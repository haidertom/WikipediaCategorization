'''''A Philosopher by lamplight''''' (also known as '''''A Hermit Studying Anatomy''''') is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]]. It is not known when Wright painted the picture, but it was first exhibited in 1769 in London with the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]]. This was one of the earliest of many lamplight or candlelight paintings and portraits for which Wright is famed.

== Description ==

This picture was described in the catalogue of the 1801 sale as a companion to ''[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus]]''. Each has a main figure in the foreground with two subsidiary ones behind, both are night scenes and show old men engaged in scientific research.&lt;ref name="Nicolson 1968"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: Painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|author2=Mellon, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows an old man who is thought to be a philosopher or a pilgrim,examining a collection of human bones in a lamp-lit cave. Two smaller men, or boys, dressed as pilgrims (as identified by the [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shells]] in their hats: the emblem of St James) seem to be approaching him. The size of these figures is a lot smaller than the main character in the painting. Outside the cave the dark landscape is lit by the moonlight breaking through the clouds. Shells were the sign of pilgrims but they were also the emblem of the Darwin family which included [[Erasmus Darwin]] who was a leading member of the [[Lunar Society]] and [[Derby Philosophical Society]] which linked key men in the age of enlightenment.
[[File:Demokrit, hensunken i betragtninger.jpg|thumb|left|100px|''Democritus in Meditation'' by [[Salvator Rosa]].]]
Experts believe that this painting was based on [[Salvator Rosa]]'s ''Democritus in Meditation''. Wright’s friend [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] was a follower of Rosa’s so it is possible that Wright would have seen Rosa's work or an engraving of it.&lt;ref name="Derby Museums page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art treasure - A Hermit |url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureAHermit.htm |accessdate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425222633/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureAHermit.htm |archivedate=25 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Democritus was a Greek philosopher who is remembered for making fun of the foolishness of mankind.

Though the painting's subtitle is ''A Hermit Studying Anatomy'', his attitude towards the bones he is holding does not suggest particularly serious scrutiny. He is surrounded by symbols of the ephemeral nature of the human condition which include the skeleton, a lamp that will burn all its fuel, the moon which has to be reborn every four weeks and an hour glass. The moon was also the symbol of the [[Lunar Society]] which Wright was strongly associated with although he never became a member.

The preoccupation of the philosopher and trepidation of the two pilgrims may be a reflection on concerns about the new scientific understanding and [[The Enlightenment|enlightenment at the time]] Wright lived.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Beauty is a perceived characteristic of an animal, [[idea]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], person or [[Location (geography)|place]] that provides a perceptual experience of pleasure or satisfaction. Many people define beauty as something that is subjective, being that it is in the "eye of the beholder" to see what he or she thinks is actually beautiful. This "eye" is seen in many different cultures with each having a different preference. This subjective can be seen throughout history, especially in the African-American community. With the presence of oppression in the past, African-American cultural beauty has bend mended and redefined in many ways.

== Slavery and Its Contribution ==
Even before the United States had been formed, the idea of beauty was one which was seen throughout different societies. In ancient Egypt, women were classified based on their skin tone; the woman with lighter skin tones were seen as higher class because unlike the woman in the working class they did not spend their days working under the sun, and the judgement based on skin tone is one that was seen through slavery as well.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, Mark. Branded Beauty : How Marketing Changed the Way We Look, Kogan Page, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/washington/detail.action?docID=781928&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, the definition of beauty was mainly set by Whites, since they were slaves owners, and were in numerous ways, considered to be the superior race. Beginning from as early as 1619, African-American women's beauty has been compared to Caucasian beauty standards, mainly in two areas: hair and skin color. Even though African-American slaves were not seen as beautiful by some slave masters, that did not stop them from having intimacies with many of them, which resulted in lighter skinned offspring During slavery, those who were of lighter complexion and had more European features, did not work in the hot scorching sun with the darker complexioned slaves. The lighter toned slaves tended to be [[house slave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patton|first=Tracey|date=Fall 2017|title=Hey Girl, Am I More Than My Hair?: African American Women and Their Struggles with Beauty, Body Image, and Hair.|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=e8c7f05d-2ed8-41b3-94c6-9913d430baf5%40sessionmgr104|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=II|pages=26|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/newsandviews/2007/10/for_lightskinned_only.html|title=For Light-Skinned Only?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of African-Americans being assimilated to obtain more "acceptable" or "beautiful" features slowly becomes juxtaposed with the abolishment of slavery by way of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], written by [[Abraham Lincoln]]. 

== Attempt of Assimilation ==
[[File:Malcolm X NYWTS 2a cropped.jpg|thumb|Malcolm X, civil rights activist]]
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
African-American hair has, and still is sometimes seen as unprofessional and inappropriate to most white standards. Many people argue that imitation European standards of beauty was a necessity to the prosperity of blacks and how they would be accepted by white culture (mainly in the workplace).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/black-hair-care-and-culture-story|title=Black hair care and culture, a story {{!}} African American Registry|website=www.aaregistry.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main efforts of assimilation was to straighten African-American hair. This can be seen in history through figures such as [[Malcolm X]], who was a Civil Rights Activist in the 1950s. Malcolm X [[Perm (hairstyle)|relaxed]] his hair using, what was then called a “[[conk]]”, which consisted of [[lye]]. One experience he had consisted of the lye burning he scalp at the same time his water went out. He resulted in putting his head inside of a toilet to get the product out of his hair. This was his realization that his attempt to become more presentable was also his biggest mistake.

== Development of Black culture ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Throughout history, African-American culture has evolved in such a way that their beauty standards too became their own. Each time frame has its own standard of what beauty is, but many of them stick closely to natural beauty, without much processing taking place. The hair, clothes, styles, expectations (of a man or woman), and everything in between changes as time changes. During the 1960s, the [[Afro]] was cultivated. During the 1980s and early 1990s  West African hairstyles began to regain their fame, including: [[braid]]s, [[Hair twists|twists]], [[cornrows]], and much more. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the [[Jheri curl]] was introduced, but most African-Americans chose [[dreadlocks]], fades, or other styles that used their own natural hair texture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During these time periods, the development of African-American music was mainstream with hip hop, which included foul language, violence, and truth in lyrics. Many [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] groups and Rap groups/rappers glorified the beauty of the natural woman, with her accentuating curves and even her flaws.

== Cultural appropriation ==
[[File:Mybraids.jpg|thumb|Cornrow Hairstyle]]
White culture subdues African-Americans in many aspects. The past and present culture that America lives in criticizes blacks for the styles or trends that they create and later copy them and become coined as “trendy” or “fashionable”. Many celebrities have showed examples of this appropriation in most recent years. [[Miley Cyrus]], for example, at one point in 2015, wore her hair in faux dreadlocks at an award’s show and was seen as being edgy. [[Zendaya]], a celebrity of African-American descent, also wore her hair in dreadlocks at an awards show later on that year, but was publicly criticized for looking like “she smells like … weed” by Entertainment News host Giuliana Rancic in one of her TV appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2017/02/how-black-culture-is-exploited-in-memes-copy-headline-plz|title=The Double Standards of Cultural Appropriation {{!}} The Bottom Line|date=2017-02-22|work=The Bottom Line|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also celebrities like the Kardashian and Jenner family have made names for themselves by basically using black attributes and culture to their advantage.

== Effects on society ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Within the United States, the beauty of African-American woman continued to be ostracized in society by not allowing African-American woman to participate in [Miss America] beauty contests until 30 years after their beginning. &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Geoffrey. “Blonde and Blue-Eyed? Globalizing Beauty, C.1945-C.1980.” The Economic History Review, vol. 61, no. 1, 2008, pp. 125–154. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40057559.&lt;/ref&gt;The beauty contests within the United States were the beginnings of ideal beauty portrayed in the media.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:MagrittePipe.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Treachery Of Images]]'' (1928-29) by [[René Magritte]] depicts a pipe along with text stating "This is not a pipe."]] --&gt;

'''Anti-genre''' is a [[self-descriptive word|self-descriptive]] label attributed to any artistic style devoid of [[genre]].  This lack of genre-status can either be the result of:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) an active attempt to evade categorization (transcend all genres), &lt;br /&gt;
(2) conscious negation of the [[ethos]] of its medium (unlearning of history),&lt;br /&gt;
(3) an active and conscious negation of itself.

The anti-genre is not simply an assault on tradition (previous artistic styles), for every anti-thesis in history would then fall under this title. (see [[Anti-genre#Hard versus Soft|Hard versus Soft]] section)  The anti-genre, rather implies a more direct and [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] attack on the foundations of its medium.  The anti-genre is in a perpetual state of evasion both from external [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], but also from itself.

The artistic movement known as [[Dada]] is likely the best example of the anti-genre, although the Dada manifestos of [[Hugo Ball]] and [[Tristan Tzara]] never use the term 'anti-genre' to describe Dada,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
DADA DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING.  Every man must shout: there is great destructive, negative work to be done. To sweep, to clean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.391.org/manifestos/19180323tristantzara_dadamanifesto.htm Tzara, Tristan (1918) ''dada Manifesto.'', Paris, France]&lt;/ref&gt;
 Dada means nothing...   Thought is produced in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396, 397; Richter, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[etymology]] of the term anti-genre borrows its [[semantic]] form from the terms [[wikt:anti-|anti-]] meaning ''against'' and ''genre'', (French "kind," related to the English "gender")

The best example of the anti-genre in music is [[John Cage]]'s 1952 composition [[4′33″]], in which the entire performance consists of four and a half minutes of utter silence.  The musicians are instructed not to play their instruments.  All the audience can hear is the sound of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Cage, John (1961) ''Silence: Lectures and Writings'', Wesleyan University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In this famous and controversial piece, John Cage presents silence as the [[antithesis]] of music.  Thus, the absence of all audible content becomes music's anti-genre.  There are, however other examples.

If [[music]] is the artistic arrangement of sound, then the non-artistic arrangement of sound might be a suitable candidate for musical-negation.  Non-music becomes noise, rather than artful melody and rhythm.  Examples of [[noise music]] range from guitar-based feedback recordings and live performances ([[The Melvins]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Jimi Hendrix]]) to the screeching sounds of [[Screamo]], [[Grindcore]], [[industrial music]] or contemporary dance electronic styles like [[Gabber]], Terrorcore, [[Breakcore]], [[Glitch (music)|Glitch]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia - [[List of hardcore genres]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the entire ethos of the [[Punk subculture]] was based on nihilism, which by its very nature seeks category annihilation.

==Examples in Literature==
[[File:Nietzsche.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]].]]
The anti-genre, in literature, comes into being in particular during the mid to late 19th century.  Both [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s 1864 novel [[Notes from Underground]], with his introduction of the anti-hero (referred to as the Underground Man) as well as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]] published in 1895, represent early works in the tradition.

For Dostoyevsky's underground man, all the virtues of the traditional protagonist (the hero) are turned upside down.  Rather than courageous he is weak and complains of both physical pain as well as deeper (more existential) angst.  Rather than altruism and chivalry he feels vengeance and spite towards others.  Dostoyevsky's underground man introduces to western literature the [[archetype]] of the [[anti-hero]].  His early work also attacks the [[positivists]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, thereby strengthening the case against [[utopian]] optimism.  The introduction of the anti-hero combined with his [[dystopian]] proposal, represent more of a soft anti-genre status rather than the more technical definition of the term.

For Nietzsche, the task of overcoming history required a grand declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Michael.  Introduction to, ''Twilight of the Idols/The Anti-Christ''.  London: Penguin Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  His enemies were many:    In the last sane year of his life he was able to complete two final texts, [[Twilight of the Idols]] and [[The Anti-Christ]].

More technical examples of the anti-genre in literature might include [[meta-fiction]] or [[aleatoricism]], but there is lack of contemporary scholarship on the topic to resolve this matter definitively.

==Paradox of the Anti-Genre==
Is the anti-genre itself a genre?

This poses a problem.  For, if it is a genre, then it does not exist but if it is not a genre then no discussion of it as a coherent entity can take place.  The anti-genre therefore suffers from an identity crisis.  Of course, nothing would make the anti-genre more happy than to deny its own existence.

By referencing a negation of itself in its own definition, ''anti-genre'' achieves a contradictory truth status (both true and false at the same time).  This happens any time that the definition of the word in question (or interpretation of the sentence in question) is a denial of its own meaning.  For example,

           The statement in this box is false.

When it is true (that it is false) it becomes a negation of itself.  It cannot be both true and false at the same time.  The anti-genre suffers from this same type of self-annihilation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

But, although this might pose a problem for a symbolic logician or software engineer, it poses no problem for the anti-artist.  The goal of the artist working in their respective anti-genre is to evade genre-classification.  Thus, the inability of their category to hold down a definition becomes an asset rather than a liability.

==Examples in Computer Science==
The most technical description of the paradox of the anti-genre can be found in computer science.  In computer programming an [[infinite loop]] is often an un-intended result ([[software bug|bug]]) of circular self-reference in the program code.

For example, the Dada artist's eternal maxim declares,&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dada had only one rule: Never follow any rules.&lt;ref&gt;http://arthistory.about.com/cs/arthistory10one/a/dada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we (hypothetically) run this maxim through a [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] computer algorithm, it would cause program error.  For, if Dada does not obey this rule then Dada would be free to follow any rules (a direct refutation of this maxim), but if it obeys this maxim then there is at least one rule which it is following (a contradiction).  In the language of computer programming this is fatal (it prevents an exit condition from being met) but for the artist this might be the ultimate goal of his/her art.

==Hard versus Soft==
The technical definition of anti-genre (hard version) is not merely art that insults its predecessors.  The hard version is more active in its flight from meaning.  It is self-consciously involved in the process of not just breaking with tradition but undoing the entire framework that distinguishes the different genre categories in that medium.   Silence in place of music and the blank canvas in place of paint, are two obvious examples of this.

The soft version however, is a little harder to nail down.  The definition of a soft anti-genre might include art intentionally dispensing with conventions of its medium or violently breaking with tradition by [[subversion]], vandalism-art, irrationality, self-defeat or other strategies in a rebellious spirit.

The problem with this lighter version of anti-genre is that all artistic movements by definition represent a decisive break with the traditions that came before them.  If not, then they would merely be continuous with their predecessors.  This is known as the process of [[dialectic]]. First, a thesis is proposed.  Then the thesis is rejected by the [[anti-thesis]].  This rejection is eventually accepted by the community and a synthesis of thesis and anti-thesis come together to create the new proposal ready for rejection.  And so the cycle continues.

It is important to emphasize the hard and soft distinction however because there is a tendency in postmodernity to associate negative/rebellious attitudes in artistic movements with formal categories like anti-genre, despite the fact that the anti-genre, in its hard version, has a much more technical definition.

==The End of History==
What is the logical conclusion of an artistic movement that is essentially suicidal? (see [[Anti-genre#Paradox of the Anti-Genre|Paradox of the Anti-genre]] section)

After annihilating everything in their path, every artistic style and movement that had come before them, every political attitude and social value, the DaDa artist eventually had nothing left to consume and so retired to a life of seclusion and chess.

Likewise, and for all of his proselytizing (calling for a complete transvaluation of all human values), Nietzsche ended his life deep inside a state of mental illness.
And so it is not uncommon to hear writers lament that the only cure for history is a good psychiatrist and a lot of prescription medicine.

'''''Aurora Borealis''''' is an 1865 painting by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] of the [[aurora borealis]] and the Arctic expedition of [[Isaac Israel Hayes]]. The painting measures {{conv|142.3x212.2|cm}} and is now owned by the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=Smithson1&gt;{{cite web|title=Aurora Borealis|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4806|publisher=[[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Eos|title=Aurora Painting Pays Tribute to Civil War's End|last=Love|first=Jeffrey J.|publisher=American Geophysical Union|volume=96|doi=10.1029/2015EO035713| date=September 2015 |url=https://eos.org/features/aurora-painting-pays-tribute-to-civil-wars-end}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
''Aurora Borealis'' is based on two separate sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Truettner, W. H. (1970). "The Genesis of Frederic Edwin Church's Aurora Boreolis". ''Art Quarterly'', XXXI, Fall 1968, pp. 266–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first incident was an aurora witnessed by Church's pupil, the [[Arctic]] explorer [[Isaac Israel Hayes|Isaac I. Hayes]]. Hayes provided a sketch and description of the aurora borealis display he witnessed one January evening. Coinciding with Hayes' furthest northern movement into what he named Cape Leiber, the aurora borealis appeared over the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Howat |first=John K. |title=Frederic Church|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10988-1 |pages=120–121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQh2gpT0KFIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the event, Hayes wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The light grew by degrees more and more intense, and from irregular bursts it settled into an almost steady sheet of brightness... The exhibition, at first tame and quiet, became in the end startling in its brilliancy. The broad dome above me is all ablaze... The colour of the light was chiefly red, but this was not constant, and every hue mingled in the fierce display. Blue and yellow streamers were playing in the lurid fire; and, sometimes starting side by side from the wide expanse of the illuminated arch, they melt into each other, and throw a ghostly glare of green into the face and over the landscape. Again this green overrides the red; blue and orange clasp each other in their rapid flight; violet darts tear through a broad flush of yellow, and countless tongues of white flame, formed of these uniting streams, rush aloft and lick the skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes|first=Issac Israel |title=The Open Polar Sea: A Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery Towards the North Pole, in the Schooner "United States" |year=1867|publisher=Sampson Low, Son and Marston|location=London|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltY35Ap35moC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Description and influences ==

The iconography of the painting suggested personal and nationalistic references. The peak in the painting had been named after Church during Hayes's expedition. ''Aurora Borealis'' incorporated details of Hayes' ship, drawn from a sketch he brought back upon returning from his expedition. Contrasted with Church's earlier painting of the north, ''[[The Icebergs]]'' (1861), the intact ship highlights Hayes' achievement in navigating this space, as well as the state of the nation in navigating the contentious historical moment. Presenting the ship's safe passage through the dark Arctic environment, Church suggested optimism for the future; a tiny light shines out from the ship's window.&lt;ref name="Kinsey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsey|first=Joni L.|title=History in Natural Sequence: The Civil War Polyptych of Frederic Edwin Church|year=1995|work=Redefining American History Painting, Patricia M. Burnham and Lucretia Hoover Giese (eds.)|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-521-46059-X|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Millard describes Church's paintings as "large in scale and size, sharply horizontal in format" and "dramatic in subject, but yielding in execution, and tend[ing] to exploit both value contrast and continuous tonal transition." Church's works, including ''Aurora Borealis,'' were completed using small touches of pigment built together through thin applications, leaving the viewer unaware of fracture between strokes. These works are also built around the tones of "ochre, brown, gray going to blue or green, and green" at the expense of the full value of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millard|first=Charles|title=American Style and Quality |journal=[[The Hudson Review]] |date=Spring 1978 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=163–169 |jstor=3850161 |doi=10.2307/3850161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibition ==
Completed in New York that winter,&lt;ref name="Avery"/&gt; ''Aurora Borealis'' was exhibited publicly in London in 1865 as a triumvirate with two paintings by Church of Ecuadoran volcanoes: ''Cotopaxi'' (his 1862 painting of an eruption)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/americas-moral-volcano/?_r=0|title=America's Moral Volcano|first=Eleanor Jones|last=Harvey|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Chimborazo'' (his 1864 reprise of the dormant mountain that had been the subject of his 1858 masterwork ''Heart of the Andes'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsey|first=Joni L.|title=History in Natural Sequence: The Civil War Polyptych of Frederic Edwin Church|work=Redefining American History Painting, Patricia M.

== Reception and legacy ==
[[File:Frederic Edwin Church - Rainy Season in the Tropics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Rainy Season in the Tropics'', 1866.]]

Created at the end of the [[American Civil War]], ''Aurora Borealis'' (1865) was believed to depict the portent of a simultaneously triumphant and desolate [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory, its meaning amplified in relation to later works, including ''The After Glow'' (1867) and other works.&lt;ref name="Avery"&gt;{{cite book |last=Avery |first=Kevin J. |title=Treasures from Olana: Landscapes|year=2005|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-4430-6|pages=48–49, 71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fTXgbL63XQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=aurora&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aurora Borealis'' (1865) was associated with ''Rainy Season in the Tropics'' (1866) for two reasons. First, the two paintings marked the completion of the arctic-tropical sequence created with ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859) and ''The North'', also known as ''[[The Icebergs]]'' (1861). These pairings drew together popular attention on exploration of the arctic North and the tropical South. The second association between ''Aurora Borealis'' and ''Rainy Season in the Tropics'' was established through their compositions and "in their luminosity", where each suggested a "renewed optimism in natural and historic events".&lt;ref name="Kinsey"/&gt;

[[File:Cassandra1.jpeg|thumb|Painting of Cassandra by [[Evelyn De Morgan]]]]

The '''Cassandra metaphor''' (variously labelled the '''Cassandra''' "'''syndrome'''", "'''complex'''", "'''phenomenon'''", "'''predicament'''", "'''dilemma'''", or "'''curse'''") occurs when valid warnings or concerns are dismissed or disbelieved.

The term originates in [[Greek mythology]]. [[Cassandra]] was a daughter of [[Priam]], the King of [[Troy]].  Struck by her beauty, [[Apollo]] provided her with the gift of [[prophecy]], but when Cassandra refused Apollo's romantic advances, he placed a curse ensuring that nobody would believe her warnings.  Cassandra was left with the knowledge of future events, but could neither alter these events nor convince others of the validity of her predictions.

The metaphor has been applied in a variety of contexts such as psychology, environmentalism, politics, science, cinema, the corporate world, and in philosophy, and has been in circulation since at least 1949 when French philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]] coined the term 'Cassandra Complex' to refer to a belief that things could be known in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Gaston, Le Rationalisme appliqué PUF, Paris, (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

The Cassandra metaphor is applied by some psychologists to individuals who experience physical and emotional suffering as a result of distressing personal perceptions, and who are disbelieved when they attempt to share the cause of their suffering with others.

===Melanie Klein===

In 1963, [[psychologist]] [[Melanie Klein]] provided an interpretation of [[Cassandra]] as representing the human moral conscience whose main task is to issue warnings. Cassandra as moral conscience, "predicts ill to come and warns that punishment will follow and grief arise".&lt;ref name="Klein, M. 1975"&gt;Klein, M., Envy and Gratitude- And Other Works 1946–1963, p. 293 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Cassandra's need to point out moral infringements and subsequent social consequences is driven by what Klein calls "the destructive influences of the cruel super-ego", which is represented in the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] by the god [[Apollo]], Cassandra's overlord and persecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, M., Envy and Gratitude – And Other Works 1946–1963, p. 295 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's use of the metaphor centers on the moral nature of certain predictions, which tends to evoke in others "a refusal to believe what at the same time they know to be true, and expresses the universal tendency toward denial, [with] denial being a potent defence against persecutory anxiety and guilt".&lt;ref name="Klein, M. 1975"/&gt;

===Laurie Layton Schapira===

In a 1988 study, [[Jungian]] analyst Laurie Layton Schapira, explored what she called the "[[Cassandra Complex]]" in the lives of two of her analysands.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL2243156M/The_Cassandra_complex|title=The Cassandra complex: living with disbelief: a modern perspective on hysteria|last=Schapira|first=Laurie Layton|date=1988|publisher=Inner City Books|year=|isbn=091912335X|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Based on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra complex: 
# dysfunctional relationships with the "[[Apollo archetype]]",
# emotional or physical suffering, including [[hysteria]] ([[conversion disorder]]) or "women’s problems",
# and being disbelieved when attempting to relate the facticity of these experiences to others.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"/&gt;

Layton Schapira views the Cassandra [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] as resulting from a dysfunctional [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with what she calls the "[[Apollo archetype]]", an archetype which refers to any individual's or culture's pattern that is dedicated to, yet bound by, order, reason, intellect, truth and clarity that disavows itself of anything occult or irrational.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Layton Schapira, The Cassandra Complex: Living With Disbelief: A Modern Perspective on Hysteria p.10 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual specialization of this archetype creates emotional distance and can predispose relationships to a lack of emotional reciprocity and consequent dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"/&gt; She further states that a "Cassandra woman" is very prone to hysteria because she "feels attacked not only from the outside world but also from within, especially from the body in the form of somatic, often gynaecological, complaints."&lt;ref name="Layton_p65"&gt;Laurie Layton Schapira, ''The Cassandra Complex: Living With Disbelief: A Modern Perspective on Hysteria'' p.65 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the [[metaphor]]ical application of the [[Cassandra|Greek Cassandra myth]], Layton Schapira states that:
{{blockquote|What the Cassandra woman sees is something dark and painful that may not be apparent on the surface of things or that objective facts do not corroborate. She may envision a negative or unexpected outcome; or something which would be difficult to deal with; or a truth which others, especially authority figures, would not accept. In her frightened, ego-less state, the Cassandra woman may blurt out what she sees, perhaps with the unconscious hope that others might be able to make some sense of it. But to them her words sound meaningless, disconnected and blown out of all proportion.&lt;ref name="Layton_p65"/&gt;}}

===Jean Shinoda Bolen===

In 1989, [[Jean Shinoda Bolen]], Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the [[University of California]], published an essay on the god Apollo&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; in which she detailed a psychological profile of the "Cassandra woman" whom she suggested referred to someone suffering—as happened in the mythological relationship between Cassandra and Apollo—a dysfunctional relationship with an "Apollo man". Bolen added that the Cassandra woman may exhibit "hysterical" overtones, and may be disbelieved when attempting to share what she knows.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves pp. 130–160 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bolen, the archetypes of Cassandra and Apollo are not gender-specific. She states that "women often find that a particular [male] god exists in them as well, just as I found that when I spoke about goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us all&amp;nbsp;... There are gods and goddesses in every person."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' pp. x–xi (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

"As an archetype, Apollo personifies the aspect of the personality that wants clear definitions, is drawn to master a skill, values order and harmony, and prefers to look at the surface rather than at what underlies appearances. The Apollo archetype favors thinking over feeling, distance over closeness, objective assessment over subjective intuition."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' p.135 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Of what she describes as the negative Apollonic influence, Dr. Bolen writes:
{{blockquote|Individuals who resemble Apollo have difficulties that are related to emotional distance, such as communication problems, and the inability to be intimate&amp;nbsp;... Rapport with another person is hard for the Apollo man. He prefers to access (or judge) the situation or the person from a distance, not knowing that he must "get close up"—be vulnerable and empathic—in order to truly know someone else&amp;nbsp;... But if the woman wants a deeper, more personal relationship, then there are difficulties&amp;nbsp;... she may become increasingly irrational or hysterical.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"/&gt;}}
Bolen suggests that a Cassandra woman (or man) may become increasingly hysterical and irrational when in a dysfunctional relationship with a negative Apollo, and may experience others' disbelief when describing her experiences.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"/&gt;

==Corporate world==

Foreseeing potential future directions for a corporation or company is sometimes called "visioning".&lt;ref name="Davies1998"&gt;Davies, P., "The Cassandra Complex: how to avoid generating a corporate vision that no one buys into" pp. 103–123 in ''Success in Sight: Visioning'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet achieving a clear, shared vision in an organization is often difficult due to a lack of commitment to the new vision by some individuals in the organization, because it does not match reality as they see it. Those who support the new vision are termed "Cassandras"—able to see what is going to happen, but not believed.&lt;ref name="Davies1998"/&gt; Sometimes the name Cassandra is applied to those who can predict rises, falls, and particularly crashes on the global [[stock market]], as happened with [[Warren Buffett]], who repeatedly warned that the 1990s stock market surge was a bubble, attracting to him the title of "Wall Street Cassandra".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bear Book: Survive and Profit in Ferocious Markets'', p. 81 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Grove]], in his book ''Only The Paranoid Survive'', reminds the reader of the Helpful Cassandras that sense the winds of change before others and are critical to managing through Strategic Inflection Points.&lt;ref&gt; ''Only The Paranoid Survive'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this is a primary source—we need another to establish notability --&gt;{{better source needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental movement==

Many environmentalists have predicted looming environmental catastrophes including [[climate change]], rise in sea levels, irreversible [[pollution]], and an impending collapse of [[ecosystem]]s, including those of [[rain forest|rainforests]] and [[ocean]] [[reef]]s.&lt;ref name="AtKisson, A. 1999"&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, [[Earthscan]] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though much of this has since come to pass, individuals sometimes acquire the label of 'Cassandras', whose warnings of impending environmental disaster are disbelieved or mocked.&lt;ref name="AtKisson, A. 1999"/&gt; [[Environmentalist]] [[Alan Atkisson]] wrote in 1999 that to understand that humanity is on a collision course with the laws of nature is to be stuck in what he calls the 'Cassandra dilemma' in which one can see the most likely outcome of current trends and can warn people about what is happening, but the vast majority cannot, or will not respond, and later if catastrophe occurs, they may even blame you, as if your prediction set the disaster in motion.&lt;ref&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, p.22 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally there may be a "successful" alert, though the succession of books, campaigns, organizations, and personalities that we think of as the environmental movement has more generally fallen toward the opposite side of this dilemma: a failure to "get through" to the people and avert disaster. In the words of Atkisson: "too often we watch helplessly, as Cassandra did, while the soldiers emerge from the Trojan horse just as foreseen and wreak their predicted havoc. Worse, Cassandra's dilemma has seemed to grow more inescapable even as the chorus of Cassandras has grown larger."&lt;ref&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, p.22 pp. 32–33 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==

There are examples of the Cassandra metaphor being applied in the contexts of [[medical science]],&lt;ref&gt;Web, S., Contemporary IMRT: Developing Physics and Clinical Implementation, p.357 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lantos, J.D., The Lazarus Case: Life-and-Death Issues in Neonatal Intensive Care, p.160 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; the media,&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L., Digital Media: Transformations in Human Communication, p.157 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; to feminist perspectives on reality,&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, L., 'The Cassandra Complex', pp. 37–41 in Haring-Smith, T., New Monologues For Women By Women – Vol II (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delamotte, D., Women Imagine Change: A Global Anthology of Women's Resistance From 600 B.C.E. p.86 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, S., Angus, I., Orwell, G., My Country Right or Left p.378 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of the metaphor being used in popular music lyrics, such as the 1982 ABBA song "Cassandra",&lt;ref&gt;Atkisson, A., Cassandra's Lyre (song) on album Believing Cassandra 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[ABBA]]: 'Cassandra' recorded October 18, 1982 as the B-side of the single The Day Before You Came&lt;/ref&gt;  Emmy the Great's "Cassandra", and [[Star One (band)|Star One]]'s "Cassandra Complex". The five-part [[The Mars Volta]] song "Cassandra Gemini" may reference this syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;Fear Before the March of Flames, Taking Cassandra to the End of the World Party (song) on album The Always Open Mouth 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' or in [[Dead and Divine]]'s "Cassandra Syndrome". The Ohio band Curse of Cassandra is named after the metaphor.

There are also distinct parallels to Old Testament prophets such as Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Amos - prophets who called attention to the failure of those who thought of themselves as God's people to forsake meaningless sacrifices and devote themselves to caring for "orphans and widows in their distress." The prophets called their societies to thereby honor God and avoid social / political disasters. Their "prophecies" were not well-received; Jeremiah, for example, being thrown into a deep well as well as put in wooden stocks.

[[File:IMA Conservation Technician 4.jpg|thumb|250px|A conservation technician examining an artwork under a microscope at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]]]
The '''conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of items of historical and personal value made primarily from [[paper]], [[parchment]], and [[leather]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] conservation activities are generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Paper-based items, such as [[books]], scrapbooks, [[manuscripts]], maps, deeds, [[newspapers]], drawings, water colors, miniatures, and postcards present distinctive concerns when it comes to care and conservation. Unlike works of art on paper, these items are often handled directly and repeatedly to access information.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Even paper [[ephemera]] like newspapers and letters may be significant historical records or family mementos.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, "Preservation Measures for Newspapers", Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/newspap.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first substantial work on the subject of book restoration was [[Alfred Bonnardot]]'s ''Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres'', first published in Paris in 1846.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norman |first1=Jeremy |title=Alfred Bonnardot Issues the First Book on the Restoration of Rare Books and their Bindings (1846) |website=HistoryofInformation.com |url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=3433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrov"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petrov |first1=Ferdinand |title=The art of painting and the art of restoration |date=2015 |publisher=Ferdinand Petrov |location=Vancouver, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Inherent vice ===
[[Inherent vice (library and archival science)|Inherent vice]] is "the quality of a material or an object to self-destruct or to be unusually difficult to maintain".&lt;ref&gt;National Postal Museum, "Inherent Vice," ''Smithsonian'', Accessed on 13 April 2014, [http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/stamp/5d_preserving3.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Paper, books, manuscripts, and ephemera are prime examples of materials subject to inherent vice. Early paper was handmade from plant fibers such as flax, hemp, and cotton: it is generally durable and can last for centuries.&lt;ref name="CCI418"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/418-eng.aspx |title=How to Care for Paper Documents and Newspaper Clippings |publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|date=4 January 2002 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224951/http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/418-eng.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the mid-19th century, machine-made paper was introduced, and wood became the most common, least expensive ingredient, especially in newspapers. The presence of [[lignin]] in wood pulp paper causes acid to degrade the [[cellulose]], which causes the paper to become unstable and discolored over time.&lt;ref&gt;Dava Tobey, "Preserving History," ''Minnesota Historical Society'', Accessed on 13 April 2014, [http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/nytimes_preserving.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, paper has the natural ability to absorb and retain moisture from the atmosphere, making it prone to the growth of mold, fungi, and bacteria.&lt;ref name=S30&gt;Shelley (1992), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books are inherently complex; they are often made of mixed materials ranging from parchment, leather, fabric, adhesives and thread. Some inks used in old books and manuscripts are harmful to paper. [[Iron gall ink]], most commonly used from the 8th century through the end of the 19th century, contains acid and can corrode the paper in humid conditions.&lt;ref name="CCI419"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/419-eng.aspx |title=How to Care for Books |publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|date=4 January 2002|accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224951/http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/419-eng.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials used to make books contain hundreds of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) that break down over time. They are released into the air, where they become detectable as "old-book smell". A book's smell can provide conservators with hints as to its condition. Decomposing [[cellulose]] emits [[furfural]], which has an almond-like scent. [[Lignin]] releases [[benzaldehyde]] and [[vanillin]] with a vanilla smell. [[Hexanal]] from cellulose and lignin gives off an earthy smell.  Researchers have attempted to profile the smell of old books and relate human perceptions of smell to their chemical sources. “Chocolate” and “coffee”  are the most frequently used descriptors from the Historic Paper Odour Wheel.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wiener|first1=Ann Elizabeth  |title=What’s That Smell You’re Reading? |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/whats-that-smell-youre-reading |journal=Distillations |publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|date=2018|volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36-39|accessdate=July 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derieux"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lattuati-Derieux |first1=Agnès |last2=Bonnassies-Termes |first2=Sylvette |last3=Lavédrine |first3=Bertrand |title=Identification of volatile organic compounds emitted by a naturally aged book using solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry |journal=Journal of Chromatography A |date=February 2004 |volume=1026 |issue=1-2 |pages=9–18 |doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2003.11.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ephemera]], as the name implies, was never made to survive. Flyers, postcards, and programs are often printed on poor quality paper, carelessly handled, and likely to be haphazardly displayed or stored.&lt;ref name=L33&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pests ===
Insects and vermin are naturally attracted to paper because paper is made of cellulose, starch and protein, materials that provide sources of nourishment.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt; The most common pests are roaches, silverfish, and various types of beetles.&lt;ref name=MCB&gt;Mary C. Baughman, “Approaches to Insect Problems in Paper and Books,” ''Harry Ransom Center'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/conservation/resources/insects/].&lt;/ref&gt; Book lice feed on mold spores found on paper and cardboard, and although they do not cause visible damage, their decomposition and excretions can stain paper and may also nourish other pests, continuing the cycle of damage.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; To best discourage infestation, a clean and dust-free environment is desirable: food and drink should be kept away from storage areas. If pests are discovered, they should first be identified so that appropriate measures can be taken.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt; Freezing the collection items is an option for pest mitigation: ideally (for dealing with most insects) the center of the item should be frozen within four hours at a temperature of -20&amp;nbsp;°C (about -4 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 72 hours, following which the materials may be thawed over a 24-hour period.&lt;ref name=MCB /&gt; However, some materials should not be frozen, such as books made with leather, because the cold temperatures may cause the fat to rise to the surface of the leather resulting in a white or yellow area called a bloom.&lt;ref name=MCB /&gt; The use of insecticides directly on collection materials is not generally recommended. However, if the infestation is severe, and [[fumigation]] is the best option, the affected items should be separated from the rest of the collection for treatment.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt;

=== Environmental conditions ===
Extremes of temperature or relative [[humidity]] are damaging from either end of the spectrum (low or high).&lt;ref name=S29&gt;Shelley (1992), p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; High heat and low relative humidity can cause paper to become brittle and leather book bindings to crack.&lt;ref name=S29 /&gt; High temperatures and high relative humidity accelerates mold growth, [[foxing]], staining, blooming, disintegration, and "[[red rot]]" in leather bindings. Fluctuations in temperatures and humidity may also cause cockling: a wrinkling or puckering preventing the surface from laying flat.&lt;ref&gt;Cameo, "Cockling", ''Museum of Fine Arts Boston'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Cockling].&lt;/ref&gt; Precise environmental levels for optimal preservation will depend on whether the collection is for use, storage, or a combination: in general, a cool environment (below 70 degrees Fahrenheit) and relatively dry air (between 30-50% relative humidity) is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Sherelyn Ogden, "Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation", ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Air quality must also be taken into consideration. Dust tends to absorb moisture, providing a suitable environment to attract mold growth and insects.&lt;ref name=SLV&gt;State Library of Victoria, "Caring for Works on Paper", ''State Library of Victoria'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/explore/conservation-guides/caring-works-paper].&lt;/ref&gt; Dust can also become acidic when combined with skin oils and the surface of paper.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt;

All kinds of light (sunlight, artificial light, spotlights) can be harmful.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt; Light can result in fading, darkening, bleaching, and cellulose breakdown. Some inks and other pigments will fade if exposed to light, especially ultraviolet (UV) light present in normal daylight and from fluorescent bulbs.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; Any exposure to light can cause damage, as the effects are cumulative and cannot be reversed.&lt;ref name=S29 /&gt; Minimal or no exposure to light is ideal.

===Handling===
[[File:RDZ des Historischen Archivs der Stadt Köln - Gefriertrocknungsanlage und Archivgut-2278.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A paper conservator handling a book.]]
Other than a poor environment, poor handling is the primary cause of deterioration for books, manuscripts, and ephemera.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt; Recommendations for good handling to minimize damage include:
* A clean work area and clean hands. Food and drink should be kept away from collection materials, and smoking avoided. Hands should be washed and dried immediately before handling collection items. Hand lotions, creams and wipes should never be used prior to handling items.&lt;ref name=HRC&gt;Harry Ransom Center, “Ransom Center Guidelines: Safe Handling of Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts,” ''The University of Texas at Austin'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/pubmnem/MEM_RR_Handling_8_10%20rev.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gloves should be worn only when absolutely necessary, as they may reduce dexterity and feeling.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; If worn, they should be clean white cotton gloves. 
* Loose clothing, jewelry, or buttons, may all cause damage, and should be kept under control. The user should ensure he or she is seated or standing in a stable position. Precautions should be taken if he or she is suffering from a cold.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;
* The bookmarking of pages by use of paper clips, acidic inserts, or the folding of page corners should be avoided.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP&gt;Library of Congress, "Care, Handling, and Storage of Works on Paper," ''Library of Congress'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/paper.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of rubber bands, self-adhesive tape, any kind of "leather dressing", or glue should all be avoided.&lt;ref name=LOCSOB&gt;Library of Congress, "Care, Handling, and Storage of Books," ''Library of Congress'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/books.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Adhesives can leave stains and a damaging residue.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt; 
* A book should not be forced further than its natural opening. Instead, the covers may be propped on foam wedges to decrease the opening angle, and the pages held open using book snake weights.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The turning of pages by the top corner instead of the bottom may help prevent tears.&lt;ref name=L36&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The pages of a bound manuscript should be turned slowly, and the leaves flexed as little as possible, because decorations and inks may no longer be firmly attached to parchment leaves.&lt;ref name=HRC /&gt;
* Books should be removed from the shelf by gripping on both sides of the spine at the middle (having, if necessary, pushed in the neighboring book on both sides to get a good grip).&lt;ref name=LOCSOB /&gt; Both hands should be used when removing large or heavy books from a shelf. If the volume is horizontal in a stack of books, the books above it should be removed first.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;
* Pencil, not ink, should be used to make any necessary marks or inscriptions. Inscriptions should only be made when the paper is on a clean hard surface to avoid embossing the inscription into the paper.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt;
* A work in paper should not be lifted by its edges. Instead, a thin support such as a folder or foam board should be used.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;Dixie Nielson, "Object Handling," in ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods'', eds. Rebecca Buck and Jean Allman Gilmore. (Washington, DC: AAM Press, 2010), 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parchment is not as flexible as paper, and is more resistant to unfolding. It should not be forced.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Photocopying that forces books to lie flat should be avoided. This may damage the spine and weaken pages.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;
* Items should not be piled on one another, and, for oversized items, a large clear space should be prepared. Maps and blueprints that have been rolled may be gently unfolded or unrolled if they are not brittle or weak. They can also be placed under light weight for a few weeks to relax.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage methods and materials ==
[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|thumb|250px|A paper conservator surveying a collection of materials in storage.]]
Good storage can extend the life of an item and is an important aspect of preventative conservation. Storage should be cool, dry, clean, and stable.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt; Items should be kept away from radiators or vents, which can cause environmental fluctuations.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt;

Manuscripts and paper documents should be stored in protective archival-quality boxes and folders, made of acid-free and lignin-free materials.&lt;ref name=OSE&gt;Sherelyn Ogden, “Storage Enclosures for Books and Artifacts on Paper,” ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/4.-storage-and-handling/4.4-storage-enclosures-for-books-and-artifacts-on-paper].&lt;/ref&gt; Documents that might be handled often may be stored or encapsulated in a clear [[polyester]] (Mylar) film sleeve or folder. As added protection acid formation, paper-based storage materials may have a buffer, such as calcium carbonate, which can neutralize acids as they form in the storage materials.&lt;ref name=OSE /&gt; Boxes should not be overfilled. Items may be interleaved with acid/lignin-free paper.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; If boxes are only partially full, spacers may be used, or the box may be stored horizontally.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; Large format material is best stored in a plan cabinet with shallow drawers.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; The rolling of large items (e.g. maps) should be avoided where possible; but if there is no other option, the item should be rolled around a large diameter archival quality tube.&lt;ref name=L42&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The outside of the rolled item may also be covered with archival quality paper.&lt;ref name=L42 /&gt;

The best shelving for books is baked enamel steel shelving that stands away from exterior walls. Average size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side so they can support each other.&lt;ref name=L36 /&gt; If a book is removed from the shelf, it may be replaced with a foam block to maintain verticality.&lt;ref name="MRM5"/&gt; Shelves should not be overpacked. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt; Books should be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion as well as to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in book cloth.&lt;ref name=L36 /&gt;

==Active conservation and repair techniques==
*'''Surface cleaning''': Paper and leather can be dusted with a soft brush, and dust can be removed from books with a vacuum cleaner that has a cheesecloth tied over the nozzle.&lt;ref name=CYT /&gt; Nonchemical vulcanized rubber sponges or nonabrasive erasing materials such as vinyl erasers are also used. Care must be taken: an inappropriate cleaning technique could permanently ingrain dirt or remove media.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;
*'''Mold and insect removal''': Insect accretions and mold residues are normally removed by scalpels, aspirators, or specialized vacuum cleaners. Deep freezing may be appropriate to kill insects.&lt;ref name=NUA&gt;NEDCC, "Conservation Treatment for Works of Art and Unbound Artifacts on Paper," ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.5-conservation-treatment-for-works-of-art-and-unbound-artifacts-on-paper]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Adhesive removal''': Some adhesive materials are acidic and harmful to paper, causing stains. Repairs made with water-based adhesives such as animal glue can be removed in a water bath, by local application of moisture, or with poultices or steam. Synthetic adhesives and pressure-sensitive (self-adhering) tapes usually have to be dissolved or softened with an organic solvent before they can be removed. Steam is sometimes helpful to remove adhesive.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Washing and alkalization''': Washing not only removes dirt and aids in stain reduction; it can also wash out acidic compounds and other degradation products that have built up in the paper. Washing can also relax brittle or distorted paper and aid in flattening. When washing alone does not combat acidity, the addition of an alkaline buffer to paper is sometimes recommended for de-acidification. Alkalization can be achieved by immersion or by spraying.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Mending and filling''': Severe tears that cannot be stabilized with polyester film can usually be mended on the reverse with narrow strips of torn [[Japanese tissue]]. The strips are adhered with a permanent, nonstaining adhesive such as starch paste or methyl cellulose. Holes or paper losses may be filled individually with Japanese paper, with paper pulp, or with a paper carefully chosen to match the original in weight, texture, and color.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Sewing and rebinding''': Books with broken sewing, loose or detached boards or leaves require special care.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Several techniques are used in conservation binding. The original sewing in a volume should be retained if this is possible; it can be reinforced using new linen thread and sewing supports.&lt;ref name=NBM&gt;NEDCC, "Conservation Treatment for Bound Materials of Value," ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.6-conservation-treatment-for-bound-materials-of-value]&lt;/ref&gt; If the original binding is too deteriorated, the book may be rebound with new archival safe materials. An alternative to a leather-covered laced-in structure is a split-board structure, which can be covered in leather or cloth.&lt;ref name=NBM /&gt; 
*'''Backing''': Weak or brittle paper may be reinforced by backing them with another sheet of paper. Again, Japanese paper can be used as a backing, adhered with a starch paste.
*'''Flattening''': Flattening is always necessary following aqueous treatment. Flattening is also helpful for rolled or folded paper that cannot gently and safely be opened. It is usually done between blotters or felts under moderate pressure.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Emergencies and disasters''': Most natural or man-made disasters, such as floods or fire, involve water. Even a small amount of water from a leaky roof or pipe can do significant damage to a paper collection. Immediate response by a knowledgeable professional or agency within the first 48 hours is crucial to the successful salvage of materials and the prevention of mold growth. Wet paper or books may be frozen to stabilize them; they can be thawed and dried at a later time.&lt;ref name=CYT /&gt;

== Reformatting options ==
Reformatting options include photocopying, [[Digitizing|digitization]], and microfilming. Many libraries and universities have book copiers where the book can be supported at an angle, avoiding the damage to its structure that can be caused by forcing it flat.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;

In spite of the [[digital revolution]], preservation microfilming is still used. Microfilm can have a life expectancy of 500 or more years, and only needs light and magnification to read.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Dalton. [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/6.-reformatting/6.1-microfilm-and-microfiche "Microfilm and Microfiche"]. ''Northeast Document Conservation Center''. Accessed 22 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional conservators ==
In general, the cleaning and repair of paper documents and books should ideally be assigned to a professional conservator.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CYT&gt;AIC, "Caring for Your Treasures," ''American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures#.U13JgK1dX4g].&lt;/ref&gt; Many paper or book conservators are members of a professional body, such as the [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) or the [[Guild of Bookworkers]] (both in the United States), or the [[Archives and Records Association]] (in the United Kingdom and Ireland).

'''Contour drawing''', is an artistic technique used in the field of [[art]] in which the [[artist]] sketches the contour of a subject by drawing lines that result in a drawing that is essentially an outline; the [[French language|French]] word contour meaning, “outline.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=contour&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of contour drawing is to emphasize the [[mass]] and [[volume]] of the subject rather than the [[Complexity|detail]]; the focus is on the outlined shape of the subject and not the minor details. However, because contour can convey a three-dimensional [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], length and width as well as thickness and depth are important; not all contours exist along the outlines of a subject.&lt;ref name="sutherland"&gt;Sutherland, Jane. 1997. "Gesture drawings." American Artist (VNU eMedia, Inc.) 61, no. 656: 11. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost . Retrieved February 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is manifested in different styles and practiced in drawing development and learning.

==Importance==
Contour drawing is an essential technique in the field of art because it is a strong foundation for any drawing or [[painting]]; it can potentially modify a subjects’ form through variation within the lines. Its objective is to capture the life, action, or expression of the subject.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt; It is widely accepted among schools, art institutions, and colleges as an effective training aid and discipline&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaïdes, Kimon. 1941. "The Natural Way to Draw". Houghton Mifflin Company Boston&lt;/ref&gt; for beginner artists. In the hands of a talented master, the line that conveys contour can deliver an astonishing amount of visual delight.

==Technique==
In a continuous-line drawing, the artist looks both at the subject and the paper, moving the [[medium (communication)|medium]] over the paper, and creating a [[silhouette]] of the object. Like [[blind contour drawing]], contour drawing is an artful experience that relies more on sensation than perception; it’s important to be guided by instinct.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt; To make a blind contour drawing, an artist does not look at the paper or [[canvas]] on which he/she is working.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt; Another technique similar to contour drawing is outline drawing; a division between form and the space a subject occupies.&lt;ref name="sheenan"&gt;Sheenan, Steven. 1994. "Two types of line drawings." American Artist (VNU eMedia, Inc.) 58, no. 625: 10. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost . Retrieved February 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; All three types of drawing are considered to be [[gesture]] drawings;&lt;ref name="sheenan" /&gt; the practice of drawing a series of bodies in still form. An outline drawing does not include the visual amusement of human sight, while a contour drawing contains form, weight, mass, space, and distance.&lt;ref name="sheenan" /&gt;

==Styles==
By altering the character of the mark, an artist can emulate many aspects of the subject that relate form and space to the viewer. For example, a line can be lighter in value ([[Gradation (art)|gradation]]) to suggest greater distance between objects in the drawing. A darker portion of the contour could represent an object with little or no light source; the space is compressed or the object is lower.&lt;ref name="sheenan" /&gt; Continuous lines used inside the outline of a subject can add accent or cast shadow, depending on the value of the line.

==Practice==
The purpose of drawing blindly is to force the artist’s eye to move along the contour of the subject as his or her pencil moves along the paper. Initially, this type of drawing may be difficult and slow, but an artist will find that with practice, it is an effective way of defining observation skills such as identifying and underlying the structure of the subject, relating [[form (visual art)|form]]s, and conveying the sensual experience of the subject. Through thorough practice in this style, he/she will be skilled at drawing anything quickly and successively.&lt;ref name="sutherland" /&gt;

[[File:Memorial to Ernest Crofts, RA, Holy Trinity Blythburgh.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Ernest Crofts in [[Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh]]]]
'''Ernest Crofts''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (15 September 1847 – 19 March 1911) was a British painter of historical and military scenes.

==Biography==
Born in [[Leeds]] on 15 September 1847, Ernest was son of John Crofts, Esq. of Adal, near Leeds, a Justice of the Peace, and grandson of the Rev. W. Crofts, B.D., Vicar of North Grimston, near Malton, Yorkshire. One of his maternal uncles was the Rev. William Carr, B.D. of [[Bolton Abbey]], Yorkshire. His mother was Ellen Wordsworth, the daughter of a Leeds industrialist. Ernest studied at [[Rugby School]], for several years, and then headed to Berlin where he developed his interest in art and decided upon a career as a painter. His first acquaintance with war was made in 1864 when he accompanied a Prussian doctor in the [[Second Schleswig War|Schleswig-Holstein War]], and the operations around [[Dybbøl|Düppel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The London Figaro'', 13 April 1889&lt;/ref&gt; His sister [[Ellen Wordsworth Crofts]] married Sir [[Francis Darwin]] and was the mother of poet [[Frances Cornford]].

He returned to London and became a pupil under A. B. Clay, but was back in Germany a few years later, this time studying at the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]] in Europe, where he studied under the German military artist, [[Emil Hünten]], himself an ex-pupil of [[Horace Vernet]], and at the time military and historical painter to the Prussian emperor. Under Hünten, Crofts' talent as a military painter grew, and in 1874, he exhibited ''Retreat'', representing an episode in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] during the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], and in the same year, another scene from the same conflict, ''One touch of nature makes the whole world kin'' which won him the Crystal Palace prize medal. Both scenes were influenced by the artist's experience of witnessing some of the closing stages of the war, especially the battles of Weissenbourg, [[Battle of Wörth|Wörth]], and the siege of [[Strasbourg]]. While contributing regularly to the annual [[Royal Academy]] exhibition, he continued to live in Düsseldorf where he met his future wife.

[[File:Crofts Ernest The Battle Of Ligny.jpg|thumb|left|''Ligny'' by Ernest Crofts (1875)]]
In 1875, Crofts exhibited ''[[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]]'' at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] (RA) and at the International Exhibition in Philadelphia. The following year saw his picture representing ''The morning of the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'' which captured the dawn of the day with the tired and bespattered troops. One critic described it as follows: "Mr. Crofts' large canvas is admirable in the grouping of the soldiers on the morning of the battle; the day is breaking, on a weary, wounded and mud-stained company, some lying on the bare ground with knapsacks for pillows, some up and preparing for the march. The artillery are just on the move, and the note of preparation is sounding. The tone of the picture reminds us of the French school".&lt;ref&gt;Royal Academy annual report, 1880, pp. 351-352&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's first notable pictures of the [[English Civil War]] were exhibited in 1877, one of which depicted ''[[Oliver Cromwell]] at [[Battle of Marston Moor|Marston Moor]]''. In the same year, he refused the offer of an appointment of military painter to the Prince of Roumania to be attached to his staff during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]].

Crofts was elected an Associate of the RA on 19 July 1878, the year that his picture, ''Wellington on his march from Quatre Bras to Waterloo'' was shown. In the same year, his painting entitled ''The Morning of the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'' was shown at the Paris International Exhibition; this depicted the French army retiring from the battlefield, with [[Napoleon]] leaving his carriage and preparing to mount his horse. The artist walked and sketched much of the area around the battlefield of Waterloo including [[La Haye Sainte]], [[Hougoumont]] and [[La Belle Alliance]]. In 1896, he was elected a full academician of the [[Royal Academy]], and his Diploma Work, a Civil War scene, was entitled ''To the Rescue''. Two years later he succeeded [[Philip Calderon]] as keeper and trustee of the RA, which gave him accommodation at Burlington House. He was in effect chief director of the academy art schools as well as chief custodian of the Diploma Galley, which required "firmness, kindness and tact," according to one obituary, and Crofts was noted for his "pleasant manner, his good looks, and his amiability of character" which made him an ideal keeper.&lt;ref&gt;obituary, ''The Times'', 20 March 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides historical scenes, Crofts did paint some contemporary military events. In 1901, for instance, [[Edward VII|the king]] commissioned him to paint a picture of the distribution of the war medals following the [[Boer War]]. Two years later, he painted a large scene of the funeral of [[Queen Victoria]]. One of his most ambitious works was the panel in the ambulatory of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] which portrayed [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] opening the first Royal Exchange in 1571. His trilogy of paintings chronicling the final moments, death and burial of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] were popular, but there was some disagreement over the representation of the block upon which the king knelt to be beheaded. Some argued about the accuracy, contending that the block of the period was a lower one, being just a few inches from the ground, and that to reach it, the king would have had to lie flat.

Crofts lived at 'The Green' which he helped to re-design, next to [[Blythburgh]] church in [[Suffolk]]. He had married a German lady,  Elizabeth Wüsthofen of Düsseldorf, and they had one daughter. The artist died of pneumonia at Burlington House on 19 March 1911. His funeral service was held at St. James's Church, Piccadilly, on Thursday 23 March, followed by his  burial at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. A sale of his remaining works was held at Christie, Manson &amp; Woods on Monday 18 December 1911.&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of Remaining Works of Ernest Crofts, R.A. deceased...''. London, Christie, Manson &amp; Woods, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

While Crofts's pictures were popular in the 1870s and 1880s, the public lost its appetite for war paintings in the early years of the 20th century following the setbacks in South Africa. His obituary noted that "his taste was a little theatrical, and his talent not good enough to redeem it...it is safe to say that he will be best remembered, not by them, but by his good work at the Academy Schools and by his administrative services to the body of which he was a useful member...the exacting taste of the present day asks for something less conventional than his rather superficial battle scenes".&lt;ref&gt;obituary, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; While the artist's pictures continue to be used as illustration in history and military books, today he is rarely mentioned as a significant historical artist.

The '''Klis Fortress''' ({{lang-hr|Tvrđava Klis}}) is a [[medieval fortress]] situated above a [[Klis|village bearing the same name]], near the city of [[Split (city)|Split]], in central [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]]. From its origin as a small [[fortification|stronghold]] built by the ancient [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe [[Dalmatae]], becoming a royal castle that was the seat of many [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Croatian kings]], to its final development as a large fortress during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], Klis Fortress has guarded the frontier, being lost and re-conquered several times throughout its more-than-two-thousand-year-long history. Due to its location on a pass that separates the mountains [[Mosor]] and [[Mali Kozjak|Kozjak]], the fortress served as a major source of defense in Dalmatia, especially against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] advance, and has been a key crossroad between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] belt and the [[Balkans|Balkan]] rear.

== Importance ==
Since [[Mislav of Croatia|Duke Mislav]] of the [[Duchy of Croatia]] made Klis Fortress the seat of his throne in the middle of the 9th century, the fortress served as the seat of many Croatia's rulers. The reign of his successor, [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Duke Trpimir I]], the founder of the Croatian royal [[House of Trpimirović]], is significant for spreading [[Christianity]] in the Duchy of Croatia. He largely expanded the Klis Fortress, and in Rižinice, in the valley under the fortress, he built a [[church (building)|church]] and the first [[Benedictine monastery]] in Croatia. During the reign of the first Croatian king, [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], Klis and [[Biograd na Moru]] were his chief residences.

In March 1242 at Klis Fortress, [[Tatars]] who were a constituent segment of the [[Mongols|Mongol]] army under the leadership of [[Kadan]] suffered a major defeat while in pursuit of the Hungarian army led by King [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla IV]]. After their defeat by Croatian forces, the Mongols retreated, and Béla IV rewarded many Croatian towns and nobles with "substantial riches". During the [[Late Middle Ages]], the fortress was governed by [[Croatian nobility]], amongst whom [[Paul I Šubić of Bribir]] was the most significant. During his reign, the [[House of Šubić]] controlled most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia. Excluding the brief possession by the forces of [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnian King]], [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]], the fortress remained in Hungaro-Croatian hands for the next several hundred years, until the 16th century.

Klis Fortress is probably best known for its defense against the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion of Europe]] in the early 16th century. Croatian captain [[Petar Kružić]] led the defense of the fortress against a Turkish invasion and siege that lasted for more than two and a half decades. During this defense, as Kružić and his soldiers fought without allies against the Turks, the military faction of [[Uskoks]] was formed, which later became famous as an elite Croatian militant sect. Ultimately, the defenders were defeated and the fortress was occupied by the Ottomans in 1537. After more than a century under Ottoman rule, in 1669, Klis Fortress was besieged and seized by the [[Republic of Venice]], thus moving the border between Christian and Muslim Europe further east and helping to contribute to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress, but it was taken by the [[Austrians]] after [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] extinguished the republic itself in 1797. Today, Klis Fortress contains a museum where visitors to this historic military structure can see an array of arms, armor, and traditional uniforms.

==Location==
The fortress is located above a village bearing the [[Klis|same name]], {{convert|11|km}} from the [[Adriatic Sea]], on a pass that separates the mountains [[Mosor]] and [[Mali Kozjak|Kozjak]], at the altitude of {{convert|360|m}}, northeast of [[Split (city)|Split]] in [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 470"&gt;Hrvatski leksikon (1996), p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its strategic position, the fortress is regarded as one of the region's most important [[fortification]]s.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

Perched on an isolated rocky eminence, inaccessible on three sides, the fortress overlooks Split, the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement of [[Salona]], [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]], [[Kaštela]] and [[Trogir]], and most of the central [[List of islands in the Adriatic|Dalmatian islands]].&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/&gt; Historically, the fortress has controlled access to and from [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Dalmatia]] and [[Zagora (Croatia)|inland Croatia]].&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The importance of such a position was felt by every army that invaded, or held possession of this part of Croatia.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/&gt; Klis Fortress was a point against which their attacks were always directed, and it has been remarkable for the many sieges it withstood.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/&gt; It has been of major strategic value in Croatia throughout history.&lt;ref name="građevinar"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.casopis-gradjevinar.hr/assets/Uploads/JCE-53-2001-09-06.pdf | title=Klis&amp;nbsp;–vrata Dalmacije |trans-title=Klis&amp;nbsp;– A gateway to Dalmatia | journal=Građevinar | publisher=Croatian Society of Civil Engineers | location=Zagreb |date=September 2001 | volume=53 | issue=9 | pages=605–611 | language=Croatian | issn=0350-2465 | format=PDF | accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient stronghold of Illyrians and Romans===
{{See also|Dalmatae|Illyrian Wars|Roman Empire}}
The ancient [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe of [[Dalmatae]], which held a stronghold on this spot, were the first known inhabitants who lived on the site of what is today Klis Fortress.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.klis.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:povijest-uvod-clanak&amp;catid=9:povijest-kategorija&amp;Itemid=7 | title=Povijest Klisa | last=Listeš | first=Srećko | work=klis.hr | publisher=Službene stranice Općine Klis | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were defeated several times, and in the year 9 AD, finally annexed by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; Today's Klis Fortress was known to the Romans by the name of ''"Andetrium"'' or ''"Anderium"'',&lt;ref name="Royal Geographical Society 589"&gt;Royal Geographical Society (1856), p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; and in later times ''"Clausura"'', which is the origin of later ''"Clissa"'' and modern ''"Klis"''.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"&gt;Wilkinson (1848), pp. 169–172.&lt;/ref&gt; To the Romans, Klis became famous for its celebrated siege by [[Augustus]], at the time of the [[Illyrian revolt]] in Dalmatia.&lt;ref name="Collection 111-116"&gt;Collection (1805), pp. 111–116.&lt;/ref&gt; The road that lead from Klis to Salona was called "Via Gabiniana" or "Via Gabinia", which according to an inscription found at Salona, appears to have been made by [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/&gt; Southeast of the fortress, the traces of a Roman camp are still visible, as well as an inscription carved on a rock; both which are supposed to be contemporary with the siege under Tiberius.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/&gt; The description of this siege during the [[Illyrian Wars]] demonstrates that this place was strong and unreachable in those times.&lt;ref name="Collection 111-116"/&gt;

===Migration period and the arrival of the Croats===
{{See also|Migration period|Croats}}
After the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], Barbarians plundered the region around Klis.&lt;ref name="Fine 22"&gt;Fine (The early medieval Balkans&amp;nbsp;– 1991), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; First it was ruled by [[Odoacer]], and then by the [[Theodoric the Great]], after he eliminated Odoacer, and set up an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Fine 22"/&gt; After [[Justinian I]] fought an almost continual war for forty years to recover the old Roman Empire, he seized Dalmatia, and Klis was from 537, a part of [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="Fine 22"/&gt; The name of Klis (''Kleisa'' or ''Kleisoura'') was first described in chapter 29 of Emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus']] ''De Administrando Imperio''.&lt;ref name="Curta 100-101"&gt;Curta (2006), pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; While describing the Roman settlement of [[Salona]], Constantine VII speaks of the stronghold, which may have been designed or improved, to prevent attacks on the coastal cities and roads by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]].&lt;ref name="Curta 100-101"/&gt;

Salona, the capital of the [[Byzantine Dalmatia|province of Dalmatia]] was sacked and destroyed in 614 by [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and [[Slavs]].&lt;ref name="Fine 34-35"&gt;Fine (The early medieval Balkans&amp;nbsp;– 1991), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The population fled to [[Diocletian's Palace|Diocletian's]] walled palace of Split, which was able to hold up.&lt;ref name="Fine 34-35"/&gt; Thereafter, Split rose quickly in importance, as one of Dalmatia's major cities.&lt;ref name="Fine 34-35"/&gt; After a few decades, the Avars were driven out by the [[Croats]].&lt;ref name="Fine 34-35"/&gt; This probably happened after 620, when in second wave Croats migrated on the invitation by the Emperor [[Heraclius]] to counter the Avar threat on the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="Constantine Porphyrogenitus"&gt;[[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], ''De Administrando Imperio'', ed.

===Royal Castle===
{{See also|Duchy of Croatia|Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)}}
From the early 7th century on, Klis was an important Croat stronghold, and later, one of the seats of many Croatia's rulers.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; In the 9th century, Croatian duke [[Mislav of Croatia|Mislav]] of the [[Duchy of Croatia]], from 835 to 845, made the castle of Klis seat of his throne.&lt;ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 470"/&gt; Despite [[Franks|Frankish]] overlordship, the Franks had almost no role in Croatia in the period from the 820s through 840s. After Mislav's death, starting with [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Duke Trpimir I]], Klis was ruled by royal members of the [[House of Trpimirović]], who were at first [[Duke]]s of the Croatian Duchy (''dux Croatorum''), and afterwards [[Monarch|Kings]] of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Croatian Kingdom]] (''rex Croatorum''). They developed the early Roman stronghold into their capital.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Relations with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] greatly improved under the Croatian duke Trpimir I, who moved the dux's main residence from [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] to Klis.&lt;ref name="Fine 257"&gt;Fine (The early medieval Balkans&amp;nbsp;– 1991), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of Mislav's successor [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir I]], is significant for spreading [[Christianity]] in the medieval Croatian state, and for the first mention of the name ''"Croats"'' in domestic documents.&lt;ref name="Curta 139"&gt;Curta (2006), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 1022"&gt;Hrvatski leksikon (1996), p. 1022.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March, in 852, Trpimir I issued a ''"Charter in Biaći"'' ({{lang-la|in loco Byaci dicitur}}) in Latin, confirming Mislav's donations to the [[Archbishopric]] in [[Split (city)|Split]].&lt;ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 1022"/&gt; In this document Trpimir I named himself; ''"By the mercy of God, Duke of Croats"'' ({{lang-la|Dux Chroatorum iuvatus munere divino}}), and his realm as the ''"Realm of the Croats"'' ({{lang-la|Regnum Chroatorum}}).&lt;ref name="Hrvatski leksikon 1022"/&gt; In the same document Trpimir I mentioned Klis as his property&amp;nbsp;— seat.&lt;ref name="Curta 139"/&gt; Under Klis, in Rižinice, the duke Trpimir built a [[church (building)|church]] and the first [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] in Croatia, which is known from the discovery of a stone fragment on a gable arch from an altar screen, inscribed with the duke's name and title.&lt;ref name="Curta 139"/&gt; {{cquote|([[Latin language|Latin]] ... ''pro duce Trepimero'' ...&amp;nbsp;– English... ''for Duke Trpimir'' ...)}}

Archaeological excavations found that a church dedicated to Saint Vitus was founded in the 10th century by a certain Croatian king, along with his wife, Queen Domaslava, which got destroyed during Ottoman conquests in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historiografija.hr/Budak_HZ_2-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial [[Saxons|Saxon]] theologian of the mid-9th century, [[Gottschalk of Orbais]], spent some time at Trpimir's court between 846 and 848.&lt;ref name="Curta 139"/&gt; His work ''"De Trina deitate"'' is an important source of information for Trpimir's reign.&lt;ref name="Curta 139"/&gt; Gottschalk was a witness to the battle between Trpimir and Byzantine strategos, when Trpimir was victorious.&lt;ref name="Curta 139"/&gt; During the reign of Croatian king [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], who had no permanent capital, the castle of Klis along with [[Biograd na Moru|Biograd]], were his chief residences.&lt;ref name="Fine 263"&gt;Fine (The early medieval Balkans&amp;nbsp;– 1991), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knights Templar===
{{See also|Kingdom of Croatia (1102–1526)|Kingdom of Hungary|Knights Templar}}
From the early 12th century, and after the decay of the native Croatian royal family of Trpimirović, the castle of Klis was mainly governed by [[Croatian nobility]], under the supremacy of Hungarian kings. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] were, from 1102, in a [[personal union]] of two kingdoms, united under the Hungarian king.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The actual nature of the relationship is inexplicable in modern terms because it varied from time to time. (Bellamy (2003), p. 38.) Sometimes Croatia acted as an independent agent and at other times as a vassal of Hungary. (Bellamy (2003), p. 38.) However, Croatia retained a large degree of internal independence. (Bellamy (2003), p. 38.) The degree of Croatian autonomy fluctuated throughout the centuries as did its borders. (Singleton (1989), p. 29.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regional Surveys of the World 271"&gt;Regional Surveys of the World (1996), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew II of Hungary]] was extremely favorably disposed towards the [[Knights Templar|Templars]].&lt;ref name="Hunyadi and Laszlovszky 137"&gt;Hunyadi and Laszlovszky (2001), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; During his participation in the [[Fifth Crusade]], he appointed [[Pontius de Cruce]], Master of the Order in the Hungarian Kingdom, as a regent in Croatia and Dalmatia.&lt;ref name="Hunyadi and Laszlovszky 137"/&gt; After his return in 1219, in recognition of the great logistical and financial support which the Order had given him during the campaign, he granted the Order the estate of [[Gacka]].&lt;ref name="Hunyadi and Laszlovszky 137"/&gt; Even before his departure from the city of Split in 1217, he had made over to the Templars the castle of Klis (''Clissa''), a strategic point in the hinterland of Split (''Spalato''), which controlled the approaches to the town.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunyadi and Laszlovszky 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 161–163"/&gt; The king Andrew was reluctant to entrust the castle of Klis to any of the local magnates, knowing what great harm could come from that castle.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 161–163"&gt;Archdeacon (2006), pp. 161–163.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the king's will that Split receive the castle of Klis for the defense of their city.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 161–163"/&gt; The city of Split showed little interest in the royal favors, so the king entrusted Klis into Templars hands.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 161–163"/&gt; Shortly after this, the Templars lost Klis, and, in exchange, the king gave them the coastal town of [[Šibenik]] (''Sebenico'').&lt;ref name="Hunyadi and Laszlovszky 137"/&gt;

===Mongol siege===
{{See also|Mongol invasion of Europe}}
[[Tatars]] under the leadership of [[Kadan]] experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for [[Béla IV of Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 299"&gt;Archdeacon (2006), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 299"/&gt; They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 299"/&gt; But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 299"/&gt; This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought hand to hand.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 299"/&gt; They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 299"/&gt; Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir,&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 299"/&gt; a number of them turning off toward Split.&lt;ref name="Archdeacon 299"/&gt;

The Mongols attacked the Dalmatian cities for the next few years but eventually withdrew without major success, as the mountainous terrain and distance were not suitable for their style of warfare.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"/&gt; They pursued Béla IV from town to town in Dalmatia.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"/&gt; The [[Croatian nobility]] and Dalmatian towns such as [[Trogir]] and [[Rab]] helped Béla IV to escape.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"/&gt; After this failure, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV rewarded the Croatian towns and nobility.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"/&gt; Only the city of [[Split (city)|Split]] did not help Béla IV in his escape.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"/&gt;

Some historians claim that the mountainous terrain of Croatian Dalmatia was fatal for the Mongols, because they suffered great losses when attacked by the [[Croats]] from ambushes in mountain passes.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"&gt;Klaić V., Povijest Hrvata, Knjiga Prva, Druga, Treća, Četvrta i Peta Zagreb 1982. {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians claim that the death of [[Ögedei Khan]] ({{lang-hr|Ogotaj}}) was the only reason for retreat. Much of Croatia was plundered by the Mongols, but without any major military success.&lt;ref name="Klaić V"/&gt; [[Saint Margaret of Hungary|Saint Margaret]] (January 27, 1242&amp;nbsp;– January 18, 1271), a daughter of Béla IV and [[Maria Laskarina]], was born in Klis Fortress during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion of Hungary-Croatia]].&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

===Šubić's rule===
{{See also|House of Šubić}}
The weakening of royal authority under [[Stephen V of Hungary]] allowed the [[House of Šubić]] to regain their former role in Dalmatia.&lt;ref name="Fine 206"&gt;Fine (The Late Medieval Balkans&amp;nbsp;– 1994), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1274, [[Stjepko Šubić of Bribir]] died, and [[Paul I Šubić of Bribir]] succeeded him as the family elder.&lt;ref name="Fine 206"/&gt; Soon, [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]], recognizing the balance of power in Dalmatia, named Paul I as [[Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name="Fine 206"/&gt; Ladislaus IV died in 1290 leaving no sons, and a civil war between rival candidates, pro-Hungarian [[Andrew III of Hungary]], and pro-Croatian [[Charles Martel of Anjou]], started.&lt;ref name="Fine 207-208"&gt;Fine (The Late Medieval Balkans&amp;nbsp;– 1994), pp. 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Martel's father [[Charles II of Naples]], awarded all Croatia from [[Petrova Gora|Gvozd Mountain]] ({{lang-hr|Petrova Gora}}) to the river [[Neretva|Neretva mouth]] hereditary to Paul I Šubić of Bribir.&lt;ref name="Fine 207-208"/&gt; Thus, Charles converted Paul's personal position as Ban into a hereditary one for the Šubić family.&lt;ref name="Fine 207-208"/&gt; All the other nobles in this region, were to be vassals of Paul Šubić.&lt;ref name="Fine 207-208"/&gt; In response, Andrew III in 1293 issued a similar charter for Paul Šubić.&lt;ref name="Fine 207-208"/&gt; During this struggle over the throne, [[George I Šubić of Bribir]], Ban Paul's brother went to Italy, visiting the pope and the Naples court.&lt;ref name="Fine 208-209"&gt;Fine (The Late Medieval Balkans&amp;nbsp;– 1994), pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1300, George I returned to Split, bringing [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] with him.&lt;ref name="Fine 208-209"/&gt; Paul Šubić accompanied Charles Robert (later known as Charles I of Hungary) to [[Zagreb]], where he was recognized as king; then they proceeded to [[Esztergom]], where, in 1301, the Archbishop of Esztergom crowned him as King of Hungary and Croatia.&lt;ref name="Fine 208-209"/&gt;

Paul I Šubić, Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, became [[Lord of all of Bosnia]] in 1299.&lt;ref name="Fine 209-210"&gt;Fine (The Late Medieval Balkans&amp;nbsp;– 1994), pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Although supporting the king, Paul I continued to act independently, and ruled over a large portion of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia.&lt;ref name="Fine 209-210"/&gt; He appointed his brothers as commissars of Dalmatian cities, and gave Split to his brother [[Mladen I Šubić of Bribir|Mladen I Šubić]], and [[Šibenik]], [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], [[Trogir]] and [[Omiš]] to his brother [[George I Šubić of Bribir|George I Šubić]].&lt;ref name="Fine 209-210"/&gt; After George I Šubić died in 1302, his brother Mladen I Šubić ruled as a [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Bosnian Ban]] over [[Bosnia]] from Klis Fortress, until he was killed in a battle during 1304.&lt;ref name="Fine 209-210"/&gt; Then, Šubić gave the Klis Fortress to his son [[Mladen II Šubić of Bribir|Mladen II Šubić]], who ruled over Bosnia like his uncle Mladen I.&lt;ref name="Fine 209-210"/&gt; [[George II Šubić of Bribir|George II Šubić]] and his son, [[Mladen III Šubić of Bribir|Mladen III Šubić]], ruled over Klis Fortress until the late 14th century.&lt;ref name="Fine 209-210"/&gt; During summer-long festivities in Klis Fortress, open to the whole population, Mladen III Šubić gave his sister's [[Jelena Šubić]] hand in marriage to [[Vladislaus of Bosnia]], from the [[House of Kotromanić]].&lt;ref name="Klaić V"/&gt; Jelena Šubić gave birth to the first [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnian King]], [[Tvrtko I]], who later inherited the fortress.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt;

===Petar Kružić and the Uskoci===
{{See also|Petar Kružić|Uskoks}}
Owing to its location, Klis Fortress was an important defensive position during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Singleton 60-61"&gt;Singleton (1989), pp. 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress stands along the route by which the Ottomans could penetrate the mountain barrier separating the coastal lowlands from around Split, from Turkish-held Bosnia.&lt;ref name="Singleton 60-61"/&gt; The Croat feudal lord [[Petar Kružić]] gathered together a garrison composed of Croat refugees, who used the base at Klis both to hold the Turks at bay, and to engage in marauding and piracy against coastal shipping.&lt;ref name="Singleton 60-61"/&gt; Although nominally accepting the sovereignty of the Habsburg king [[Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Ferdinand]] who had obtained the Croatian crown in 1527,{{refn|group="Note"|The Croatian nobles [[1527 election in Cetin|met in 1527 at Cetin and elected Ferdinand as their king]], and confirmed the succession to him and his heirs.

When a large Turkish force threatened the fortress, Kružić appealed to Ferdinand I for help, but the Emperor's attention was diverted by a Turkish invasion into [[Slavonia]].&lt;ref name="Singleton 60-61"/&gt; For more than two and half decades, Captain Kružić, also called ''(Prince of Klis)'', defended the fortress against the Turkish invasion.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; Kružić led the defense of Klis, and with his soldiers fought almost alone against the Ottomans, as they hurled army after army against the fortress.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; No troops would come from the Hungarian king, as they were defeated by the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, and the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] baulked at sending any help.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; Only the [[pope]]s were willing to provide some men and money.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt;

===Final Ottoman siege===
{{main|Siege of Klis}}
[[Pope Paul III]] claimed some rights in Klis, and in September, 1536, there was talk in the [[Roman Curia|Curia]] of strengthening the defenses of the fortress.&lt;ref name="Setton 421"&gt;Setton (1984), p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope notified [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] that he was willing to share the costs of maintaining a proper garrison in Klis.&lt;ref name="Setton 421"/&gt; Ferdinand I did send aid to Klis and was apparently hopeful of holding the fortress, when the Turks again laid siege to it.&lt;ref name="Setton 421"/&gt; Ferdinand I recruited men from [[Trieste]] and elsewhere in the Habsburg lands, and Pope Paul III sent soldiers from [[Ancona]].&lt;ref name="Setton 421"/&gt; There were about 3,000 infantry in the reinforcements, which made a sizeable relief force, that were commanded by Petar Kružić, [[Niccolo dalla Torre]], and a papal commissioner [[Jacomo Dalmoro d'Arbe]].&lt;ref name="Setton 421"/&gt; On March 9, 1537, they disembarked near Klis, at a place called S. Girolamo, with fourteen pieces of artillery.&lt;ref name="Setton 421"/&gt; After Ibrahim's death, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] sent 8,000 men under the command of [[Murat-beg Tardić]] (Amurat Vaivoda), a Croatian renegade who had been born in [[Šibenik]], to go and lay siege to Klis fortress (''Clissa''), and fight against Petar Kružić.&lt;ref name="Spandouginos 75"&gt;Spandouginos (1997), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; An initial encounter of the Christian relief force with the Turks was indecisive, but, on March 12, they were overwhelmed by the arrival of a great number of Turks.&lt;ref name="Setton 421"/&gt;

The attempts to relieve the citadel ended in farce.&lt;ref name="Bousfield 313"&gt;Bousfield (2003), p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Badly-drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in the fear of Turks, and their attempts to re-board their boats at Solin bay caused many vessels to sink.&lt;ref name="Bousfield 313"/&gt; Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape.&lt;ref name="Spandouginos 75"/&gt; Kružić himself&amp;nbsp;– who had left the fortress to make contact with the reinforcements was captured and executed: the sight of his head on a stick was too much for the remaining defenders of Klis, who were now willing to give up the fortress in return for safe passage north.&lt;ref name="Bousfield 313"/&gt; After Petar Kružić's death, and with a lack of water supplies, the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom, on March 12, 1537.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; Many of the citizens fled the town, while the [[Uskoci]] retreated to the city of [[Senj]], where they continued fighting the Turkish invaders.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt;

===Sanjak centre of Ottoman Bosnia===
{{See also|Bosnia Eyalet}}
During the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], Klis Fortress was, for a century, an administrative centre or [[sanjak]] (Kilis Sancağı) of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]].&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; On April 7, 1596, Split noblemen Ivan Alberti and Nikola Cindro, along with Uskoci, Poljičani, and Kaštelani irregulars, organized an occupation of Klis.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; Assisted by dissident elements of the Turkish garrison, they succeeded.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Setton 9"&gt;Setton (1984), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Bey Mustafa responded by bringing more than 10,000 soldiers under the fortress.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; General [[Ivan Lenković]], leading 1,000 Uskoci, came in relief of the 1,500 Klis defenders.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; During the battle, Ivan Lenković and his men retreated after he was wounded in battle, and the fortress was lost to the Turks, on May 31.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; Nevertheless, this temporary relief resounded in Europe and among the local population.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt;
[[File:Rijeka014.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Petar Kružić]] fighting the Ottomans]]

From the well-fortified position in the Klis Fortress, the Turks were a constant threat to the Venetians and to the local Croatian population in the surrounding area. In 1647, after the Turkish success at [[Novigrad, Zadar County|Novigrad]], the Turks were said to have 30,000 troops ready to attack Split.&lt;ref name="Setton 144"&gt;Setton (1984), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Signoria]] send off two thousand soldiers with munitions and provisions to the threatened area.&lt;ref name="Setton 144"/&gt; Although Split and [[Zadar]] were strong fortresses, they were clearly in danger.&lt;ref name="Setton 144"/&gt;

===Venetian domination===
In 1420, the [[Anjou]] contender [[Ladislaus of Naples]] was defeated and forced to sail away for [[Naples]]. Upon his departure he sold his "rights" to Dalmatia to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]] for the relatively meager sum of 100,000 [[ducats]]. However, Klis and Klis Fortress remained parts of the Kingdom of Croatia.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; From that time, the Venetians were eager to take control over Klis, as the fortress was one of the region's most important strategic points.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt;

The Venetians fought for decades before they finally managed to re-take Klis.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; During the [[Candian War#War in Dalmatia|Candian War (1645–1669)]], the Venetians in Dalmatia enjoyed the support of the local population, particularly the [[Morlachs]] (Morlacchi).&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; Venetian commander [[Leonardo Foscolo]] seized several forts, retook [[Novigrad, Zadar County|Novigrad]], temporarily captured the [[Knin Fortress]], and managed to compel the garrison of Klis Fortress to surrender. At the same time, a month-long siege of the Šibenik Fortress by the Ottomans in August and September failed.&lt;ref name="Fraser 244-245"&gt;Fraser (1854), pp. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Setton 148-149"&gt;Setton (1991), pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1669, Klis Fortress was in the possession of the Venetians, and it remained so until the fall of the Venetian state.&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress during their rule.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; After another, the seventh war with the Turks from 1714 to 1718, the Venetians were able to advance up to the present Bosnian/Croatian border, taking in the whole Sinjsko field and [[Imotski]].&lt;ref name="Singleton 60-61"/&gt; Thereafter the Turkish menace was laid to rest and Venice had no serious challenge to its authority in Dalmatia, until [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] extinguished the republic itself in 1797.&lt;ref name="Singleton 60-61"/&gt; The border between Christian and Muslim Europe had been moved further east, and the fortress lost its main strategic importance.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Subsequently, Klis was taken by the [[Austrians]].&lt;ref name="Povijest Klisa"/&gt; The last military occupation of Klis Fortress was by [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

[[File:Klis 0807 3.jpg|160px|thumb|alt=View of the fortress from west to east.|right|Klis Fortress seen from its west point, toward east.]]
Klis Fortress is one of the most valuable surviving examples of defensive [[architecture]] in Dalmatia.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The fortress is a remarkably comprehensive structure with three long rectangular defensive lines, consisting of three [[Defensive wall|defensive stone walls]], which are surrounding a central strongpoint, the "''Položaj maggiore''" at its eastern, highest end.&lt;ref name="Bousfield 313"/&gt; "''Položaj maggiore''" or ''"Grand position"'' is a mixed Croatian-Italian term, dating from the time when Leonardo Foscolo captured the fortress for the Venetians in 1648.&lt;ref name="Bousfield 313"/&gt; At that time, a village started to spread below the ramparts.&lt;ref name="Foster 215"/&gt; The structures of the fortress are mostly irregular, as they were constructed to suit the natural topography.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/&gt; On the hills around Klis, there are several small towers, built by the Turks to keep the fortress under surveillance.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 169-172"/&gt;

===Fortress outskirts===
The Klis Fortress rises on a bare cliff divided into two parts.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The first, lower part is on the west, out topped by Mount Greben from the north.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The second, higher part is on the east, and includes the Tower "Oprah", whose name most likely refers to a specific part in the defense.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; In this section which was not topped by any side, was located the flat of the [[Commander]].&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The only entrance into the fortress is from the western side.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; On the southwest side of the fortress, and below it was a resort (part of the modern village of Klis) called "borgo" or "suburbium", surrounded by double walls with 100–200 towers.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; A similar but smaller resort (also part of modern village of Klis) existed below Mount Greben on a plateau called Megdan.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; This included [[lazaretto]]es and [[quarantine]]s which were in Turkish times called "nazanama".&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; There were also many inns for travellers, which were used for isolation during epidemics.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Thus, the coastal towns, primarily the city of Split was protected from epidemics that came from Bosnia.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Near the fortress, there were several sources of drinking water, and the closest was the "[[Biblical Magi|Holy Biblical Magi]]" whose importance was invaluable during long sieges.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

===Present appearance===
[[File:Split at night.jpg|160px|thumb|alt=In view from the fortress towards Split at night, there is dark blue sky, and city lights below.|left|View towards [[Split (city)|Split]].]]
The fortress was built into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely discernible from the distance as a man-made structure.&lt;ref name="Foster 215"/&gt; The defensive capabilities of the fortress have been tested through history in many [[military]] operations.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; During the centuries of its use, the structure served various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, to keep up with the development of arms.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The present day aspect of a mostly [[Rock (geology)|stone]] fortress dates back to the restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Foster 215"&gt;Foster (2004), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

====First defensive line====
Many buildings of the Klis Fortress which are from 17th through 19th centuries are partially or entirely preserved.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The Fortress actually consists of three parts, enclosed by walls with separate entrances.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The first main entrance was built by the Austrians in the early 19th century, on the place of an earlier Venetian entrance.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Left of the entrance there is a fortification erected by the Venetians in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Also, near the main entrance there is a "position Avanzato" built in 1648, which was repeatedly renewed afterwards.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; On the ground floor of the fortification there is a narrow over-vaulted corridor, which is called a Casemate.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

====Second defensive line====
[[File:Oprah tower and second entrance of klis fortress.jpg|160px|thumb|alt=Stone tower with flag left from stone entrance.|left|Oprah tower guarding a second entrance.]]
The second entrance which was significantly damaged in the siege of 1648, leads to the former medieval part of the fortress previously ruled by a Croatian nobility.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; After 1648, Venetians fully restored the second entrance, but its present appearance was made by the Austrians during the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Along the northern wall near the second entrance, there is fortress-tower called "Oprah", the most important medieval fortification of the western part of the fortress.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; It was mentioned for the first time in 1355, but later the Venetians made the lower crown on it.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Nearby of the entrance are artillery barracks, built by the Austrians in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; In 1931 its upper floor was ruined, so now only the ground floor remains.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

====Third defensive line====
[[File:Klis 0807 4.jpg|160px|thumb|right|alt=Entrance to the third defensive line, through the third gate in a medieval tower.|right|Entrance to the third defensive line, through the third gate in a medieval tower.]]
[[File:Cannon-in-klis.JPG|160px|thumb|right|Cannon in the castle]]
The third entrance leads to the former medieval part built in the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; The Venetians renewed it several times after conquest in 1648, and the last upgrade was in 1763.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Within this part of the fortress there is the side tower, built during the 18th century, and completed in 1763.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Following is a repository of weapons built in the mid-17th century and old powder magazine from the 18th century.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; "House of Dux" later called governor's residence was rebuilt in the mid-17th century on the foundations of the oldest buildings from the period of Croatian kings.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; Austrians repaired this building, and there were placed commandments unity of the fortress and Engineering.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; On the top point of the fortress there was a "New gunpowder storage", built in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

The oldest remaining building with the [[dome]] and [[minaret]], was a former square-shaped Turkish [[mosque]], built after the conquest of Klis in 1537 on the foundations of an earlier Old Croatian Catholic chapel.&lt;ref name="Foster 215"/&gt; after occupation in 1648, the Venetians pulled down the minaret and converted it into a Roman Catholic church, dedicated to St. [[Vitus]] ({{lang-hr|Crkva St. Vida}}).&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster 215"/&gt; It is a simple constructed square with the octagonal stone roof. There used to be three Altars, dedicated to St. Vid, Virgin Mary and St. Barbara, but today the church has no inventory.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; In the church there is a Baroque stone sink from the 17th century, which served as a baptistery, where there is engraved the year of 1658.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; West of the church is the bastion of Bembo, the largest artillery position in the third defense line and in the whole fortress.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt; It has wide holes for guns, and was built in the mid-17th century on the site of former Kružić's tower, and the defensive positions of Speranza.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

==Present day==
The Klis Fortress has been developed as a visitor attraction by the "Kliški uskoci" [[historical reenactment|re-enactment]] association in Klis with the aid of the conservation department of the [[Government of Croatia|Ministry of Culture]] in Split.&lt;ref name="kliskiuskoci"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kliskiuskoci.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54%3Aotvorena-uskoka-oruarnica&amp;catid=15%3Avijesti&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=en | title=Otvorena "Uskočka oružarnica" | last=Mihovilović | first=Sreten | work=kliskiuskoci.hr | publisher=Povijesna postrojba „Kliški uskoci“ | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the historic military structure can see an array of arms, armor, and traditional uniforms in a building which was formerly an Austrian armory.&lt;ref name="kliskiuskoci"/&gt; Klis is remembered in a Croatian [[byword (saying)|byword]] based on the resistance of Klis and the strength of its people: ''It is difficult for Klis because it is on the rock and it is difficult for the rock because Klis is on it''.&lt;ref name="građevinar"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
The fortress was used in a 1972 historical film [[Eagle in a Cage]], portraying [[Saint Helena]]. 
Klis is also being used as a location for the fictional city of Meereen in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://winteriscoming.net/2013/09/new-set-photos-from-klis-and-dubrovnik/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">The '''Galería de Arte Mexicano''' (GAM) was founded by [[Carolina Amor|Carolina]] and [[Inés Amor]] on 7 March 1940, in [[Mexico City]] and has been the first gallery of [[Mexican art]]. The gallery building was the first building in Mexico of [[Andrés Casillas de Alba]].

The intention of the GAM is to establish national artists as well as the promotion of young artists. The collection of the GAM includes items of [[Modern art|modern]], Mexican and [[contemporary art]]. In January 1940 the gallery opened its first exhibition of [[Surrealism|Surrealist art]] organized by French writer and group leader [[André Breton]], the Austrian Surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] and the Peruvian poet [[César Moro]]. Altogether the GAM organized more than 900 exhibitions including well-known exhibitors like [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Miguel Covarrubias]], [[Miguel Condé]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Agustín Lazo]], [[Federico Cantú]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cantuart.blogspot.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesús Guerrero Galván]], [[Luis Ortiz Monasterio]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://luisortizmonasterio-boart.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emilio Rosenblueth]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://emiliorosenblueth.blogspot.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">In [[geometry]] and [[crystallography]], a '''glide plane''' (or '''transflection''') is a [[symmetry operation]] describing how a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a plane, followed by a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] parallel with that plane, may leave the [[crystal]] unchanged. 

Glide planes are noted by ''a'', ''b'' or ''c'', depending on which axis the glide is along.  There is also the ''n'' glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the ''d'' glide, which is along a fourth of either a face or space diagonal of the [[unit cell]]. The latter is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure.

==Formal treatment==
In [[geometry]], a '''glide plane operation''' is a type of [[isometry]] of the [[Euclidean space]]: the combination of a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a plane and a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] in that plane. Reversing the order of combining gives the same result. Depending on context, we may consider a reflection a special case, where the translation vector is the zero vector.

The combination of a reflection in a plane and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a reflection in a parallel plane. However, a glide plane operation with a nonzero translation vector in the plane cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a reflection combined with ''any'' translation is a glide plane operation in the general sense, with as special case just a reflection. The glide plane operation in the strict sense and the pure reflection are two of the four kinds of indirect [[Euclidean_group#Overview_of_isometries_in_up_to_three_dimensions|isometries in 3D]].

The [[isometry group]] generated by just a glide plane operation is an infinite [[cyclic group]]. Combining two equal glide plane operations gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide plane operation, so the even powers of the glide plane operation form a translation group.

In the case of '''glide plane symmetry''', the [[symmetry group]] of an object contains a glide plane operation, and hence the group generated by it. For any symmetry group containing glide plane symmetry, the translation vector of any glide plane operation is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide plane operation is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide plane symmetry reduces to a combination of [[reflection symmetry]] and [[translational symmetry]].

'''Guildford School of Acting (GSA)''' is a drama school in [[Guildford]], Surrey, England.  It is an academic school in the [[University of Surrey]] with accreditation from Drama UK for its professional training degrees. As of 2014, it is the top scoring Drama UK accredited school for student satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsauk.org/gsa-achieves-success-national-student-survey-2014/ |title=GSA achieves success in the National Student Survey 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2014 |date=August 2014 |publisher=Guildford School of Acting |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820084216/http://gsauk.org/gsa-achieves-success-national-student-survey-2014/ |archivedate=20 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Guildford School of Acting (GSA), originally known as the '''Grant-Bellairs School of Dance and Drama''', was founded in London in 1935 by Pauline Grant and Bice Bellairs.  The school moved to Guildford in 1945 as a result of [[World War II]].  In 1964, the school became a charitable organisation and was renamed Guildford School of Acting &amp; Dance.  In the early 1990s the '&amp; Dance' was dropped. Today the school is part of the University of Surrey's Stag Hill Campus, Guildford, Surrey.

The school offers professional training and academic degrees in theatre and performance, dance, acting, musical theatre and [[Stagecraft|production skills]] such as [[stage management]], [[Lighting designer|lighting]] and [[sound design]]. Surrey has a long association with dance having been the first university in the UK to validate a single honours dance degree. The university also hosts the National Resource Centre for Dance established in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/nrcd/ |title=National Resource Centre for Dance website |accessdate=14 September 2016 |date=September 2016 |publisher=University of Surrey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624134515/http://www.surrey.ac.uk/nrcd/ |archive-date=24 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
. All full-time courses lead towards further and higher education qualifications validated by either the [[University of Surrey]] or [[Trinity College London]].  A leading performing arts school, GSA is recognised as a centre of excellence for Musical Theatre training alongside research specialisms in performance philosophy and contemporary theatre practice. The Centre for Performance Philosophy (CCP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/schoolofarts/research/centre_for_performance_philosophy/ |title=Centre for Performance Philosophy |accessdate=20 September 2016 |date=September 2016 |publisher=University of Surrey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001201000/http://www.surrey.ac.uk/schoolofarts/research/centre_for_performance_philosophy/ |archive-date=1 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; led by Dr. Laura Cull Ó Maoilearca, was founded in 2016 as part of the school's Institute of Performance.

Until November 2009, the School occupied several sites in central Guildford, with facilities including drama, dance and music studios, technical workshops, IT facilities, a specialist library and resource centre, a wardrobe department, rehearsal rooms and two in-house theatres. As part of its merger with the University of Surrey, the school has moved to a completely new building which houses all faculties of the school on one site on the university campus. Peter Barlow, GSA Director (until December 2010), was handed the keys by project manager David Austin ([[VolkerFitzpatrick]]) on 13 November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatoire.org/home/index.php?dept=21&amp;s=432&amp;id=499 |title=New building – we have the keys! |accessdate=20 November 2009 |date=November 2009 |publisher=Guildford School of Acting |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213200848/http://www.conservatoire.org/home/index.php?dept=21&amp;s=432&amp;id=499 |archivedate=13 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; marking a new era for GSA, with the first classes at the new building started on 16 November. The relocation was completed in late 2011 with the opening of the Ivy Performing Arts Centre.

The school stages regular private and public performances at both The Ivy Arts Centre and other venues in Guildford and in the UK.

In 2015 the school added a course in Actor-Musicianship which will produce its first graduates in 2018.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Following a re-structure in 2016, GSA now includes the well-established programmes in Theatre &amp; Performance, and Dance which had previously been part of the university's School of Arts. This will produce its first graduates in 2019.

'''''Holyday''''', later also known as '''''The Picnic''''', is an oil painting by French painter [[James Tissot]]  (1836–1902),  painted in 1876. Tissot moved to England in the year 1871, when he was thirty five  years old and settled there.  Before moving to London, Tissot  was a successful painter of Paris society.

It is {{convert|30|by|39|in|cm|}} in size. The painting shows a group of elegantly dressed men and women during a picnic at the  pond in the painter's garden.  The painting is characterized by the attention to detail and vivid colours. ''Holyday'' is held in London's [[Tate Gallery]].

== Description==
''Holyday'' was painted in the back garden of Tissot's London home, near the [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]. Autumn is coming, the leaves of the large chestnut tree are changing color, but the rest of the vegetation is still green and luxurious. The low sun shines a bright afternoon light on the scene. On the right is the painter's wife, Kathleen Newton, who appears to avert her eyes from the scene. The men in the painting belong to the well-known ''[[I Zingari]]'' cricket club, judging by their yellow, red and black hats. The women are overdressed, one of Tissot's idiosyncrasies. The atmosphere is sensual and relaxed and demonstrates a British sense of superiority. &lt;!-- ?? --&gt;

[[File:James Tissot - La Partie carrée.jpg|thumb|250px|''La Partie carrée'', 1876.]] 
Stylistically, ''Holyday'' is striking because of its crystal-clear representation. The work is hyperrealistic and greatly detailed, with sparkling colors. The focus on daily scenes comes from [[Impressionism]], which was ''en vogue'' in the Paris of those days. The influence of Manet can be recognized, also in the choice of subject, reminiscent of his ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (The Luncheon on the Grass). However, ''Holyday'' does not provoke but is suffused with a British conservatism.

== History==
Tissot's ''Holyday'' was shown in 1877 in London's [[Grosvenor Gallery]] as a pendant for ''[[:File:Tissot a-convalescent.jpg|A Convalescent]]'', which was also painted by Tissot in his yard. He made studies for both paintings in a single sketchbook. He probably intended the two to be a [[diptych]], though they were quickly separated when sold and never exhibited together afterward. ''A Convalescent'' is in the [[Manchester Art Gallery]]; ''Holyday'' was acquired by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1928.

{{main|Claude Monet}}

'''[[Claude Monet]]''' painted a [[Serial imagery|series]] of oil paintings of the [[Palace of Westminster]], home of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], in the fall of 1899 and the early months of 1900 and 1901 during stays in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/56.135.6|title=''Claude Monet: The Houses of Parliament (Effect of Fog)'' (56.135.6) In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. (December 2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the series' paintings share the same viewpoint from Monet's window or a terrace at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] overlooking the [[Thames]] and the approximate canvas size of 81&amp;nbsp;cm × 92&amp;nbsp;cm (32 in × 36 3/8 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/parliament/|title=Monet, Claude: Houses of Parliament, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/09/science.arts|title='Hospital view. Experts decipher where Monet was standing', James Randerson, Wednesday 9 August 2006, Guardian Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are, however, painted during different times of the day and weather conditions.

By the time of the ''Houses of Parliament'' series, Monet had abandoned his earlier practice of completing a painting on the spot in front of the motif. He carried on refining the images back in France and sent to London for photographs to help in this. This caused some adverse reaction, but Monet's reply was that his means of creating a work was his own business and it was up to the viewer to judge the final result.

==Public display==

In 2018, the [[Tate Britain]] in [[Central London|London]] exhibited six paintings of the series, together in a single room, for the duration of a temporary exhibition titled ''Impressionists in London, French artists in exile (1870-1904)'', devoted to the temporary exile of French and [[impressionist]] artists in London during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. This was a rare occurrence because no museum owns or exhibits more than two in a permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Brown | first=Mark | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/18/monet-uk-parliament-paintings-feature-impressionism-tate-britain-exhibition | title=Monet's UK parliament paintings to feature in Tate Britain exhibition  | website=The Guardian | date=18 July 2017 | accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sooke | first=Alastair | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/not-impressionistic-beautiful-impressionists-londontate-britain/ | title=Not very impressionistic, but beautiful all the same - Impressionists in London Tate Britain, review  | website=The Telegraph | date=30 October 2017 | accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Huntington Theatre Company''' is Boston’s leading professional theatre and the recipient of the 2013 Regional Theatre Tony Award. Under the direction of Artistic Director Peter DuBois and Managing Director Michael Maso and in residence at [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name="AboutHuntington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/about/ |title=About Us &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Huntingtontheatre.org |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Huntington was founded in 1982 by Boston University under President John Silber and Vice President Gerald Gross, and was separately incorporated as an independent non-profit in 1986. Its two prior artistic leaders were Peter Altman (1982 – 2000) and Nicholas Martin (2000 – 2008). Michael Maso has led the Huntington’s administrative and financial operations since 1982 as the Managing Director, producing more than 180 plays in partnership with three artistic directors and leading the Huntington’s ten-year drive to build the Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts, which opened in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/artists/Michael-Maso/ |title=Michael Maso &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Huntingtontheatre.org |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, as a result of Boston University's decision to sell the BU Theatre on Huntington Avenue, the Huntington Theatre Company and Boston University dissolved their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/artery/2015/10/07/boston-univeristy-selling-theater|title=After 33 Years, BU And Huntington Theatre Company Are Cutting Ties|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new owners of the BU Theatre Complex,  QMG Huntington LLC, have proposed the creation of a new condo tower, while also allowing the Huntington to lease the renovated theatre space for $1 per year for the next 99 years. Construction is projected to be completed in late 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater/dance/2017/06/26/huntington-ave-tower-and-theater-plans-are-revealed/IigoaYlOaDibKyMfQ7r6dO/story.html|title=Huntington Ave. tower and theater plans are revealed - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts===

The Huntington Theatre Company built and operates the Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts, located at 527 Tremont Street in Boston's Historic South End, which provides facilities and audience services at subsidized rates to small and mid-sized theatre companies.It houses the 360 seat Virginia Wimberly Theatre, the Nancy and Edward Roberts Studio Theatre, Carol G. Deane Hall, and Hall A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412050435/http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/about/pavilion/ |title=Calderwood Pavilion at the BCA &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Huntington also operates BostonTheatreScene.com where tickets are sold for productions at the [[Boston University]] Theatre, the BCA Theatres on the Plaza, and Calderwood Pavilion at the BCA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostontheatrescene.com/venues/ Venues | BostonTheatreScene.com website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124064219/http://www.bostontheatrescene.com/venues/ |date=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable productions ==

The Huntington has transferred 16 productions to New York, including two in 2012: the Broadway premiere of Lydia R. Diamond’s ''Stick Fly'' and the Roundabout Theatre Company production of Stephen Karam’s ''Sons of the Prophet'', named a 2012 Pulitzer Prize finalist. The Huntington champions new play development and the local theatre community through its operation of the Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts, which the Huntington built in 2004.&lt;ref name="AboutHuntington" /&gt;

August Wilson had a unique relationship with the Huntington, as eight of his plays were produced here before they went on to New York (7 to Broadway, and one Off Broadway). The Huntington's special relationship with August Wilson and his work began in 1986 with a production of ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'', Wilson's third play. For 25 years, the Huntington served as an artistic home to Wilson, developing and premiering seven of the ten plays of his Century Cycle during his life and producing two after his death. In 2012, the Huntington completed the cycle with ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/20130704024109/http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/news/archive/2011-2012/2011/Huntington-completes-Pulitzer-Prize-and-Tony-Award-winner-August-Wilsons-Century-Cycle-/ |title=Huntington completes Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winner August Wilson's Century Cycle &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Archive.is |date= |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010-2011 season, the Huntington featured "The Shirley, VT Plays" Festival, with three plays written by [[Annie Baker]] being put on at the same time in three different theatres; ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' (Huntington), ''[[Body Awareness]]'' (SpeakEasy), and ''Aliens'' (Company One).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasystage.com/content.php?section=showpage&amp;page=awareness ]{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The Huntington teamed up with Mary Zimmerman to produce a knockout production of ''Candide.'' Zimmerman returned in the 2013-2014 season to direct the world premiere adaptation of ''The Jungle Book'' in association with Chicago's Goodman Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528203626/http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/2013-2014/Jungle-Book/ |title=The Jungle Book &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New work ==
The Huntington has produced more than 100 New England, American, or world premieres to date.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Huntington Playwriting Fellows (HPF)===

Since 2003, the HPF program has invited writers to participate in two-year residencies, during which playwrights receive a modest honorarium, join in a biweekly writers’ collective with artistic staff, attend Huntington productions and events, and are eligible for readings and support through the Breaking Ground Festival and the Huntington's Summer Workshop Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://howlround.com/the-huntington-playwriting-fellows-lisa-timmel-local-playwrights-and-radical-hospitality|title=The Huntington Playwriting Fellows: Lisa Timmel, Local Playwrights, and Radical Hospitality|work=HowlRound|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of the program is creating relationships with writers at all stages of their careers, from emerging talent to established professionals.

'''Irene Krugman''' (1925–15 April 1982)&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Irene Krugman Dead; Environmental Artist|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 April 1982|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/17/obituaries/irene-krugman-dead-environmental-artist.html|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] artist, known for creating [[installation art|installations]], using a limited number of simplified forms that are repeated on different scales.&lt;ref name=Alloway&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alloway|first=Lawrence|title=Art|journal=The Nation|date=22 April 1978|pages=485–486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman was born in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=HellerHeller&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Heller|editor1-first=Jules|editor2-last=Heller|editor2-first=Nancy G.|title=North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYxmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11|publisher=Routledge|date=1995|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], [[New York University]], and the [[New School for Social Research]] with [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]].&lt;ref name=HellerHeller/&gt; She exhibited widely, in group and solo shows, and her work is owned by the [[Newark Museum]], the [[New Jersey State Museum]], [[Michigan State University]], [[University of Notre Dame]], and [[Rowan University|Rowan University Art Gallery]], among others.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=HellerHeller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://sites.rowan.edu/artgallery/_docs/groundbreaking_catalog.pdf|title=Groundbreaking: The Women of the Sylvia Sleigh Collection|location=Glassboro, NJ|publisher=Rowan University Art Gallery|date=2011|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work was praised in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by [[Grace Glueck]], who noted that Krugman's installation at the [[City University of New York]] in 1977 consisted of a "[[mastaba]]-shape" and "mirror-lined boxes of unfinished wood that carry within themselves identical smaller structures reflected by the mirrors," which she called "an imaginative idea, imaginatively executed."&lt;ref name=Glueck&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Irene Krugman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 February 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to her solo exhibition at [[OK Harris Gallery]] in 1978, a reviewer in ''[[Arts Magazine]]'' characterized Krugman's work as "a model for our perception of the larger world which is also self-reflexive, limited, in other words, by our capacity to measure and know it."&lt;ref name=Malen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malen|first=Lenore|title=Irene Krugman|journal=Arts Magazine|date=April 1978|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman and her husband, Leonard (1919-1989), lived in [[Morristown, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Their son, Michael Krugman (1951–2016), was a practitioner of [[self-healing]] and developed the Sounder Sleep System, a treatment for people suffering from [[insomnia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Krugman (1951-2016)|url=https://www.feldenkrais-institute.com/team/michael-krugman|website=Instituto Feldenkrais|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irene Krugman died of [[cancer]], aged 56.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

[[File:Amersfoort Koppelpoort 04.jpg|thumb|300px|Southeastern facade]]
The '''Koppelpoort''' is a [[medieval]] [[City gate|gate]] in the Dutch city of [[Amersfoort]], [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Completed around 1425, it combines land and water-gates, and is part of the second city wall of Amersfoort, which was constructed between 1380 and 1450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gildeamersfoort.nl/cmsms/rondleidingen-2/rondleidingen-op-aanvraag/bezoek-en-rondleiding-unieke-monumenten/koppelpoort |title=Koppelpoort |language=Dutch |publisher=Gilde Amersfoort |date= |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The gate was built between 1380 and 1425 as part of the second city wall. The whole wall was completed around 1450. The gate was attacked in 1427 during the siege of the city. This attack was repelled.

The gate was opened and closed every day by the appointed ''raddraaiers'', "wheel-turners". A minimum of twelve wheel-turners were collected morning and evening by several guards. It was an extremely dangerous task; if they did not begin walking simultaneously, then one could fall, dragging the rest along with often fatal results. Before the gate could come down, it had to be raised, to pull out the iron pins that held it in place. Only then could it come down. While the gate was going down, walking in the wheel grew ever easier and faster, and many people stumbled and broke their limbs. The koppelpoort was also never breached.

The Koppelpoort was given its current appearance during the restoration by [[Pierre Cuypers]] in 1885 and 1886. Among other things, Cuypers removed a step between the two gates and replaced it with a slope.

From 1969 to 1993 a puppet theater was situated in the gate.

The latest restoration was completed in 1996. It was carried out very cautiously, and with respect for the old building materials. For this the town of Amersfoort received the [[Europa Nostra]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2477871/1999/01/29/Gerestaureerde-Koppelpoort-beloond-met-Europa-Nostra-prijs.dhtml |title=Gerestaureerde Koppelpoort beloond met Europa Nostra-prijs |language=Dutch |publisher=''[[Trouw]]'' |date=29 January 1999 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kubachi ware''' is the name given to a style of [[Persian pottery]]. Though it takes its name from the town of [[Kubachi (urban-type settlement)|Kubachi]] in [[Dagestan]], modern-day [[Russia]], scholars believe that Kubachi ware pieces were created during the [[Safavid]] Period in the northwestern part of what is now Iran.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golombek|first1=Lisa|title=Persian Pottery in the First Global Age: The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries|date=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004260927|pages=168–81|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-V2NAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=golombek+kubachi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DZqOtXxQTv&amp;sig=l13RWTnlVmhuwpeq0YVFNiSKIBo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMI4uzv_d7dxgIVQoosCh07uw3J#v=onepage&amp;q=golombek%20kubachi&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nishapur]], [[Tabriz]], [[Mashhad]], and [[Isfahan]] have all been put forth as possible places of origin for Kubachi ware.

Kubachi ware is made of [[Fritware|stonepaste]] (also known as fritware). The decoration varies; some have turquoise glazes with black figures, perhaps in imitation of Chinese [[celadon]]. Others are blue on white, similar to [[Chinese ceramics|Ming porcelain]].&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O85923/dish-unknown/|website=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue and white Ming porcelain was widely copied in Persia. The subject matter of Kubachi pieces includes humans, plants, and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holt|first1=PM|last2=Lambton|first2=Ann KS|last3=Lewis|first3=Bernard|title=The Cambridge History of Islam|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521291380|pages=729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the pottery, especially the use of [[polychrome]], reveals [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] influence, imitating the [[Iznik pottery|ceramics of Iznik]].&lt;ref name="Christie's"&gt;{{cite web|title=A SAFAVID BLUE AND WHITE "KUBACHI" POTTERY DISH|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/a-safavid-blue-and-white-kubachi-pottery-5671753-details.aspx|website=Christie's|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane 1939"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=Arthur|title=The So-Called "Kubachi" Wares of Persia|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|date=1939|volume=75|issue=439|pages=156–7, 160–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is unsurprising given that Tabriz, one of the manufacturing centers of Kubachi ware, was located along trade routes with the Ottomans and was invaded by them several times.

==Origin of name==
The town of Kubachi, located in the [[Caucasus]], was the site of a large collection of 15th- and 16th-century [[pottery]]. Starting in the 1870s, many of these ceramic pieces were bought by collectors from Europe and North America and later donated to large museums.&lt;ref name="Later Persian Pottery on Encyclopædia Britannica'"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savage|first1=George|title=Later Persian Pottery|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/pottery/Later-Persian#ref599991|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the town has stuck with this group of ceramics despite the fact that they were not manufactured in Kubachi.

==Place of origin== 
The earliest outside visitors to Kubachi assumed the works to be made locally, but this view was quickly discredited.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt; Several competing theories about their place of origin have since been put forth; it has been suggested that the works are actually the products of multiple cities' workshops.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt;

Petrofabric analysis suggests that Tabriz may have been the place of production for many works of Kubachi ware.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"/&gt; Black-and-turquoise Kubachi ware has been associated with Nishapur via petrofabric analysis.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt; Still other works have been identified with Masshad via inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt; The style of the figures on some of the works suggests a link with Isfahan.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt;

'''Lena Söderberg''', born '''Sjööblom''' (born 31 March 1951) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] model who appeared as a [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] in the November 1972 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date = November 1972 |title = Playmate of the Month |journal = Playboy Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Lenna Sjööblom'''.

A head and shoulder section of her centerfold, this cropped section itself known as [[Lenna]], is often used to test algorithms in [[digital image processing]].&lt;ref name=JH&gt;Jamie Hutchison, [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/pcs_mirror/may_june01.pdf "Culture, Communication, and an Information Age Madonna"], ''IEEE Professional Communication Society Newsletter'' Vol. 45, No. 3, May/June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a guest at the 50th annual Conference of the [[Society for Imaging Science and Technology]] in 1997, where she gave a presentation about herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml Imaging Experts Meet Lenna in Person].&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the ubiquity of her ''Playboy'' photo scan, she has been called the "first lady of the internet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19260550 BBC News].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cs.cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/playboy_backups/lena.html |title=Playboy Newsdesk - Lena |newspaper=Cs.cmu.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was given to her by Jeff Seideman in a press release he issued announcing her appearance at the 50th annual IS&amp;T Conference.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

According to [[Producers Guild of America]] (PGA) guidelines, the Line Producer is the individual who reports directly to the individual(s) receiving "Produced By" credit on the theatrical motion picture and is the single individual who has the primary responsibility for the logistics of the production, from pre-production through completion of production; all Department Heads report to the Line Producer.&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Producer's Code of Credits|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?coc_tmp_2|publisher=Producers Guild of America|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line producer functions like a [[chief operations officer]] in running the production company. During pre-production, responsibilities include supervising the assembly of the shooting company, recruitment of key personnel and services, and production organization for how to shoot the script and transform it into a movie.  The line producer plans start dates for everyone and everything, and monitors the budget in the lead up to picture. Film production generally follows a rigorous schedule. The line producer facilitates casting, [[location scouting]], set building and decorating, offices and stages, wardrobe, props, stunts, physical and visual effects, camera, lighting, rigging, transportation, cast, crew and union relations, travel, cast and crew accommodation, contracting of legal permissions and agreements, safety and risk management, prep and shooting schedule. In short, the line producer oversees the joint planning, negotiations, implementation and accounting for production.

In the studio system, the line producer reports to the studio and typically liaises with key executives of production divisions inside the studio such as physical production, legal, labor relations, insurance, and finance. The line producer supports the [[Director (film)|director]]'s vision and direct influence on the creative expression or narrative of the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=A line producer is basically there to make the director's vision achievable.|url=http://www.creativeskillset.org/film/stories/development/article_3400_1.asp|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it could be argued that, through a line producer's ability to influence aspects of the film, like allocation of resources to certain departments, they can change important aspects of the film that have creative consequences, e.g., production value. For example, they can affect the project's look by influencing the choice of [[filming location]]s.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt; While the director is in charge of all purely artistic decisions, the line producer helps to substantiate the director's creative ideas by taking care of [[logistics]] and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Runs the more practical aspects of the production such as logistics and personnel, as opposed to the creative content|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/employment/television/producer.html|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[pre-production]] through [[principal photography]], the line producer oversees the [[production budget]] and physical needs of the shoot.  By the first day of production, several versions of the budget have usually been drafted. A finalized or "locked" budget is the basis for the production to move forward. A key objective of a line producer is to respect this "locked" budget and deliver in time.

While in production, the line producer oversees the execution of many decisions that must be made to deliver each day's shoot.  The administrative aspects, especially those that have any financial impact, are all crucial areas of the line producer's work.  These areas include but are not limited to negotiating compensation (usually during pre-production) of crew members (both for union and non-union productions) and resolving daily production issues (in conjunction with the [[assistant director|first assistant director]] and possibly the [[unit production manager]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A line producer is the person who is in charge of hiring all of the below-the-line production crew such as camera crews, lighting crews and catering staffs.|url=http://filmtvcareers.about.com/od/basics/p/CP_Line_Prod.htm|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, they provide demanded equipment. If required, they handle unanticipated scheduling changes and serve "as a liaison between the crew and the producer."&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;

==Becoming a line producer==
Line producers usually come from the ranks of assistant directors and unit production managers, giving them a strong background in the logistics of [[filmmaking]] and [[time management]]. It is common for them to continue to perform in one of those roles on projects they line produce. They do not necessarily attend a [[film school]].&lt;ref name="Film Connection Film Institute"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="127885">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of general music articles in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia''}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}
The music articles in the [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey Sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey Jr]] (1791–1851).The ''Cyclopædia'' was illustrated using 53 plates as well as a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

The general musical articles list all those that are not biographical, which form a separate list. They were written mostly by Charles Burney. Others on the scientific basis of music were by John Farey Sr, and technical descriptions of some musical instruments were given by his son.

It had been Burney's intention to write a ''Dictionary of Music'', but for various reasons he never did so.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger, "Dr Burney's 'Dictionary of Music" ',''Musicology Australia'', vol. 5, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;159–171, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 when he was aged 75 he was offered the chance of writing music articles in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'', and this occupied him to around 1805 or '06. His fee was £1000. Burney's brief was to 'include definitions in all the languages of Europe where Music has been much cultivated, with its history, biography, Criticism and discussions'&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Lonsdale, Roger, ''Dr Charles Burney: a Literary Biography'', OUP 1965, pp 412&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles contain an enormous amount of musical information, much of which being augmented versions of what he had already published in his earlier writings &lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer, Frank]], ed. Charles Burney, ''A General History of Music'', 2 vol. 1935, rep 1957 [Originally published in 4 volumes, 1776–1789]; and Scholes, P. A., ''Dr Burney's Musical Tours in Europe'', 2 vol, OUP 1959, [France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773]; as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he took the opportunity to add new topics covering the years of the last quarter of the eighteenth century and much of the first decade of the nineteenth, in particular the London musical scene. In all he wrote 996 general articles. While the majority of the articles have some length, a good proportion are brief (3 or 4 lines or fewer), dictionary definitions, or cross references. Many of the former are terms derived from French and Italian. The encyclopaedic-length articles (as distinct from the dictionary-length articles) are usually longer than Burney's earlier published writings on the same topic.

Dr [[Percy Scholes]] cites a statement by Dr Rees from Preface to the ''Cyclopaedia'' that he had 'constantly interpolated his own additions to the articles of his specialists'. and quotes a passage from the article about Dance (Vol 11) describing 'in our own memory', Welsh church-goers being played out of church by a fiddle.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, P. A.,''The Puritans and Early Music in England and New England'', OUP, 1934, p77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Farey, sr]] was by profession a geologist, but was greatly interested music.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Croy Kassler, ''The Science of Music in Britain, 1714–1830'', Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London, 1979, vol 1, pp 329–343&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved with the Choral Fund,&lt;ref&gt;Established in 1791 by [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] to assist poor musicians. Farey was the first Secretary and Librarian.&lt;/ref&gt; the Cecilian Society&lt;ref&gt;A group founded in 1785 which sang mainly oratorios. The newspapers of the period carried frequent advertisements of their performances.&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[Surrey Chapel|Surrey Chapel Society]], and also sang in oratorios in Drury Lane Theatre. He was particularly interested in the [[mathematics of music]] and [[musical temperament|temperament]], and wrote all the 215 scientific articles on these topics for Rees. Farey's investigations of [[musical temperament|temperament]] involved discussing (and criticising) the various schemes in use then. He described them in a series of letters to the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', and the ''[[Monthly Magazine]]'' as well as the ''[[American Journal of Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Kassler, above for details of these.&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed 25 articles to the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]'' on this topic .&lt;ref&gt;For a list of the latter see the bibliography appended to Trever D. Ford and [[Hugh S. Torrens]] introduction ('John Farey (1766–1826) an unrecognised polymath') to the 1989 reprinting of the first volume of John Farey's ''General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Farey, jr]] was a prolific contributor to Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'', not only as a writer but also as an artist of many of the plates.&lt;ref&gt;Woolrich, A. P., "John Farey, Jr., technical author and draughtsman: his contribution to Rees's ''Cyclopædia''". ''Industrial Archaeology Review'', 20, (1998), 49–68 [http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm AIA Abstracts 1998. ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207111214/http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm |date=7 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the four articles he wrote, he drew plates for two illustrating [[John Isaac Hawkins]]'s ''Finger-keyed Viol'', and two different patterns of pipe organ. The plates were keyed to the texts of the articles, and for this reason it was necessary for Farey to have produced both, since writing the texts describing the plates would have required technical knowledge which Burney would not have possessed.

'''Alphabetisation of articles:'''&lt;br&gt;
The work followed the common practice of conflating the letters I and J and U and V into single sequences. The topics included in this list therefore follow the sequence they appear in the original volumes.

'''Annotations:'''&lt;br&gt;
The articles are annotated to [[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer]]'s edition of Burney's ''History'' (1935) and [[Percy Scholes|Scholes]]'s edition of Burney's travels, ''Travels'' (1959). Where a page reference is given the text can be found there. Where a book is cited, but with no page, index entries were found, and Burney is presumed to have written his article using the information there. Where there is no annotation, the article must be unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22072">{{Muhammad}}

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[Christendom]] largely viewed [[Islam]] as a [[list of Christian heresies|Christological heresy]] and [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] as a [[false prophet]]. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Islam was more typically grouped with [[Paganism|heathenism]], and [[Muhammad]] was viewed as inspired by the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]]. A more relaxed or benign view of Islam only developed in the modern period, after the Islamic empires ceased to be an acute military threat to Europe.  See [[Orientalism]].

The earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. With the [[Crusades]] of the [[High Middle Ages]], and the wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Late Middle Ages]], the Christian reception of Muhammad became more [[polemic]]al, moving from the classification as a heretic to depiction of Muhammad as a servant of [[Satan]] or as the [[Antichrist]], who will be suffering tortures in [[Christian views on hell|Hell]].

== Overview ==
{{Main|Criticism of Muhammad#Christian criticism|Muhammad in the Bible#Muhammad as Antichrist}}
In contrast to the views of [[Muhammad in Islam]], the Christian image stayed highly negative for over a millennium.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"Muhammad." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007.

Montgomery]] | title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1974 | isbn=0-19-881078-4}} New Edition, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Middle Ages ===
The earliest written Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. In the anti-Jewish polemic the ''[[Teaching of Jacob]]'', a dialogue between a recent Christian convert and several [[Jews]], one participant writes that his brother "wrote to [him] saying that a deceiving prophet has appeared amidst the [[Saracen]]s". Another participant in the ''Doctrina'' replies about Muhammad: "He is deceiving. For do prophets come with sword and [[chariot]]?, …[Y]ou will discover nothing true from the said prophet except human bloodshed".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Emil Kaegi, Jr., "Initial Byzantine Reactions to the Arab Conquest", ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', Vol. 38, No. 2 (June , 1969), p. 139–149, p. 139–142, quoting from ''Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati'' 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Though Muhammad is never called by his name,&lt;ref&gt;''Mahomet'', among other [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] forms (such as [[Mahound]]), were popular for rendering of the Arabic name Muhammad, borne by the founder of the religion of Islam (died 633). In literary use now superseded by the more correct form Mohammed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[New English Dictionary on Historical Principles]]'', Volume 6. By [[Philological Society|Philological Society (Great Britain)]]. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=iakjAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA38 38]&lt;/ref&gt; there seems to have been knowledge of his existence. It also appears that both [[Judaism's views on Muhammad|Jews]] and Christians viewed him in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;Kaegi p. 139–149, p. 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary sources, such as the writings of [[Sophronius of Jerusalem]], show there was no knowledge of the Saracens having their own prophet or faith, and only remark that the Saracen attacks must be a punishment for Christian [[sin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kaegi p. 139–149, p. 139–141,&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of Muhammad was available in [[Christendom]] from after the early expansion of his religion&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Stubbe]] ''An account of the rise and progress of Mahometanism'' Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG1AAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA211 211]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought''. Edited by Adrian Hastings, Alistair Mason, Hugh Pyper. Pg 330.&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, the translation of a polemical work by [[John of Damascus]], who used the phrase "[[false prophet]] in "Heresies in Epitome: How They Began and Whence They Drew Their Origin.".&lt;ref&gt;http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: "The Fountain of Wisdom" (''pege gnoseos''), part II: "Concerning Heresy" (''peri aipeseon'')&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Christian knowledge of Muhammad's life "was nearly always used abusively".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Another influential source was the [[Epistolae Saraceni]] or the “Letters of a Saracen” written by an Oriental Christian and translated into Latin from Arabic.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; From the 9th century onwards, highly negative biographies of Muhammad were written in Latin,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; such as the one by [[Álvaro of Córdoba (Mozarab)|Álvaro of Córdoba ]] proclaiming him the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt;  Christendom also gained some knowledge of Muhammad through the [[Mozarabs]] of Spain, such as the 9th-century [[Eulogius of Córdoba]],&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; who was one of the [[Martyrs of Córdoba]].

=== High Middle Ages ===
{{see|Vita Mahumeti}}
[[File:Mohammed2.jpg|Mohammed and the Murdered Monk|thumb|left|250px|"Mohammed and the Murdered Monk", 1508 engraving by [[Lucas van Leyden]] – an incident unattested in Islamic accounts of the Prophet's life]]
In the 11th century [[Petrus Alphonsi]], a Jew who converted to Christianity, was another Mozarab source of information on Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Later during the 12th century [[Peter the Venerable]], who saw Muhammad as the precursor to the Antichrist and the successor of [[Arius]],&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt; ordered the translation of the [[Quran]] into Latin (''[[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete]]'') and the collection of information on Muhammad so that Islamic teachings could be refuted by Christian scholars.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

During the 13th century European biographers completed their work on the life of Muhammad in a series of works by scholars such as [[Peter Pascual]], [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]], and [[Ramon Llull]]&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; in which Muhammad was depicted as an Antichrist while [[Islam]] was shown to be a Christian [[heresy]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; The fact that Muhammad was unlettered, that he married a wealthy widow, that in his later life he had several wives, that he was involved in several wars, and that he died like an ordinary person in contrast to the Christian belief in the supernatural end of [[Jesus]]' earthly life were all arguments used to discredit Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

Medieval scholars and churchmen held that Islam was the work of Muhammad who in turn was inspired by Satan. [[Kenneth Setton]] wrote that Muhammad was frequently calumniated and made a subject of legends taught by preachers as fact.&lt;ref name="meyer1"&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton (July 1, 1992). "[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&amp;id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]". Diane Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87169-201-5}}. pg 1–5&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in order to show that Muhammad was the anti-Christ, it was asserted that Muhammad died not in the year 632 but in the year 666 – the [[number of the beast]] – in another variation on the theme the number "666" was also used to represent the period of time Muslims would hold sway of the land.&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt; A verbal expression of Christian contempt for Islam was expressed in turning his name from Muhammad to [[Mahound]], the "devil incarnate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Reeves, Minou | title=Muhammad in Europe: A Thousand Years of Western Myth-Making | year=2003 | publisher=NYU Press | isbn=978-0-8147-7564-6}}, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Others usually confirmed to pious Christians that Muhammad had come to a bad end.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; According to one version after falling into a drunken stupor he had been eaten by a herd of swine, and this was ascribed as the reason why Muslims proscribed consumption of alcohol and pork.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; In another account of the alcohol ban, Muhammad learns about the Bible from a Jew and a heretical [[Arianism|Arian]] monk. Muhammad and the monk get drunk and fall asleep. The Jew kills the monk with Muhammad's sword. He then blames Muhammad, who, believing he has committed the crime in a drunken rage, bans alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Bushkovich, Paul, "Orthodoxy and Islam in Russia", Steindorff, L. (ed) ''Religion und Integration im Moskauer Russland: Konzepte und Praktiken, Potentiale und Grenzen 14.-17. Jahrhundert'', Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2010, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Leggenda di Maometto'' is another example of such a story. In this version, as a child Muhammad was taught the black arts by a heretical Christian villain who escaped imprisonment by the [[Christian Church]] by fleeing to the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; as an adult he set up a false religion by selectively choosing and perverting texts from the [[Bible]] to create Islam. It also ascribed the Muslim holiday of Friday "dies Veneris" (day of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]), as against the Jewish (Saturday) and the Christian (Sunday), to his followers' depravity as reflected in their multiplicity of wives.&lt;ref name="meyer1"/&gt; A highly negative depiction of Muhammad as a heretic, false prophet, renegade cardinal or founder of a violent religion also found its way into many other works of European literature, such as the [[chansons de geste]], [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', and [[John Lydgate]]'s ''The Fall of the Princes''.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
[[File:Dante and Virgil Meet Muhammad and His Son-in-law, Ali in Hell.jpg|thumb|right|Muhammad pulling his chest open in [[William Blake]]'s illustration of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s "[[Divine Comedy]]"]]

The thirteenth century ''[[Golden Legend]]'', a best-seller in its day containing a collection of hagiographies, describes "Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)" as "a false prophet and sorcerer", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his "visions" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] monk named Sergius.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=GNWZgIL5ZCoC&amp;pg=PA753&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Divine Comedy====
In  [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'',  Muhammad is in the ninth ditch of [[Malebolge]], the eighth realm, designed for those who have caused schism; specifically, he was placed among the Sowers of Religious Discord.  Muhammad is portrayed as split in half, with his entrails hanging out, representing his status as a [[heresiarch]] (Canto 28):
:No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove--&gt; below.
:His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove --&gt; whatever gets conveyed down the gullet.
:As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, ''"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks [[Ali]], his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seth Zimmerman|title=The Inferno of Dante Alighieri |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3hWDEjN7JcC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-28090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohameddemons2.jpg|thumb|right|Mohammed tortured in Hell from fresco in [[San Petronio Basilica]]]]
This scene is frequently shown in illustrations of the ''Divine Comedy''. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century [[fresco]] ''[[Last Judgment]]'' by Giovanni da Modena and drawing on Dante, in the [[San Petronio Basilica]] in [[Bologna]],&lt;ref name=fresco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,742914,00.html|title=Al-Qaida plot to blow up Bologna church fresco|date=2002-06-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Philip Willan}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in artwork by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[William Blake]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/11/MNGRCH6UQK1.DTL|title=What's behind Muslim cartoon outrage|date=2006-02-11|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ayesha Akram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common allegation laid against Muhammad was that he was an impostor who, in order to satisfy his ambition and his lust, propagated religious teachings that he knew to be false.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Montgomery, ''Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman.'' Oxford University Press, 1961. From p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural critic]] and author [[Edward Said]] wrote in ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' regarding Dante's depiction of Muhammad:
{{quote|Empirical data about the Orient […] count for very little [i.e., in Dante's work]; what matters and is decisive is […] by no means confined to the professional scholar, but rather the common possession of all who have thought about the Orient in the West […]. What […] Dante tried to do in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', is […] to characterize the Orient as alien and to incorporate it schematically on a theatrical stage whose audience, manager, and actors are […] only for Europe. Hence the vacillation between the familiar and the alien; Mohammed is always the imposter (familiar, because he pretends to be like the Jesus we know) and always the Oriental (alien, because although he is in some ways "like" Jesus, he is after all not like him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Said|title=Orientalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvJ3YwOkZAYC|year=1979|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-394-74067-6|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A more positive interpretation appears in the 13th-century ''Estoire del Saint Grail'', the first book in the vast [[Matter of Britain]], the [[Lancelot-Grail]]. In describing the travels of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], keeper of the [[Holy Grail]], the author says that most residents of the Middle East were pagans until the coming of Muhammad, who is shown as a true [[prophet]] sent by God to bring Christianity to the region. This mission however failed when Muhammad's pride caused him to alter God's wishes, thereby deceiving his followers. Nevertheless, Muhammad's religion is portrayed as being greatly superior to paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, Norris J. (Ed.) (December 1, 1992).

====Later presentations====
The depiction of Islam in the ''Travels of Sir [[John Mandeville]]'' is also relatively positive, though with many inaccurate and mythical features. It is said that Muslims are easily converted to Christianity because their beliefs are already so similar in many ways, and that they believe that only the Christian revelation will last until the end of the world. The moral behaviour of Muslims at the time is shown as superior to that of Christians, and as a standing reproach to Christian society.&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;[http://www.romanization.com/books/mandeville/chap15.html The Travels of Sir John Mandeville], CHAPTER XV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of Muhammad in the form of [[picaresque novel]]  began to appear from the 13th century onward, such as in Alexandre du Pont's ''Roman de Mahom'', the translation of the Mi'raj, the ''Escala de Mahoma'' (“The Ladder of Muhammad”) by the court physician of Alfonso X of Castile and León and his son.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

Medieval European literature often referred to Muslims as "[[infidel]]s" or "pagans", in sobriquets such as the ''paynim foe''. These depictions such as those in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' represent Muslims worshiping Muhammad (spelt e.g. 'Mahom' and 'Mahumet') as a god, and depict them worshiping various deities in the form of "[[cult image|idols]]", ranging from [[Abaddon|Apollyon]] to [[Lucifer]], but ascribing to them a chief deity known as "[[Termagant]]".&lt;ref name="meyer2"&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton (July 1, 1992). "[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&amp;id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]". Diane Publishing. {{ISBN|0-87169-201-5}}. pg 4-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'', "[http://www.bartleby.com/81/16352.html Termagant]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, in medieval romances such as the French Arthurian cycle, pagans such as the ancient Britons or the inhabitants of "Sarras" before the conversion of King Evelake, who presumably lived well before the birth of Muhammad, are often described as worshipping the same array of gods and as identical to the imagined (Termagant-worshipping) Muslims in every respect. In the same vein, the definition of "[[Saracen]]" in [[Raymond of Penyafort]]'s ''Summa de Poenitentia'' starts by describing the Muslims but ends by including every person who is neither a Christian nor a Jew.

When the [[Knights Templar]] were being tried for [[heresy]] reference was often made to their worship of a demon [[Baphomet]], which was notable by implication for its similarity to the common rendition of Muhammad's name used by Christian writers of the time, Mahomet.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahomet'' still is the Polish and French word for the English "Muhammad".&lt;/ref&gt; All these and other variations on the theme were all set in the "temper of the times" of what was seen as a Muslim-Christian conflict as Medieval Europe was building a concept of "the great enemy" in the wake of the quickfire success of the [[early Muslim conquests]] shortly after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], as well as the lack of real information in the West of the mysterious East.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt;

Muhammad is characterized as "''pseudo-prophet''" in Byzantine and post-Byzantine religious and historic texts, as for example by [[Niketas Choniates]] (12th-13th c.).&lt;ref name="Mai1840"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mai|first=Angelo|authorlink=Angelo Mai|title=Spicilegium romanum ...: Patrum ecclesiasticorum Serapionis, Ioh.

'''''Megaville''''' is an [[independent film|independent]]/[[low-budget film|low-budget]] [[direct-to-video]] 1990 [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] film, starring [[Billy Zane]] in his first lead role. ''Megaville'' is a [[neo-noir]] [[psychological thriller]] which utilizes elements of science fiction such as [[cyberpunk]] and [[existentialism]].

==Plot==
National boundaries have been broken, two giant super-states remain—a bleak, decaying Hemisphere, and the sprawling media state Megaville. Travel between the states is restricted. The "CKS" governs daily life in the Hemisphere. All forms of media are illegal here.

Raymond Palinov, an unassuming captain of the media police finds himself drawn to a spaghetti western and cannot pull away from it during a media raid. Palinov is ostracized by his superior for the incident. After nearly losing his job, Palinov begins to exhibit strange character traits. During a rally in which outlawed media recordings are shown to the media police as examples of contraband, Palinov laughs out loud at a comedy clip. Palinov then appears to have a complete mental breakdown and loses consciousness. Whereas most agents would have been terminated following such an incident, Palinov is spared. Palinov is found to be exhibiting unusual brain activity and is sent for an examination. Palinov explains to Dr. Vogel that he has been having bizarre flashbacks and seeing memories in dreams which are not his own. Dr. Vogel tells Palinov he believes the strange behavior is due to years of exposure to media "filth" and initiates a procedure which will remove the unexplained brain activity and restore Palinov's personality in its entirety. The procedure doesn't work and Palinov's mental episodes become steadily worse.

Palinov is contacted by Mr. Duprell, the director of the CKS, with an infiltration assignment. The Hemisphere war against media is about to intensify with news of the introduction of "Dream-A-Life" (DAL) a hallucination-inducing consumer product. People in Megaville could start new lives in their own fantasy world of choice. The government of Megaville has deemed DAL legal and its use has become prevalent with the help of a mysterious figure in the Megaville underworld known as Mr. Newman. Duprell explains that Palinov bears a striking physical resemblance to Newman's only known contact in the Hemisphere, Mr. Jensen. Palinov's mission is to assume Jensen's life and infiltrate the criminal underworld of both the Hemisphere and Megaville, discover who Newman is working with, and who Newman's contacts are in the Hemisphere. In order to assist his infiltration, Palinov is implanted with some of Jensen's memories.
As he slips into the role, he soon meets Jensen's almost lover, Christine, a former demolitions expert for the armed forces who went AWOL after being ordered to kill civilians. Christine demands that Jensen take her to Megaville. Christine and Palinov travel to Megaville and meet Newman, who refuses to reveal any information about his operation. Meanwhile, the president of Megaville, outspoken against DAL, is assassinated. Palinov suspects Newman is involved, but the only witness is the president's personal aide, who is now permanently trapped in a DAL induced hallucination.

When Palinov attempts to remove the headset, the aide is shot in broad daylight by Newman. Duprell contacts Palinov through his [[brain implant]], informs him to close the deal with Newman or his mother will die; Duprell does not want to stop DAL, he wants in on the deal. Palinov refuses and Duprell attempts to kill him via the implant. Palinov's mother saves him by destroying Duprell's transmitting device, but is then murdered. However, before she dies she reveals the truth to Palinov; she is not his mother at all, he is actually Jensen the man he thinks he is impersonating, Palinov's mind is the fake. Palinov escapes with Christine, pursued by Megaville's underworld; all except Palinov are killed in a shoot-out.
Duprell has been watching Palinovs mind, which Palinov finally realizes. He uses a DAL device to fake Duprell's activities on a Megaville national broadcast, which Duprell believes to be real. Palinov says all the evidence of the conspiracy is in a briefcase at Christine's apartment. Duprell opens it and detonates the bomb inside. Newman reveals to Palinov that he is Jensen's biological father and claims he wishes they had spent more time together before shooting Palinov. Newman then notices his leg is handcuffed to Palinov and he is now trapped in the desert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5676">The '''National Center for Jewish Film''' is a non-profit motion picture archive, distributor, and resource center. It houses the largest collection of [[Jewish]]-themed film and video outside of [[Israel]].  Its mission is to collect, restore, preserve, catalogue, and exhibit films with artistic and educational value relevant to the Jewish experience, and to disseminate these materials to the widest possible audience.

Founded in 1976, the National Center for Jewish Film (NCJF or the Center) became an independent [[501(c)]](3) non-profit organization in 1981.  The Center is located on the campus of [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

==Collections==

The NCJF archive exclusively owns an estimated 10,000 cans of film (35&amp;nbsp;mm, 16&amp;nbsp;mm, 8&amp;nbsp;mm, super 8) and thousands of master videotapes. This collection of feature films, documentaries, fiction and non-fiction short films, newsreels, home movies, and institutional films includes material dating from 1903 to the present. These films address a wide range of topics, including: the Jewish immigrant experience in America, [[Yiddish theatre]] and cinema, pre–[[World War II]] European Jewry, [[the Holocaust]], [[Judaism]] and the arts and music, relations between Jews and other groups, [[Sephardic]] culture, Israeli history, and Hollywood portrayals of Jewish life.

The Center’s collection includes ethnographic studies of past and present Jewish communities in China, Mexico, Morocco, Australia, Tunisia, Russia, Argentina, Bosnia, India, Romania, Greece, and Egypt, travelogues depicting Jewish life in Poland before World War II, U.S. government World War II newsreels, studies in Israeli history, Holocaust films exploring little-known sites of genocide like [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] and [[Babi Yar]], anti-Jewish propaganda, and Yiddish-American feature films. Individually and collectively, the films distributed by NCJF dispel stereotypes about Jews and educate audiences about the diversity and cultural richness of Jewish life.

==Film preservation==

NCJF's first priority is the [[film preservation|preservation]] and restoration of rare and endangered nitrate and acetate films. NCJF preservation activities began 30 years ago with the rescue of a languishing [[Yiddish language]] film collection. Since that time, NCJF has preserved and restored 36 Yiddish feature films, making them available in 35mm, 16mm, video, and DVD formats.

The Center's other archival and preservations projects include features and documentaries from around the globe; early American silent film comedies and features; rare early Russian films; pre–World War II home movies of [[Yurburg]], [[Horodok, Lviv Oblast|Horodok]], [[Novogrudok]], and [[Berlin]]; travelogues of [[Białystok]], [[Krakow]], [[Warsaw]], [[Vilnius]], and [[Lviv]]; industrial and fundraising films produced by Jewish agencies; early documentary footage of Palestine/Israel. NCJF’s most recent restorations include the Yiddish feature films The Cantor’s Son and The Living Orphan, the preservation of rare home movies documenting the way of life in several small communities of Eastern Europe, Jewish chicken farmers in [[New Jersey]], and merchants in Massachusetts, and film of President [[Harry S.Truman]] addressing the issue of Middle East politics at an [[State of Israel Bonds|Israel Bonds]] dinner in 1956.

NCJF was invited by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] to participate (with nine other institutions) in the millennium film preservation program, "Treasures of American Film Archives." NCJF is a founding member of the Association of Moving Image and a member of the International Film Archives Association and The Council of Archives and Research Libraries in Jewish Studies.

==Other activities==

NCJF’s other activities include film distribution, producing public programs, and providing programming, consultation, and research assistance to approximately 2000 individuals and institutions a year.

The Center’s rare film materials are made available to scholars, curators, journalists, teachers, authors, artists, filmmakers, and the general public, and have been exhibited and screened worldwide. They have been used as the basis for numerous books and articles, and have been included in many museum exhibitions and film productions, including [[The Winds of War]], Imaginary Witness: Hollywood and the Holocaust, Chasing Shadows, The Last Days, The Struma, Hollywoodism, and scores of independent documentaries.

NCJF distributes 350 films, including the productions of over 100 contemporary independent filmmakers. The Center produces and sells videocassettes and DVDs of its titles for both home and educational use and licenses its films for television broadcasts; recently stations include Turner Movie Classics, Jewish Broadcast Network, [[Jewish Broadcasting Service|Shalom TV]], ARTE [France/Germany], SBS [Australia], NOGA [Israel], and Four Films [UK].

NCJF began organizing its own film festival --  [http://www.jewishfilm.org/filmfest/filmfestivals.html JEWISHFILM]—in 1998 at the Edie and [[Lew Wasserman]] Cinematheque at Brandeis University.

'''Paper craft''' is the collection of [[art]] forms employing [[paper]] or [[card stock|card]] as the primary [[artistic medium]] for the creation of three-dimensional objects.  It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded,  stitched, or layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=6 |title=The Complete Photo Guide to Paper Crafts|first=Patrice |last=Boerens |isbn=978-1-58923-468-0 |publisher=Creative Publishing International |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papermaking]] by hand is also an important paper craft. [[Painting]] and [[calligraphy]] though they are commonly applied as decoration are normally considered as separate arts or crafts.

Paper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caribbean-craft.com/|title=Handmade Home Decor {{!}} Paper Mache {{!}} Caribbean Craft|last=Craft|first=Caribbean|website=www.caribbean-craft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the [[education]] of children.  Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals.&lt;ref name="Therapy"&gt;Carol Tubbs, Margaret Drake, ''Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy'', "Paper crafts", (2006), p. 221-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also neater to work with than paints, dyes, and other coloring materials.  Paper crafts may also be used in [[psychotherapy|therapeutic]] settings, providing children with a safe and uncomplicated creative outlet to express feelings.&lt;ref name="Therapy"/&gt;

==Folded paper==
The word "paper" derives from [[papyrus]], the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in [[Egypt]] as far back as the third millennium B.C.&lt;ref name=Skeat&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat, 1935. "Papyrus and its uses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018121945/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html |date=2013-10-18 }} ([[British Museum]] pamphlet).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the earliest known example of "paper folding" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern [[road]] [[map]].&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers.&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; 

The first Japanese origami is dated from the 6th century A.D.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;Lang, Robert James. [1988] (1988). The Complete Book of Origami: Step-by Step Instructions in Over 1000 Diagrams/48 Original Models. Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-25837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the [[Western world|West]], the term [[origami]] is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Bible"&gt;Nick Robinson, ''The Origami Bible'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi ([[Chinese paper folding]]), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and [[paper plane]]s.

==Cut paper==
{{Main|Papercutting}}
[[Papel picado]], as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while [[Chinese paper cutting]] uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. [[Wycinanki]] and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.

==Paper pulp painting==

Images built using colored paper pulp are a form of paper art that started in the 20th century. [[Chuck Close]], [[Lynn Sures]] are among contemporary artist developing this medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Ramsgate Sands.jpg|thumb|400px|''Ramsgate Sands'']]
[[File:The sands, Ramsgate, Kent, England, ca. 1899.jpg|thumb|Ramsgate in 1899]]

'''''Ramsgate Sands''''', also known as '''''Life at the Seaside''''', is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by [[William Powell Frith]], made in 1852 to 1854, which depicts a beach scene in [[Ramsgate]].  The painting was Frith's first great commercial success: it was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1854, and bought by [[Queen Victoria]].  Frith made a series of similar pictures, showing groups of people in contemporary scenes, including ''[[The Derby Day]]'' of 1858, and ''[[The Railway Station]]'' of 1862 and ''[[Private View at the Royal Academy]] of 1883.

==Background==
After the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]] reached [[Ramsgate Town railway station]] in 1846, the town of [[Ramsgate]] rapidly became a popular destination for day trips from London.

Frith was already a successful artist.  He became a member of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1853, and the painting was based on studies made by Frith during a holiday in Ramsgate in September 1851, where he was inspired by the variety of everyday life.  [[Dunedin Public Art Gallery]] holds an oil sketch from 1851-2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfund.org/what-we-do/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/1524/sketch-for-ramsgate-sands-or-life-at-the-seaside-william-powell-frith Sketch for Ramsgate Sands or Life at the seaside by William Powell Frith], Art Fund; and [http://collection.dunedin.art.museum/search.do;jsessionid=39AC1F27647657B417DDD082FEAD286D?id=26865&amp;db=object&amp;page=1&amp;view=detail Sketch for Ramsgate Sands or Life at the seaside], Dunedin Public Art Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Frith takes advantage of the location to paint people of different social classes in contemporary modern dress.  The seaside was a place where the different classes, ages, and sexes could mix without the usual barriers.  Frith populates the painting with a variety of [[stock characters]] - a grandmother with a parasol, a gentleman seated reading a newspaper, an over-dressed "swell", a variety of entertainers and vendors.  Frith also included a self-portrait: he is looking over the shoulder of the man on the far right, with two ladies and a girl in white in front.  The small girl paddling in the sea near the centre of the painting, staring directly out of the picture, is thought to be his daughter.  All are viewed from the sea, looking towards the beach, separating the viewer from the scene.  Many of the buildings in the background - the clock tower, the granite obelisk erected in 1822, building with battlements on Harbour Parade, and the gable end of the building at the junction of Albion Place and Madeira Walk above the cliffs - remain recognisable today.
 
Unusually, to modern eyes, the characters are wearing their usual clothes on the beach, including [[crinoline]]s for the women and [[waistcoat]]s for the men, alongside more recognisable seaside images of [[sandcastle]]s, donkey rides, and a [[Punch and Judy]] show.  Two telescopes hint at people-watching or voyeurism (the morality of women observing men bathing was a contemporary issue, particularly as men often bathed naked).  [[Bathing machine]]s are visible in the background, but the painting shows no bathers, only genteel paddling at the edge of the sea.

The painting measures {{convert|77|xx|155.1|cm|in}}.  The back of the painting bears the inscription "Life at the Sea side".

==Reception==
The painting received a mixed reception.  It was dismissed by one contemporary commentator as "vulgar Cockney business" or a "tissue of vulgarity"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn_8pZ8QXaEC&amp;pg=PA69 Charles Darwin And Victorian Visual Culture] Jonathan Smith, p.69-71&lt;/ref&gt; and it was rejected by several potential buyers before it was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1854.

However, it became very popular with the viewing public at the exhibition, and it was praised by critics for its realistic depiction of modern life.  It was voted the "picture of the year" by the journal ''Royal Academy Pictures'' and was purchased by the printers [[Lloyd Brothers]] for 1,000 guineas.  When [[Queen Victoria]] expressed an interest in buying the painting - she had visited Ramsgate several times in the 1820s and 1830s, staying at [[Historic buildings in Ramsgate#Townley House|Townley House]] and [[Historic buildings in Ramsgate#Albion House|Albion House]] - it was sold for the same price to her, and displayed at [[Osborne House]].

Lloyd Brothers retained the right to reproduce the painting as an engraving for sale to the public as prints, and Frith may have earned as much as £3,000 from the sales.

'''Rockport Art Association''' is one of the oldest [[art association]]s in the United States. It started as an artist's cooperative and became a gathering place of New England artists of the 20th century. The artists [[Aldro Hibbard]], Antonio Cirino, [[Paul Strisik]], [[Anthony Thieme]], W. Lester Stevens and [[Harry Vincent]] were contemporaries closely tied to its early days.

==Information==
The Rockport Art Association was founded in the year of 1921. Its history has expanded over the past 90 years. In the year of 1921, a group of artists that were attracted to the city of Rockport decided to form the association. The association began in the previous art studio of Aldro T. Hibbard. The Rockport Art Association is commonly called by its acronym of RAA. RAA was originally established as an artist cooperative for art lovers and creators. In the year of 1929, the Rockport Art Association had been placed in its permanent location of an Old Tavern building on Main Street. The RAA had taken location in  a sea captain’s house and over the years it has also been an inn, a tavern, and a stage coach stop before it was founded in its permanent location. The RAA currently has over 250 artist and photography members. The Rockport Art Association has a museum collection that includes paintings, graphics and sculpture representing a pictorial history of life and art on Cape Ann. The RAA is also known to hold several special events, exhibitions, and educational series. &lt;ref name=RAAabout&gt;{{cite web|title=About the RAA|url=http://www.rockportartassn.org/about_the_raa.htm|publisher=Rockport Art Association|accessdate=20 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829010034/http://www.rockportartassn.org/about_the_raa.htm|archivedate=29 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe''' is a firm of [[bookbinding|bookbinders]] established in [[London]] in 1901.   It is considered to be one of the most important bookbinding companies of the 20th century, famous for its luxurious [[jewelled bookbinding|jeweled bindings]] that used real gold and precious stones in their book covers.

Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe was established by Francis Sangorski (1875-1912) and George Sutcliffe (1878-1943).  They had met in 1896 at a bookbinding [[evening class]]es taught by [[Douglas Bennett Cockerell|Douglas Cockerell]] at the [[London County Council]]'s [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]].  In 1898, Sangorski and Sutcliffe each won one of the ten annual craft scholarship awards, giving them £20 a year for three years to continue their training as [[apprentice]] bookbinders. They were employed at Cockerell's own bindery, and began to teach bookbinding at [[Camberwell College of Art]].  They were laid off in 1901 after a [[coal strike]] caused an economic slump, and they decided to set up on their own in a rented attic in [[Bloomsbury]], starting on 1 October 1901.  They soon moved to [[Vernon Place]], and then, in 1905, to [[Southampton Row]].

Sangorski's elder brother, [[Alberto Sangorski]], worked for the firm.  He became an accomplished [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminator]], working for [[Robert Riviere|Rivière]] from 1910.

They quickly revived the art of [[jewelled bookbinding]]s, decorating their sumptuous multi-colour leather book bindings with gold inlay and precious and semi-precious jewels.  They were commissioned to create a most luxurious binding of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', the front cover of which was adorned with three golden peacocks with jewelled tails and surrounded by heavily tooled and gilded vines, that was sent on the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912.  The book, known as the [[Great Omar]], sank with the ship and has not been recovered.  Shortly afterwards, Sangorski drowned.

Sutcliffe continued the firm, which became recognised as one of the leading bookbinders in London.  The bindery moved to [[Poland Street]], and managed to survive through the [[First World War]], the [[Great Depression]], the [[Second World War]], and post-war austerity.  In this period, it undertook work for the [[Ashendene Press]], [[Golden Cockerel Press]] and the [[J. &amp; E. Bumpus]] bookshop. It also created miniature books for [[Queen Mary's Dolls' House]].

After Sutcliffe suffered a [[stroke]] in 1936, he entrusted the business to his nephew, [[Stanley Bray]] (1907-1995), who had worked for his uncle since 1926.  The company merged with [[HT Woods]] in 1939, bringing Kenneth Hobson to the firm.  He introduced a more modern style of binding.  Bray inherited the company on Sutcliffe's death.  The firm merged again in 1988, joining with [[Zaehnsdorf]]'s bindery in [[Bermondsey]] (established by [[Joseph Zaehnsdorf]] in 1842).  The combined business was bought by [[Asprey]] in 1985 and renamed SSZ Limited.  Shepherds, a bookbinding company, bought the company from Asprey in 1998, and revived the Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe name.  The bindery recently moved from its premises in Bermondsey to [[Rochester Row]].

A second copy of the Omar Khayyam was bound as World War II broke out and this was placed in a bank safe vault for safe keeping, but enemy bombing destroyed the vault and the second copy. Stanley Bray after his retirement made a Third version of the binding using the original design, this is now in the British Library.

The '''Speed Art Museum''', originally known as the '''J.B. Speed Memorial Museum''', now colloquially referred to as '''the Speed'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards Hill|first=Toya|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2002/08/05/story3.html|title=Speed show expected to bolster local economy|work=Louisville Business First|date=August 5, 2002|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by locals,  is the oldest, largest, and foremost [[museum]] of [[art]] in [[Kentucky]]. It is located in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] on Third Street next to the [[University of Louisville]] Belknap campus and receives around 180,000 visits annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=anon|first=anon|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3911|title=The Speed Art Museum|work=Charity Navigator|date=2016|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum offers visitors a variety of "art experiences" outside its collection and international exhibitions, including the Speed Concert Series, the [[Art Sparks Interactive Family Gallery]], and the popular late-night event, ''Art After Dark''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisville.com/content/speed-museum-brings-you-art-after-dark|title=Speed Museum brings you Art After Dark|author=Lou|date=September 28, 2009|work=Louisville.com|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Speed houses [[Arts of the ancient world|ancient]], [[Renaissance Classicism|classical]], and [[modern art]] from around the world. The focus of the collection is Western art, from antiquity to the present day. Holdings of paintings from the Netherlands, French and Italian works, and contemporary art are particularly strong, with sculpture prominent throughout.

==History==

The museum was built in 1927 by [[Arthur Loomis]] in the [[Neo-Classical style]]. Loomis was already well known in Louisville for landmarks like the Louisville Medical College and Levi Brothers'. The original building was designed as an understated [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] limestone facade. [[Hattie Bishop Speed]] established the museum in memorial of her husband [[James Breckenridge Speed]], a prominent Louisville businessman, art collector, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, James. "Ghosts, Raspberries, and the Legacy of Hattie Speed" '' The Speed Member Magazine'' Fall 2009 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Speed set up the endowment to fund the museum, encouraging the museum to never charge admission.

The museum underwent a $60 million expansion and renovation project from September 2012 to March 2016, designed by architect [[Kulapat Yantrasast]] of wHY architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/arts/design/speed-museum-turns-to-a-spreadsheet-to-increase-diversity.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Loos|first=Ted|date=March 15, 2016|title=Speed Museum Turns to a Spreadsheet to Increase Diversity|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the closure, the museum opened Local Speed, a satellite space in Louisville's [[East Market District]] (NuLu) for rotating exhibitions, programs and events. Local Speed is located at 822 East Market Street.

The 62,500-square-foot North Building doubled the overall square footage and nearly tripled the gallery space from the previous wing. The expansion created a space for larger special exhibitions, new contemporary art galleries, a family education welcome center, 150-seat theater, indoor/outdoor café, museum shop, and a multifunctional pavilion for performances, lectures and entertaining. Additionally, the new Elizabeth P. and Frederick K. Cressman Art Park and public Piazza was created for the display of sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedmuseum.org/about/history/|title=History|website=speedmuseum.org|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Timeline&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Speed Art Museum.'' Louisville, KY: The Speed Art Museum, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

1927 – The Speed Art Museum is built. More than 74,000 visitors fill the museum in the first year.

1928 – The centenary of Kentucky portrait painter [[Matthew Harris Jouett]] is celebrated with a major exhibition of his portraits, many owned by prominent Louisvillians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jouett Centenary: Portraits Shown at Speed Museum|work=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=February 26, 1928|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1933 – The museum is incorporated as a privately endowed institution and its [[board of governors]] was established.

1934 – The museum received its first major [[donation]], a valuable collection of [[North American Indian]] artifacts given by Dr. Frederick Weygold.

1941 – Dr. Preston Pope Satterwhite makes a significant gift to the museum – his collection of 15th century and 16th century French and Italian [[Decorative Arts]] including [[tapestries]] and [[furniture]].

1944 – Satterwhite donates the [[English Renaissance]] room, which was moved in its entirety from [[Devon]], England. Dr. Satterwhite's gift necessitated an enlargement of the museum and in his will he provided for the addition that bears his name. Completed in 1954, it was the first of three additions to the original building.

1946 – Paul S. Harris becomes the first professional director of the museum. During his tenure, acquisitions to the collection were made mostly in the areas of decorative arts and furniture.

1964 – Recently donated paintings and furniture from the collection of Mrs. W. Blakemore Wheeler go on view including works by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[John Constable]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Maurice Utrillo]], and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]].

1966 – Charter Collectors Group forms to assist museum in the acquisition of pre-1940 art.

1970 – New Art Collectors Group forms to assist museum to acquire [[contemporary art]].

1973 – The North Wing of the museum opens, giving new space for a theatre, offices, indoor sculpture court, and library.

1977 – The Speed celebrates its 50th anniversary in 1977 with the acquisition of Rembrandt's ''Portrait of a Woman'', one of the museum's most significant acquisitions.

1983 – The 1983 Wing opens, designed by Robert Geddes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soa.princeton.edu/content/robert-geddes|title=Robert Geddes|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Princeton. The new wing adds much-needed gallery space for permanent collections and special exhibitions.

1996 – Mrs. Alice Speed Stoll dies, leaving behind an [[estate (land)|estate]] that bequeaths over $50 million to the museum. The Speed closes to undertake an extensive renovation and renaissance. Newer lighting, heating and cooling systems, bold wall colors, multi-layered labels about the collection, and the Laramie L. Learning Center, [[Art Sparks Interactive Family Gallery]] are put into place.

1997 – The museum reopens.

2012 – The museum begins another major transition with a $60 million expansion project that will create a space for larger special exhibitions, new contemporary art galleries, a family education welcome center, 150-seat theater, indoor/outdoor café, museum shop, and a multifunctional pavilion for performances, lectures and entertaining. The museum is closed to the public for three years during the construction period.

2013 – The Speed staff relocates offsite to the downtown Louisville neighborhood of Nulu and opens Local Speed, a satellite space for exhibitions, family activities, programs and special events.

2016 – The museum reopens on March 12 with a 30-hour celebration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1010">The '''''Symphony in A major ("Mannheim No. 2")''''' is a Mannheim symphony by [[Johann Stamitz]], probably written sometime from 1741 to 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes to Johann Stamitz Symphonies Vol. 1 on Naxos|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553194&amp;catNum=553194&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It might be Stamitz' first symphony.  It is formed in the standard 3-movement symphonic scheme of the time:

#Allegro
#Andante
#Presto

This symphony, just like the others by Stamitz, definitely influenced [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Mozart]].  It is about 11 minutes long.

'''The Australiana Fund''' is an independent fundraising organisation responsible for the purchase and maintenance of artworks in the four Official Residences of the [[Governor-General of Australia]] and the [[Prime Minister of Australia]].

== History ==
'''The Australiana Fund''' was started in 1978 by [[Tamie Fraser]], wife of the then Prime Minister, [[Malcolm Fraser]].

Based on an idea for The Americana Fund by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] for the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the [[White House]], Mrs. Fraser hoped to furnish the Official Residences of the Governor-General and Prime Minister of Australia with objects of Australian origin and craftsmanship. The Fund's collection policy also allows for the acquisition of items with specific relevance to past Governors-General and Prime Ministers.

== Activities ==
The Canberra Branch organises public tours of the gardens of Government House, "Yarralumla", every Thursday.

Acquisitions are made without financial assistance from the Australian Government so proceeds from these events allow a continuing programme of new acquisitions as well as the management of the existing collection. The current value of the collection is in excess of A$4 million.

The Australiana Fund aims to enhance the decor of each house with quality artworks, furniture and objects which will represent the best of Australian workmanship from every State and Territory and in years to come will continue to reflect Australian cultural pride and heritage.

== Sites of the Official Residences ==
* [[Government House, Canberra|Government House]], Canberra ("Yarralumla")

* [[Admiralty House, Sydney|Admiralty House]], Sydney

&lt;/ref&gt;
(in the original French ''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu ou la politique de Machiavel au XIXe siècle'') is a [[political satire]] written by French [[lawyer|attorney]] [[Maurice Joly]] in protest against the regime of [[Napoleon III]], a.k.a. Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte who ruled France from 1848-1870.  It was translated into English in 2002.  Small portions were translated in 1967 as an appendix to [[Norman Cohn|Norman Cohn's]] ''[[Warrant for Genocide]]'', which identifies it as the main source of the later ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.

The piece uses the literary device of a dialogue of the dead, invented by ancient Roman writer [[Lucian]] and introduced into the French [[belles-lettres]] by [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] in the 18th century. Shadows of the historical characters of [[Niccolo Machiavelli]] and [[Charles Montesquieu]] meet in Hell in the year 1864 and dispute on politics. In this way Joly tried to cover up a direct, and then illegal, criticism of Louis-Napoleon's rule.

==Summary==

[[File:M. Joly. Dialogue aux enfers. Title page, 1864.jpeg|thumb|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Dialogue aux enfers, 1864&lt;/div&gt;]]
Joly relates in his 1870 autobiography

&lt;/ref&gt;
and walking by [[Pont Royal]], he was inspired to write a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. The noble baron Montesquieu would make the case for [[liberalism]]; the Florentine politician Machiavelli would present the case for [[despotism]].

Machiavelli claims that he "... wouldn't even need twenty years to transform utterly the most indomitable European character and render it as a docile under tyranny as the debased people of Asia". Montesquieu insists that the liberal spirit of the peoples is invincible. In 25 dialogues, step by step, Machiavelli, who by Joly's plot covertly represents Napoleon III, explains how he would replace freedom with despotism in any given European country: "... Absolute power will no longer be an accident of fortune but will become a need" of the modern society. At the end, Machiavelli prevails. In the curtain-line Montesquieu exclaims "Eternal God, what have you permitted!...".
&lt;ref name="Waggoner" /&gt;

The book was published anonymously (par un contemporain, ''by a contemporary'') in [[Brussels]] in 1864

&lt;/ref&gt; and smuggled into France for distribution, but the print run was seized by the police immediately upon crossing the border. The police swiftly tracked down its author, and Joly was arrested.  The book was banned.  On 25 April 1865, he was sentenced to 18 months at the [[Sainte-Pélagie Prison]] in Paris. The second edition of "Dialogues" was issued in 1868 under Joly's name

'''''Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent''''' is a 1790 painting by the Swiss artist [[Henry Fuseli]]. It depicts one of the most popular myths in Germanic mythology, [[Thor]]'s fishing trip, which was known to Fuseli through P. H. Mallet's 1755 book ''Introduction à l'histoire du Dannemarc'', translated to English by Thomas Percy in 1770 as ''Northern Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=190562|title=Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent|work=[[VADS (organisation)|VADS]]|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nude and muscular Thor stands in [[Hymir]]'s boat with the [[Jörmungandr]] on his fish hook.

The painting was Fuseli's diploma work for his election to the British [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1790. The subject has been interpreted in relation to Fuseli's support for the [[French Revolution]], where the serpent could represent the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSR_=7KTmL9VfZZ8&amp;_IXSP_=33&amp;_MREF_=20389&amp;_IXSS_=work_date%3d%26%252asform%3d%252fsearch_form%252fworksform%26_IXresults_%3dy%26title%3d%26_IXACTION_%3dquery%26artist_role_sval%3d%26all_fields%3d%26submit%3dSearch%26sort_by%3d%26_IXTRAIL_%3dSearch%2bWorks%2bof%2bArt%257cSearch%2bResults%26type%3d%26_IXSP_%3d0%26artist_name%3dHENRY%2bFUSELI%26_IXMAXHITS_%3d18&amp;_IXACTION_=display&amp;_IXSPFX_=templates/full/|title=Thor battering the Midgard Serpent, 1790|publisher=[[Royal Academy of Arts]]|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheikh Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi al-Halveti''' (January 21, 1926 &amp;ndash; 15 February 2018) was an author, translator and [[Sufi]].  He served as a government official in [[Ankara]], Honorary Consul of [[Turkey]] in [[Morocco]] and was the Sheikh of the [[Jerrahi]] Order in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html The Tree of Being] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516072115/http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on February 15, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alaturka.us/obituary-sufi-leader-tosun-bayraktaroglu/ Obituary: Sufi leader Tosun Bayraktaroglu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bayrak was born in [[Istanbul]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Ahmet Sait Akcay, [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/culture-and-art/obituary-sufi-leader-tosun-bayraktaroglu/1069998 Obituary: Sufi leader Tosun Bayraktaroglu]. Andalou Agency, 21 February 2018. Accessed 28 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood, he'd been raised without religion in the household, having rarely visited a mosque with his parents; his interest in Hindu and Buddhist philosopher during high school was one of his few experiences with religion.&lt;ref name=moth&gt;Matt Hanson, [https://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2018/09/01/the-moth-and-the-flame-in-memory-of-tosun-bayrak The moth and the flame: In memory of Tosun Bayrak]. [[Daily Sabah]], 31 August 2018. Accessed 28 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in life, his grandfather helped to spark his interest in art and poetry with trips to museums as well as [[Topkapı Palace]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; Initially, he studied [[Biological Sciences]] at [[Robert College]], graduating in 1945.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; It was during his time in college that he first became exposed to Islam as a living practice, lodging on weekends with his aunt who prayed five times a day and fasted during [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;

Bayrak later went on to study [[Art]], [[Architecture]], and [[Art History]] in the Studios of [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Andre Lhote]] in [[Paris]];&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; [[Architecture]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]];&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; and [[History of Art]] at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], [[London]]. While in London, he was an associate of poet [[Can Yücel]] and former [[Prime Minister of Turkey]] [[Bülent Ecevit]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; He received a Masters in Fine Arts from [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

===Sufism===
In 1970 Bayrak met [[Muzaffer Ozak]], who became his spiritual teacher, at the Jerrahi Lodge in Instanbul.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rory Dickson, [https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=HCiLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=jerrahi+america&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj0IvShLDeAhUMC8AKHfz9BuQQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jerrahi%20america&amp;f=false Living Sufism in North America: Between Tradition and Transformation], p. 108. [[Albany, New York|Albany]]: [[SUNY Press]], 2015. {{ISBN|9781438457581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bayrak became a Sheikh of the Halveti-Jerrahi order and resided near the Jerrahi Order of America mosque in [[Spring Valley, New York]] a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sufism.org/books/names.html#tosun The Most Beautiful Names]&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as the spiritual guide of the Jerrahi Order of the Americas starting from 1977,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sep_oct_01/1001_13.html The Meaning of Age] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040626145532/http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sep_oct_01/1001_13.html |date=2004-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and he founded the official mosque of the Order's American branch in [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; Though at one time an admirer of [[Fethullah Gülen]], Bayrak condemned the [[Gülen movement]] at a winter 2016 art exhibit in Istanbul due to the movement's alleged involvement in the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;

{{cquote|“Service should be from the moment you are born until the moment you give your last breath, but you have to find out in what way. That's what's most important. We have to find out in what manner we are supposed to serve.” &lt;ref&gt;"The World is Beautiful" An interview with Sheikh Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi [http://www.wie.org/j18/bayrak.asp?page=2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks]], which ended as Bayrak was planning a Friday sermon, he declared that the perpetrators were insane, not Muslims, and opposed the key teachings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lerner and Richard Liebson, [https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/2015/01/09/local-muslims-jews-horrified-terror-france/21530145/ Local Muslims, Jews horrified by terror in Paris]. [[The Journal News]], 9 January 2015. Accessed 1 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayrak passed away in New York on 15 February 2018 at the age of 92.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Works==
===Artisty===
Bayrak taught art and art history at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]], where he helped to establish the Fine Arts Division.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; His work was exhibited widely in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html The Tree of Being] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516072115/http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he became a [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim]] fellow in 1965.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/Public/Authors/Detail.asp?AuthorID=97&amp;WhatType=1 Tosun Bayrak]&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired from the art world in the 1970s and devoted his life to the study and teaching of [[Islam]] and Sufism. 

{{cquote|“Both my wife and I were artists, and we felt very strongly that it was feeding our egos. Art, art exhibitions, and the consequences of being accepted and successful are incredible food for your ego, which is the Sufi's enemy. The final straw was when we went to Rome to visit a friend, a sculptor, and there was a very pretty young girl there whom my friend introduced me to. And she was so adoring to me. She said, "Ohhh, I know you. I love your art." She was completely praising me, and I saw the ego suddenly rise up and say, "Aha! This beautiful, spiritual girl is telling you that you are a great artist." So I said, "Oh, my God! That's it. It's over." I hit the ego on the head and decided I was finished with it all.&lt;ref&gt;"The World is Beautiful" An interview with Sheikh Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi [http://www.wie.org/j18/bayrak.asp?page=2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Translation===
Bayrak translated dozens of books on Islamic spirituality, but he was particularly known for his efforts on the works of the Sufi mystic [[Ibn Arabi]]. One of his best known works is ''Ibn Arabi: The Tree of Being''. His translations of classic works of Sufism include [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]]'s ''Secret of Secrets'', ''Inspirations'', and ''The Book of Sufi Chivalry'', ''[[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi]]: The Shape of Light'', ''The Name and the Named: Divine Attributes of God'', and [[Imam Birgivi]]'s ''The Path of Muhammad''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''UK Theatre''' (formerly the '''Theatrical Management Association''') was founded in 1894 as the Theatrical Managers Association, with Sir [[Henry Irving]] as its first president.[http://uktheatre.org/who-we-are-what-we-do/about-uk-theatre/history/] There are however records of the activity of a Theatrical Managers Association going back to at least 1866.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatres v.

Irving is described here as the chairman.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uppspretta''' is the name of a [[Toyism|Toyist]] artwork situated in the [[Iceland]]ic town of [[Keflavík]]. In 2013, a neglected [[water tower]] being nine meters in height and thirty-six meters in circumference, was transformed into an object of art.&lt;ref&gt;Nordwest-Zeitung, [http://www.nwzonline.de/friesland/kultur/maskenspiel-und-bunte-farben_a_17,0,2199234095.html Maskenspiel und bunte Farben], 28 August 2014 {{ger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting shows the story of a [[puffin]] named Uppspretta.&lt;ref&gt;Krant van Coevorden, [http://www.krantvancoevorden.nl/nieuws/26695/oude-watertank-in-ijsland-krijgt-facelift-van-de-toyisten/ Oude watertank in IJsland krijgt facelift van de Toyisten], 28 May 2013 {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This largest artistic wall painting of Iceland&lt;ref&gt;Víkurfréttir, [http://www.vf.is/mannlif/staersta-veggmalverk-a-islandi-gert-i-keflavik/58129 Stærsta veggmálverk á Íslandi gert í Keflavík], 7 July 2013 {{is icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was officially opened by mayor Árni Sigfússon of [[Reykjanesbær]] on 6 September 2013.&lt;ref name="Beek 5-14" /&gt; It is situated in a popular recreation area of  Keflavík.&lt;ref&gt;Reykjanesbær, [http://www.reykjanesbaer.is/upplysingatorg/frettir-og-tilkynningar/uppspretta-vatnstankur-verdur-listaverk-/19420/ Uppspretta, vatnstankur verður listaverk], 28 April 2014 {{is icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project==
[[File:Uppspretta sewing coffee bags.jpg|thumb|The sewing of coffee bags]]
The transformation of the tower into an artwork was actuated by an earlier work of the [[Toyism|Toyists]], namely ''De Stip'' (''The Dot'') in [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]], [[Netherlands]], when a [[Gas holder|gas storage container]] of 22 meters high was repainted into a work of art. This Icelandic project was financed partially by the municipality of [[Reykjanesbær]], through sponsorship and [[crowdfunding]].&lt;ref name="Beek 53-55"&gt;Beek, W. van der (2014), ''Uppspretta'', pp. 53-55, {{ISBN|978-90-809703-0-4}} {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this project, the Toyists were also asked by a hotel in Keflavík, to paint its facade and a dining room in the same style.&lt;ref name="Beek 98-99, 116"&gt;Beek, W. van der (2014), ''Uppspretta'', pp. 98–99, 116, {{ISBN|978-90-809703-0-4}} {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project started on 24 July 2013, and was completed after seven weeks. Eleven Toyists from five different countries were involved.&lt;ref name="Beek 98-99, 116" /&gt; During the activities, Iceland had its worst weather conditions since the summer of 1923. Plastic could not be used as a protection material, because it is impermeable to air. The strong winds blew apart the plastic, revealing the artwork before the project was finished. For that reason, coffee bags were used in order to be able to complete the project. Two hundred of them were sewn together and wrapped around the tower.&lt;ref name="Beek 53-55" /&gt;

== Theme and design==
Whilst [[toyism]] is to be classified under [[figurative art]], one cannot subdivide it further into one particular style. A common denominator of the artworks of the Toyists is that they seem recognizable as well as unworldly.&lt;ref name="DKB"&gt;Drenthe Kunst Breed, [http://drenthekunstbreed.nl/kunst/galerie.asp?G=0&amp;id=52&amp;meer=1 Dejo - Toyisme Studio] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of this artwork is a story that resembles a legend. It was invented by the art group for this occasion.&lt;ref name="Beek 5-14"&gt;Beek, W. van der (2014) ''Uppspretta'', pp. 5–14, {{ISBN|978-90-809703-0-4}} {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, other works of this group are based on anecdotes, fantasies and philosophies too.&lt;ref name="DKB" /&gt;

Sólfar (English: ''[[The Sun Voyager]]'') is a work of the Icelandic artist [[Jón Gunnar Árnason]] and was the inspiration for the dream boat that brought Uppspretta back to Iceland. Árnason intended his creation to be a ''dream boat'' which travels to undiscovered areas.&lt;ref&gt;Wide Sea | No Anchor, [http://wideseanoanchor.com/iceland-land-of-puffins/ Sun Voyager], and Travel Bunny, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150910201019/http://thetravelbunny.com/2015/09/10/reykjavik-design-iceland/ Reykjavik – Iceland’s Design Destination]&lt;/ref&gt; There's a dream boat in the story of the toyists as well, that brings the main character Uppspretta back to Iceland IJsland. In the images at the right the inspiration of the ''Sólfar'' of Árnason can be observed in the painting of the toyists.&lt;ref name="Beek 5-14" /&gt;

Another inspiration came from Iceland, like a [[geyser]]; Uppspretta means ''source''. The [[viking]]s, who are believed by the artists to be the first inhabitants of Iceland, appear in the form of [[Freyja]], the goddess of love from the [[Norse mythology]]. There's also an image of a [[Viking ships|viking ship]].&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2014), ''Uppspretta'', pp. 36–44, {{ISBN|978-90-809703-0-4}} {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The story behind ==
The main character of this story is a [[puffin]] named Uppspretta, a curious bird that wanted to discover the world. On his search, he read many books on the history of [[Iceland]]. When he discovered that its first citizens came from [[Norway]], he decided to go and find his female puffin there. His parents had warned him that he was not capable of flying above land, but he ignored their warning, flew over land, and fell to earth.&lt;ref name="Beek 5-14" /&gt;

However, he did not land in Norway, but to the south in the [[Netherlands]]. There he was found by a man that took care of him. At the man’s home Uppspretta fell asleep and dreamed about people and music. In his dreams a ship came into sight that took him aboard, travelled over the seas, and subsequently through the air to Keflavík. When he arrived at home, he married a female puffin from Norway and became the leader of all puffins on Iceland.&lt;ref name="Beek 5-14" /&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}'''Whitewashing''' in beauty is a phenomenon in the intersection of the [[fashion industry]], [[digital photography]], [[mass media]], [[marketing]] and [[advertising]]. It describes a situation in which the skin tone of non-white women (less often of men) – when depicted in magazine covers, advertisements, commercials, music videos, etc. – is, digitally [[retouching|retouched]] or physically modified to appear [[white]]r. Whitewashing can also present itself in the alteration of [[Hair|hair texture]] to resemble [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] beauty ideals of straight hair. Whitewashing can be seen in the form of skin whitening, either digitally or with harmful [[Skin whitening|skin bleaching]] products, or by chemically relaxing textured hair to make it conform to Eurocentric beauty standards. Additionally, [[plastic surgery]] can be used to alter features to make them appear more European, such as [[East Asian blepharoplasty|double eyelid surgery.]]

Whitewashing has been seen for centuries in the [[Whitewashing in media|media]], through film, photography, advertising, etc. Whitewashing in [[Hollywood]] is a prevalent issue, often attributed to the lack of racial diversity in the industry itself. Advertising companies often will airbrush their models to make them appear to have lighter skin, as seen in the [[L'Oréal|L'oreal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;campaign with [[Beyoncé]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/08/advertising.usa|title=L'Oreal accused of 'whitening' Beyoncé Knowles in cosmetics ad|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2008-08-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Whitewashing can also be seen when a film or television show based on a book or other precedent decides to rewrite a non-white role as white and use a white actor to portray the role. This is not to be confused with [[blackface]], which is when a person who is not Black attempts to portray a darker skin tone with makeup or digital editing. This type of whitewashing is most common in the film industry and has been a problem since the beginning of Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/hollywood-has-whitewashed-asian-stories-decades-year-they-couldn-t-n830241|title=Hollywood has whitewashed Asian stories for decades. This year, they couldn't ignore the backlash.|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; More people of color are being represented in the industry as of late, but whitewashing remains a prevalent issue that can affect self-image of young children whose races have been marginalized in film.'

Cultural whitewashing is also common in the media, in which a culture's traditions are tweaked to satisfy Western stereotypes, such as in the popular film [[Step Up (franchise)|Step Up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vagabomb.com/Cultural-Appropriation-Whitewashing-Everything-I-Loved-about-Step-up-Suddenly-Seemed-Wrong/|title=Cultural Appropriation &amp; Whitewashing: Everything I Loved about Step up Suddenly Seemed Wrong|last=VagaBomb|date=2017-09-07|work=VagaBomb|access-date=2018-03-30|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular examples ==

=== Advertising ===
A clear example of beauty whitewashing is a [[L'Oreal]] advertising campaign featuring [[Beyoncé Knowles]] in which her skin was digitally retouched to appear lighter. This brought the corporation under fire for a significant period. Other examples include celebrities [[Halle Berry]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Rihanna]], [[Freida Pinto]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Tyra Banks]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Gabourey Sidibe]] and [[Queen Latifah]], in which these figures were subjected to skin lightening during the editing stage of promotional photoshoots.

The photo and video-sharing app, [[Snapchat]], also attracted public criticism in 2016 for potential whitewashing in its photo filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/snapchat-filters-flower-crown-beautifying-skin-whiter-lightening-controversy-a7036261.html|title=Snapchat criticised over 'filters' which appear to 'whitewash' users' skin|date=18 May 2016|work=The Independent|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular target of this outcry was the use of words such as "beautify" and "pretty" associated with the skin-lightening filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/snapchat-white-wash/|title=Snapchat accused of whitewashing its users through ‘beautify’ filter|last=Chang|first=Lulu|date=18 May 2016|work=DigitalTrends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Recently, [[Rupert Sanders]]’ Hollywood rendition of the 1995 Japanese manga film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost In the Shell]]'' came under scrutiny for casting a white actress ([[Scarlett Johansson]],) to play the Japanese protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/31/here-s-how-ghost-in-the-shell-tries-and-fails-to-atone-for-its-whitewashing|title=Here’s How ‘Ghost in the Shell’ Tries (and Fails) to Atone for Its Whitewashing|last=Leon|first=Melissa|date=2017-03-31|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this wasn't physical whitewashing through skin whitening or hair relaxant, it is still considered whitewashing since a white actress was used instead of a Japanese one and the role was rewritten for a white actress.

In the 2014 film [[Aloha (2015 film)|''Aloha'']], directed by [[Cameron Crowe]], [[Emma Stone]] (a white actress) was cast for the role of Captain Allison Ng, a woman who was partially Hawaiian. Similar to ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost In the Shell]],'' a white actress was used in place of a person of color, effectively whitewashing the role and the film itself.

=== Public Figures ===
Typically, women primarily use products to lighten their skin, but in many cases men also do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Margaret|title=Buying Racial Capital: Skin-Bleaching and Cosmetic Surgery in a Globalized World|url=https://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/soc/mhunter/Hunter_Buying%20Racial%20Capital.pdf|website=The Journal of Pan African Studies|publisher= |volume=4|issue=4|year=2011|page=143|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former professional baseball star, [[Sammy Sosa]] admitted to using skin bleaching cream in an interview with "[[Primer Impacto]]" of the Univision Spanish network.&lt;ref name="Sosa: Cream has bleached skin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Enrique|title=Sosa: Cream has bleached skin|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4642952|website=ESPN|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammy Sosa said, "It's a bleaching cream that I apply before going to bed and whitens my skin some… It's a cream that I have, that I use to soften [my skin], but has bleached me some. I'm not racist, I live my life happily." &lt;ref name="Sosa: Cream has bleached skin" /&gt;

== Critique ==
The reasons for altering [[Human skin color|skin tone]] in advertisements are believed to be primarily marketing purposes, more specifically directly appealing to whiter ethnicities, which are generally the strongest [[target group]]s in consumer-driven areas such as [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mire|first=Amina|year=2001|title=Skin-Bleaching: Poison, Beauty, Power and the Politics of the Colour Line|url=http://search.proquest.com/genderwatch/docview/194908202/C3A77B0AF8444C03PQ/5?accountid=7418|journal=Resources for Feminist Research|volume=28.3|pages=13–38|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skin tone manipulation can also reflect the implicit [[Physical attractiveness|beauty standards]] or ideals that the marketers perpetuate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Stevie|last2=DeJong|first2=Penelope|year=2011|title=Ethical Responses To Public Allegations Of Skin Tone Manipulation In Print Advertising: Consumer Indifference Or Consumer Concern?|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=00f70588-2f88-44db-8e39-c64075eb7445%40sessionmgr120&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=67526247|journal=Journal of Promotion Management|volume=17.4|pages=396–406|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete|doi=10.1080/10496491.2011.620485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauty whitewash is criticized for distorting general perceptions of reality, exuding a twisted sense of beauty, and having a negative influence on women, children, and communities alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Ashley|year=2015|title=Picture [Im]Perfect: Photoshop Redefining Beauty In Cosmetic Advertisements, Giving False Advertising A Run For The Money|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=f9fa4ec1-adeb-4419-8ea1-e19555aa3581%40sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=108802574&amp;db=a9h|journal=Texas Review Of Entertainment &amp; Sports Law|volume=16.2|pages=87–105|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] ideals are forced upon people of color, creating [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] within their own communities. Ultimately, whitewashing creates social tension not only between White and non-White communities, but also between groups who resemble the more established beauty standards, such as lighter-skinned African Americans, and the groups who do not, including darker-skinned African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hunter |first=Margaret |title=The Persistent Problem of Colorism: Skin Tone, Status, and Inequality |url=https://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/soc/mhunter/The%20Persistent%20Problem%20of%20Colorism.pdf |journal=Sociology  Compass |publication-date=2007 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=237–254 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00006.x |access-date=2016-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305034927/https://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/soc/mhunter/The%20Persistent%20Problem%20of%20Colorism.pdf# |archive-date=2017-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can apply to both men and women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Veras |first=Edlin |title=He's Dark, Dark; Colorism Among African American Men |url=http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=aas_theses |journal=Georgia State University |publication-date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kai Nelson believes that whitewashing has a negative impact on children in African American communities as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Kai|year=2016|title=Where's the Representation? The Impact of White Washing on Black Children|url=http://scholarsarchive.jwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=ac_symposium|journal=Academic Symposium of Undergraduate Scholarship|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media does not always give an accurate view of the races that they are depicting, resulting in a diminishment of self-confidence in African American children. Nelson explains that children interpret the altering of [[Human skin color|skin color]] in the beauty industry in a negative way, and can develop a viewpoint that they are "unattractive" and "undesirable".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the lack of Black role models in [[Media culture|popular media]], this causes them to see the Caucasian community as the "default [[race (human categorization)|race]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As Ronald Hall describes in his ''[[Journal of Black Studies]]'', whitewashing has caused [[people of color]] to develop a "bleaching syndrome" which causes an internalization of preference for the dominant, or White, culture’s ideals. This results in people of color developing a contempt for dark skin because it is regarded as an obstacle for [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. However, despite adopting white cultural values, people of color are still barred from full assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Ronald|year=1995|title=The Bleaching Syndrome: African Americans' Response to Cultural Domination Vis-a-Vis Skin Color|url=|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=26.2|pages=172–84|doi=10.1177/002193479502600205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4663">'''Women Artists in Revolution (WAR)''' was a [[New York City]]-based collective of American women artists and activists that formed in 1969. They seceded from the male-dominated [[Art Workers' Coalition]] (AWC), prompted by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s 1969 Annual (later the [[Whitney Biennial]]), which included only eight women out of the 143 featured artists shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29794506|title=The power of feminist art : the American movement of the 1970s, history and impact|date=1994|publisher=H.N.
