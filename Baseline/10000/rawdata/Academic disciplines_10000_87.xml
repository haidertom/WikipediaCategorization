'''Alejandro Anreus''' is a curator, art historian and critic who has focused his research on [[Latin American art|Latin American Art]]. Though he began his career as an artist, Anreus is now an art historian and poet, and is professor of art history and Latin American/Latino Studies at [[William Paterson University]]. Among his many accomplishments, Anreus is a two-time recipient of the Oscar B. Cintas Foundation and has worked as a curator with public collections such as the Montclair Art Museum and the Jersey City Museum during his career.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Alejandro Anreus was born in [[Havana, Cuba]] on 11 September 1960. He later migrated to the United States as a result of the [[Cuban exile|Cuban Exile]] of 1950s-1970s and settled down with his mother, two aunts and grandmother in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. Anreus earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in art history at [[Kean College]], where he was influenced and mentored by Marxist art historian Alan Wallach, and then his [[Master of Arts]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] at [[Graduate Center, CUNY|The Graduate Center, CUNY.]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpunj.edu/coac/departments/art/faculty/anreus-alejandro.dot#qsC7lmWeStRGgVzO.97|title=Alejandro Anreus - William Paterson University|website=www.wpunj.edu|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Artistic Practice ===
From 1981 through 1987 Anreus was represented by Schweyer-Galdo Galleries, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he had a one-person exhibition of his drawings every two years. After a hiatus, he participated in American Voices in 2004, his last exhibition, a two-person linoleum prints and photography exhibition with  photographer [https://julionazario.wordpress.com/ Julio Nazario], Edge Art, Rahway, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Curatorial practice ===
Alejandro Anreus has worked as Curator at the [[Jersey City Museum]] (1993-2001) and the [[Montclair Art Museum|MontClair Art Museum]]. He also regularly participates in panels and seminars on Latin American art and art and politics of the 1930s. Exhibitions such as [[Ben Shahn]] and The Passion of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] at the Jersey City Museum, [[Juan Sánchez Cotán|Juan Sánchez]]: Printed Convictions, Subversions/Affirmations: [[Jaune Quick–to–See Smith|Jaune Quick-to-See Smith]],A Survey and Bending the Grid: Luis Cruz Azaceta at the [[Aljira, a Center for Contemporary Art|Aljira Center for Contemporary Art]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]] have been part of his curriculum as a curator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2015, he guest curated the exhibition Gloria Rodriguez Calero: Urban Martyrs And Later Days Santos, [[El Museo del Barrio|Museo Del Barrio]], NewYork.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Works and publications ==
Alejandro Anreus has focused critically on the role of politics within the modernity of Latin American and Latino Art. Covered in his research are topics such as muralism, political art of the 1930s and the life and work of Latino artists. His articles have appeared in Art Journal, [[Third Text]], [[ArtNexus|Art Nexus]] and Encuentro de la Cultura Cubana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cintasfoundation.org/index.php/fellows/visual-artists/298-alejandro-anreus|title=Anreus, Alejandro|website=www.cintasfoundation.org|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent publications are Ben Shahn and The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti (Jersey City Museum and [[Rutgers University Press]], 2001), [https://books.google.com/books/about/Orozco_in_Gringoland.html?id=FPFeAAAAMAAJ Orozco in Gringoland: The Years in New York] ([[University of New Mexico Press]], 2001), and [http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-02691-X.html The Social and The Real; Political Art of the 1930s in the Western Hemisphere] ([[Penn State University Press|Penn State Press]], 2006), which he co-edited with Diana L.

'''Applied physics''' is intended for a particular technological or [[applied science|practical use]]. It is usually considered as a bridge or connection between [[physics]] and [[engineering]].

"Applied" is distinguished from "pure" by a subtle combination of factors, such as the motivation and attitude of researchers and the nature of the relationship to the [[technology]] or [[science]] that may be affected by the work. Applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the [[physical science]]s, but is concerned with the utilization of scientific principles in practical devices and systems, and in the application of physics in other areas of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Information on Applied Physics |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/general/ |publisher=Stanford Department of Applied Physics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307121331/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/general/ |archive-date=7 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It usually differs from engineering in that an applied [[physicist]] may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving an engineering problem. This approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. 

In other words, applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the physical sciences but is concerned with the utilization of these scientific principles in practical devices and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Applied Physics |url=http://www.sci.waseda.ac.jp/research/BELONG/E/02802.html|publisher=Waseda University|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied [[physicists]] can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, the field of [[accelerator physics]] can contribute to research in theoretical physics by working with engineers enabling design and construction of high-energy [[collider]]s.

[[File:Physical science and Biology faculties, University of Innsbruck.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Institute of Astro- and Particle Physics of University of Innsbruck can be seen here (the tallest building with a telescope dome on the roof).]]
'''Astromundus''' is a 2-years [[Erasmus Mundus]] masters course in [[Astronomy]] and [[Astrophysics]]. It is offered by a consortium of 5 partner universities of four different [[Europe]]an countries. Partner universities are [[University of Innsbruck]] in [[Austria]], [[University of Padova]] and [[University of Rome Tor Vergata]] in [[Italy]], [[University of Göttingen]] in [[Germany]] and [[University of Belgrade]] in [[Serbia]]. Belgrade is a third country partner of this consortium.

Main objective of this masters course is to provide students from all over the world with a state-of-the-art background in Astrophysics which would be useful in their future research career. Also, as typical of all other Erasmus Mundus programs, it encourages cultural exchange between different countries. The first edition of AstroMundus officially started on September 22, 2010 in [[Innsbruck]]. The welcome reception was held at ''Claudiasaal'', a historical landmark of Innsbruck.&lt;ref name="oweb"&gt;Information taken from the official website of Astromundus. For the link of the website see the External links&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics of interest==
Courses offered by Astromundus are mainly on these topics. They span throughout almost all the branches of Modern Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology.
* [[Galactic Astronomy|Galactic Astrophysics]] (the [[Sun]] and the [[Solar system]], the [[Milky Way]], [[stellar evolution]], the [[interstellar medium]])
* [[Planetology]] and [[Astrobiology]] (including [[Extrasolar planets]])
* [[Extragalactic Astronomy|Extragalactic Astrophysics]] ([[Galaxy|galaxies]], [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy evolution]], [[galaxy clusters]], [[intracluster medium]], [[star formation]])
* [[Active Galactic Nuclei]] (including [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] theory, [[relativistic jets]], modelling)
* [[Cosmology]] (including [[observational cosmology]], [[galaxy survey]]s, [[gravitational lensing]], [[Timeline of the Big Bang|very early universe]])
* [[Particle physics in cosmology|Particle Cosmology]]
* [[Astroparticle physics]]
* [[Gravitational waves]]
* [[Observational astronomy|Observational astrophysics]] from the ground and from space (including [[Radio astronomy|Radio]], [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]], [[Optical astronomy|optical]])
* [[Millennium Run|Computational astrophysics]] ([[N-body simulations]], [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magneto-hydrodynamic simulations]], [[High energy physics]] with [[CERN]])&lt;ref name="oweb"/&gt;

==Scholarships==
Like all Erasmus Mundus programmes, Astromundus is funded by [[European Commission]]. Two categories of scholarships are awarded to the selected students: ''category A'' for non-European students and ''category B'' for European students. For the first edition, the students who were awarded the "category A" scholarships came from [[Bangladesh]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], [[Pakistan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United States]]. European students came from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Spain]].

Students holding a category A scholarship get 1000 euro per month during the whole 24-month period of their master studies. Additionally 4000 euro is given in the beginning of every academic year. So in total a category A scholarship amounts to 32,000 euro excluding tuition and insurance fees. Students don't need to pay tuition fees in any of the partner universities and they also get an international health and travel insurance valid for two years. Including the tuition and insurance fees this particular scholarship would amount to almost 48,000 euro in two years. On the other hand, category B scholarship holding European students get 500 euro per month during the whole period. Usually they don't get the travel allowance although one can get an allowance of 3000 euro if he or she spends more than 3 months in the University of Belgrade. On the contrary if any student, holding a category A scholarship, spends more than 3 months in Belgrade, which is unusual, he/she is not paid for the months in excess of three. This system has been devised especially to encourage European students to go to third countries and third country students to visit Western European universities.

Scholarships for scholars are also available in Astromundus. These are short term scholarships awarded for teaching or research for a maximum period of three months&lt;ref name="oweb"/&gt;

==Partner universities==
===University of Innsbruck===
[[University of Innsbruck]] is the coordinating university of this programme. So prospective students need to send their application package there. First semester of the programme is also held at this university. So all the students come here for the first semester which usually starts during winter. Innsbruck offer introductory graduate courses on various fields of Physics, Mathematics and Astrophysics so that students from different background can come to an equal standard and be ready for the next semesters.

Courses offered by the University of Innsbruck are: Advanced Mathematical Methods for Astrophysicists, Concepts of Physics for Astrophysicists, Concepts of Galactic Astrophysics, Concepts of Extragalactic Astrophysics, Introduction to Radio Astronomy, Galaxy Groups, Basic Concepts of Astro- and Particle Physics, Astrophysics Laboratory etc. Among these first four courses are compulsory. Each of the compulsory courses carry six credits. In total a student need to cover 30 credits in one semester of Astromundus.

===University of Padova===
[[University of Padova]] is one of the oldest universities in [[Italy]]. It hosts two (second and final) of the four semesters of Astromundus.

===University of Rome Tor Vergata===
University of Rome Tor Vergata is the second public university of Rome and hosts all of the last three semesters of Astromundus. A student can spend 3 semesters here but it is encouraged to change institutions.

More specialized courses are offered here. Such as, Extragalactic Astrophysics 1, [[Theory of relativity|Relativity]] and [[Cosmology]], Stellar Astrophysics, Experimental Solar Physics, Extragalactic Astrophysics 2 ([[Observational cosmology]] and [[Galaxy cluster]]s), Space Physics, Planetology, Astrobiology, Physics of Gravitation Radiative Processes in Astrophysics etc. [[Jonathan Lunine]], a [[Planetary science|planetary scientist]] and physicist from the [[United States]], is currently working here as a visiting professor who offers lectures in Planetology.

===University of Göttingen===
For the last two semesters students can go to the University of Goettingen. It was ranked 4th in Germany, 30th in Europe and 93rd in the world in 2010 by the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. So far it seems to be the top priority of the students for doing a master thesis. Courses offered here are mainly on stellar structure and evolution, stellar atmospheres, stellar atmospheres modelling, [[active galactic nuclei]], numerical experiments in astrophysics, cosmological structure formation, inflationary theory, [[helioseismology]], physics of [[Sun]]. They also offer some seminar courses related to string theory and supermassive black holes that one can take for credits.

===University of Belgrade===
[[University of Belgrade]] is situated in [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]]. Students can go there for the last two semesters. The best master theses written by Astromundus students will be considered for publication in the ''[[Serbian Astronomical Journal]]'' published by the [[Astronomical Observatory Belgrade]] and the [[Department of Astronomy, Belgrade]].

==Examination and grade conversion scheme==
A student typically needs to go to more than two universities in two years. Thus he/she encounters different environments, different examination and grading systems. Like in Innsbruck, in accordance with the Austrian system, exams are usually in written form and grades are given on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being excellent and 5 being insufficient and grades have to be an integer number. In Italy however exams are usually oral (typically 40 minutes to one hour, sometimes even longer) and grades range from 0 to 30, 17 being fail and 30 being the highest score. They also have a grade named 30 LODE (or 30+) awarded for exceptionally good performances. In Germany, exams are again oral (lasting for 15 to 30 minutes) and grading system is somewhat similar to Austria. Only here the difference is, grades don't necessarily have to be an integer, students very frequently get grades like 1.3, 1+, 2.7 etc. Serbian system is very different, their marks range from 1 to 100 with a passing mark of 50.

As it is a joint master programme and finally one certificate has to be offered by the consortium as a whole, all the different grades are converted into the Austrian system, [[University of Innsbruck]] being the coordinating university. The grade conversion scheme is given below:

{|class="wikitable"

'''Braille music''' is a [[Braille code]] that allows music to be notated using [[Braille]] cells so music can be read by visually impaired musicians.  The Braille music system was originally developed by [[Louis Braille]].

[[File:Braille cell.svg|thumb|Braille cell, 2 dots wide by 3 dots high]]Braille music uses the same six-position [[Braille cell]] as literary braille.  However braille music assigns a separate meaning to each braille symbol or group of symbols different from literary braille and has its own syntax and abbreviations.

Almost anything that can be written in print music notation can be written in braille music notation.  However, braille music notation is an independent and well-developed system with its own conventions.

The world's largest collection of braille music is located at the National Library for the Blind in Stockport, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlb-online.org/mod.php?mod%3Duserpage%26menu%3D130002%26page_id%3D50 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313234416/http://www.nlb-online.org/mod.php?mod=userpage&amp;menu=130002&amp;page_id=50 |archivedate=2005-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning Braille music ==
Braille music is in general neither easier nor more difficult to learn than print music. Visually impaired musicians gain the same benefits upon learning to read braille music as sighted musicians who learn to read print music. Visually impaired musicians can begin learning braille music about the time they have reasonable competence reading literary Braille.

== Teaching Braille music ==
Braille music for beginners, like print music for beginners, is quite simple.  Music teachers with no previous knowledge of braille music can easily learn the rudiments of braille music notation and keep a step or two ahead of the student who is learning braille music.  Some common print method books are available in braille so a sighted teacher can use a print version and the visually impaired student braille version or the other way around.

== Transcribing music into Braille ==
Much commonly used music has been transcribed into braille.  In the U.S. this is available from the National Library Service (NLS) of the Library of Congress (free for qualified individuals) and through other sources.  Most countries have a national library similar to the NLS.

However, many visually impaired musicians require a good deal of music that has never before been transcribed.  In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and many other countries, there is a network of braille music transcribers who can transcribe such music.

Another option is to use a computer-music system.  Such systems typically allow a user to enter music into a computerized music notation program.  The software then automatically converts the print notation into braille. One such software program is called Goodfeel. The visually impaired individual can enter music notation within the Lime program, which has been scripted so the process of music entry is accessible. Then this file can be imported into Goodfeel which converts the music into a Braille file that can be exported to a Braille embosser or read on a portable Braille display.

== Introduction to Braille music symbols and syntax ==
Some of the most common braille music symbols and combinations are summarized in the chart below:

[[File:braillemusicsummary.gif|Braille Music Summary Graphic]]

=== Pitch and rhythm ===
As the "Notes" section of the music braille chart above indicates, a single symbol shows both the pitch and rhythmic length of a note.  For instance, dots 1,4,5 indicate an eighth note (or 128th note) C. Every rhythm symbol in braille music does double duty—8th notes and 128th notes use the same symbols, as do quarter notes and 64th notes, half notes and 32nd notes, and whole notes and 16th notes.  Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, and whole notes).  For advanced users there is never rhythmic ambiguity because the context, including time signature and bar lines, makes the intended rhythmic value clear.  For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), context says the symbol must indicate a whole rest.

=== Octave marks ===
An octave mark is included before a note symbol to specify the octave of the note.  For instance, the 4th Octave is the octave starting with middle C and going up to the B above middle C. Octaves are only specified when needed.  For instance, a melody proceeding upward from the first octave can, if moving by step, proceed to the second, third, and fourth octaves without requiring additional octave signs. The rule is that, in the absence of an octave mark specifying otherwise, notes move by a unison, 2nd, or 3rd rather than a 6th, 7th, or octave.  For instance, the following moves upward continuously, ending in octave 5:

:Octave 2 C C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A B B C C

The rule for 4ths and 5ths is different, however: in the absence of an octave sign specifying otherwise, a melodic leap of a 4th or 5th will stay within the same octave as the previous note.  For instance, the following always stays within Octave 2:

:Octave 2 C G D A E B F C G D A E

Because of the use of octave marks, clef symbols are not required in braille music.  On occasion, clef symbols (bass clef, treble clef, or other) will be indicated so the visually impaired musician will be aware of every detail of the print score.

=== Musical markings ===
Musical indications like "dim", "cresc", or "rit" are inserted inline with the note and rhythm notation and, to differentiate them from note, octave, and other musical signs, always preceded by the "word sign" (dots 3,4,5).

Slurs may be indicated by a slur sign between two notes or bracket slur surrounding a group of notes to be slurred.

Musical signs such as staccato or tenuto are generally placed before the note or chord they affect.  The musical signs shown on the chart are shown modifying a quarter note C (dots 1,4,5,6).

"Music hyphen" is used to indicate that a measure will be continued on the following line (this happens somewhat more often in braille music than in print music).

A "word apostrophe" indicates that the word will be continued on the following line.

=== Repetition symbols ===
Braille music tends to be rather bulky.  Because of this, a system of repetition symbols—much more extensive than that in print music—is employed to reduce page turns, size of scores, and expense of printing.

The repetition symbol (dots 2,3,5,6) is used similarly to the musical repetition symbol [[File:Repetition symbol.jpg]] to indicate that a beat, half measure, or full measure is to be repeated.

In addition, braille music often includes instructions such as "repeat measure 2 here" or "repeat measures 5-7 here".  Such indications are in addition to the commonly used repeat marks and first and second endings.

=== Contrapuntal lines and chords within a staff ===
Unlike print music notation, braille music is a linear format.  Therefore, certain conventions must be used to indicate [[contrapuntal]] lines and chords, situations where more than one note is played simultaneously within a staff.

==== In-accords ====
Independent contrapuntal lines within a staff are indicated via whole- or part-measure in-accords.  The first of the contrapuntal lines is given, then the second, enclosed by the in-accord symbols.  The in-accord symbols indicate that the two lines are to be played simultaneously.

==== Interval notation ====
Homophonic chordal sections are written using interval notation.  For instance, the notation "quarter-note-C, 3rd, 5th" would indicate playing a C along with the notes a 3rd and 5th higher than C, making a chord C-E-G a quarter note in length. Reading the interval notation is somewhat complicated by the fact that some staves use bottom-up notation (the bottom note of each chord is specified and intervals are read upwards from the given note) and some use top-down notation (the top note of each chord is specified and intervals are read downwards from the given note). The modern convention is to specify the main note (either the bass line or melody line) and let the intervals go up or down from there as appropriate.  For instance, in most piano music the left hand specifies the bottom note and intervals go bottom-up while the right hand specifies the top note and intervals go top-down. Many older scores have all staves reading bottom-up or all reading top-down. Most scores have a note indicating the direction of the interval notation.  However, in some older scores the direction must be established from the context. By convention, in-accords are given in the same direction as the interval notation. Thus, examining the in-accords is one way to establish whether the interval notation on a particular staff is bottom-up or top-down.

=== Dealing with different staves ===
Printed music is often written on several different staves.  For instance, piano music is typically written on two different staves combined into the [[grand staff]]: one for treble clef and one for bass clef, while choral music often has four different staves (one each for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass).  The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically. Because of the linear nature of braille music and the fact that the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations. ''Bar over bar format'' is most similar to print music.  Simple piano music in bar over bar format is quite similar to print music, with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation on the bottom line.  Some degree of vertical alignment between the right and left hands is maintained. Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are ''line over line format'', [http://www.brl.org/music/code/bmb/chap29/index.html ''section by section format''], ''paragraph style'', and ''bar by bar format''.  As a rule these formats take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together. For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part.  No attempt is made to align the parts. The same procedure is followed for measures 9-16, and so on, section by section, throughout the score. The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together. A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used.  However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.

== Variations in Braille music ==
Over the years and in the many different countries, a variety of minor differences in braille music practice have arisen.  Some countries have preferred a different standard for interval or staff notation or used different codes for various less common musical notations. An international effort to standardize the braille music code culminated in the updates summarized in [http://www.brl.org/music/index.html Braille Music Code 1997] and detailed in the [http://www.opustec.com/products/newintl/newbrl.html New International Manual of Braille Music Notation (1997)].  However, users should be aware that they will continue to encounter divergences when ordering scores from printing houses and libraries because these are often older and come from various countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3996">'''Diploma in Computer Science''', originally known as the "Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing", was a conversion course in [[Computer Science]] offered by the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]]. It was equivalent to a [[master's degree]] in present-day nomenclature but the title ''diploma'' was retained for historic reasons, "diploma" being the archaic term for a master's degree.

The Diploma was the world's first full-year taught course in computer science, starting in 1953. It attracted students with degrees in mathematics, science and engineering. At its peak, there were 50 students on the course. UK government ([[EPSRC]]) funding was withdrawn in 2001 and student numbers dropped dramatically. In 2007, the University took the decision to withdraw the Diploma at the end of the 2007-08 academical year, after 55 years of service. 

==History==
The introduction of this one-year graduate course was motivated by a [[University of Cambridge]] Mathematics Faculty Board Report on the "demand for postgraduate instruction in numerical analysis and automatic computing … &lt;nowiki&gt;[which]&lt;/nowiki&gt; if not met, there is a danger that the application to scientific research of the machines now being built will be hampered". The [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] "was one of the pioneers in the de and use of electronic computing-machines (sic)". It had introduced a Summer School in 1950, but the Report noted that "The Summer School deals &lt;nowiki&gt;[only]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with 'programming', rather than the general theory of the numerical methods which are programmed." The Diploma "would include theoretical and practical work … &lt;nowiki&gt;[and also]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instruction about the various types of computing-machine … and the principles of design on which they are based." With only a few students initially, no extra staff would be needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/UoCCL/misc/EDSAC99/history.html Informal history of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

University-supported teaching and research staff in the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Laboratory]] at the time were [[Maurice Wilkes]] (head of the laboratory), [[J. C. P. Miller]], W. Renwick, E. N. Mutch, and S. Gill, joined slightly later by C. B. Haselgrove.

In its final incarnation, the Diploma was a 10-month course, evaluated two-thirds on examination and one-third on a project dissertation. Most of the examined courses were shared by the second year ("Part IB") of the undergraduate [[Computer Science Tripos]] course, with some additional lectures specifically for the Diploma students and four of the third year undergraduate ("Part II") lecture courses also included.

There were three grades of result from the Diploma: distinction (roughly equivalent to first class honours), pass (equivalent to second or third class honours), and fail.

The '''Catlin Seaview Survey''', later renamed the '''XL Catlin Seaview Survey''', was a major scientific expedition which commenced in September 2012, whose aim was to document the composition and [[Environmental issues with coral reefs|health]] of [[coral reef]]s worldwide. Specifically, the survey aimed to "carry out a rapid assessment of the current state of coral reef systems and to make this scientific record publicly available for scientists worldwide to use". The survey was sponsored by the [[Catlin Group]] until the survey ended when the Catlin group ended sponsorship. The original team created a film, chasing coral and a new, global initiative known as 50 reefs.&lt;ref name=CSSMain2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Catlin Seaview Survey|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The survey started in September 2012, and was focused on sections of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] across a range of depths. Specifically, 32 reefs were sampled, which equated to approximately {{convert|150|km}} of reef. This produced around 105,000 images, which are currently being analysed by scientists globally,&lt;ref name=CSSAbout2014&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/about|work=Catlin Seaview Survey|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; using image recognition software.&lt;ref name=CSSScience2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Science|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/science|work=Catlin Seaview Survey|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to imaging shallow reefs, the deeper reef was sampled. This also led to the discovery of the deepest known coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef, which is located at a depth of {{convert|125|m}}.

This initial success led to the continuation of the survey globally. In 2013, the survey focussed on sampling corals in the [[Caribbean sea]] and [[Bermuda]]. Other sites are also being explored in 2014.&lt;ref name="CSSAbout2014"/&gt;

==Surveying==

[[File:Seaview SVII Camera.jpg|thumb|The [[Seaview SVII]] Camera, used extensively throughout the Catlin Seaview Survey.]]

The status of surveyed reefs is being documented using [[Optical resolution|high-resolution]], 360-degree [[Panorama|panoramic]] vision.&lt;ref name='CSSAbout2014'/&gt; These images are [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-tagged with camera direction recorded, documenting precise locations. This method of documentation is intended to form a visual record of the world's reefs, allowing different reefs to be visually compared, and individual reefs to be monitored over time. This imaging also aims to help both the general public and specific groups (e.g. policy makers) better identify and understand the threats facing coral reefs. Likewise, these images are intended to assist the formation of strategies to protect reefs.

To survey deeper reefs, specialist divers and [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROUVs) are being utilised. The temperatures of these deep reefs are also being monitored. In addition, biological samples are being collected to identify potential genetic links between shallow and deep coral systems, which could be important for conservation. Pulsed Amplitude Modulated (PAM) stress detection devices are also being used in deeper reefs to monitor stress levels.

Much of this imaging was produced using the [[Seaview SVII|SVII Camera]]. The SVII is a self-propelling underwater panoramic camera, and was designed by the survey team. The camera can be controlled by a diver, and is propelled at a constant speed. The Seaview SVII-S has also been designed, and is a lighter, human-propelled version of the SVII which can be transported by a single person. Underwater [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s are used to control the cameras and observe real-time images, and have also been used for communication, especially with [[social media]]. 

As mentioned, ROUVs are used to sample deeper reefs. These are highly mobile, and can operate at low depths. These ROUVs also contain scientific equipment which can be altered depending on the sampling being carried out, and can carry out sampling. As with the low-depth cameras, these ROUVs are able to produce high definition geo-positioned images.&lt;ref name="CSSScience2014"/&gt;

==Catlin Global Reef Record==

Data from the Catlin Seaview Survey has been used to construct the [[Catlin Global Reef Record]], which was launched in 2013. This database contains images and data collected by the Catlin Seaview Survey and by other coral reef research.&lt;ref name="CSSScience2014"/&gt; However, the huge photographic records generated by the Catlin Seaview Survey are the main aspect of this record. The Catlin Global Reef Record is freely available to scientists globally, and can be used to analyse these reef environments and monitor their change.&lt;ref name=GRRHome2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://globalreefrecord.org/home_scientific|work=Global Reef Record|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cennino &lt;!--NOTE--&gt;d&lt;!--The "d" remains lower-case except when at the start of a sentence ie. "D'Andrea is daring."--&gt;'Andrea Cennini''' (c. 1360 &amp;ndash; before 1427) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] influenced by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]. He was a student of [[Agnolo Gaddi]] in [[Florence]]. Gaddi trained under his father, called Taddeo Gaddi, who trained with Giotto. 

Cennini was born in [[Colle di Val d'Elsa]], [[Tuscany]]. After training as an artist with Agnolo Gaddi in Florence he worked at the court of [[Francesco Novello da Carrara]] in Padua for some years before apparently returning to Colle di Val d'Elsa.

He is remembered mainly for having authored '''''Il libro dell'arte'''''. Thought to have been written around the turn of the 15th century, the book is a "how to" on late Medieval and early Renaissance painting. It contains information on [[pigment]]s, [[brush]]es, drawing, [[panel painting]], the art of [[fresco]], painting on fabrics and casting, amongst other techniques and tricks. Cennini also mentions oil painting in passing, which was important for dispelling the myth, propagated by [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Karel Van Mander]], that [[oil painting]] was invented by [[Jan van Eyck]] (although [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] (Roger of Helmerhausen) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, On Divers Arts, written in 1125).

The dates of Cennini's life are highly speculative. It is often falsely assumed that he was alive in 1437 because that date appears on the earliest of the four extant copies of his manuscript. However, an administrative document from Colle di Val d'Elsa dated 1427 probably refers to his son; if this is the case then the document makes it clear that Cennini was dead by this time. The techniques Cennini describes range from ones which were already in use in the 13th century to ones which were innovative in the late fourteenth century. However, there is no evidence in his writing of the exciting developments in oil painting taking place in the early 15th century, suggesting that his book was written not long after the turn of the century.

The extent to which Cennini intended to provide a practical handbook for the apprentice painter is disputed. Some scholars believe that his book was a presentation book or a guild book instead. Along with technical methods, Cennini offered advice on the sort of lifestyle to which a young painter should subscribe. "Your life should be arranged just as if you were studying [[theology]], or [[philosophy]], or other theories, that is to say, eating and drinking moderately, at least twice a day, electing digestible and wholesome dishes, and light wines; saving and sparing your hand, preserving it from such strains as heaving stones, crowbars, and many other things which are bad for your hand, from giving them a chance to weary it. There is another cause which, if you indulge it, can make your hand so unsteady that it will waver more, and flutter far more, than leaves do in the wind, and this is indulging too much in the company of women."

According to [[Victoria Finlay]], in her book ''Colour: Travels Through The Paintbox, the infamous UK forger'', [[Eric Hebborn]] was greatly influenced by Cennino Cennini. The last book Hebborn wrote before he was brutally murdered was ''The Art Forger's Handbook''. Finlay writes that he "used and adapted Cennino's advice extensively - preparing panels, tinting papers different colours, and making brand new works look as if they had been varnished some time before (by beating egg-white, left overnight and then applying it with a brush), just as the master advised."

In the 1970s, Boskovits established a small oeuvre for Cennini, which has been confirmed by later scholarship. This includes frescoes in the church of San Lucchese in Poggibonsi and a panel painting depicting the birth of the Virgin in the Museo Comunale in Colle di Val d'Elsa. The two paintings pictured above were added to the corpus at a later date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3563">'''Centraco''' (French ''Centre nucléaire de traitement et de conditionnement'', Central Nuclear processing and packaging), is a factory run by the Society for packaging waste and industrial effluents (SOCODEI). Located on the [[Marcoule|Marcoule nuclear site]] in an area of 11&amp;nbsp;hectares [[Codolet]] (Gard),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.codolet.fr/&lt;/ref&gt; the basic nuclear installation has been operational since 1999.

== Types of radioactive waste ==

[[High-level radioactive waste management|Nuclear waste]] treated Centraco are very low, low and intermediate radiation (TFA, FMA), they come from the nuclear industry (mainly from [[Électricité de France|EDF]] and [[Areva]]), research centers (Atomic Energy Commission), and small producers such as hospitals.

Types of Waste:
*metal objects, from the controlled area and maintenance of [[Nuclear decommissioning|nuclear decommissioning;]]
*waste fuels, mainly gloves and coveralls;
*liquid [[Wastewater|waste]] such as washing solutions, [[oil]]s, [[solvent]]s, and resins and sludge from nuclear installations.

== Waste Treatment ==

The main goal is to minimize the volume before packaging, plant Centraco consists of two main units that deal with waste by type:

*The melting of metals
*The incineration plant for fuel and effluents.

Residues from each unit are mixed with a matrix and then packaged. The final volume of waste is reduced by a factor of 10 to 17.

=== The incineration plant ===

This furnace consists of three rooms:

*The primary chamber: the temperature there is 900-1000&amp;nbsp;°C
*The secondary chamber: the temperature of 1100–1200&amp;nbsp;°C
*The tertiary room

Solid waste is fed into the primary chamber. By cons, liquid waste is injected either in the primary chamber, or in the secondary chamber according to their chemical composition.

The [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[Clinker (waste)|slag]] are collected and linked in a "glue" by the method of inerting cold. They are then packed in metal drums and shipped to the National Agency for Radioactive Waste (ANDRA).

The incinerator has a rated capacity of 5000&amp;nbsp;tons / year of waste.

An explosion September 12, 2011 caused the death of an employee, and injured four others. This has happened in a furnace at the site of reprocessing nuclear waste Marcoule. It was an "industrial accident" and not "nuclear accident".

=== The furnace ===

The [[Foundry|smelter]] includes an [[induction furnace]] for the manufacture of [[ingots]] and metal [[ferrules]]. The metals are melted in the furnace at 1600&amp;nbsp;°C. Impurities are removed manually, then the molten metal is poured into a ladle and is then cast into ingots or centrifuged in a tube.

The ingots, conical cylinders of about 1.5 t are considered as final waste and are sent to the Center of storage l'Aube in [[Soulaines-Dhuys]] for a long-term storage.

The tubes are reused for the manufacture of packaging for medium-level waste such as concrete shells or internal shielding of barrels, allowing the partial recovery of the waste.

A shuttle bus travels between the two units to transfer the waste into the proper unit after sorting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4089">The '''chain-linked model''' or '''Kline model''' of innovation was introduced by mechanical engineer Stephen J. Kline in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1, March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; and further described by Kline and economist [[Nathan Rosenberg]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, S.J. &amp; N. Rosenberg (1986). “An overview of innovation.” In R. Landau &amp; N. Rosenberg (eds.), The Positive Sum Strategy: Harnessing Technology for Economic Growth. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, pp. 275–305.&lt;/ref&gt; The chain-linked model is an attempt to describe complexities in the  [[innovation]] process. The model is regarded as Kline's most significant contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/971028kline.html Salisbury, David F., "Memorial for Stephen Kline; engineer, interdisciplinary thinker," news release, Stanford University, October 27, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the chain-linked model, new knowledge is not necessarily the driver for innovation.  Instead, the process begins with the identification of an unfilled market need.  This drives research and design, then redesign and production, and finally marketing, with complex [[feedback]] loops between all the stages.  There are also important feedback loops with the organization's and the world's stored base of knowledge, with new basic research conducted or commissioned as necessary, to fill in gaps. 

It is often contrasted with the so-called [[linear model of innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;Caraça, João,  Bengt-Åke Lundvall, and Sandro Mendonça (2009).  “The changing role of science in the innovation process: From Queen to Cinderella?” Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 76, 861–867.&lt;/ref&gt; in which basic research leads to applied development, then engineering, then manufacturing, and finally marketing and distribution.

==Applications==
The Kline model was conceived primarily with commercial industrial settings in mind, but has found broad applicability in other settings, for example in military technology development.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Vassiliou, Stan Davis, and Jonathan Agre (2011).  Innovation Patterns in Some Successful C2 Technologies." Proc. 16th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations and extensions of the model have been described by a number of investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Kameoka, A., D.

[[File:Claremont Colleges Collage.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Clockwise from top: Pomona College, Keck Graduate Institute, the Honnold-Mudd Library, Pitzer College, Scripps College, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont McKenna College.]]

The '''Claremont Colleges''' (known colloquially as the '''7Cs''') are an American [[consortium]] of seven highly selective institutions of higher education located in [[Claremont, California]], a city {{convert|35|mi}} east of downtown [[Los Angeles]]. They comprise five undergraduate colleges (the '''5Cs''') — [[Pomona College]], [[Scripps College]], [[Claremont McKenna College]] (CMC), [[Harvey Mudd College]], and [[Pitzer College]] — and two graduate schools — [[Claremont Graduate University]] (CGU) and [[Keck Graduate Institute]] (KGI). All of the members except KGI have adjoining campuses that together cover roughly {{convert|1|mi2|km2}}.

The consortium was founded in 1925 by Pomona president [[James A. Blaisdell]], who proposed a [[collegiate university]] design inspired by [[Oxford University]]. He sought to provide the specialization, flexibility, and personal attention commonly found in small colleges, but with the resources of a large university.&lt;ref&gt;[[James A. Blaisdell]], the creator of the Claremont Colleges, declared in 1923 "My own very deep hope is that instead of one great, undifferentiated university, we might have a group of institutions divided into small colleges—somewhat of an [[Oxford University|Oxford]] type—around a [[library]] and other utilities which they would use in common. In this way, I should hope to preserve the inestimable personal values of the small college, while securing the facilities of the great university."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the consortium has roughly 7700 students and 3600 faculty and staff, and offers more than 2000 courses every semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Claremont Colleges |url=http://www.claremont.edu/ |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colleges share a central library, campus safety services, and other resources. Among the undergraduate schools, there is significant social interaction and academic cross-registration, but each college still maintains a distinct identity. For the Class of 2020 admissions cycle, four of the five most selective liberal art colleges in the U.S. by acceptance rate were among the Claremont Colleges, and the remaining college, Scripps, had the second lowest acceptance rate among women's colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toptieradmissions.com/resources/college-admissions-statistics/ivy-league-admission-statistics-for-class-of-2020/|title=Ivy League Admissions Stats &amp; Acceptance Rates, Class of 2020|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fiske Guide to Colleges has called the consortium "a collection of intellectual resources unmatched in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuc.claremont.edu/aboutcuc/|title=About CUC|work=claremont.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/7234.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813201211/http://www.cgu.edu/pages/7234.asp |archivedate=2011-08-13 |df= }} The Claremont Difference&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colleges ==

The five undergraduate colleges are:
* [[Pomona College]] (founded 1887), a small, [[coeducational]], [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] that offers majors in humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Pomona College is the founding member of the Claremont Colleges.
* [[Scripps College]] (founded 1926), a small, [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts]], [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]], which offers 35 majors in both the sciences and humanities.
* [[Claremont McKenna College]] (founded 1946), a small, [[coeducational]], [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] that specializes in [[economics]], [[political science]], [[international relations]], and [[Policy|public policy]]. It also maintains a  broad set of majors in the [[natural sciences]], [[social sciences]], and [[humanities]]. Claremont McKenna College is also home to the [[The Robert Day School|Robert Day School of Economics and Finance]], which offers both an undergraduate program and a master's program in finance.
* [[Harvey Mudd College]] (founded 1955), a small, [[coeducational]] college specializing in [[engineering]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], and the [[physical science|physical]] and [[biological science]]s but also includes coursework in the humanities and social sciences.
* [[Pitzer College]] (founded 1963), a small, [[coeducational]], [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] noted for its core values of Social Responsibility, Intercultural Understanding, Interdisciplinary Learning, Student Engagement and Environmental Sustainability. Pitzer is part of the [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States#SAT optional movement|SAT optional movement]] among liberal arts colleges.

The two graduate universities are:
* [[Claremont Graduate University]] (founded 1925), awards master's and doctoral degrees in 31 disciplines: [[arts]], [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] &amp; [[Organizational studies|organizational sciences]], [[management]]/[[Senior management|executive management]], [[psychology]], [[Education|educational studies]], [[religion]], [[mathematical sciences]], [[information systems]] &amp; [[Information technology|technology]], [[Community health|community]] &amp; [[global health]], and [[botany]].
* [[Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences]] (founded 1997), a [[Medical research|biomedical]] [[graduate school]] offers professional Master of [[Biotechnology|Bioscience]] (MBS) degree and PhD in Applied Life Science for MBS graduates. It also offers a Postdoctoral Professional Masters (PPM) and a joint PhD program in [[computational biology]] with Claremont Graduate University.  The Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy opened in 2014 offering a four-year Doctorate of Pharmacy degree (Pharm.D.). Keck Graduate Institute also sponsors a four-year undergraduate program in collaboration with the [[Minerva Project]], termed [[Minerva Schools at KGI]], though students are not physically present on the Claremont Colleges campuses.

The [[Claremont School of Theology]] (founded 1885) (and thus [[Claremont Lincoln University]]) is affiliated with the consortium, but is not a member.

== Rankings ==

According to the [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|American Liberal Arts College]] rankings released by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' in fall 2017, the "5Cs" were ranked among the top 40 liberal art colleges in the United States: Pomona College (#6), Claremont McKenna College (#8), Harvey Mudd College (#12), Scripps College (#26), and Pitzer College (#33). Additionally, all of the undergraduate colleges are categorized as "Most Selective".&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges/spp+50 National Liberal Arts College Rankings] U.S.News &amp; World Report, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked the 5C's among the top 60 undergraduate colleges (including universities and military academies) in the nation and within the top 25 liberal arts colleges for its 2017 report: Pomona College (#10 overall, #1 LAC), Claremont McKenna College (#11 overall, #2 LAC), Harvey Mudd College (#18 overall, #5 LAC), Scripps College (#43 overall, #16 LAC), and Pitzer College (#59 overall, #23 LAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 25 Liberal Arts Colleges 2017|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickfederle/2017/08/02/top-25-liberal-arts-colleges-2017/#71eb29da6bc7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niche listed all of the undergraduate colleges within the top 30 small colleges in the United States as measured by surveys rating various components of the undergraduate experience: Pomona College (#2), Harvey Mudd College (#5), Claremont McKenna College (#10), Scripps College (#22), and Pitzer College (#29).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Best Small Colleges in America|url=https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-small-colleges/|publisher=Niche}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' also releases individual graduate program rankings for the [[Claremont Graduate University]], with several of its programs ranking in the top tier of graduate programs nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/claremont-graduate-university-112251/overall-rankings] ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shared facilities, programs, and resources ==
Each college is independent in that, for example, students receive their degrees from the one college in which they are enrolled, and administration and admissions departments are independent. The seven-institution Claremont Colleges system is supported by The Claremont Colleges Services (TCCS), which provides centralized services, such as a library, student health, financial and human resources, telecommunications, risk management, real estate, physical plant maintenance, and other services, for those colleges.

Shared facilities include the Libraries of the Claremont Colleges, Campus Safety, the Tranquada Student Services Center (which houses Baxter Medical Center, Monsour Counseling Center, and the Health Education Outreach), McAlister Center (home of the Office of the Chaplains and the Claremont Card Center), EmPOWER Center (which works to address sexual violence), the Rick and Susan Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity (The Hive), the Huntley Bookstore, all dining facilities, and several sports facilities. The Claremont Colleges Library is an example of the level of cooperation in terms of support services. The size of the library collection ranks third among the private institutions in [[California]], behind only [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[University of Southern California|USC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuc.claremont.edu/aboutcuc/history.asp|title=History of The Claremont Colleges|work=claremont.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shared academic departments include the Intercollegiate [[Women's Studies]] Center, the Intercollegiate Department of [[Chicano]] Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of [[Asian American]] Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of Black Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of Religious Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of [[Media Studies]], and the Five-College Theater Department.

Shared intercollegiate programs include the [[European Union]] Center of California, the Chicano/[[Latino]] Student Affairs Center, the Office of Black Student Affairs, the Office of the Chaplains, Hillel, and the Queer Resource Center.

In addition, three of the Claremont Colleges&amp;mdash;Claremont McKenna College, Pitzer College, and Scripps College&amp;mdash;share a single science program. These three colleges pool their resources to create the largest academic department in Claremont, the Joint Science Department. Many research projects and courses utilize the [[Robert J. Bernard Field Station]], an {{convert|86|acre|ha|adj=on}} natural area which consists principally of the rare Coastal Sage Scrub [[ecosystem]].

Many clubs are open to students from all the undergraduate colleges. ''[[The Student Life]]'', the largest student newspaper at the 5C's, covers all five schools and publishes a weekly print edition as well as online content. [[KSPC]] 88.7 FM is the non-profit [[community radio]] station associated with the Claremont Colleges. Students from the colleges host KSPC shows and help run the station.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=October 2018|small=no}}
In October 1923, President [[James A. Blaisdell]] of Pomona College wrote to [[Ellen Browning Scripps]] describing a vision of educational excellence he had for the future Claremont Colleges:

{{quote|I cannot but believe that we shall need here in the South [of California] a suburban educational institution of the range of [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. My own very deep hope is that instead of one great undifferentiated university, we might have a group of institutions divided into small colleges — somewhat on the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] type — around a library and other utilities which they would use in common. In this way I should hope to preserve the inestimable personal values of the small college while securing the facilities of the great university. Such a development would be a new and wonderful contribution to American education. Now the thing which would assure this future institution to Southern California is land ... It is now or never. To save the needed land for educational use seems to me to guarantee to Southern California one of the great educational institutions of America. Other hands through the centuries will carry on the project and perfect it. But never again can there come so fundamental a service as this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuc.claremont.edu/aboutcuc/land_use_statement.asp CUC Land Use Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Bernard. An Unfinished Dream: A Chronicle of the Group Plan of the Claremont Colleges. The Castle Press. 1982. pg. 702&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Athletics ==
'''[[Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags and Athenas|Claremont-Mudd-Scripps]]''' athletics teams from [[Claremont McKenna College]], [[Harvey Mudd College]] and [[Scripps College]] compete as one team. Male athletic teams are called the Stags, and women's teams are called the Athenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.prestosports.com/quick_facts/|title=CMS Quick Facts|work=prestosports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Pomona College]] and [[Pitzer College]] compete together as '''[[Pomona-Pitzer]]'''. Their teams are called the Sagehens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physical-education.pomona.edu/program.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124180736/http://physical-education.pomona.edu/program.shtml |archivedate=2009-01-24 |title= 	
The Athletic Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] in the [[Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (SCIAC). In the Division III Final Standings for the 2016-2017 year, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps ranked 4th nationally, while Pomona-Pitzer ranked 29th; they were the top two performers in the SCIAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016-17 Learfield Directors' Cup Division III Final Standings|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/June1FinalDIIIOverall.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club and intramural sports==
In addition to the Stags/Athenas and the Sagehens, there are several 5C club sports teams.

The [[roller hockey]] club, the Claremont Centaurs, won the Division 3 Championship of the West Coast Roller Hockey League in 2009–2010, 2010–2011, and 2011–2012.

The men's and women's [[rugby union]] both attended Division II Nationals in 2004 and 2006, and the men's team won the [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] national championship in 2010.

The women's [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] team reached Nationals in 2004, 2011, and 2013, and won the tournament in 2012, and the men's [[Ultimate Frisbee|ultimate frisbee]] were 2008 Southern California Sectional champions and 2011 Division III National champions.

Other club sports offered at the 5Cs include men's [[lacrosse (sport)|lacrosse]], [[field hockey]], crew, and cycling.

==In popular culture==
The Claremont Colleges are referenced in [[Max Brooks]]'s 2006 apocalyptic horror novel ''[[World War Z]]'', in which the students at the colleges hold off 10,000 zombies by fortifying Scripps's walled campus. Brooks is an alumnus of Pitzer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28130">'''Cognitive musicology''' is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[Cognitive model#Computational models|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive musicology can be differentiated from other branches of [[music psychology]] via its methodological emphasis, using computer modeling to study music-related [[knowledge representation]] with roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]]. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories.&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O. (1999). AI and music: A cornerstone of cognitive musicology. In M. Balaban, K. Ebcioglu, &amp; O. Laske (Eds.), ''Understanding music with AI: Perspectives on music cognition.'' Cambridge: The [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graci | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = A brief tour of the learning sciences featuring a cognitive tool for investigating melodic phenomena | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Technology Systems | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 181–211 | doi=10.2190/et.38.2.i}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, M., 1999. "Structure as Performance: Cognitive Musicology and the Objectification of Procedure," in  Otto Laske: Navigating New Musical Horizons, ed. J. Tabor. New York: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even while enjoying the simplest of melodies there are multiple brain processes that are synchronizing to comprehend what is going on. After the stimulus enters and undergoes the processes of the ear, it enters the auditory cortex, part of the temporal lobe, which begins processing the sound by assessing its pitch and volume. From here, brain functioning differs amongst the analysis of different aspects of music. For instance, the rhythm is processed and regulated by the left frontal cortex, the left parietal cortex and the right cerebellum standardly. Tonality, the building of musical structure around a central chord, is assessed by the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (Abram, 2015). Music is able to access many different brain functions that play an integral role in other higher brain functions such as motor control, memory, language, reading and emotion. Research has shown that music can be used as an alternative method to access these functions that may be unavailable through non-musical stimulus due to a disorder. Musicology explores the use of music and how it can provide alternative transmission routes for information processing in the brain for diseases such as Parkinson's and [[dyslexia]] as well.

==Notable researchers==
The polymath [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher Longuet-Higgins]], who coined the term "cognitive science", is one of the pioneers of cognitive musicology.  Among other things, he is noted for the computational implementation of an early key-finding algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, C. (1987) Mental Processes: Studies in cognitive science. Cambridge, MA, US: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Key finding is an essential element of tonal music, and the key-finding problem has attracted considerable attention in the psychology of music over the past several decades.  Carol Krumhansl and Mark Schmuckler proposed an empirically grounded key-finding algorithm which bears their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Krumhansl | first = Carol | title = Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-19-505475-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their approach is based on key-profiles which were painstakingly determined by what has come to be known as the probe-tone technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krumhansl | first1 = C. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = E. | year = 1982 | title = Tracing the dynamic changes in perceived tonal organisation in a spatial representation of musical keys | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 334–368 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.89.4.334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This algorithm has successfully been able to model the perception of musical key in short excerpts of music, as well as to track listeners' changing sense of key movement throughout an entire piece of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmuckler | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Tomovski | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Perceptual tests of musical key-finding | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1124–1149 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.31.5.1124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Temperley, whose early work within the field of cognitive musicology applied dynamic programming to aspects of music cognition, has suggested a number of refinements to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler Key-Finding Algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Temperley | first = David | title = The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-262-20134-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Laske was a champion of cognitive musicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Otto Laske | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A collection of papers that he co-edited served to heighten the visibility of cognitive musicology and to strengthen its association with AI and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Balaban | first = Mira | title = Understanding Music with AI | publisher = AAAI Press | year = 1992 | location = Menlo Park | isbn = 0-262-52170-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreword of this book reprints a free-wheeling interview with [[Marvin Minsky]], one of the founding fathers of AI, in which he discusses some of his early writings on music and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minsky | first1 = M | year = 1981 | title = Music, mind, and meaning | url = http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/MusicMindMeaning.html | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 28–44 | doi=10.2307/3679983}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI researcher turned cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has also contributed a number of ideas pertaining to music from an AI perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas | title = Gödel, Escher, Bach | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-465-02656-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musician Steve Larson, who worked for a time in Hofstadter's lab, formulated a theory of "musical forces" derived by analogy with physical forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Musical Forces and Melodic Expectations: Comparing Computer Models with Experimental Results | doi = 10.1525/mp.2004.21.4.457 | journal = Music Perception | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 457–498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hofstadter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Virtual Music | publisher = The MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-262-53261-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also weighed in on David Cope's experiments in musical intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Experiments in Musical Intelligence | publisher = A-R Editions | location = Madison | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-89579-337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which take the form of a computer program called EMI which produces music in the form of, say, Bach, or Chopin, or Cope.

Cope's programs are written in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], which turns out to be a popular language for research in cognitive musicology.  Desain and Honing have exploited Lisp in their efforts to tap the potential of microworld methodology in cognitive musicology research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honing | first1 = H | year = 1993 | title = A microworld approach to formalizing musical knowledge | url = | journal = Computers and the Humanities | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 41–47 | doi=10.1007/bf01830716}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also working in Lisp, Heinrich Taube has explored computer composition from a wide variety of perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taube | first = Heinrich | title = Notes from the Metalevel | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-90-265-1975-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, of course, researchers who chose to use languages other than Lisp for their research into the computational modeling of musical processes.  Tim Rowe, for example, explores "machine musicianship" through C++ programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowe | first = Robert | title = Machine Musicianship | publisher = MIT Pr | location = City | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-262-68149-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rather different computational methodology for researching musical phenomena is the toolkit approach advocated by David Huron.&lt;ref&gt;Huron, D. (2002). Music Information Processing Using the Humdrum Toolkit: Concepts, Examples, and Lessons. "Computer Music Journal, 26" (2), 11–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  At a higher level of abstraction, Gerraint Wiggins has investigated general properties of music knowledge representations such as structural generality and expressive completeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiggins | first1 = G. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1993 | title = A Framework for the Evaluation of Music Representation Systems | url = | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 31–42 | doi=10.2307/3680941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a great deal of cognitive musicology research features symbolic computation, notable contributions have been made from the biologically inspired computational paradigms.  For example, [[Jamshed Bharucha]] and Peter Todd have modeled music perception in tonal music with neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;Bharucha, J. J., &amp; Todd, P. M. (1989). Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets. ''Computer Music Journal'', 44−53&lt;/ref&gt;  Al Biles has applied genetic algorithms to the composition of jazz solos.&lt;ref&gt;Biles, J. A. 1994. "GenJam: A Genetic Algorithm for Generating Jazz Solos." Proceedings of the 1994 International Computer Music Conference. San Francisco: International Computer Music Association&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous researchers have explored algorithmic composition grounded in a wide range of mathematical formalisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nierhaus | first = Gerhard | title = Algorithmic Composition | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-211-75539-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cope | first = David | title = Computer Models of Musical Creativity | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-262-03338-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[cognitive psychology]], among the most prominent researchers is [[Diana Deutsch]], who has engaged in a wide variety of work ranging from studies of absolute pitch and musical illusions to the formulation of musical knowledge representations to relationships between music and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Deutsch | first = Diana | title = The Psychology of Music | publisher = Academic Press | location = Boston | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-213565-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equally important is Aniruddh D. Patel, whose work combines traditional methodologies of cognitive psychology with [[neuroscience]].  Patel is also the author of a comprehensive survey of cognitive science research on music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Patel | first = Aniruddh | title =Music, Language, and the Brain | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-213565-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most significant contribution to viewing music from a linguistic perspective is the [[Generative Theory of Tonal Music]] (GTTM) proposed by [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lerdahl | first = Fred |author2=Ray Jackendoff | title = A Generative Theory of Tonal Music | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-262-62107-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although GTTM is presented at the algorithmic level of abstraction rather than the implementational level, their ideas have found computational manifestations in a number of computational projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Jonah|author2=David Pesetsky|title=The Recursive Syntax and Prosody of Tonal Music|journal=Recursion: Structural Complexity in Language and Cognition|date=May 2009|volume=Conference at UMass Amherst|url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/Katz_Pesetsky_Recursion_Conference_Music.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamanaka|first=Masatoshi|author2=Hirata, Keiji |author3=Tojo, Satoshi |title=Implementing 'A Generative Theory of Tonal Music'|journal=Journal of New Music Research|date=2006|volume=35|issue=4|pages=249–277|doi=10.1080/09298210701563238}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For the German-speaking area, Laske's conception of cognitive musicology has been advanced by Uwe Seifert in his book ''Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft'' ("Systematic music theory and cognitive science. The foundation of cognitive musicology")&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Seifert: ''Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft''. Orpheus Verlag für systematische Musikwissenschaft, Bonn 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  and  subsequent publications.

== Music and language acquisition skills ==
Both music and speech rely on sound processing and require interpretation of several sound features such as timbre, pitch, duration, and their interactions (Elzbieta, 2015). A fMRI study revealed that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas, two areas that are known to activated during speech and language processing, were found activated while the subject was listening to unexpected musical chords (Elzbieta, 2015). This relation between language and music may explain why, it has been found that exposure to music has produced an acceleration in the development of behaviors related to the acquisition of language. The Suzuki music education which is very widely known, emphasizes learning music by ear over reading musical notation and preferably begins with formal lessons between the ages of 3 and 5 years. One fundamental reasoning in favor of this education points to a parallelism between natural speech acquisition and purely auditory based musical training as opposed to musical training due to visual cues. There is evidence that children who take music classes have obtained skills to help them in language acquisition and learning (Oechslin, 2015), an ability that relies heavily on the dorsal pathway. Other studies show an overall enhancement of verbal intelligence in children taking music classes. Since both activities tap into several integrated brain functions and have shared brain pathways it is understandable why strength in music acquisition might also correlate with strength in language acquisition.

== Music and pre-natal development ==
Extensive prenatal exposure to a melody has been shown to induce neural representations that last for several months. In a study done by Partanen in 2013, mothers in the learning group listened to the ‘Twinkle twinkle little star' melody 5 times per week during their last trimester. After birth and again at the age of 4 months, they played the infants in the control and learning group a modified melody in which some of the notes were changed. Both at birth and at the age of 4 months, infants in the ''learning group'' had stronger event related potentials to the unchanged notes than the ''control group''. Since listening to music at a young age can already map out neural representations that are lasting, exposure to music could help strengthen brain plasticity in areas of the brain that are involved in language and speech processing.

== Music therapy effect on cognitive disorders ==
If neural pathways can be stimulated with entertainment there is a higher chance that it will be more easily accessible. This illustrates why music is so powerful and can be used in such a myriad of different therapies. Music that is enjoyable to a person illicit an interesting response that we are all aware of. Listening to music is not perceived as a chore because it is enjoyable, however our brain is still learning and utilizing the same brain functions as it would when speaking or acquiring language. Music has the capability to be a very productive form of therapy mostly because it is stimulating, entertaining, and appears rewarding. Using fMRI, Menon and Levitin found for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing. This included the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus, and insula, which are all thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli (Gold, 2013).

Pitch perception was positively correlated with phonemic awareness and reading abilities in children (Flaugnacco, 2014). Likewise, the ability to tap to a rhythmic beat correlated with performance on reading and attention tests (Flaugnacco, 2014). These are only a fraction of the studies that have linked reading skills with rhythmic perception, which is shown in a meta-analysis of 25 cross-sectional studies that found a significant association between music training and reading skills (Butzlaff, 2000). Since the correlation is so extensive it is natural that researchers have tried to see if music could serve as an alternative pathway to strengthen reading abilities in people with developmental disorders such as dyslexia. Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by a long lasting difficulty in reading acquisition, specifically text decoding. Reading results have been shown to be slow and inaccurate, despite adequate intelligence and instruction. The difficulties have been shown to stem from a phonological core deficit that impacts reading comprehension, memory and prediction abilities (Flaugnacco, 2014). It was shown that music training modified reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. By improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, through training, phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia were improved. The OPERA hypothesis proposed by Patel (2011), states that since music places higher demands on the process than speech it bring brings adaptive brain plasticity of the same neural network involved in language processing.

Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological disorder that negatively impacts both motor and non-motor functions caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (Ashoori, 2015). This in turn leads to a DA deficiency in the basal ganglia. The deficiencies of dopamine in these areas of the brain have shown to cause symptoms such as tremors at rest, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability. They are also associated with impairments of internal timing of an individual (Ashoori, 2015). Rhythm is a powerful sensory cue that has shown to help regulate motor timing and coordination when there is a deficient internal timing system in the brain. Some studies have shown that musically cued gait training significantly improves multiple deficits of Parkinsons, including in gait, motor timing, and perceptual timing. Ashoori's study consisted of 15 non-demented patients with idiopathic Parkinson's who had no prior musical training and maintained their dopamine therapy during the trials. There were three 30-min training sessions per week for 1 month where the participants walked to the beats of German folk music without explicit instructions to synchronize their footsteps to the beat. Compared to pre-training gait performance, the Parkinson's patients showed significant improvement in gait velocity and stride length during the training sessions. The gait improvement was sustained for 1 month after training, which indicates a lasting therapeutic effect. Even though this was uncued it shows how the gait of these Parkinson's patients was automatically synchronized with the rhythm of the music. Also the lasting therapeutic effect shows that this might have affected the internal timing of the individual in a way that could not be accessed by other means.

{{For|the book by James McBride|The Color of Water}}
[[File:Strawberry splash.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=a glass of transparent water sitting on a wooden table|When water is in small quantities (e.g. in a glass) it appears [[wikt:colorless|colorless]] to the [[human eye]]]]
The '''color of water''' varies with the ambient conditions in which that water is present. While relatively small quantities of [[water]] appear to be [[Transparency and translucency|colorless]], pure water has a slight [[blue]] [[color]] that becomes a deeper blue as the thickness of the observed sample increases. The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective [[Electromagnetic absorption by water|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of white light. Dissolved [[chemical elements|elements]] or suspended impurities may give water a different color.

==Intrinsic colour==
[[File:SwimmingPoolAndBucket.jpg|thumb|right|An indoor swimming pool appears blue from above. as light reflecting from the bottom of the pool travels through enough water that its red component is absorbed. The same water in a smaller bucket looks only slightly blue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Davis |first=Jim |last2=Milligan |first2=Mark |year=2011 |title=Why is Bear Lake So Blue? |series=Public Information Series |volume=96 |publisher=[[Utah Geological Survey]] |url=http://geology.utah.gov/whatsnew/news/new0411b.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123163847/http://www.geology.utah.gov/whatsnew/news/new0411b.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2011 |isbn=978-1-55791-842-0 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observing the water at close range makes it appear colourless to the human eye.]]
The intrinsic colour of liquid water may be demonstrated by looking at a white light source through a long pipe that is filled with purified water and closed at both ends with a transparent window. The light [[Turquoise (colour)|turquoise]] blue colour is caused by weak [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] in the red part of the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{Citation |last=Braun |first=Charles L. |last2=Smirnov |first2=Sergei N. |year=1993 |title=Why is water blue? |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]] |volume=70 |issue=8 |pages=612–614 |url=http://inside.mines.edu/fs_home/dwu/classes/CH353/study/Why%20is%20Water%20Blue.pdf |doi=10.1021/ed070p612|bibcode = 1993JChEd..70..612B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pope |author2=Fry |title=Absorption spectrum (380-700nm) of pure water. II. Integrating cavity measurements |journal=Applied Optics |volume=36 |issue=33 |pages=8710–23 |year=1996 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-39-31-5843 |doi=10.1364/ao.36.008710 |pmid=18264420 |bibcode = 1997ApOpt..36.8710P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absorptions in the visible spectrum are usually attributed to excitations of [[Electron configuration|electronic]] energy states in matter. Water is a simple three-atom [[molecule]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and all its electronic absorptions occur in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and are therefore not responsible for the colour of water in the visible region of the spectrum. The water molecule has three fundamental modes of [[molecular vibrations|vibration]]. Two stretching vibrations of the O-H [[Chemical bond|bond]]s in the gaseous state of water occur at v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3650&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3755&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Absorption due to these vibrations occurs in the [[infrared]] region of the spectrum. The absorption in the visible spectrum is due mainly to the [[harmonic]] v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 14,318&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is equivalent to a wavelength of 698&amp;nbsp;nm. In liquid state at 20°C these vibrations are red-shifted due to hydrogen bonding, resulting in red absorption at 740&amp;nbsp;nm, other harmonics such as v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; giving red absorption at 660&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Braun" /&gt; The absorption curve for heavy water (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is of a similar shape, but is shifted further towards the infrared end of the spectrum, because the vibrational transitions have a lower energy. For this reason, heavy water does not absorb red light and thus large bodies of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O would lack the characteristic blue colour of the more commonly-found light water (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name="Webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolour/5B.html |title=Colours from Vibration |author=WebExhibits |work=Causes of Colour |publisher=[[WebExhibits]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223212434/http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolour/5B.html |archivedate=2017-02-23 |accessdate=2017-10-21 |quote=Heavy water is colourless because all of its corresponding vibrational transitions are shifted to lower energy (higher wavelength) by the increase in isotope mass. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absorption intensity decreases markedly with each successive overtone, resulting in very weak absorption for the third overtone. For this reason, the pipe needs to have a length of a meter or more and the water must be purified by [[microfiltration]] to remove any particles that could produce [[Mie scattering]].

==Color of lakes and oceans==
[[File:Ireland-AtlanticOceanwithAranIsland.jpg|thumb|left|Large bodies of water such as oceans manifest water's inherent blue color.]]
Lakes and oceans appear blue for several reasons.  One is that the surface of the water reflects the color of the sky. While this reflection contributes to the observed color, it is not the sole reason.{{sfn|Braun|Smirnov|1993|p=612|ps=:"...any simple answer is bound to mislead.  It turns out that contributions to the observed color are made both by reflected skylight and by the intrinsic absorption."}}

Some of the light hitting the surface of ocean is reflected but most of it penetrates the water surface, interacting with its molecules. The water molecule can vibrate in three different modes when irradiated by light. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so the remaining light seen is composed of the shorter wavelength blues and violets. This is the main reason the [[ocean color|ocean's color]] is blue.

Some constituents of sea water can influence the shade of blue of the ocean. This is why it can look greener or bluer in different areas. Water in swimming pools (which may also contain various chemicals) with white-painted sides and bottom will appear as a turquoise blue.

Clean water appears blue in white-tiled swimming pools as well as in indoor pools where there is no blue sky to be reflected. The deeper the pool, the bluer the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |last=Rossing |first=Thomas D. |last2=Chiaverina |first2=Christopher J. |date=1999 |title=Light science: physics and the visual arts |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-0-387-98827-6 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Scattering from suspended particles also plays an important role in the color of lakes and oceans.  A few tens of meters of water will absorb all light, so without scattering, all bodies of water would appear black. Because most lakes and oceans contain suspended living matter and mineral particles, known as [[colored dissolved organic matter]] (CDOM), light from above is reflected upwards. Scattering from suspended particles would normally give a white color, as with snow, but because the light first passes through many meters of blue-colored liquid, the scattered light appears blue. In extremely pure water—as is found in mountain lakes, where scattering from white-colored particles is missing—the scattering from water molecules themselves also contributes a blue color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[File:Ocean color 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The hue of the reflected sky also contributes to the perceived color of water.]]
Another phenomenon that occurs is [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the [[atmosphere]] along one's line of sight: the [[horizon]] is typically 4–5&amp;nbsp;km distant and the air (being just above [[sea level]] in the case of the ocean) is at its [[Density of air|densest]].  This mechanism would add a blue tinge to any distant object (not just the sea) because blue light would be scattered into one's line of sight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The surfaces of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight, making them appear bluer. The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle.{{sfn|Braun|Smirnov|1993|p=613 |ps=:"...the relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle." }}

==Color of glaciers==
{{Main article|Blue ice (glacial)}}

[[Glacier]]s are large bodies of [[ice]] and [[snow]] formed in [[Ice age|cold climates]] by processes involving the compaction of fallen snow. While snowy glaciers appear white from a distance, up close and when shielded from direct ambient light, glaciers usually appear a deep blue due to the long path lengths of the internal reflected light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Relatively small amounts of regular ice appear white because plenty of air bubbles are present, and also because small quantities of water appear to be colorless.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In glaciers, on the other hand, the pressure causes the air bubbles, trapped in the accumulated snow, to be squeezed out increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear blue, therefore a large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, would also appear blue.

==Color of water samples==
[[File:Havasu Falls 2 md.jpg|thumb|right|High concentrations of dissolved [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] give the water of [[Havasu Falls]] a turquoise color.]]
Dissolved and particulate material in water can cause discoloration. Slight discoloration is measured in Hazen units (HU).&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization, ISO 2211:1973, ''Measurement of colour in Hazen units (platinum-cobalt scale) of Liquid Chemical Products''&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities can be deeply colored as well, for instance dissolved [[organic compound]]s called [[tannin-stained waters|tannin]]s can result in dark brown colors, or [[algae]] floating in the water (particles) can impart a green color.

The color of a water sample can be reported as:
* ''Apparent color'' is the color of the whole water sample, and consists of color from both [[Solution|dissolved]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] components.
* ''True color'' is measured after filtering the water sample to remove all suspended material.

Testing for color can be a quick and easy test which often reflects the amount of organic material in the water, although certain inorganic components like iron or manganese can also impart color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Water color can reveal physical, chemical and bacteriological conditions. In drinking water, green can indicate copper leaching from copper plumbing and can also represent algae growth. Blue can also indicate copper, or might be caused by syphoning of industrial cleaners in the tank of commodes, commonly known as backflowing. Reds can be signs of rust from iron pipes or airborne bacteria from lakes, etc. Black water can indicate growth of sulfur-reducing bacteria inside a hot water tank set to too low a temperature. This usually has a strong sulfur or rotten egg (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) odor and is easily corrected by draining the water heater and increasing the temperature to {{convert|49|C|F}} or higher.  The odor will always be in the hot water pipes if sulfate reducing bacteria are the cause and never in the cold water plumbing.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The color spectrum with water indicators{{clarify|date=July 2012}} is wide and, if learned, can make identifying and solving cosmetic, bacteriological and chemical problems easier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Water quality and color==
[[File:Lake Pukaki and neighbours - STS088-721-15.jpg|thumb|left|Glacial [[rock flour]] makes New Zealand's [[Lake Pukaki]] a lighter turquoise than its neighbors.]]
The presence of color in water does not necessarily indicate that the water is not [[drinking water|drinkable]]. Color-causing substances such as [[tannin-stained waters|tannins]] may be harmless.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Color is not removed by typical [[water filter]]s; however, [[slow sand filter]]s can remove color, and the use of [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulants]] may also succeed in trapping the color-causing compounds within the resulting [[precipitate]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Other factors can affect the color seen:
*Particles and solutes can absorb light, as in tea or coffee. Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color. The Red Sea has occasional blooms of red ''[[Trichodesmium|Trichodesmium erythraeum]]'' algae.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
*Particles in water can scatter light.  The Colorado River is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water. Some mountain lakes and streams with finely ground rock, such as [[rock flour|glacial flour]], are turquoise.  Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water's absorption can return to the surface and be observed.  Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green, a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Color names==
[[File:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|Red tide off the California coast]]
Various cultures divide the [[semantic field]] of colors differently from the English language usage and some do not [[blue-green across cultures|distinguish between blue and green]] in the same way. An example is Welsh where ''glas'' can mean blue or green.

Other color names assigned to bodies of water are [[sea green]] and [[ultramarine]] blue. Unusual oceanic colorings have given rise to the terms [[red tide]] and [[oil spill|black tide]].

The Ancient Greek poet [[Homer]] uses the [[epithet]] "wine-dark sea"; in addition, he also describes the sea as "grey". [[Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age|William Ewart Gladstone]] has suggested that this is due to the [[Ancient Greek]]s classifying colors primarily by luminosity rather than hue, while others believe Homer was color-blind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}{{Portal|Water}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19392">'''Computational neurogenetic modeling (CNGM)''' is concerned with the study and development of dynamic [[neuronal modeling|neuronal models]] for modeling brain functions with respect to [[gene]]s and dynamic interactions between genes. These include [[neural network models]] and their integration with gene network models. This area brings together knowledge from various scientific disciplines, such as [[computer science|computer]] and [[information science]], [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive science]], [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], as well as [[engineering]].

== Levels of processing ==

=== Molecular kinetics ===
Models of the [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of proteins and [[ion channels]] associated with [[neuron]] activity represent the lowest level of modeling in a computational neurogenetic model. The altered activity of proteins in some diseases, such as the [[amyloid beta]] protein in [[Alzheimer's disease]], must be modeled at the molecular level to accurately predict the effect on cognition.&lt;ref name = pCNGM_AD &gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kasabov | last2 = Schliebs | last3 = Kojima | first1 = Nikola K. | first2 = Reinhard | first3 = Hiroshi | title = Probabilistic Computational Neurogenetic Modeling: From Cognitive Systems to Alzheimer's Disease | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | date = 2011 | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 300–311 | doi = 10.1109/tamd.2011.2159839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ion channels, which are vital to the propagation of [[action potentials]], are another molecule that may be modeled to more accurately reflect biological processes. For instance, to accurately model [[synaptic plasticity]] (the strengthening or weakening of [[synapse]]s) and memory, it is necessary to model the activity of the [[NMDA receptor]] (NMDAR). The speed at which the NMDA receptor lets Calcium ions into the cell in response to [[Glutamate]] is an important determinant of [[Long-term potentiation]] via the insertion of [[AMPA receptor]]s (AMPAR) into the [[plasma membrane]] at the synapse of the postsynaptic cell (the cell that receives the neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell).&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

=== Genetic regulatory network ===
[[Image:WagnerModel.png|thumb|right|An example of a [[Wagner's gene network model|model]] of a gene network. The genes, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''G''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are modified by either inhibitory signals, represented by bars and negative coefficients, or excitatory signals, represented by arrows and positive coefficients. The interactions are represented numerically by the matrix on the right, '''R'''.]]
In most models of neural systems neurons are the most basic unit modeled.&lt;ref name = book /&gt; In computational neurogenetic modeling, to better simulate processes that are responsible for synaptic activity and connectivity, the genes responsible are modeled for each [[neuron]].

A [[gene regulatory network]], protein regulatory network, or gene/protein regulatory network, is the level of processing in a computational neurogenetic model that models the interactions of [[gene]]s and proteins relevant to synaptic activity and general cell functions. Genes and proteins are modeled as individual [[Node (graph theory)|nodes]], and the interactions that influence a gene are modeled as excitatory (increases gene/protein expression) or inhibitory (decreases gene/protein expression) inputs that are weighted to reflect the effect a gene or protein is having on another gene or protein. Gene regulatory networks are typically designed using data from [[DNA microarrays|microarrays]].&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

Modeling of genes and proteins allows individual responses of neurons in an artificial neural network that mimic responses in biological nervous systems, such as division (adding new neurons to the artificial neural network), creation of proteins to expand their cell membrane and foster [[neurite]] outgrowth (and thus stronger connections with other neurons), up-regulate or down-regulate receptors at synapses (increasing or decreasing the weight (strength) of synaptic inputs), uptake more [[neurotransmitters]], change into different types of neurons, or die due to [[necrosis]] or [[apoptosis]]. The creation and analysis of these networks can be divided into two sub-areas of research: the 
gene up-regulation that is involved in the normal functions of a neuron, such as growth, metabolism, and synapsing; and the effects of mutated genes on neurons and cognitive functions.&lt;ref name = gene&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benuskova | first1 = L. | last2 = Kasabov | first2 = N. | year = 2008 | title = Modeling brain dynamics using computational neurogenetic approach | url = | journal = Cognitive Neurodynamics | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 319–334 | doi = 10.1007/s11571-008-9061-1 | pmc = 2585617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial neural network ===
[[Image:artificial neuron.png|thumb|right|A [[Artificial neuron|model]] of an individual neuron. The inputs, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, are modified by the input weights, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, and then combined into one input, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. The transfer function, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then uses this input to determine the output, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
An [[artificial neural network]] generally refers to any computational model that mimics the [[central nervous system]], with capabilities such as learning and pattern recognition. With regards to computational neurogenetic modeling, however, it is often used to refer to those specifically designed for biological accuracy rather than computational efficiency. Individual neurons are the basic unit of an artificial neural network, with each neuron acting as a node. Each node receives weighted signals from other nodes that are either [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]] or [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]]. To determine the output, a [[transfer function]] (or [[activation function]]) evaluates the sum of the weighted signals and, in some artificial neural networks, their input rate. Signal weights are strengthened ([[long-term potentiation]]) or weakened ([[long-term depression]]) depending on how synchronous the presynaptic and postsynaptic activation rates are ([[Hebbian theory]]).&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

The synaptic activity of individual neurons is modeled using equations to determine the temporal (and in some 
cases, spatial) summation of synaptic signals, [[membrane potential]], threshold for action potential 
generation, the absolute and relative [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], and optionally ion receptor channel [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] and [[Gaussian noise]] (to increase biological accuracy by incorporation of random elements). In addition to connectivity, some types of artificial neural networks, such as [[spiking neural network]]s, also model the distance between neurons, and its effect on the synaptic weight (the strength of a synaptic transmission).&lt;ref name=CN_sum /&gt;

=== Combining gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks ===
For the parameters in the gene regulatory network to affect the neurons in the artificial neural network as intended there must be some connection between them. In an organizational context, each node (neuron) in the artificial neural network has its own gene regulatory network associated with it. The weights (and in some networks, frequencies of synaptic transmission to the node), and the resulting membrane potential of the node (including whether an [[action potential]] is produced or not), affect the expression of different genes in the gene regulatory network. Factors affecting connections between neurons, such as [[synaptic plasticity]], can be modeled by inputting the values of synaptic activity-associated genes and proteins to a function that re-evaluates the weight of an input from a particular neuron in the artificial neural network.

=== Incorporation of other cell types ===
Other cell types besides neurons can be modeled as well. [[Glial cells]], such as [[astroglia]] and [[microglia]], as well as [[endothelial cells]], could be included in an artificial neural network. This would enable modeling of diseases where pathological effects may occur from sources other than neurons, such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name = pCNGM_AD /&gt;

== Factors affecting choice of artificial neural network ==
While the term artificial neural network is usually used in computational neurogenetic modeling to refer to models of the central nervous system meant to possess biological accuracy, the general use of the term can be applied to many gene regulatory networks as well.

=== Time variance ===
Artificial neural networks, depending on type, may or may not take into account the timing of inputs. Those that do, such as [[spiking neural network]]s, fire only when the pooled inputs reach a membrane potential is reached. Because this mimics the firing of biological neurons, spiking neural networks are viewed as a more biologically accurate model of synaptic activity.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

=== Growth and shrinkage ===
To accurately model the central nervous system, creation and death of neurons should be modeled as well.&lt;ref name = book /&gt; To accomplish this, constructive artificial neural networks that are able to grow or shrink to adapt to inputs are often used. [[Evolving classification function|Evolving connectionist systems]] are a subtype of constructive artificial neural networks ([[Evolving classification function|evolving]] in this case referring to changing the structure of its neural network rather than [[Evolutionary computation|by mutation and natural selection]]).&lt;ref name = ECoS /&gt;

=== Randomness ===
Both synaptic transmission and gene-protein interactions are [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] in nature. To model biological nervous systems with greater fidelity some form of randomness is often introduced into the network. Artificial neural networks modified in this manner are often labeled as probabilistic versions of their neural network sub-type (e.g., p[[spiking neural network|SNN]]).&lt;ref name = pSNN&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N. | last2 = Schliebs | first2 = S. | last3 = Mohemmed | first3 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Modelling the Effect of Genes on the Dynamics of Probabilistic Spiking Neural Networks for Computational Neurogenetic Modelling | url = | journal = Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics | volume = 7548 | issue = | pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-35686-5_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incorporation of fuzzy logic ===
[[Fuzzy logic]] is a system of reasoning that enables an artificial neural network to deal in non-[[Binary data|binary]] and linguistic variables. Biological data is often unable to be processed using [[Boolean logic]], and moreover accurate modeling of the capabilities of biological nervous systems requires fuzzy logic. Therefore, artificial neural networks that incorporate it, such as [[Evolving classification function|evolving fuzzy neural networks (EFuNN) or Dynamic Evolving Neural-Fuzzy Inference Systems (DENFIS)]], are often used in computational neurogenetic modeling. The use of fuzzy logic is especially relevant in gene regulatory networks, as the modeling of protein binding strength often requires non-binary variables.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;&lt;ref name = ECoS&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = Michael J | year = 2009 | title = A Decade of Kasabov's Evolving Connectionist Systems: A Review | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, And Cybernetics—Part C: Applications and Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 253–269 | doi = 10.1109/TSMCC.2008.2012254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of learning ===
Artificial Neural Networks designed to simulate of the human brain require an ability to learn a variety of tasks that is not required by those designed to accomplish a specific task. [[Supervised learning]] is a mechanism by which an artificial neural network can learn by receiving a number of inputs with a correct output already known. An example of an artificial neural network that uses supervised learning is a [[multilayer perceptron]] (MLP). In [[unsupervised learning]], an artificial neural network is trained using only inputs. Unsupervised learning is the learning mechanism by which a type of artificial neural network known as a [[self-organizing map]] (SOM) learns. Some types of artificial neural network, such as evolving connectionist systems, can learn in both a supervised and unsupervised manner.&lt;ref name = book /&gt;

== Improvement ==
Both gene regulatory networks and artificial neural networks have two main strategies for improving their accuracy. In both cases the output of the network is measured against known biological data using some function, and subsequent improvements are made by altering the structure of the network. A common test of accuracy for artificial neural networks is to compare some parameter of the model to data acquired from biological neural systems, such as from an [[EEG]].&lt;ref name = EEG&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Benuskova | first1 = L. | last2 = Wysoski | first2 = S. G. | last3 = Kasabov | first3 = N. | pages = 4638–4644 | title = Computational Neurogenetic Modeling: A Methodology to Study Gene Interactions Underlying Neural Oscillations | conference = 2006 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks | doi = 10.1109/IJCNN.2006.1716743 | location = Vancouver, BC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of EEG recordings, the [[local field potential]] (LFP) of the artificial neural network is taken and compared to EEG data acquired from human patients. The [[relative intensity ratios|relative intensity ratio]] (RIRs) and [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) of the EEG are compared with those generated by the artificial neural networks to determine the accuracy of the model.&lt;ref name = FFT&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N. | last2 = Benuskova | first2 = L. | last3 = Wysoski | first3 = S. G. | date = 2005 | title = Computational neurogenetic modeling: Integration of spiking neural networks, gene networks, and signal processing techniques | conference = Artificial Neural Networks: Formal Models and Their Applications - Icann 2005, Pt 2, Proceedings | volume = 3697 | pages = 509–514 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.106.5223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic algorithm ===
[[File:A-Numerical-Approach-to-Ion-Channel-Modelling-Using-Whole-Cell-Voltage-Clamp-Recordings-and-a-pcbi.0030169.sv001.ogv|thumb|right|An example of a model being refined through successive generations, using a genetic algorithm, to match experimental data.]]
Because the amount of data on the interplay of genes and neurons and their effects is not enough to construct a rigorous model, 
[[evolutionary computation]] is used to optimize artificial neural networks and gene regulatory networks, a common technique being the [[genetic algorithm]]. A genetic algorithm is a process that can be used to refine models by mimicking the process of natural selection observed in biological ecosystems. The primary advantages are that, due to not requiring derivative information, it can be applied to [[black box]] problems and [[Evolutionary multimodal optimization|multimodal optimization]]. The typical process for using genetic algorithms to refine a gene 
regulatory network is: first, create a population; next, to create offspring via a crossover operation and 
evaluate their fitness; then, on a group chosen for high fitness, simulate mutation via a mutation operator; 
finally, taking the now mutated group, repeat this process until a desired level of fitness is demonstrated.
&lt;ref name = evol&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N | year = 2006 | title = Neuro-, genetic-, and quantum inspired evolving intelligent systems | url = | journal = International Symposium on Evolving Fuzzy Systems, Proceedings | volume = | issue = | pages = 63–73 | doi = 10.1109/ISEFS.2006.251165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolving systems ===
Methods by which artificial neural networks may alter their structure without simulated mutation and fitness selection have been developed. A [[Evolving classification function|dynamically evolving neural network]] is one approach, as the creation of new connections and new neurons can 
be modeled as the system adapts to new data. This enables the network to evolve in modeling accuracy without simulated natural selection. One method by which dynamically evolving networks may be optimized, called evolving layer neuron aggregation, combines neurons with sufficiently similar input weights into one neuron. This can take place during the training of the network, referred to as online aggregation, or between periods of training, referred to as offline aggregation. Experiments have suggested that offline aggregation is more efficient.&lt;ref name = ECoS /&gt;

== Potential applications ==
A variety of potential applications have been suggested for accurate computational neurogenetic models, such as simulating genetic diseases, examining the impact of potential treatments,&lt;ref name = nano&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kasabov | first1 = N. | last2 = Benuskova | first2 = L. | last3 = Wysoski | first3 = S.

The simulation of disease states is of particular interest, as modeling both the neurons and their genes and proteins allows linking genetic mutations and protein abnormalities to pathological effects in the central nervous system. Among those diseases suggested as being possible targets of computational neurogenetic modeling based analysis are epilepsy, schizophrenia, mental retardation, brain aging and Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name = book&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Benuskova | last2 = Kasabov | first1 = Lubica | first2 = Nikola | date = 2007 | title = Computational Neurogenetic Modeling | location = New York | publisher = Springer | ISBN = 0-387-48353-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Cybernetic art''' is [[contemporary art]] that builds upon the legacy of [[Cybernetics]], where feedback involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.

==History==
[[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s ''CYSP I'' (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words "CYbernetic" and "SPatiodynamic").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CYSP I, the first cybernetic sculpture of art's history|url=http://www.olats.org/schoffer/cyspe.htm|publisher=Leonardo/OLATS - Observatoire Leonardo des arts et des technosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Roy Ascott]] elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in  "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including "[http://www.artexetra.com//CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Energy to Information: Representation in Science, Technology, Art, and Literature|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|pages=255–277|editor=Bruce Clarke and Linda Dalrymple Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of [[Roy Ascott]]"(2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A. Shanken}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to [[telematic art]] (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to [[net.art]].)

Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of [[Robert Breer]] and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In "Beyond Modern Sculpture" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading art theorists and historians in this field include [[Christiane Paul]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Margot Lovejoy]], [[Edmond Couchot]], [[Fred Forest]] and [[Edward A. Shanken]].

The '''Danish Maritime Safety Administration''' (DaMSA) ({{lang-da|Farvandsvæsenet}}) was a department of the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]] with administration located in [[Christianshavn]], [[Copenhagen]]. DaMSA operated throughout Denmark as part of the Danish [[search and rescue|Search and Rescue]] (SAR) organization that runs 21 rescue stations located along the coasts of Denmark.

Responsibilities of DaMSA included authorizing [[navigation]] systems and [[buoy]]age, resolving issues concerning [[Shipwreck|wreck]]s and their [[Marine salvage|salvage]] in Danish waters, and running the [[Danish Pilotage Service]] (Lodsvæsenet). DaMSA was the [[Centre for Operational Oceanography (Denmark)|Centre for Operational Oceanography]], which collects hydrographical and oceanographic data from all national waters, and makes charts and maps for use by the [[Danish Defence|Military of Denmark]] and civilians. DaMSA was a full member of the [[North West Shelf Operational Oceanographic System]].

==History==
[[File:Farvandsvaesenet.20090713(007).jpg|left|thumb|200px|Farvandsvæsenet is headquartered in Søkvæsthuset.]]
On 1 April 1973 ''Farvandsdirektoratet'' was established by merging the following organizations: Danish Lighthouse Service  (Fyrvæsenet), Danish Pilotage Service  (Lodsvæsenet), Danish Rescue Service (Redningsvæsenet) and the  [[Det Kongelige danske Søkortarkiv|Royal Danish Nautical charts archive]] (Det Kongelige danske Søkortarkiv).

During the late 1970s and 1980s, the name Farvandsdirektoratet was changed to Farvandsvæsenet. Farvandsdirektoratet remained a used and accepted name.

In 1987 the Royal Danish Nautical charts archive was detached for merger with the [[National Survey and Cadastre of Denmark]]. All of these services have a long history on their own, reaching back to 1560.

On 1 April 2008 Farvandsvæsenet changed its English name from ''Royal Danish Administration of Navigation and Hydrography'' (RDANH) to ''Danish Maritime Safety Administration'' (DaMSA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iho.shom.fr/REG_HYD_COM/NSHC/28th_Meeting/NSHC28_EN_B1-1_DK_Hydrographic_National_Report_2008.pdf Hydrographic National Report of Denmark, April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
Farvandsvaesenet occupied the buildings named Søkvæsthuset and Bakkehuset. Bakkehuset is known for housing the Danish poet [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]].[[Image:JohanLudvigHeibergOgJohanneLuiseHeibergPlaque.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Plaque on Bakkehuset]]

==Mission and tasks==
The mission of the '''Danish Maritime Safety Administration''' was to assure the safety of navigation at sea in Danish, Faroese and Greenlandic waters. DaMSA achieved this mission through execution of the following tasks: Exercise jurisdiction and issue nautical publications; Provide aids to navigation; Provide coastal rescue; Provide [[pilotage]]; Conduct [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographical survey]]s and provide oceanographic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danish Maritime Safety Administration|url=http://www.efficiensea.org/default.asp?Action=Details&amp;Item=415|accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DaMSA was a member of the [[SeaDataNet]] European Directory of Marine Organizations, providing bathymetric measurements in Danish
and Greenlandic waters. Five surveying ships are present working in Danish waters, all equipped with a shallow water multibeam system. Two surveying ships (one with multibeam) are stationed in Greenland with working area on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SeaDataNet European Directory of Marine Organizations|url=http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?check_n_code=465&amp;page_size=10&amp;page_count=3&amp;screen=0&amp;rs_found=41&amp;key=27|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
The Maritime Safety Administration was abolished by royal decree of 3 October 2011. Its tasks were redistributed: pilotage service and maritime buoyage were transferred to the [[Minister of Economic and Business Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs]], oceanography was transferred to the [[Ministry of Climate and Energy (Denmark)|Ministry of Climate and Energy]] and hydrographic surveying was transferred to the [[Ministry of Environment (Denmark)|Ministry of Environment]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1981">'''Deliberative rhetoric''' (sometimes called '''legislative oratory''') is a [[rhetorical device]] that juxtaposes potential future outcomes to communicate support or opposition for a given action or policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|chapter=Deliberative Oratory|chapter-url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu|title=Silva Rhetoricae: The Forest of Rhetoric|first=Gideon O.|last=Burton|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In deliberative rhetoric, an argument is made using examples from the past to predict future outcomes in order to illustrate that a given policy or action will either be harmful or beneficial in the future.&lt;ref name=Nordquist/&gt; It differs from [[deliberative democracy]], which is a form of governmental discourse or institution that prioritizes public debate.

In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' (4th century BCE), [[Aristotle]] wrote that deliberative rhetoric is relevant in political debate&lt;ref name=Nordquist&gt;{{cite|title=What Are the 3 Branches of Rhetoric?|first=Richard|last=Nordquist|date=April 30, 2016|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/qaaboutrhetoric/f/What-Are-The-Three-Branches-Of-Rhetoric.htm|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the "political orator is concerned with the future: it is about things to be done hereafter that he advises, for or against."&lt;ref name="Aristotle" /&gt; According to Aristotle, political orators make an argument for a particular position on the grounds that the future results will be in the public's best interest. He wrote that a politician "aims at establishing the expediency or the harmfulness of a proposed course of action; if he urges its acceptance, he does so on the ground that it will do good; if he urges its rejection, he does so on the ground that it will do harm."&lt;ref name="Aristotle"&gt;{{cite|last=Aristotle|title=Rhetoric|translator-first=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14147">'''Digital infinity''' is a technical term in [[theoretical linguistics]]. Alternative formulations are "discrete infinity" and "the infinite use of finite means". The idea is that all human languages follow a simple logical principle, according to which a limited set of digits—irreducible atomic sound elements—are combined to produce an infinite range of potentially meaningful expressions. 

[[Image:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|300px|right|Frontispiece and title page of the ''Dialogue'']]{{quotation|'Language is, at its core, a system that is both digital and infinite. To my knowledge, there is no other biological system with these properties....'|{{Citation|title=''Noam Chomsky''}}&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky, 1991. Linguistics and Cognitive Science: Problems and Mysteries. in Asa Kasher (ed.), ''The Chomskyan Turn.'' Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 26-53, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quotation|‘It remains for us to examine the spiritual element of speech ... this marvelous invention of composing from twenty-five or thirty sounds an infinite variety of words, which, although not having any resemblance in themselves to that which passes through our minds, nevertheless do not fail to reveal to others all of the secrets of the mind, and to make intelligible to others who cannot penetrate into the mind all that we conceive and all of the diverse movements of our souls.’|{{Citation|title=''[[Antoine Arnauld]] and Claude Lancelot''}}&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Arnauld and Claude Lancelot, 1975 (1660). ''The Port-Royal Grammar.'' The Hague: Mouton, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Noam Chomsky]] cites [[Galileo]] as perhaps the first to recognise the significance of digital infinity. This principle, notes Chomsky, is "the core property of human language, and one of its most distinctive properties: the use of finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts". In his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogo]]'', Galileo describes with wonder the discovery of a means to communicate one's "most secret thoughts to any other person ... with no greater difficulty than the various collocations of twenty-four little characters upon a paper." This is the greatest of all human inventions, Galileo continues, comparable to the creations of a Michelangelo...&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky" /&gt;

== The computational theory of mind ==
'Digital infinity' corresponds to Noam Chomsky's '[[universal grammar]]' mechanism, conceived as a computational [[Language module|module]] inserted somehow into ''Homo sapiens''{{'}} otherwise 'messy' (non-digital) brain. This conception of human cognition—central to the so-called '[[cognitive revolution]]' of the 1950s and 1960s—is generally attributed to [[Alan Turing]], who was the first scientist to argue that a man-made machine might truly be said to 'think'. The idea of a thinking machine had previously been considered absurd, having been famously dismissed by [[René Descartes]] as ''theoretically'' impossible. Neither animals nor machines can think, insisted Descartes, since they lack a God-given soul.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Descartes, 1985 [1637]. 'Discourse on the Method.' In ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes.'' Translated by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Vol. 1, pp. 139-141. &lt;/ref&gt; Turing was well aware of this traditional theological objection, and explicitly countered it.&lt;ref name="Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today's digital computers are instantiations of Turing's theoretical breakthrough in conceiving the possibility of a man-made ''universal thinking machine''—known nowadays as a '[[Turing machine]]'. No physical mechanism can be intrinsically 'digital', Turing explained, since—examined closely enough—its possible states will vary without limit. But if most of these states can be profitably ignored, leaving only a limited set of relevant distinctions, then ''functionally'' the machine may be considered 'digital':&lt;ref name="Turing"/&gt; {{quotation|'The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the "discrete-state machines." These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking, there are no such machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them.' |{{Citation|title=''Alan Turing''}}&lt;ref name="Alan Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An implication is that 'digits' don't exist: they and their combinations are no more than convenient fictions, operating on a level quite independent of the material, physical world. In the case of a ''binary'' digital machine, the choice at each point is restricted to 'off' versus 'on'. Crucially, the intrinsic properties of the [[Media (communication)|medium]] used to encode signals then have no effect on the message conveyed. 'Off' (or alternatively 'on') remains unchanged regardless of whether the signal consists of smoke, electricity, sound, light or anything else. In the case of analog (more-versus-less) gradations, this is not so because the range of possible settings is unlimited. Moreover, in the analog case it ''does'' matter which particular medium is being employed: equating a certain intensity of smoke with a corresponding intensity of light, sound or electricity is just not possible. In other words, only in the case of ''digital'' computation and communication can information be truly independent of the physical, chemical or other properties of the materials used to encode and transmit messages.

Digital computation and communication operates, then, independently of the physical properties of the computing machine. As scientists and philosophers during the 1950s digested the implications, they exploited the insight to explain why 'mind' apparently operates on so different a level from 'matter'. Descartes celebrated distinction between immortal 'soul' and mortal 'body' was conceptualised, following Turing, as no more than the distinction between (digitally encoded) ''information'' on the one hand, and, on the other, the particular physical ''medium''—light, sound, electricity or whatever—chosen to transmit the corresponding signals. Note that the Cartesian assumption of mind's independence of matter implied—in the human case at least—the existence of some kind of digital computer operating inside the human brain. 

{{quotation|'Information and computation reside in patterns of data and in relations of logic that are independent of the physical medium that carries them. When you telephone your mother in another city, the message stays the same as it goes from your lips to her ears even as it physically changes its form, from vibrating air, to electricity in a wire, to charges in silicon, to flickering light in a fibre optic cable, to electromagnetic waves, and then back again in reverse order. ... Likewise, a given programme can run on computers made of vacuum tubes, electromagnetic switches, transistors, integrated circuits, or well-trained pigeons, and it accomplishes the same things for the same reasons.

This insight, first expressed by the mathematician Alan Turing, the computer scientists Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, and Marvin Minsky, and the philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor, is now called the [[computational theory of mind]]. It is one of the great ideas in intellectual history, for it solves one of the puzzles that make up the 'mind-body problem', how to connect the ethereal world of meaning and intention, the stuff of our mental lives, with a physical hunk of matter like the brain. ... For millennia this has been a paradox. ... The computational theory of mind resolves the paradox.'|{{Citation|title=''Steven Pinker''}}&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, 1997. ''How the Mind Works.'' London: Allen Lane, Penguin, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==A digital apparatus==
Turing did not claim that the human mind really is a digital computer. More modestly, he proposed that digital computers might one day qualify in human eyes as machines endowed with "mind". However, it was not long before philosophers (most notably [[Hilary Putnam]]) took what seemed to be the next logical step—arguing that the human mind ''itself'' is a digital computer, or at least that certain mental "modules" are best understood that way.

[[Noam Chomsky]] rose to prominence as one of the most audacious champions of this 'cognitive revolution'. Language, he proposed, is a computational 'module' or 'device' unique to the human brain. Previously, linguists had thought of language as learned cultural behaviour: chaotically variable, inseparable from social life and therefore beyond the remit of natural science. The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, had defined linguistics as a branch of 'semiotics', this in turn being inseparable from anthropology, sociology and the study of man-made conventions and institutions. By picturing language instead as the ''natural'' mechanism of 'digital infinity', Chomsky promised to bring scientific rigour to linguistics as a branch of strictly ''natural'' science.

[[Image:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|300px|right|The human speech apparatus in sagittal section]]In the 1950s, phonology was generally considered the most rigorously scientific branch of linguistics. For phonologists, "digital infinity" was made possible by the human vocal apparatus conceptualised as a kind of machine consisting of a small number of binary switches. For example, "voicing" could be switched 'on' or 'off', as could palatisation, nasalisation and so forth. Take the consonant [b], for example, and switch voicing to the 'off' position—and you get [p]. Every possible phoneme in any of the world's languages might in this way be generated by specifying a particular on/off configuration of the switches ('articulators') constituting the human vocal apparatus. This approach became celebrated as '[[distinctive features]]' theory, in large part credited to the Russian linguist and polymath [[Roman Jakobson]]. The basic idea was that every phoneme in every natural language could in principle be reduced to its irreducible atomic components—a set of 'on' or 'off' choices ('distinctive features') allowed by the design of a digital apparatus consisting of the human tongue, soft palate, lips, larynx and so forth. 

Chomsky's original work was in [[Morphophonology|morphophonemics]]. During the 1950s, he became inspired by the prospect of extending Roman Jakobson's 'distinctive features' approach—now hugely successful—far beyond its original field of application. Jakobson had already persuaded a young social anthropologist—[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]—to apply distinctive features theory to the study of kinship systems, in this way inaugurating 'structural anthropology'. Chomsky—who got his job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thanks to the intervention of Jakobson and his student, Morris Halle—hoped to explore the extent to which similar principles might be applied to the various sub-disciplines of linguistics, including syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 64-127.&lt;/ref&gt; If the phonological component of language was demonstrably rooted in a digital biological 'organ' or 'device', why not the syntactic and semantic components as well? Might not language as a whole prove to be a digital organ or device?

This led some of Chomsky's early students to the idea of '[[generative semantics]]'—the proposal that the speaker generates word and sentence meanings by combining irreducible constituent elements of meaning, each of which can be switched 'on' or 'off'. To produce 'bachelor', using this logic, the relevant component of the brain must switch 'animate', 'human' and 'male' to the 'on' '''(+)''' position while keeping 'married' switched 'off' '''(-)'''. The underlying assumption here is that the requisite conceptual primitives—irreducible notions such as 'animate', 'male', 'human', 'married' and so forth—are genetically determined internal components of the human language organ. While this idea would rapidly encounter intellectual difficulties—sparking controversies culminating in the so-called '[[linguistics wars]]'&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. A. 1993. ''The Linguistics Wars.'' New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;—it attracted young and ambitious scholars impressed by the recent emergence of computer science and its promise of scientific parsimony and unification. If the theory worked, the simple principle of digital infinity would apply to language as a whole. Linguistics in its entirety might then lay claim to the coveted status of ''natural'' science. No part of the discipline—not even semantics—need be contaminated any longer by association with such 'un-scientific' disciplines as cultural anthropology or social science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12268">'''Engineering psychology''', also known as Human Factors Engineering, is the science of [[human behavior]] and capability, applied to the design and operation of systems and technology.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;
As an applied field of [[psychology]] and an interdisciplinary part of [[ergonomics]], it aims to improve the [[Human–machine system|relationships between people and machines]] by redesigning equipment, interactions, or the environment in which they take place. The work of an engineering psychologist is often described as making the relationship more "user-friendly."

== History ==
Engineering psychology was created from within [[experimental psychology]].&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; Engineering psychology started during World War I (1914).&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz"/&gt; The reason why this subject was developed during this time was because many of America’s weapons were failing;  bombs not falling in the right place to weapons attacking normal marine life.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; The fault was traced back to human errors.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; One of the first designs to be built to restrain human error was the use of [[psychoacoustics]] by S.S. Stevens and L.L. Beranek were two of the first American psychologists called upon to help change how people and machinery worked together.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; One of their first assignments was to try and reduce noise levels in military aircraft. The work was directed at improving intelligibility of military communication systems and appeared to have been very successful. However it was not until after August 1945 that levels of research in engineering psychology began to increase significantly.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt; This occurred because the research that started in 1940 now began to show.&lt;ref name="Grether"/&gt;

[[Lillian Gilbreth]] combined the talents of an [[engineer]], [[psychologist]] and mother of twelve.  Her appreciation of [[human factor]]s made her successful in the implementation of [[time and motion]] studies and [[scientific management]].  She went on to pioneer [[ergonomic]]s in the kitchen, inventing the [[pedal bin]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A brief history of modern psychology |author=Ludy T. Benjamin |page=105 |chapter=Lillian Gilbreth's Engineering Psychology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-3205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the two world wars generated much formal study of human factors which affected the efficiency of munitions output and warfare.  In World War I, the Health of Munitions Workers Committee was created in 1915.  This made recommendations based upon studies of the effects of overwork on efficiency which resulted in policies of providing breaks and limiting hours of work, including avoidance of work on Sunday.  The [[Industrial Fatigue Research Board]] was created in 1918 to take this work forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Employers, the government, and industrial fatigue in Britain, 1890-1918 |first=A.J. |last=McIvor |journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine |year=1987 |volume=44 |pages=724–732 |doi=10.1136/oem.44.11.724|pmc=1007909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In WW2, researchers at Cambridge University such as [[Frederic Bartlett]] and [[Kenneth Craik]] started work on the operation of equipment in 1939 and this resulted in the creation of the [[Unit for Research in Applied Psychology]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/history/legacyconference/briefingnotes.html |title=Notes on the work of the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Unit 1944-1997 |chapter=Formation of the APU |publisher=MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Applied psychology]] - The use of psychological principles to overcome problems in other domains.  It has been argued that engineering psychology is separate from applied (cognitive) psychology because advances in cognitive psychology have infrequently informed engineering psychology research.  Surprisingly, work in engineering psychology often seems to inform developments in cognitive psychology.  For example, engineering psychology research has enabled cognitive psychologists to explain why [[GUI]]s seem easier to use than character-based computer interfaces (such as [[DOS]]).&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=N.|title=Engineering Psychology: Another Science of Common Sense?|journal=The Psychologist|year=1996|volume=9|issue=7|pages=300–303|url=http://www.katiandgraham.com/eng_psy.htm|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering Psychology, Ergonomics, &amp; Human Factors ===
Although the comparability of these terms and many others have been a topic of debate, the differences of these fields can be seen in the applications of the respective fields.

Engineering psychology is concerned with the adaptation of the equipment and environment to people, based upon their psychological capacities and limitations with the objective of improving overall system performance, involving human and machine elements&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt; Engineering psychologists strive to match equipment requirements with the capabilities of human operators by changing the design of the equipment.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schultz| first = D| authorlink = |author2=Schultz, E.| title = Psychology and work today | publisher = Pearson |location=New Jersey | year = 2010| url = | isbn = 978-0-205-68358-1 | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this matching was the redesign of the mailbags used by letter carriers. Engineering psychologists discovered that mailbag with a waist-support strap, and a double bag that requires the use of both shoulders, reduces muscle fatigue.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz" /&gt; Another example involves the cumulative trauma disorders grocery checkout workers suffered as the result of repetitive wrist movements using electronic scanners. Engineering psychologists found that the optimal checkout station design would allow for workers to easily use either hand to distribute the workload between both wrists.&lt;ref name="Schultz &amp; Schultz" /&gt;

The field of [[ergonomics]] is based on scientific studies of ordinary people in work situations and is applied to the design of processes and machines, to the layout of work places, to methods of work, and to the control of the physical environment, in order to achieve greater efficiency of both men and machines&lt;ref name="Human Factors"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Licht, | first = D| authorlink = |author2=D.

At one point in time, the term [[human factors]] was used in place of ergonomics in Europe.&lt;ref name="Grether"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Grether| first = F| authorlink = | title = Engineering psychology in the United States| journal = American Psychologist |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=743–751| publisher = | year = 1962| url = | format = | doi = 10.1037/h0026850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human factors involve interdisciplinary scientific research and studies to seek to realize greater recognition and understanding of the worker's characteristics, needs, abilities, and limitations when the procedures and products of technology are being designed.&lt;ref name="Human Factors" /&gt; This field utilizes knowledge from several fields such as mechanical engineering, psychology, and industrial engineering&lt;ref name="Human Factors" /&gt; to design instruments.

[[Human factors]] is broader than engineering psychology, which is focused specifically on designing systems that accommodate the information-processing capabilities of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Wickens, C. and Hollands, J. (1999), ''Engineering Psychology and Human Performance'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-321-04711-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the work in the respective fields differ, there are some similarities between these. These fields share the same objectives which are to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency with which human activities are conducted as well as to improve the general quality of life through increased safety, reduced fatigue and stress, increased comfort, and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;

===Importance of Engineering Psychologists===

Engineering psychologists contribute to the design of a variety of products, including dental and surgical tools, cameras, toothbrushes and car-seats. They have been involved in the re-design of the mailbags used by letter carriers. More than 20% of letter carriers suffer from [[musculoskeletal injury]] such as lower back pain from carrying mailbags slung over their shoulders. A mailbag with a waist-support strap, and a double bag that requires the use of both shoulders, has been shown to reduce muscle fatigue.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Research by engineering psychologists has demonstrated that using cell-phones while driving degrades performance by increasing driver reaction time, particularly among older drivers, and can lead to higher accident risk among drivers of all ages. Research findings such as these have supported governmental regulation of cell-phone use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane P.

The institution is part of [[IONIS Education Group]].

== History ==

Epitech was created in 1999, taking advantage of the keen interest of the ''[[École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées]]'' to train students with a specific interest for computer sciences related matter only.

In 2007, Epitech opened new campuses in [[Casablanca]], [[Dalian]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lille]], [[Lyon]], [[Nantes]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Toulouse]].
Since January 2008, the degree delivered has been recognized by the ''[[Commission nationale de la certification professionnelle]]'',&lt;ref name="arrete"&gt;{{cite web| title=Arrêté du 16 janvier 2008 portant enregistrement au répertoire national des certifications professionnelles | location=France | language=French| url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=FADF1CA86320AE687B52F19AB774F9F8.tpdjo13v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000017981284&amp;categorieLien=id | date=24 January 2008 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | publisher=[Legifrance.gouv.fr] }}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Nomenclature des niveaux de formation|level 1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rncp.cncp.gouv.fr/grand-public/visualisationFiche?format=fr&amp;fiche=5588 Le Répertoire National des Certifications Professionnelles (RNCP) - Résumé descriptif de la certification]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the campuses of [[Nice]], [[Montpellier]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Marseille]] and [[Rennes]] were opened.
Since 2009, the school has been recognized by France.&lt;ref name="legifrance" /&gt;

=== New campuses abroad ===
In early 2013, Epitech announced it would open a campus in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in September 2013 and further international branches in [[California]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]] by September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Le groupe d'enseignement privé Ionis s'ancre à l'international |url=http://www.lemondeinformatique.fr/actualites/lire-le-groupe-d-enseignement-prive-ionis-s-ancre-a-l-international-52506.html |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|1}}

== Partnership ==
EPITECH has partnered with the ''Zup de Co'' association to create the ''[[Web@cademie]]'', a 2-year training completely free for students without the [[French Baccalaureate]] and with a strong motivation in [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://pro.01net.com/editorial/588287/la-web-academie-accueille-sa-troisieme-promotion-d-eleves-decrocheurs/ La Web Académie accueille sa troisième promotion d’élèves « décrocheurs »]&lt;/ref&gt; This course has the goal to attain a job of [[software developer]] for young people who have stopped their regular studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lemouv.fr/diffusion-une-ecole-unique-en-france-la-web-academie Une école unique en France: la "web académie"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are trained by EPITECH teachers at [[Le Kremlin-Bicêtre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101645556-l-ecole-qui-reconnecte-les-decrocheurs L'école qui reconnecte les décrocheurs]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.digischool.fr/formation/la-webcademie-ouvrira-ses-portes-a-lyon-en-avril-2013-13694.php La Web@cademie ouvrira ses portes à Lyon en avril 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diploma ==
At the end of the five-year course, students receive the title of "Expert of Information Technologies" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.epitech.eu/blogs/diplome-epitech-homologue-niveau1-bac-5-art445.html&lt;/ref&gt; who is recognized by French [[Commission Nationale de la Certification Professionnelle|CNCP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letudiant.fr/etudes/ecole-ingenieur/ma-vie-detudiant-en-ecole-dinformatique-selon-zeid-en-3e-annee-a-epitech-13172/apres-epitech-quelle-insertion-professionnelle-17157.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because the school is not certified by the [[Commission des Titres d'Ingénieur]], this professional certification should not be confused in France with a degree of master (like an engineering diploma or a master diploma of public french universities)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-paris-idf.fr/formation/orientation-jeunes/reussir-son-orientation-professionnelle/comment-savoir-diplome-reconnu-par-etat-ou-entreprises-formation&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Flexible glass''' is a legendary [[lost invention]] from the time of the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius Caesar]] (between 14–37 AD). As recounted by [[Isidore of Seville]], the craftsman who invented the technique brought a drinking bowl made of flexible glass before Caesar who tried to break it, whereupon the material [[Indentation hardness|dented]], rather than [[wikt:shatter|shattering]]. The inventor then repaired the bowl easily with a small [[hammer]]. After the inventor swore to the Emperor that he alone knew the technique of manufacture, Tiberius had the man [[behead]]ed, fearing such material could undermine the value of [[gold]] and [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The story of the sad fate of the inventor of [[unbreakable glass]] (vitrum flexile) at the hands of [[Tiberius]] (42 BC–37 AD) was first related by two more-or-less contemporary compilers, namely [[Petronius]] (c. 27–66 AD, ''[[Satyricon]]'' 51) and [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD, Naturalis Historia XXXVI.lxvi.195). Pliny apparently did not believe in vitrum flexile, remarking that the story is, "more frequently told than it is reliable". [[Cassius Dio]] (c. AD 150–235, Historia Romana 57.21.7) also told a similar story, writing that ‘an architect whose name no one knows’ whom Tiberius had exiled out of jealousy for his skill, ‘approached him to crave pardon, and while doing so purposely let fall a crystal goblet; and though it was bruised in some way or shattered, yet by passing his hands over it he promptly exhibited it whole once more. For this he hoped to obtain pardon, but instead the emperor put him to death.’ The story was picked up and retold by [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560–636, Etymologiae XVI.16.6, ‘De vitro’). Subsequently the 13th century collection of technical recipes by the pseudo-Heraclius included this story, in the section treating glass recipes, using Isidore’s own words (De coloribus et artibus Romanorum III.vi [256]). This is thus an example of ‘technical knowledge’ wending its way from historical gossip (Petronius), to a technical encyclopaedia (Pliny, with reservations), and then via a philological text (Isidore) to a collection of practical craft recipes (pseudo-Heraclius).

'''Gilbert Ryle''' (19 August 1900 – 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gilbert-Ryle|title=Gilbert Ryle {{!}} British philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a representative of the generation of British [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosopher]]s who shared [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s approach to philosophical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]] (''Wittgenstein,'' Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1988, p.114) is certain that, despite the fact that Wittgenstein's work ''might'' have possibly played some "''second or third-hand [part in the promotion of] the philosophical concern for language which was dominant in the mid-century''", ''neither'' Gilbert Ryle ''nor'' any of those in the so-called "[[Ordinary language philosophy]]" school that is chiefly associated with [[J. L. Austin]] (and, according to Grayling, [[G. E. Moore]], [[C. D. Broad]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[A. J. Ayer]]) were Wittgensteinians. Grayling asserts that "''most of them were largely unaffected by Wittgenstein's later ideas, and some were actively hostile to them''"&lt;/ref&gt; and is principally known for his critique of [[Cartesian dualism]], for which he coined the phrase "the [[ghost in the machine]]." Some of his ideas in the philosophy of mind have been referred to as "behaviourist." Ryle's best known book is ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), in which he writes that the "general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as 'behaviourist'."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, Gilbert.''The Concept of Mind''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002. Pp. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryle, having engaged in detailed study of the key works of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Franz Brentano]], [[Alexius Meinong]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], himself suggested instead that the book "could be described as a sustained essay in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], if you are at home with that label."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Ryle, "Phenomenology versus ''The Concept of Mind''," in ''Collected Papers'', London: Hutchinson, 1971, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ryle was born in [[Brighton]], England, in 1900, and grew up in an environment of learning. His father was a Brighton doctor, a generalist who had interests in philosophy and [[astronomy]], and passed on to his children an impressive library. Ryle was educated at [[Brighton College]], and in 1919 he went up to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] to study [[Classics]] but was quickly drawn to Philosophy. He graduated with a "triple first": first-class honours in classical honour moderations (1921), ''literae humaniores'' (1923), and politics, philosophy, and economics (1924), and was appointed as lecturer in philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1925. A year later, he became a Student ([[Fellow]]) and tutor at Christ Church, where he remained until 1940.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Tanney | first = Julia | title = Gilbert Ryle | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher = The Metaphysics Research Lab | location = Stanford, CA | date = Winter 2003 | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/ | accessdate = 5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II he was commissioned in the Welsh Guards. A capable linguist, he was recruited into [[military intelligence|intelligence]] work and by the end of the war had been promoted to the rank of Major. After the war he returned to Oxford and was elected [[Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] and Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He published his principal work, ''The Concept of Mind'' in 1949. He was President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1945 to 1946, and editor of the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' from 1947 to 1971. Ryle died on 6 October 1976 at [[Whitby]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

His brothers [[John Alfred Ryle|John Alfred]] (1889–1950) and George Bodley (1902–1978), both educated at [[Brighton College]] as well, also had eminent careers. John became [[Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Physic]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] 1935–45 and physician to King George V. George, after serving as Director of Forestry first for Wales and then England, was Deputy-Director of the [[Forestry Commission]] 1963–65 and appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]].

==Work==
===''The Concept of Mind''===
{{Main|The Concept of Mind}}

In ''The Concept of Mind'', Ryle argues that dualism involves [[category mistake]]s and philosophical [[nonsense]]. Category mistakes and nonsense as philosophical topics continued to inform Ryle's work. Students in his 1967-8 Oxford audience would be asked rhetorically what was wrong with saying that there are three things in a field: two cows and a pair of cows. They were also invited to ponder whether the bung-hole of a beer barrel is part of the barrel or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-philosophy.com/ryle-concept-mind-summary|title=Ryle: The concept of mind (Summary)|website=www.the-philosophy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy as cartography===
{{cquote|The philosophical arguments which constitute this book are intended not to increase what we know about minds but to rectify the logical geography of the knowledge we already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Concept of Mind p 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ryle thought it was no longer possible to believe that it was a philosopher's task to study mental as opposed to physical objects. However, in its place, Ryle saw the tendency of philosophers to search for objects whose nature was neither physical nor mental. Ryle believed, instead, that "philosophical problems are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary sort about special entities."&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

Ryle offers the analogy of philosophy as being like [[cartography]]. Competent speakers of a language, Ryle believes, are to a philosopher what ordinary villagers are to a mapmaker. The ordinary villager has a competent grasp of his village, and is familiar with its inhabitants and [[geography]]. However, when asked to interpret a map for the same knowledge he has practically, the villager will have difficulty until he is able to translate his practical knowledge into universal cartographal terms. The villager thinks of the village in personal and practical terms, while the mapmaker thinks of the village in neutral, public, cartographical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By "mapping" the words and phrases of a particular statement, philosophers are able to generate what Ryle calls "implication threads." In other words, each word or phrase of a statement contributes to the statement in that, if the words or phrases were changed, the statement would have a different implication. The philosopher must show the directions and limits of different implication threads that a "concept contributes to the statements in which it occurs." To show this, he must be "tugging" at neighbouring threads, which, in turn, must also be "tugging." Philosophy, then, searches for the meaning of these implication threads in the statements in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Knowing-how and knowing-that===
{{main|Descriptive knowledge|Procedural knowledge}}
A distinction deployed in ''The Concept of Mind'', between knowing-how and knowing-that (e.g., knowing how to tie a reef knot and knowing that Queen Victoria died in 1901), has attracted independent interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Stanley]] and [[Timothy Williamson]], "Knowing How", ''[[Journal of Philosophy]]'', '''98'''(8): 411–444, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is also the origin of [[Procedural memory|procedural]] (knowing-how) and [[Declarative memory|declarative]] (knowing-that) models of [[Long-term memory|long term memory]].

Ryle took a narrow view of the scope of his field. For him, philosophy did not extend beyond the philosophy of mind, philosophical logic, and the philosophy of language. Ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics were 'philosophy' only by a strained courtesy and a burdensome historical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_ryle.html|title=Gilbert Ryle &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' was recognised on its appearance as an important contribution to philosophical psychology, and an important work in the [[ordinary language philosophy]] movement. However, in the 1960s and 1970s the rising influence of the [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] theories of [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Jerry Fodor]] and others in the neo-Cartesian school became predominant. Chomsky even wrote a book entitled ''[[Cartesian Linguistics]]''. The two major post-War schools in the [[philosophy of mind]], the [[representationalism]] of [[Jerry Fodor]] and the [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] of [[Wilfrid Sellars]], posited precisely the 'internal' cognitive states that Ryle had argued against. However, as influential modern philosopher and former student [[Daniel Dennett]] has pointed out, recent trends in [[psychology]] such as [[embodied cognition]], [[discursive psychology]], [[situated cognition]] and others in the [[post-cognitivist]] tradition have provoked a renewed interest in Ryle's work. Dennett has provided a sympathetic foreword to the 2000 edition of ''The Concept of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] endorsed Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies, suggesting that they implied that "theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=vii, 483 |isbn=0951592254 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logo iso radiation.svg|thumb|[[ISO]] radiation warning sign.]]

The field of '''[[Long-time nuclear waste warning messages|nuclear semiotics]]''' arose in 1981 when a team of engineers, anthropologists, nuclear physicists, behavioral scientists and others was convened on behalf of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] and [[Bechtel]] Corp. The goal of this "'''Human Interference Task Force'''" was to find a way to reduce the likelihood of future humans unintentionally intruding on [[radioactive waste]] isolation systems.

Specifically, the task force was to research ways to prevent future access to the planned, but stalled, [[Deep geological repository|deep geological nuclear repository]] project of [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]].

==Problem==
When atomic or fusion bombs are detonated in a war, or nuclear power plants are used in times of peace, an unnaturally high amount of radioactive waste is produced. This material will threaten human life and health for thousands of years. Consequently, nuclear technology necessitates the creation of a secure means of terminal storage for such materials for an unusually long time period.

Unfortunately, there is no method available to continuously provide the necessary knowledge about the location of nuclear waste over thousands of years. The culture of earlier centuries becomes incomprehensible when it is not translated into new languages every few generations. National institutions do not exist longer than a few hundred years. Even religions are not older than a few millennia and do not typically hand down scientific knowledge.

Furthermore, the necessary length of storage is disputed among specialists. One work group in Germany concluded that nuclear waste must be separated from the biosphere up to one million years&amp;nbsp;– about 30,000 human generations{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Earlier assumptions were based on a period of 10,000 years, which seems to be too short given the half-life of certain radioactive isotopes (e.g. [[Plutonium]]-239 at 24,000 years).

The written historical tradition of humanity, in contrast, is only about 5000 years. Warnings in [[cuneiform script]] could be interpreted by some specialists, but others, such as the writing of the [[Indus Valley civilization]], are already illegible after a few thousand years.

==Proposals==
Three parts of any [[Long-time nuclear waste warning messages|communication about nuclear waste]] must be conveyed to posterity:
#that it is a message at all
#that dangerous material is stored in a given location
#information about the type of dangerous substances

==Answers==
To determine how to convey these three things, the "''Zeitschrift für Semiotik''" ([[Tübingen]], Germany) issued a poll in 1982 and 1983 asking how a message might be communicated for a duration of 10,000 years. The poll asked the following question: "''How would it be possible to inform our descendants for the next 10,000 years about the storage locations and dangers of radioactive waste?" ''leading to the following answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Und in alle Ewigkeit: Kommunikation über 10 000 Jahre: Wie sagen wir unsern Kindeskindern wo der Atommüll liegt?|journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=And into Eternity... Communication over 10000s of Years: How Will We Tell our Children's Children Where the Nuclear Waste is?|location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Sebeok===
The linguist [[Thomas Sebeok]] was a member of the [[Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel]] working group. Building on earlier suggestions made by [[Alvin Weinberg]] and [[Arsen Darnay]] he proposed the creation of an ''atomic priesthood'', a panel of experts where members would be replaced through nominations by a council. Similar to the [[Catholic church]] - which has preserved and authorized its message for over 2000 years&amp;nbsp;— the ''atomic priesthood'' would have to preserve the knowledge about locations and dangers of radioactive waste by creating rituals and myths. The priesthood would indicate off-limits areas and the consequences of disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Thomas |last1=Sebeok|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |trans-title=Pandora's box and its protection:   A relay system in the care of an atom priesthood|journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|title=Die Büchse der Pandora und ihre Sicherung: Ein Relaissystem in der Obhut einer Atompriesterschaft    |location=Berlin |language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/enricaLovaglio/pandora/Pandora.html|title=Pandora's Box: How and Why to Communicate 10,000 Years into the Future|website=www.mat.ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has a number of critical problems:
#An ''atomic priesthood'' would gain political influence based on the contingencies that it would oversee.
#This system of information favors the creation of hierarchies.
#The message could be split into independent parts.
#Information about waste sites would grant power to a privileged class. People from outside this group might attempt to seize this information by force.

===Stanisław Lem===
Polish science-fiction author [[Stanisław Lem]] proposed the creation of [[satellites|artificial satellites]] that would transmit information from their orbit to Earth for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stanisław |last1=Lem|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Mathematische Kodierung auf lebendem Trägermaterial |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Mathematical coding on living carrier material   |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also described a biological coding of [[DNA]] in a mathematical sense, which would reproduce itself automatically. ''Information Plants'' would only grow near a terminal storage site and would inform humans about the dangers. The DNA of the so-called atomic flowers would contain the necessary data about both the location and its contents.

Lem acknowledged the problem with his idea that humans would be unlikely to know the meaning of atomic flowers 10,000 years later, and thus unlikely to decode their DNA in a search for information.

===Françoise Bastide and Paolo Fabbri===
French author [[Françoise Bastide]] and the Italian semiotician Paolo Fabbri proposed the breeding of so called ''"radiation cats"'' or ''"ray cats"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Françoise|last1=Bastide|first2=Paolo |last2=Fabbri|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Lebende Detektoren und komplementäre Zeichen: Katzen, Augen und Sirenen |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Living detectors and complimentary signs: Cats, eyes and sirens |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/27476/ray-cats-artificial-moons-and-atomic-priesthood-how-government-plans-protect-our|title=Ray Cats, Artificial Moons and the Atomic Priesthood: How the Government Plans to Protect Our Nuclear Waste|last=Kaufman|first=Rachel|date=2011|website=Mental Floss|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theraycatsolution.com/|title=Ray Cat Solution|website=10,000|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techinsider.io/the-plan-to-protect-humans-from-radioactive-waste-with-cats-2015-8|title=Color-changing cats were once part of a US government plan to protect humankind|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|date=August 16, 2015|website=Tech Insider|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cat]]s have a long history of cohabitation with humans, and this approach assumes that their domestication will continue indefinitely. These radiation cats would change significantly in color when they came near radioactive emissions and serve as living indicators of danger. In order to transport the message, the importance of the cats would need to be set in the collective awareness through fairy tales and myths. Those fairy tales and myths in turn could be transmitted through poetry, music and painting. The story of this original project was depicted in the 2016 short documentary "The Ray Cat Solution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/138843064|title=The Raycat Solution|last=Huguet|first=Benjamin|year=2016|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vilmos Voigt===
Vilmos Voigt from Loránd-Eötvös university ([[Budapest]]) proposed the installation of warning signs in the most important global languages in a concentric pattern around the terminal storage location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Vilmos |last1=Voigt |publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Konzentrisch angeordnete Warntafeln in zunehmend neueren Sprachformen |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Concentrically arranged warning signs in increasingly newer language forms |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a certain time span new signs with translations would be installed, but the old signs would not be removed. Newer signs would be posted farther away from the location, thus the warning would be understandable as languages change and it would be possible to understand the older languages through the translation.

===Emil Kowalski===
Physicist Emil Kowalski from [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], [[Switzerland]] proposed that terminal storage locations be constructed in such a way that future generations could reach them only with a high technical ability. The probability of an unwanted breach would then become extremely small. Furthermore, cultures able to perform such excavations and drillings would most certainly be able to detect radioactive material and be aware of its dangers.

[[Image:The Stranger at the Door.jpg|thumb|"The Stranger at the Door" (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]
'''''Hávamál''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|h|ɑː|v|ə|m|ɑː|l}} {{respell|HAH|və-mahl}}; "sayings of the high one"; {{IPA-non|ˈhɒːwaˌmɒːl}}, {{IPA-is|ˈhauvaˌmaul̥}}) is presented as a single poem in the [[Codex Regius]], a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems from the Viking age. The poem, itself a combination of different poems, is largely [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]], presenting advice for living, proper conduct and wisdom.

The verses are attributed to [[Odin]]; the implicit attribution to Odin facilitated the accretion of various mythological material also dealing with the same deity.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows (1936), introductory note.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part composed in the [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] [[Alliterative verse#Ljóðaháttr|''Ljóðaháttr'']], a metre associated with wisdom verse, ''Hávamál'' is both practical and philosophical in content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=Df3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=havamal+reviewed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uUAdThDbNA&amp;sig=a-EUTIfEqnRFftft1qMgfXYfwqM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifxc-L0vzVAhXizIMKHYmrAewQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Church Review|last=Richardson|first=Nathaniel Smith|last2=Boggs|first2=Edward Brenton|last3=Baum|first3=Henry Mason|date=1872|publisher=Bassett and Bradley|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the gnomic  "''Hávamál'' proper" comes the ''Rúnatal'', an account of how Odin won the [[rune]]s, and the ''Ljóðatal'', a list of magic chants or [[galdr|spells]].&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON14&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 14. [[Oxford World's Classics]] {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==
The only surviving source for ''Hávamál'' is the 13th century [[Codex Regius]]. The part dealing with ethical conduct (the ''Gestaþáttr'') was traditionally identified as the oldest portion of the poem by scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century.
Bellows (1936) identifies as the core of the poem a "collection of proverbs and wise counsels" which dates to "a very early time", but which, by the nature of oral tradition, never had a fixed form or extent.
[[Von See]] (1981) identifies direct influence of the ''[[Disticha Catonis]]'' on the ''Gestaþáttr'', suggesting that also this part is a product of the high medieval period and casting doubt on the "unadulterated Germanic character" of the poem claimed by earlier commentators.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von See: „Disticha Catonis und Hávamál.“ In: Klaus von See: Edda, Saga, Skaldendichtung. Heidelberg 1981, 27-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] core of the poem, other fragments and poems dealing with wisdom and proverbs accreted over time. A discussion of authorship or date for the individual parts would be futile, since almost every line or stanza could have been added, altered or removed at will at any time before the poem was written down in the 13th century.
Individual verses or stanzas nevertheless certainly date to as early as the 10th, or even the 9th century. Thus, the  line ''deyr fé, deyja frændr'' ("cattle die, kinsmen die") found in verses 76 and 77 of the ''Gestaþáttr'' can be shown to date to the 10th century, as it also occurs in the ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' by [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]].

==Structure==
The ''Hávamál'' is edited in 165 stanzas by Bellows (1936). Other editions give 164 stanzas, combining Bellow's stanzas 11 and 12, as the manuscript abbreviates the last two lines of stanzas 11. Some editors also combine Bellow's stanzas 163 and 164. In the following, Bellow's numeration is used.

The poems in ''Hávamál'' is traditionally taken to consist of at least five independent parts,
#the ''Gestaþáttr'', or ''Hávamál'' proper,  (stanzas 1–80), a collection of proverbs and [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] wisdom
#a dissertation on the faithlessness of women (stanzas 81–95), prefacing an account of the love-story of Odin and the [[daughter of Billingr]] (stanzas 96-102) and the story of how Odin got the [[mead of poetry]] from the maiden [[Gunnlöð]]  (stanzas 103–110)
#the ''Loddfáfnismál'' (stanzas 111–138), a collection of gnomic verses similar to the ''Gestaþáttr'', addressed to a certain Loddfáfnir
#the  ''Rúnatal'' (stanzas 139–146), an account of how Odin won the runes, introductory to the  ''Ljóðatal''
#the '' Ljóðatal'' (stanzas 147–165), a collection of charms

Stanzas 6 and 27 are expanded beyond the standard four lines by an additional two lines of "commentary". Bellow's edition inverses the manuscript order of stanzas 39 and 40. Bellow's stanza 138 (''Ljóðalok'') is taken from the very end of the poem in the manuscript, placed before
the ''Rúnatal'' by most editors following Müllenhoff. Stanzas 65, 73–74, 79, 111, 133–134, 163 are defective.

Stanzas  81-84 are in ''[[málaháttr]]'', 85–88 in ''[[fornyrðislag]]''. The entire section of 81–102 appears to be an ad hoc interpolation. Stanza 145 is also an interpolation in  ''málaháttr''.

==Contents==

===''Gestaþáttr''===
The first section '''''Gestaþáttr''''', the "guest's section". Stanzas 1 through 79 comprise a set of maxims for how to handle oneself when a guest and traveling, focusing particularly on [[manners]] and other behavioral relationships between hosts and guests and the sacred [[Folklore|lore]] of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] and [[hospitality]] to the [[Norse paganism|Norse pagans]].

The first stanza exemplifies the practical behavioral advice it offers:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
All the entrances, before you walk forward,
you should look at,
you should spy out;
for you can't know for certain where enemies are sitting,
ahead in the hall''&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON14/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Number 76 is possibly the most known section of ''Gestaþáttr'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Deyr fé,

deyr sjálfur ið sama; 
en orðstír 
deyr aldregi
hveim er sér góðan getur." }}

===On women===
[[File:Billingr's girl, bitch, and Odin by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Billingr's girl watches on while Odin encounters the bitch tied to her bedpost (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
Stanzas 83 to 110 deal with the general topic of [[romantic love]] and the character of [[women]].

It is introduced by a discussion of the faithlessness of women and advice for the seducing of them in stanzas 84–95, followed by two mythological accounts of Odin's interaction with women also known as "Odin's Examples" or "Odin's Love Quests". The first is an account of Odin's thwarted attempt of possessing the daughter of [[Billingr|Billing]]  (stanzas 96–102), followed by the story of the [[mead of poetry]] which Odin won by seducing its guardian, the maiden [[Gunnlöð]] (stanzas 103–110).

===''Loddfáfnismál''===
The '''''Loddfáfnismál'''''  (stanzas 111–138) is again gnomic, dealing with morals, ethics, correct action and codes of conduct. The section is directed to [[Loddfáfnir]] ("stray-singer").

===''Rúnatal''===
[[Image:Odin's Self-sacrifice by Collingwood.jpg|thumb|"Odin's Self-sacrifice" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]]
[[File:Jelling gr Stein 3.JPG|thumb|The younger [[Jelling stone]] (erected by [[Harald Bluetooth]] ca. 970) shows the [[crucifixion of Christ]] with the victim suspended in the branches of a tree instead of on a cross.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Patton 2009:271.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Rúnatal''''' or '''''Óðins Rune Song''''', ''Rúnatáls-þáttr-Óðins'' (stanzas 139-146) is a section of the ''Hávamál'' where Odin reveals the origins of the [[runes]].
In stanzas 139 and 140, Odin describes his  sacrifice of himself to himself:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Veit ec at ec hecc vindga meiði a
netr allar nío,
geiri vndaþr oc gefinn Oðin,
sialfr sialfom mer,
a þeim meiþi, er mangi veit, hvers hann af rótom renn.

Við hleifi mic seldo ne viþ hornigi,
nysta ec niþr,
nam ec vp rvnar,
opandi nam,
fell ec aptr þaðan.}}
|
I know that I hung on a windy tree
[[Numbers in Norse mythology|nine]] long nights,
wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,
myself to myself,
on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.

No bread did they give me nor a [[Drinking horn|drink from a horn]],
downwards I peered;
I took up the runes,
screaming I took them,
then I fell back from there.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON34&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 34. [[Oxford World's Classics]] {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "windy tree" from which the victim hangs is often identified with the world tree [[Yggdrasil]] by commentators. The entire scene, the sacrifice of a god to himself, the execution method by hanging the victim on a tree, and the wound inflicted on the victim by a spear, is often compared to the [[crucifixion of Christ]] as narrated in the [[gospel]]s.
The parallelism of Odin and Christ during the period of open co-existence of Christianity and Norse paganism in Scandinavia (the 9th to 12th centuries, corresponding with the assumed horizon of the poem's composition) is also evident from other sources. To what extent this parallelism is an incidental similarity of the mode of [[human sacrifice]] offered to Odin and the crucifixion, and to what extent a Pagan influence on Christianity, or vice versa, may have occurred, is a complex question on which scholarly opinions vary.&lt;ref&gt;a sketch of the problem is given by  Kimberley Christine Patton, ''Religion of the gods: ritual, paradox, and reflexivity'' Oxford University,  {{ISBN|978-0-19-509106-9}}, chapter 7 "Myself to Myself: The Norse Odin and Divine Autosacrifice".&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ljóðatal''===
The last section, the '''''Ljóðatal''''' enumerates eighteen songs (''ljóð''), sometimes called "charms", prefaced with
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Ljóð ek þau kann
er kann-at þjóðans kona
ok mannskis mǫgr}}
|attr1=stanza 147|
The songs I know
that king's wives know not
Nor men that are sons of men.}}

The songs themselves are not given, just their application or effect described.
They are explicitly counted from "the first" in stanza 147, and "a second" to "an eighteenth" in stanzas 148 to 165, given in Roman numerals in the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows separates the "seventeenth" item into stanzas 163 and 164. There is a gap in stanza 163, and some editors have also combined 163 and 164 into a single stanza.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no explicit mention of runes or [[runic magic]] in the ''Ljóðatal'' excepting in
the twelfth song (stanza 158), which takes up the motif of Odin hanging on the tree and its association with runes,
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|svá ek ríst
ok í rúnum fá'k}}
|
So do I write
and color the runes}}

Nevertheless, because of the ''Rúnatal'' preceding the list, modern commentators sometimes reinterpret the ''Ljóðatal'' as referring to runes, specifically with the sixteen letters of the [[Younger Futhark]].

Müllenhoff takes the original ''Ljóðatal'' to have ended with stanza 161, with the final three songs (16th to 18th) taken as late and obscure additions.

==Germanic Neopaganism==
The difference of sixteen runes of the [[Younger Futhark]] vs. eighteen charms in the ''Ljóðatal'' has notably motivated proponents of [[Ariosophy|Germanic mysticism]] to expand the row by two extra runes. The best-known attempt to this effect are the [[Armanen runes]] by [[Guido von List]] (1902).

Various proponents of [[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagan]] groups place an emphasis on ''Hávamál'' as a source of a Norse pagan ethical code of conduct. The  "[[Nine Noble Virtues]]", first compiled by [[Odinic Rite]] founder John "Stubba" Yeowell in the 1970s are "loosely based" on the Hávamál.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
The [[Northvegr Foundation]] cites the Hávamál among other Old Norse and Old English sources to illustrate "the ethical ideal of the Northern spiritual faith of Heithni."&lt;ref&gt;Alfta Lothursdottir, ''Trulog and Sogumal'', Northvegr (2006); [http://www.northvegr.org/northern/book/trulog.php Trúlög: Northern Truisms] (northvegr.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]], leader of the Icelandic ''[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]'', published his performance of a number of Eddaic poems, including the Hávamál,  chanted in [[rímur]] style.&lt;ref&gt;"Edda", Current 93 (1991); [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY7dtuYH7B0 youtube.com link]&lt;/ref&gt;

ILRI works with partners worldwide to help poor people keep their farm animals alive and productive, increase and sustain their livestock and farm productivity and find profitable markets for their animal products.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.ilri.org International Livestock Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

ILRI works to secure the assets and market participation of the poor and to improve smallholder and pastoral productivity. The institute works with partners to enhance development of new knowledge and technological and policy information to help farmers improve their livelihoods by exploiting the potential of their animals. ILRI carries out its research in East, Southern, and West Africa, in South and Southeast Asia, and in China.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

==Research areas==
ILRI's research addresses seven global livestock development challenges including vaccine and diagnostic technologies for orphan animal diseases, animal genetic resources, climate change – adaptation and mitigation, emerging diseases, SPS and market access within broader market opportunities for the poor, sustainable intensification in smallholder crop-livestock systems and vulnerability of marginal systems and peoples.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

'''''Konsthistorisk tidskrift''''' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[academic journal]] on [[art history]] that was established in 1932 by ''Konsthistoriska sällskapet'' (the Society of Art Historians) in [[Stockholm]]. The journal was published until 1967 under the full title ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift: revy för konst och konstforskning''. Since 2002 it has carried the English alternate title ''Journal of Art History''. It was published by the [[Scandinavian University Press]] from 1992 till 1999, and has been published by [[Routledge]] ([[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]) since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS entry for the ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Konsthistoriska sällskapet'',  the Society of Art Historians, was founded in 1914 on the initiative of [[Osvald Sirén]], J. A. Berg Professor of Art History in Stockholm, and [[Johnny Roosval]], then docent of Art History (later professor). The society was clearly Stockholm-centric from the start: Sirén and Roosval became chairman and vice chairman, respectively. The rest of the board consisted of representatives of the major museums in Stockholm, the director of the [[Bukowskis]] auction house there, and the other universities in Lund, Uppsala and Gothenburg each having one representative ([[Ewert Wrangel]], [[August Hahr]] and [[Axel Romdahl]], respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson (2000), p. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt;

''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'' had a predecessor in the first periodical of the society, ''Konsthistoriska sällskapets publikation'', which was published 1915-1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/420689?vw=full LIBRIS entry for the ''Konsthistoriska Sällskapets Publikation'']&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, it was absorbed into the journal ''[[Tidskrift för konstvetenskap]]'', which had been published at the [[University of Lund]] since 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/420689?vw=full LIBRIS], [http://libris.kb.se/bib/408986?vw=full LIBRIS]; Ångström-Grandien (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; At the annual meeting of Konsthistoriska sällskapet in 1931, the board of the Society proposed re-establishing a periodical of its own, as {{blockquote|despite the merits of [Tidskrift för konstvetenskap], it has become apparent that it would be more suitable for the publication of the Society to be edited from Stockholm, as most art historical authors and most members live here, and it must, additionally, be easier to satisfy the interests of art history and the art collectors in all parts of the country with Stockholm as the base.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöblom (1932), p. 123-124. Sjöberg's Swedish summary of the prospect presented by the board: "Sällskapets publikation har under senare åren utgjorts av den i Lund utgivna och redigerade Tidskrift för Konstvetenskap. Trots denna tidskrifts förtjänster har det dock visat sig vara mera lämpligt, att Sällskapets publikation redigeras från Stockholm, då de flesta konsthistoriska författarna och de flesta ledamöterna äro bosatta här, och det dessutom måste falla sig lättare att med Stockholm som utgångspunkt allsidigt tillgodose konstvetenskapens och konstsamlarnas intressen i alla delar av vårt land. Styrelsen har därför planerat en Konsthistorisk Tidskrift av ungefär samma format och omfång som den förutvarande Publikationen. Den nya tidskriften kommer att gratis tillsändas ledamöterna, och årsavgiften för ledamotskap förblir oförändrad."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The journal was to be of approximately the same size as the previous publication and would be distributed to members with no change in fees. After a short debate, the meeting agreed to the proposition of the board. Professor Axel Romdahl from Gothenburg suggested a division of the field between the two journals in some way and offered to negotiate this with representatives of the other journal.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöblom (1932), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960-1984 annual volumes of the journal included "Svensk konsthistorisk bibliografi" (from 1976 known as "konstvetenskaplig bibliografi"), an annual cumulative bibliography of art history published in Sweden, covering the years 1959-1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors==
The journal originally had an editorial group consisting of an ''ansvarig utgivare'' ("publisher", the person responsible for the publication under ''Tryckfrihetsförordningen'', the Swedish [[Constitution of Sweden#Freedom of the press and freedom of expression|Freedom of the Press Act]]) and one or several ''redaktör[er]'' ("editor[s]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of ''ansvarig utgivare'' ("publisher") for the journal has been held by:
*[[Johnny Roosval]] (1932-1965:1/2)
*Sten Karling (1965:3/4–1973)
*Patrik Reuterswärd (1974–1990)
*Hans Henrik Brummer (1991)

The position of ''redaktör'', ("editor") for the journal has been held by:
*Georg Svensson (1932–1944)
*Kjell Boström, Aron Andersson, [[Axel Boëthius]] and Georg Svensson (1945)
*Kjell Boström, Aron Andersson and Georg Svensson (1946:1-2)
*Johnny Roosval (1947)
*Sten Karling (1948–1973)
*Lars Olof Larsson and Ingrid Sjöström (1974–1980)
*Götz Pochat and Patrik Reuterswärd (1981:1)
*Patrik Reuterswärd (1981:2–1990)

Since 1992 the person responsible for the journal has been described by the English title "Editor-in-chief" and has been:

*Hans Henrik Brummer (1992–2001)
*Margaretha Rossholm Lagerlöf (2002–2009?)
*The current [[editor in chief]] is Dan Kartholm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/journal.asp?issn=0023-3609&amp;linktype=5 ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'', Editorial Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the journal has and has had a larger advisory committee. The first issue from 1932 listed one consisting of 27 people.

==Recognition==
The journal is financially supported by the [[Swedish Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;The on-line database shows it receiving 120,000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] annually for 2002–2008:

This is achieved through developing school based [[curricula]] that "engage students interactively with their surrounding environment". Ideally, learnscapes incorporate educational, environmental and social outcomes that reflect the character of the community as well as the school site.

"A Learnscape feature, whether it be an outdoor classroom, worm farm, bush regeneration, recycling area, frog pond or herb garden, is not a Learnscape itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11493">[[File:Microbial Loop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The microbial loop is a marine trophic pathway which incorporates [[dissolved organic carbon]] into the food chain.]]
The '''microbial loop''' describes a trophic pathway in the marine microbial food web where [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) is returned to higher trophic levels via its incorporation into bacterial biomass, and then coupled with the classic food chain formed by [[phytoplankton]]-[[zooplankton]]-[[nekton]]. The term microbial loop was coined by [[Farooq Azam]] and [[Tom Fenchel]] et al.&lt;ref name=AzamFenchel1983&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azam |first1=Farooq |authorlink1=Farooq Azam |last2=Fenchel |first2=Tom |authorlink2=Tom Fenchel |last3=Field |first3=JG |last4=Gray |first4=JS |last5=Meyer-Reil |first5=LA |last6=Thingstad |first6=F |title=The Ecological Role of Water-Column Microbes in the Sea |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=10 |year=1983 |pages=257–263 |doi=10.3354/meps010257}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include the role played by bacteria in the carbon and nutrient cycles of the marine environment.

In general, [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) is introduced into the ocean environment from bacterial lysis, the leakage or exudation of fixed carbon from phytoplankton (e.g., mucilaginous exopolymer from [[diatom]]s), sudden cell senescence, sloppy feeding by zooplankton, the excretion of waste products by aquatic animals, or the breakdown or dissolution of organic particles from terrestrial plants and soils (Van den Meersche ''et al.'' 2004). Bacteria in the microbial loop decompose this particulate detritus to utilize this energy-rich matter for growth. Since more than 95% of organic matter in marine ecosystems consists of polymeric, high [[molecular weight]] (HMW) compounds (e.g., protein, polysaccharides, lipids), only a small portion of total [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) is readily utilizable to most marine organisms at higher trophic levels. This means that dissolved organic carbon is not available directly to most marine organisms; marine bacteria introduce this organic carbon into the food web, resulting in additional energy becoming available to higher trophic levels. Recently the term "[[microbial food web]]" has been substituted for the term "microbial loop".

== History ==
Prior to the discovery of the microbial loop, the classic view of marine [[food web]]s was one of a linear chain from [[phytoplankton]] to [[nekton]]. Generally, marine [[bacteria]] were not thought to be significant consumers of organic matter (including carbon), although they were known to exist. However, the view of a marine pelagic food web was challenged during the 1970s and 1980s by Pomeroy and Azam, who suggested the alternative pathway of carbon flow from bacteria to [[protozoan]]s to [[metazoan]]s.

Early work in marine ecology that investigated the role of bacteria in oceanic environments concluded their role to be very minimal. Traditional methods of counting bacteria (e.g., culturing on [[agar plate]]s) only yielded small numbers of bacteria that were much smaller than their true ambient abundance in seawater. Developments in technology for counting bacteria have led to an understanding of the significant importance of marine bacteria in oceanic environments

In the 1970s, the alternative technique of direct [[Bacterioplankton counting methods|microscopic counting]] was developed by Francisco ''et al.'' (1973) and Hobbie ''et al.'' (1977). Bacterial cells were counted with an [[epifluorescence microscope]], producing what is called an 
"acridine orange direct count" (AODC). This led to a reassessment of the large concentration of bacteria in seawater, which was found to be more than was expected (typically on the order of 1 million per milliliter). Also, development of the "bacterial productivity assay" showed that a large fraction (i.e. 50%) of net [[primary production]] (NPP) was processed by marine bacteria.

In 1974, Larry Pomeroy published a paper in BioScience entitled “The Ocean’s Food Web: A Changing Paradigm”, where the key role of microbes in ocean productivity was highlighted. In the early 1980s, Azam and a panel of top ocean scientists published the synthesis of their discussion in the journal ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' entitled “The Ecological Role of Water Column Microbes in the Sea”. The term ‘microbial loop’ was introduced in this paper, which noted that the bacteria-consuming protists were in the same size class as phytoplankton and likely an important component of the diet of planktonic [[crustacean]]s.

Evidence accumulated since this time has indicated that some of these [[bacterivore|bacterivorous]] protists (such as [[ciliate]]s) are actually selectively preyed upon by these [[copepod]]s. In 1986, ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', which is found in high abundance in oligotrophic areas of the ocean, was discovered by Chisholm, Olson, and other collaborators (although there had been several earlier records of very small [[cyanobacteria]] containing [[chlorophyll b]] in the ocean). Stemming from this discovery, researchers observed the changing role of marine bacteria along a nutrient gradient from eutrophic to oligotrophic areas in the ocean.

== Factors controlling the microbial loop ==
The efficiency of the microbial loop is determined by the density of marine bacteria within it (Taylor and Joint 1990). It has become clear that bacterial density is mainly controlled by the grazing activity of small protozoans and various taxonomic groups of flagellates. Also, viral infection causes bacterial lysis, which release cell contents back into the [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) pool, lowering the overall efficiency of the microbial loop. Mortality from viral infection has almost the same magnitude as that from protozoan grazing. However, compared to protozoan grazing, the effect of viral lysis can be very different because lysis is highly host-specific to each marine bacteria. Both protozoan grazing and viral infection balance the major fraction of bacterial growth. In addition, the microbial loop dominates in oligotrophic waters, rather than in eutrophic areas - there the classical plankton food chain predominates, due to the frequent fresh supply of mineral nutrients (e.g. spring bloom in temperate waters, [[upwelling]] areas). The magnitude of the efficiency of the microbial loop can be determined by measuring bacterial incorporation of radiolabeled substrates (such as [[tritium|tritiated]] thymidine or leucine).

== Importance in marine ecosystems ==
The microbial loop is of particular importance in increasing the efficiency of the marine food web via the utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is typically unavailable to most marine organisms. In this sense, the process aids in recycling of organic matter and nutrients and mediates the transfer of energy above the [[thermocline]]. More than 30% of [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) incorporated into bacteria is respired and released as [[carbon dioxide]]. The other main effect of the microbial loop in the water column is that it accelerates [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] through regenerating production in nutrient-limited environments (e.g. oligotrophic waters). In general, the entire microbial loop is to some extent typically five to ten times the mass of all multicellular marine organisms in the marine ecosystem. Marine bacteria are the base of the food web in most oceanic environments, and they improve the trophic efficiency of both marine food webs and important aquatic processes (such as the productivity of fisheries and the amount of carbon exported to the ocean floor). Therefore, the microbial loop, together with primary production, controls the productivity of marine systems in the ocean.

Many planktonic bacteria are motile, using a flagellum to propagate, and [[chemotaxis|chemotax]] to locate, move toward, and attach to a point source of [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) where fast growing cells digest all or part of the particle. Accumulation within just a few minutes at such patches is directly observable. Therefore, the water column can be considered to some extent as a spatially organized place on a small scale rather than a completely mixed system. This patch formation affects the biologically-mediated transfer of matter and energy in the microbial loop.

More currently, the microbial loop is considered to be more extended (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003). Chemical compounds in typical bacteria (such as DNA, lipids, sugars, etc.) and similar values of C:N ratios per particle are found in the microparticles formed abiotically. Microparticles are a potentially attractive food source to bacterivorous plankton. If this is the case, the microbial loop can be extended by the pathway of direct transfer of [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) via abiotic microparticle formation to higher trophic levels. This has ecological importance in two ways. First, it occurs without carbon loss, and makes organic matter more efficiently available to phagotrophic organisms, rather than only heterotrophic bacteria. Furthermore, abiotic transformation in the extended microbial loop depends only on temperature and the capacity of DOM to aggregate, while biotic transformation is dependent on its biological availability (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003).

It is based on maintaining coherence across [[Scale (analytical tool)|scales]] and different dimensions (e.g. economic, demographic, energetic) of quantitative assessments generated using different metrics. It is designed to detect and analyze patterns in the societal use of resources and the impacts they create on the environment. The approach was created around 1997 by Mario Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi, and has been developed since then by the members of the IASTE (Integrated Assessment: Sociology, Technology and the Environment) group at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the ''Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona'' and its external collaborators. MuSIASEM strives to characterize metabolic patterns of Socio-Ecological Systems (how and why humans use resources and how this use depends on and affects the stability of the ecosystems embedding the society). This integrated approach allows for a quantitative implementation of the [[DPSIR]] framework (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses) and application as a decision support tool. Different alternatives of the option space can be checked in terms of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control), viability (compatibility with processes under human control) and desirability (compatibility with normative values and institutions). The ability to integrate quantitative assessments across dimensions and scales makes MuSIASEM particularly suited for different types of sustainability analysis: (i) the nexus between food, energy, water and land uses; (ii) urban metabolism; (iii) waste metabolism; (iv) tourism metabolism; (v) rural development.

The NASA Academy is [[NASA]]'s premiere leadership training program for undergraduate and graduate students. Since its founding in 1993, the NASA Academy has brought together future leaders of the aerospace industry and exposed them to the inner workings of NASA, academia, and industry. The Academy consists of a ten-week summer program hosted by a participating NASA center. Currently there are academies at [[Langley Research Center]], [[Ames Research Center]], [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and [[Glenn Research Center]]. [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] previously hosted NASA Academies, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa-academy.org/org_academy_overview.html |title=NAAA - NASA Academy Program Overview |publisher=Nasa-academy.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The NASA Academy at was founded in 1993 at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center by [[Gerald Soffen|Gerald "Gerry" Soffen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa-academy.org/soffen/ |title=Dr. Gerald A. Soffen Memorial at NASA Academy Alumni Association |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was largely based on the concept of the [[International Space University]]. Soffen envisioned the NASA Academy as a leadership program with an inter-disciplinary approach similar to ISU, but without the emphasis on the international and intercultural aspects. Specifically, Soffen created the program to "give possible 'leaders' a view into how NASA, the university community, and the private sector function; [to] set their priorities; and [to] contribute to the success of the aerospace program."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=NASA Academy at Ames for Space Exploration Mission Statement|publisher=NASA Academy|url=http://academy.arc.nasa.gov/index.php?fuseaction=home.mission|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research focus for any specific NASA Academy can change from year to year. In 2015, the Multidisciplinary Aeronautics Research Team Initiative (MARTI) replaced the Aeronautics Academy.

==Mission statement==
{{Quote box

}}
The NASA Academy states its mission as follows: "to identify and recruit the future leaders of the space exploration community, to introduce them to the key aspects of the industry, to provide them with critical training, and to build an ever-expanding network of these future leaders, so that these young scientists and engineers are prepared to assume the highest responsibilities of a career dedicated to leadership in space exploration."&lt;ref&gt;

==Program Overview==
The 2010 NASA Academy Definitions Document outlines six key criteria that are critical to the program and which, when taken as a whole, differentiate it from other NASA leadership development programs:
# Principal Investigator-Directed Research, wherein the Research Associate devotes an average of 30 hours a week to a research project within a NASA science or advanced technology program.
# A Group Research Project requiring the collaborative efforts of all of the Research Associates as well as external advisors. Traditionally, this requires extensive work during evenings and weekends, and consumes several working days during normal business hours towards to end of the program.
# Structured and Unstructured Team Building activities, designed to form an effective and cohesive community from an interdisciplinary group of leaders.
# Interactions with current aerospace industry leaders, including both formal lectures and informal opportunities to interact at meals, launches, and other events.
# Site visits to a variety of NASA centers, companies, and university labs. Traditionally, this takes up approximately one working day during normal business hours as well as extensive work during evenings and weekends.
# A culture of extreme professionalism and preparation.

NASA Academy students are typically expected to work long hours: as a general rule, the day is scheduled from 07:30 to 21:00, after which students work on the Team Project or on individual research assignments. However, NASA Academy students are also typically given excellent opportunities, including field trips to other centers and excellent access to the leaders and decision-makers of the aerospace industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/nasa_academy/ |title=TSGC &amp;#124; NASA Academy |publisher=Tsgc.utexas.edu |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A NASA Academy class typically varies from 10-20 students per center per year. Participants are selected in a joint effort between the NASA Center, the NASA Academy Alumni Association, the PIs, and the State [[National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program|Space Grant]] Consortia. Alumni from the previous year's program are typically selected to serve as program coordinators for current sessions. For several years in the early 2000s (decade), the NASA Academy at GSFC admitted a French student every year as part of a cooperative agreement with [[CNES|the Centre National d'Études Spatiales]], the French space agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Education/SEM8KVCJD3G_0.html |title=ESA - Education - Opportunity for European students to attend NASA Academy 2010 |publisher=Esa.int |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable alumni==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = "After 14 years, among its alumni are over 50 members with doctorates, 45 employees of NASA centers, 65 NASA contractors, 70 other professionals in aerospace-related fields, 10 math, science and physics teachers, and three CEOs, with approximately 50% of the alumni currently having completed or completing advanced degrees. In addition, Academy alumni account for hundreds of scholarship awards, space agency awards, national awards, professional society awards, and university awards, including five NASA Harriett G. Jenkins Pre-Doctoral Fellows during the past five years -- with at least one in every cohort. Academy alumni are also responsible for hundreds of presentations, projects, publications and patents."

[[File:NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Aerial view 2010 facing south.jpg|thumb|upright|Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland]]
'''[[Goddard Space Flight Center]]''' (GSFC), located in Greenbelt, MD, is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the United States dedicated to increasing knowledge of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe via observations from space. GSFC is a major U.S. laboratory for developing and operating unmanned scientific spacecraft. GSFC conducts scientific investigation, development and operation of space systems, and development of related technologies. Goddard scientists can develop and support a mission, and Goddard engineers and technicians can design and build the spacecraft for that mission. Goddard scientist John C. Mather shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]. GSFC also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the [[Space Network]] and the [[Near Earth Network]]), develops and maintains advanced space and Earth science data information systems, and develops satellite systems for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).

The facility is headquartered in the city of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jpl.Nasa.Gov |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/about_JPL/maps.cfm |title=Directions - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=Jpl.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the border of [[La Cañada Flintridge, California|La Cañada Flintridge]] and Pasadena.  JPL is managed by the nearby [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). The Laboratory's primary function is the construction and operation of robotic planetary spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions.  It is also responsible for operating NASA's [[Deep Space Network]].

The '''[[Armstrong Flight Research Center]]''' (AFRC), located inside [[Edwards Air Force Base]], is an aeronautical research center operated by [[NASA]]. Armstrong is NASA's premier site for aeronautical research and operates some of the most advanced [[aircraft]] in the world. It is also the home of the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (SCA), a modified Boeing 747 designed to carry a Space Shuttle orbiter back to [[Kennedy Space Center]] if one lands at Edwards. On December 31, 2012, the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] voted 404–0 to rename the centre previously known as Dryden in honor of [[Neil Armstrong]], the first astronaut to walk on the surface of the moon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1212/31armstrong/  |title=House passes bill to rename NASA facility for Armstrong  | date=2012-12-31  |accessdate=2013-01-01  |publisher=Spaceflight Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Barack Obama officially signed the change into law on January 16, 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Center Redesignated for Neil Armstrong; Test Range for Hugh Dryden |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/Features/nasa-dryden-to-be-renamed-for-neil-armstrong_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Glenn Research Center|John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field]]''' (GRC) located in [[Brook Park, Ohio]], was established in 1942 as part of NACA, and was later incorporated as a NASA laboratory for aircraft engine research. In 1999, the center's name was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field after John Glenn, an American fighter pilot, astronaut and politician. Glenn supports all of the agency's missions and major programs. Glenn excels in researching and developing innovative technologies for both aeronautics and space flight. A multitude of NASA missions have included elements from Glenn, from the Mercury and Gemini projects to the Space Shuttle Program and the International Space Station. The center's core competencies include air-breathing and in-space propulsion and cryogenics, communications, power energy storage and conversion, microgravity sciences, and advanced materials.

[[File:Msfc aerial view.jpg|thumb|upright|George C. Marshal Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama]]

'''[[Ames Research Center]]''' (ARC) at [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Moffett Field]] was founded on December 20, 1939 as a NACA laboratory, and became part of NASA in 1958, as part of the turnover from NACA. The center was named after [[Joseph Sweetman Ames]], a founding member of the NACA. ARC is one of NASA’s 10 major field centers and is located in [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]]. Historically, Ames was founded to do wind-tunnel research on the aerodynamics of propeller-driven aircraft; however, it has expanded its role to doing research and technology in aeronautics, spaceflight, and information technology. It provides leadership in [[astrobiology]], small satellites, robotic lunar exploration, intelligent/adaptive systems and thermal protection.

[[File:Langley research center.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Langley Research Center]]
'''[[Langley Research Center]]''' ('''LaRC''') is the oldest of [[NASA]]'s field centers, located in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, United States. LaRC focuses primarily on aeronautical research, though the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo lunar lander]] was flight-tested at the facility and a number of high-profile space missions have been planned and designed on-site. Established in 1917  by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]], the Center currently devotes two-thirds of its programs to [[aeronautics]], and the rest to [[outer space|space]]. LaRC researchers use more than 40 [[wind tunnel]]s to study improved [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] safety, performance, and efficiency.  Between 1958 and 1963, when NASA started [[Project Mercury]], LaRC served as the main office of the [[Space Task Group]], with the office being transferred to the Manned Spacecraft Center (now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center) in Houston in 1962&amp;ndash;63.

'''Plant physiology''' is a subdiscipline of [[botany]] concerned with the functioning, or [[physiology]], of [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992"&gt;{{cite book| author = Frank B. Salisbury|author2=Cleon W. Ross | title = Plant physiology| year = 1992| publisher = Brooks/Cole Pub Co| isbn = 0-534-15162-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related fields include [[plant morphology]] (structure of plants), plant [[ecology]] (interactions with the environment), [[phytochemistry]] ([[biochemistry]] of plants), [[cell biology]], genetics, biophysics and [[molecular biology]].

Fundamental processes such as [[photosynthesis]], [[cellular respiration|respiration]], [[plant nutrition]], [[plant hormone]] functions, [[tropism]]s, [[nastic movements]], [[photoperiodism]], [[photomorphogenesis]], [[circadian rhythms]], environmental stress physiology, seed [[germination]], [[dormancy]] and [[stoma]]ta function and [[transpiration]], both parts of plant water relations, are studied by plant physiologists.

==Aims==
The field of plant physiology includes the study of all the internal activities of plants—those chemical and physical processes associated with [[life]] as they occur in plants.  This includes study at many levels of scale of size and time. At the smallest scale are [[molecule|molecular]] interactions of [[photosynthesis]] and internal [[diffusion]] of water, minerals, and nutrients.  At the largest scale are the processes of plant [[Developmental biology|development]], [[season]]ality, [[dormancy]], and [[reproductive]] control.  Major subdisciplines of plant physiology include [[phytochemistry]] (the study of the [[biochemistry]] of plants) and [[phytopathology]] (the study of [[disease]] in plants). The scope of plant physiology as a discipline may be divided into several major areas of research.

[[Image:Plant physiology.png|thumb|240px|Five key areas of study within plant physiology.]]
First, the study of [[phytochemistry]] (plant chemistry) is included within the domain of plant physiology.  To function and survive, plants produce a wide array of chemical compounds not found in other organisms.  [[Photosynthesis]] requires a large array of [[pigment]]s, [[enzyme]]s, and other compounds to function.  Because they cannot move, plants must also defend themselves chemically from [[herbivore]]s, [[pathogen]]s and competition from other plants.  They do this by producing [[toxin]]s and foul-tasting or smelling chemicals.  Other compounds defend plants against disease, permit survival during drought, and prepare plants for dormancy, while other compounds are used to attract [[pollinator]]s or herbivores to spread ripe seeds.

Secondly, plant physiology includes the study of biological and chemical processes of individual plant [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Plant cells have a number of features that distinguish them from cells of [[animal]]s, and which lead to major differences in the way that plant life behaves and responds differently from animal life.  For example, plant cells have a [[cell wall]] which restricts the shape of plant cells and thereby limits the flexibility and mobility of plants.  Plant cells also contain [[chlorophyll]], a chemical compound that interacts with [[light]] in a way that enables plants to manufacture their own nutrients rather than consuming other living things as animals do.

Thirdly, plant physiology deals with interactions between cells, [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], and organs within a plant.  Different cells and tissues are physically and chemically specialized to perform different functions.  [[Root]]s and [[rhizoid]]s function to anchor the plant and acquire minerals in the soil.  [[Leaf|Leaves]] catch light in order to manufacture nutrients. For both of these organs to remain living, minerals that the roots acquire must be transported to the leaves, and the nutrients manufactured in the leaves must be transported to the roots.  Plants have developed a number of ways to achieve this transport, such as [[vascular tissue]], and the functioning of the various modes of transport is studied by plant physiologists.

Fourthly, plant physiologists study the ways that plants control or regulate internal functions.  Like animals, plants produce chemicals called [[plant hormone|hormones]] which are produced in one part of the plant to signal cells in another part of the plant to respond.  Many [[flowering plant]]s bloom at the appropriate time because of light-sensitive compounds that respond to the length of the night, a phenomenon known as [[photoperiodism]].  The [[ripening]] of [[fruit]] and loss of leaves in the winter are controlled in part by the production of the gas [[ethylene]] by the plant.

Finally, plant physiology includes the study of plant response to environmental conditions and their variation, a field known as [[#Environmental physiology|environmental physiology]].  Stress from water loss, changes in air chemistry, or crowding by other plants can lead to changes in the way a plant functions.  These changes may be affected by genetic, chemical, and physical factors.

==Biochemistry of plants==
[[Image:Latex dripping.JPG|thumb|[[Rubber|Latex]] being collected from a [[rubber tapping|tapped]] [[rubber tree]].]]
{{main|Phytochemistry}}

The [[chemical element]]s of which plants are constructed—principally [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], etc.—are the same as for all other life forms animals, fungi, [[bacteria]] and even [[virus]]es.  Only the details of the molecules into which they are assembled differs.

Despite this underlying similarity, plants produce a vast array of chemical compounds with unique properties which they use to cope with their environment.  [[Pigment]]s are used by plants to absorb or detect light, and are extracted by humans for use in [[dye]]s. Other plant products may be used for the manufacture of commercially important [[rubber]] or [[biofuel]].  Perhaps the most celebrated compounds from plants are those with [[pharmacological]] activity, such as [[salicylic acid]] from which [[aspirin]] is made, [[morphine]], and [[digoxin]].  [[Drug company|Drug companies]] spend billions of dollars each year researching plant compounds for potential medicinal benefits.

===Constituent elements===
{{further|Plant nutrition}}

Plants require some [[nutrient]]s, such as [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]], in large quantities to survive.  Some nutrients are termed [[Macronutrient (ecology)|macronutrients]], where the prefix ''macro-'' (large) refers to the quantity needed, not the size of the nutrient particles themselves.  Other nutrients, called [[micronutrient]]s, are required only in trace amounts for plants to remain healthy.  Such micronutrients are usually absorbed as [[ion]]s dissolved in water taken from the soil, though [[carnivorous plant]]s acquire some of their micronutrients from captured prey.

The following tables list [[chemical element|element]] nutrients essential to plants.  Uses within plants are generalized.

=== Pigments ===
[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the [[chlorophyll]] molecule.]]
[[Image:orange violet pansies.jpg|thumb|[[Anthocyanin]] gives these [[pansies]] their dark purple pigmentation.]]
{{main|Biological pigment}}

Among the most important molecules for plant function are the [[pigment]]s.  Plant pigments include a variety of different kinds of molecules, including [[porphyrin]]s, [[carotenoid]]s, and [[anthocyanin]]s.  All [[biological pigment]]s selectively absorb certain [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] while [[Reflection (physics)|reflecting]] others.  The light that is absorbed may be used by the plant to power [[chemical reaction]]s, while the reflected wavelengths of light determine the [[color]] the pigment appears to the eye.

[[Chlorophyll]] is the primary pigment in plants; it is a [[porphyrin]] that absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light while reflecting [[green]].  It is the presence and relative abundance of chlorophyll that gives plants their green color.  All land plants and [[green alga]]e possess two forms of this pigment: chlorophyll ''a'' and chlorophyll ''b''.  [[Kelp]]s, [[diatom]]s, and other photosynthetic [[heterokont]]s contain chlorophyll ''c'' instead of ''b'',  [[red algae]] possess  chlorophyll ''a''.  All chlorophylls serve as the primary means plants use to intercept light to fuel [[photosynthesis]].

[[Carotenoid]]s are red, orange, or yellow [[tetraterpenoid]]s.  They function as accessory pigments in plants, helping to fuel [[photosynthesis]] by gathering wavelengths of light not readily absorbed by chlorophyll.  The most familiar carotenoids are [[carotene]] (an orange pigment found in [[carrot]]s), [[lutein]] (a yellow pigment found in fruits and vegetables), and [[lycopene]] (the red pigment responsible for the color of [[tomato]]es).  Carotenoids have been shown to act as [[antioxidant]]s and to promote healthy [[eyesight]] in humans.

[[Anthocyanin]]s  (literally "flower blue") are [[solubility|water-soluble]] [[flavonoid]] [[pigments]] that appear red to blue, according to [[pH]]. They occur in all [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of higher plants, providing color in [[leaf|leaves]], [[plant stem|stems]], [[root]]s, [[flower]]s, and [[fruit]]s, though not always in sufficient quantities to be noticeable. Anthocyanins are most visible in the [[petal]]s of flowers, where they may make up as much as 30% of the dry weight of the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Trevor Robinson| title = The organic constituents of higher plants: their chemistry and interrelationships| year = 1963| publisher = Cordus Press| page = 183  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also responsible for the purple color seen on the underside of tropical shade plants such as ''[[Tradescantia zebrina]]''. In these plants, the anthocyanin catches light that has passed through the leaf and reflects it back towards regions bearing chlorophyll, in order to maximize the use of available light

[[Betalain]]s are red or yellow pigments.  Like anthocyanins they are water-soluble, but unlike anthocyanins they are [[indole]]-derived compounds synthesized from [[tyrosine]].  This class of pigments is found only in the [[Caryophyllales]] (including [[cactus]] and [[amaranth]]), and never co-occur in plants with anthocyanins. Betalains are responsible for the deep red color of [[beet]]s, and are used commercially as food-coloring agents.  Plant physiologists are uncertain of the function that betalains have in plants which possess them, but there is some preliminary evidence that they may have fungicidal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Signals and regulators==
[[Image:Auxin.jpg|thumb|A [[mutation]] that stops ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' responding to [[auxin]] causes abnormal growth (right)]]
Plants produce hormones and other growth regulators which act to signal a physiological response in their tissues.  They also produce compounds such as [[phytochrome]] that are sensitive to light and which serve to trigger growth or development in response to environmental signals.

===Plant hormones===
{{main|Plant hormone}}

[[Plant hormone]]s, known as plant growth regulators (PGRs) or phytohormones, are chemicals that regulate a plant's growth. According to a standard animal definition, [[hormone]]s are signal molecules produced at specific locations, that occur in very low concentrations, and cause altered processes in target cells at other locations. Unlike animals, plants lack specific hormone-producing tissues or organs.  Plant hormones are often not transported to other parts of the plant and production is not limited to specific locations.

Plant hormones are [[chemical]]s that in small amounts promote and influence the [[cell growth|growth]], [[morphogenesis|development]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of cells and tissues. Hormones are vital to plant growth; affecting processes in plants from flowering to [[seed]] development, [[dormancy]], and [[germination]]. They regulate which tissues grow upwards and which grow downwards, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, as well as leaf [[abscission]] and even plant death.

The most important plant hormones are [[abscissic acid]] (ABA), [[auxin]]s, [[ethylene]], [[gibberellin]]s, and [[cytokinin]]s, though there are many other substances that serve to regulate plant physiology.

===Photomorphogenesis===
{{main|Photomorphogenesis}}

While most people know that [[light]] is important for photosynthesis in plants, few realize that plant sensitivity to light plays a role in the control of plant structural development ([[morphogenesis]]).  The use of light to control structural development is called [[photomorphogenesis]], and is dependent upon the presence of specialized [[Photopigment|photoreceptors]], which are chemical [[pigment]]s capable of absorbing specific [[wavelength]]s of light.

Plants use four kinds of photoreceptors:&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992" /&gt; [[phytochrome]], [[cryptochrome]], a [[UV-B]] photoreceptor, and [[protochlorophyllide|protochlorophyllide ''a'']].  The first two of these, phytochrome and cryptochrome, are [[photoreceptor protein]]s, complex molecular structures formed by joining a [[protein]] with a light-sensitive pigment.  Cryptochrome is also known as the UV-A photoreceptor, because it absorbs [[ultraviolet]] light in the long wave "A" region.  The UV-B receptor is one or more compounds not yet identified with certainty, though some evidence suggests [[carotene]] or [[riboflavin]] as candidates.&lt;ref name="Fosket 1994"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fosket| first = Donald E.| title = Plant Growth and Development: A Molecular Approach| year = 1994| publisher = Academic Press| location = San Diego| isbn = 0-12-262430-0| pages = 498–509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protochlorophyllide ''a'', as its name suggests, is a chemical precursor of [[chlorophyll]].

The most studied of the photoreceptors in plants is [[phytochrome]].  It is sensitive to light in the [[red]] and [[far-red]] region of the [[visible spectrum]]. Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of [[flower]]ing based on the length of day and night ([[photoperiodism]]) and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the [[epicotyl]] or [[hypocotyl]] hook of [[dicot]] seedlings.

===Photoperiodism===
[[Image:Poinsettia 2.jpg|thumb|The [[poinsettia]] is a short-day plant, requiring two months of long nights prior to blooming.]]
{{main|Photoperiodism}}

Many [[flowering plant]]s use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in [[day]] length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed [[photoperiodism]]. Broadly speaking, flowering plants can be classified as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length.  Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to starts flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may use temperature sensitivity ([[vernalization]]) instead.

Although a short day plant cannot flower during the long days of summer, it is not actually the period of light exposure that limits flowering.  Rather, a short day plant requires a minimal length of uninterrupted darkness in each 24-hour period (a short daylength) before floral development can begin.  It has been determined experimentally that a short day plant (long night) does not flower if a flash of phytochrome activating light is used on the plant during the night.

Plants make use of the phytochrome system to sense day length or photoperiod.  This fact is utilized by [[florist]]s and [[greenhouse]] gardeners to control and even induce flowering out of season, such as the ''[[Poinsettia]]''.

==Environmental physiology==
[[Image:Arabidopsis thaliana.jpg|thumb|[[Phototropism]] in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is regulated by blue to UV light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantphys.net/article.php?id=266 plantphys.net]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Ecophysiology}}

Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of environmental physiology is on the one hand a recent field of study in plant ecology and on the other hand one of the oldest.&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992" /&gt; Environmental physiology is the preferred name of the subdiscipline among plant physiologists, but it goes by a number of other names in the applied sciences. It is roughly synonymous with [[ecophysiology]], crop ecology, [[horticulture]] and [[agronomy]]. The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of [[ecology]].

Environmental physiologists examine plant response to physical factors such as [[radiation]] (including [[light]] and [[ultraviolet]] radiation), [[temperature]], [[fire]], and [[wind]]. Of particular importance are [[water]] relations (which can be measured with the [[Pressure bomb]]) and the stress of [[drought]] or [[flood|inundation]], exchange of gases with the [[atmosphere]], as well as the cycling of nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]].

Environmental physiologists also examine plant response to biological factors.  This includes not only negative interactions, such as [[competition (biology)|competition]], [[herbivory]], [[disease]] and [[parasitism]], but also positive interactions, such as [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[pollination]].

===Tropisms and nastic movements===
{{main|Tropism|Nastic movement}}

Plants may respond both to directional and non-directional [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].  A response to a directional stimulus, such as [[gravity]] or sun[[light]], is called a tropism.  A response to a nondirectional stimulus, such as [[temperature]] or [[humidity]], is a nastic movement.

[[Tropism]]s in plants are the result of differential [[cell (biology)|cell]] growth, in which the cells on one side of the plant elongates more than those on the other side, causing the part to bend toward the side with less growth.  Among the common tropisms seen in plants is [[phototropism]], the bending of the plant toward a source of light.  Phototropism allows the plant to maximize light exposure in plants which require additional light for photosynthesis, or to minimize it in plants subjected to intense light and heat. [[Geotropism]] allows the roots of a plant to determine the direction of gravity and grow downwards.  Tropisms generally result from an interaction between the environment and production of one or more plant hormones.

[[Nastic movement]]s results from differential cell growth (e.g. epinasty and hiponasty), or from changes in [[turgor pressure]] within plant tissues (e.g., [[nyctinasty]]), which may occur rapidly.  A familiar example is [[thigmonasty]] (response to touch) in the [[Venus fly trap]], a [[carnivorous plant]].  The traps consist of modified leaf blades which bear sensitive trigger hairs. When the hairs are touched by an insect or other animal, the leaf folds shut.  This mechanism allows the plant to trap and digest small insects for additional nutrients.  Although the trap is rapidly shut by changes in internal cell pressures, the leaf must grow slowly to reset for a second opportunity to trap insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Adrian Charles Slack|author2=Jane Gate | title = Carnivorous Plants| year = 1980| publisher = Cambridge, Massachusetts : MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-19186-9| page = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant disease===
[[Image:Powdery mildew.JPG|thumb|[[Powdery mildew]] on crop leaves]]
{{main|Phytopathology}}

Economically, one of the most important areas of research in environmental physiology is that of [[phytopathology]], the study of [[disease]]s in plants and the manner in which plants resist or cope with infection.  Plant are susceptible to the same kinds of disease organisms as animals, including [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], and [[fungi]], as well as physical invasion by [[insect]]s and [[roundworm]]s.

Because the biology of plants differs with animals, their symptoms and responses are quite different.  In some cases, a plant can simply shed infected leaves or flowers to prevent the spread of disease, in a process called abscission.  Most animals do not have this option as a means of controlling disease.  Plant diseases organisms themselves also differ from those causing disease in animals because plants cannot usually spread infection through casual physical contact.  Plant [[pathogen]]s tend to spread via [[spore]]s or are carried by animal [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]].

One of the most important advances in the control of plant disease was the discovery of [[Bordeaux mixture]] in the nineteenth century.  The mixture is the first known [[fungicide]] and is a combination of [[copper sulfate]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]].  Application of the mixture served to inhibit the growth of [[downy mildew]] that threatened to seriously damage the [[France|French]] [[wine]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kingsley Rowland Stern|author2=Shelley Jansky | title = Introductory Plant Biology| year = 1991| publisher = WCB/McGraw-Hill| isbn = 978-0-697-09948-8| page = 309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of botany}}

===Early history===
[[Image:Portrait of J.B. van Helmont, Aufgang...1683 Wellcome L0003194.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].]]
Sir [[Francis Bacon]] published one of the first plant physiology experiments in 1627 in the book, ''Sylva Sylvarum.'' Bacon grew several terrestrial plants, including a rose, in water and concluded that soil was only needed to keep the plant upright. [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] published what is considered the first quantitative experiment in plant physiology in 1648. He grew a willow tree for five years in a pot containing 200 pounds of oven-dry soil. The soil lost just two ounces of dry weight and van Helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from water, not soil. In 1699, [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] published experiments on growth of [[spearmint]] in different sources of water. He found that plants grew much better in water with soil added than in distilled water.

[[Stephen Hales]] is considered the Father of Plant Physiology for the many experiments in the 1727 book;&lt;ref&gt;Hales, Stephen. 1727. ''Vegetable Staticks'' http://www.illustratedgarden.org/mobot/rarebooks/title.asp?relation=QK711H341727&lt;/ref&gt; though
[[Julius von Sachs]] unified the pieces of plant physiology and put them together as a discipline. His ''Lehrbuch der Botanik'' was the plant physiology bible of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Duane Isely| title = 101 Botanists| year = 1994| publisher = Iowa State Press| isbn = 978-0-8138-2498-7| pages = 216–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers discovered in the 1800s that plants absorb essential mineral nutrients as inorganic ions in water. In natural conditions, soil acts as a mineral nutrient reservoir but the soil itself is not essential to plant growth. When the mineral nutrients in the soil are dissolved in water, plant roots absorb nutrients readily, soil is no longer required for the plant to thrive. This observation is the basis for [[hydroponics]], the growing of plants in a water solution rather than soil, which has become a standard technique in biological research, teaching lab exercises, crop production and as a hobby.

===Current research===
One of the leading journals in the field is ''[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]]'', started in 1926. All its back issues are available online for free.[http://www.plantphysiol.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml] Many other journals often carry plant physiology articles, including ''Physiologia Plantarum'', ''Journal of Experimental Botany'', ''[[American Journal of Botany]]'', ''Annals of Botany'', ''Journal of Plant Nutrition'' and ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]].''

==Economic applications==

=== Food production ===
{{further|Agriculture|Horticulture}}

In [[horticulture]] and [[agriculture]] along with [[food science]], plant physiology is an important topic relating to [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s, and other consumable parts of plants.  Topics studied include: ''climatic'' requirements, fruit drop, nutrition, [[ripening]], fruit set.  The production of food crops also hinges on the study of plant physiology covering such topics as optimal planting and harvesting times and post harvest storage of plant products for human consumption and the production of secondary products like drugs and cosmetics.

'''[[Project]]-based learning''' ('''PBL''') is a [[Student-centred learning|student-centered]] [[pedagogy]] that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning ''Project-Based Learning,'' Edutopia, March 14, 2016].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Students learn about a subject by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to a complex question, challenge, or problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bie.org/about/what_pbl ''What is PBL?'' Buck Institute for Education].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a style of [[active learning]] and [[inquiry-based learning]].  PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote memorization, or teacher-led instruction that presents established facts or portrays a smooth path to knowledge by instead posing questions, problems or scenarios.

Thomas Markham (2011) describes project-based learning (PBL) thus: "PBL integrates knowing and doing. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum—a shift mandated by the global world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resiliency. These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience."&lt;ref&gt;Markham, T. (2011). Project Based Learning. Teacher Librarian, 39(2), 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  James G. Greeno (2006) has associated project-based learning with the "situated learning" perspective&lt;ref&gt;Greeno, J. G. (2006). Learning in activity. In R. K. Sawyer (Ed.), The Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences (pp. 79-96). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)|constructivist]] theories of [[Jean Piaget]]. Blumenfeld ''et al.'' elaborate on the processes of PBL: "Project-based learning is a comprehensive perspective focused on teaching by engaging students in investigation. Within this framework, students pursue solutions to nontrivial problems by asking and refining questions, debating ideas, making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking new questions, and creating artifacts."&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld et al 1991, EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST, 26(3&amp;4) 369-398 "Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning." Phyllis C. Blumenfeld, Elliot Soloway, Ronald W. Marx, Joseph S. Krajcik, Mark Guzdial, and Annemarie Palincsar.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of PBL lies in the authenticity or real-life application of the research. Students working as a team are given a "driving question" to respond to or answer, then directed to create an artifact (or artifacts) to present their gained knowledge. Artifacts may include a variety of media such as writings, art, drawings, three-dimensional representations, videos, photography, or technology-based presentations.

Proponents of project-based learning cite numerous benefits to the implementation of its strategies in the classroom –  including a greater depth of understanding of concepts, broader knowledge base, improved communication and interpersonal/social skills, enhanced [[leadership]] skills, increased [[creativity]], and improved writing skills. Another definition of project-based learning includes a type of instruction, where students work together to solve real-world problems in their schools and communities. Successful problem-solving often requires students to draw on lessons from several disciplines and apply them in a very practical way. The promise of seeing a very real impact becomes the motivation for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education World|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/problem-based-learning-tips-ideas.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dewey]] initially promoted the idea of "learning by doing". In ''My Pedagogical Creed'' (1897) Dewey enumerated his beliefs regarding education: "The teacher is not in the school to impose certain ideas or to form certain habits in the child, but is there as a member of the community to select the influences which shall affect the child and to assist him in properly responding to these.......I believe, therefore, in the so-called expressive or constructive activities as the centre of correlation."&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, Education and Experience, 1938/1997. New York. Touchstone.&lt;/ref&gt;(Dewey, 1897) Educational research has advanced this idea of teaching and learning into a methodology known as "project-based learning". Blumenfeld &amp; Krajcik (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, R. K. (2006) The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; cite studies by Marx ''et al.'', 2004, Rivet &amp; Krajcki, 2004 and William &amp; Linn, 2003 state that "research has demonstrated that students in project-based learning classrooms get higher scores than students in traditional classroom".

In ''Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?'', Hye-Jung &amp; Cheolil (2012) describe "social loafing" as a negative aspect of collaborative learning. Social loafing may include insufficient performances by some team members as well as a lowering of expected standards of performance by the group as a whole to maintain congeniality amongst members. These authors said that because teachers tend to grade the finished product only, the social dynamics of the assignment may escape the teacher's notice.&lt;ref&gt;

==Structure==
Project-based learning emphasizes learning activities that are long-term, interdisciplinary and student-centered. Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom activities, students often must organize their own work and manage their own time in a project-based class. Project-based instruction differs from traditional inquiry by its emphasis on students' collaborative or individual artifact construction to represent what is being learned.

Project-based learning also gives students the opportunity to explore problems and challenges that have real-world applications, increasing the possibility of long-term retention of skills and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crane|first1=Beverley|title=Using Web 2.0 Tools in the K-12 Classroom|date=2009|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55570-653-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world problems capture students' interest and provoke serious thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context. The teacher plays the role of facilitator, working with students to frame worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both knowledge development and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience. Typical projects present a problem to solve (What is the best way to reduce the pollution in the schoolyard pond?) or a phenomenon to investigate (What causes rain?). PBL replaces other traditional models of instruction such as lecture, textbook-workbook driven activities and inquiry as the preferred delivery method for key topics in the curriculum. It is an instructional framework which allows teachers to facilitate  and assess  deeper understanding  rather than stand and deliver factual  information. PBL intentionally develops students' problem solving and creative making of products to communicate deeper understanding of key concepts and mastery of 21st Century essential learning skills such as critical thinking. Students become active digital researchers and assessors of their own learning when teachers guide student learning so that students learn from the project making processes. In this context, PBLs are units of self-directed learning from students' doing or making throughout the unit. PBL is not just "an activity" (project) that is stuck on the end of a lesson or unit.

Comprehensive project-based learning:

==Examples==
[[File:Project based learning in secondary school Euroinstitut.jpg|thumb|Project based learning in secondary school Euroinstitut]]
Although projects are the primary vehicle for instruction in project-based learning, there are no commonly shared criteria for what constitutes an acceptable project. Projects vary greatly in the depth of the questions explored, the clarity of the learning goals, the content and structure of the activity, and guidance from the teacher. The role of projects in the overall curriculum is also open to interpretation. Projects can guide the entire curriculum (more common in charter or other alternative schools) or simply consist of a few hands-on activities. They might be multidisciplinary (more likely in elementary schools) or single-subject (commonly science and math). Some projects involve the whole class, while others are done in small groups or individually. For example, Perrault and Albert&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Albert|first2=Cindy A.|date=2017-10-04|title=Utilizing project-based learning to increase sustainability attitudes among students|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1533015X.2017.1366882|journal=Applied Environmental Education &amp; Communication|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/1533015x.2017.1366882|issn=1533-015X}}&lt;/ref&gt; report the results of a PBL assignment in a college setting surrounding creating a communication campaign for the campus' sustainability office, finding that after project completion in small groups that the students had significantly more positive attitudes toward sustainability than prior to working on the project.

When PBL is used with [[21st century skills|21st century tools/skills]], students are expected to use technology in meaningful ways to help them investigate, collaborate, analyze, synthesize and present their learning. The term IPBL (Interdisciplinary PBL) has also been used to reflect a pedagogy where an emphasis on technology and/or an interdisciplinary approach has been included.

An example of a school that utilizes a project-based learning curriculum is [[Think Global School]]. In each country [http://www.thinkglobalschool.org (THINK Global School)] visits, students select an interdisciplinary, project-based learning module designed to help them answer key questions about the world around them. These projects combine elements of global studies, the sciences, and literature, among other courses. Projects from past years have included recreating Homer's The Odyssey by sailing across Greece and exploring the locations and concepts central to the epic poem, and while in Kerala, India, students participated in a project-based learning module centered around blending their learning and travels into a mock business venture. The interdisciplinary project was designed to enable students to engage in the key areas of problem solving, decision making and communication — all framed by the demanding parameters of a "[[Shark Tank]]", or "[[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragon's Den]]" style competition.

Another example of applied PBL is [[Muscatine High School]], located in Muscatine, Iowa. The school started the [http://www.g-squared.info G2 (Global Generation Exponential Learning)] which consists of middle and high school "Schools within Schools" that deliver the four core subject areas. At the high school level, activities may include making water purification systems, investigating service learning, or creating new bus routes. At the middle school level, activities may include researching trash statistics, documenting local history through interviews, or writing essays about a community scavenger hunt. Classes are designed to help diverse students become college and career ready after high school.

In 2009, The Illinois Consortium for 21st Century Schools lead by Deeper Learning author Jim Bellanca, initiated a 5-year deeper learning research project to identify the best practices and conditions among existing PBL models. In 6 pilot schools with students from the low performing to the highest performing, they piloted their findings. The goal was to test if all school/all day public schools could be transformed by  PBL as initiated in schools such as Manor New Tech, 
This would test if traditional schools with established faculty could make such this deep shift.

As a result of the all school adoption of PBL in  collaborative school wide cultures, several pilot schools earned accolades as P21 Exemplar schools
([http://www.p21.org/exemplar-program-case-studies/1301-case-study-franklin-elementary-school http://www.p21exemplars/Franklin]) with raised achievement results and obvious evidence of teacher practice change.  The model calls for all  teachers and administrators to engage in a multi-year professional development effort which changed school culture, teachers re designing their units of study, teachers  vetting all units and deciding which to contribute to a school based digital PBL library of unit plans and student artifacts, revisions in RTI,  revisions in teacher evaluation and in student "grading".as well as an upgrading of grade level PLCs. The model empowers teachers to change how they deliver instruction so that MindQuest21 PBL is the dominant model of instruction in every classroom. The model was assessed in one three school public district with a rising "free and reduced,lunch"  population.  Following the pilot years, the Consortium initiated this change program in Chicago Public Schools, Atlanta Public Schools, and in a rural Illinois statewide network. The P21 Exemplar school site provides videos and descriptions of the Illinois projects as well as other PBL projects across the country.

Another example is [[Manor Independent School District|Manor New Technology High School]], a public high school that since opening in 2007 is a 100 percent project-based instruction school. Students average 60 projects a year across subjects. It is reported that 98 percent of seniors graduate, 100 percent of the graduates are accepted to college, and fifty-six percent of them have been the first in their family to attend college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/stw-project-based-learning-best-practices-new-tech-high-school#more|What Makes Project-Based Learning a Success?]. Retrieved 2013-10-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has also providing funding for project-based learning projects within the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. For example, [http://www.popullar.eu/ PopuLLar - Music and language learning], [http://www.clohe-movingtoys.eu/ Moving toys in the classroom] and [http://www.artined.eu/ ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts].

According to Terry Heick on his blog, Teach Thought, there are three types of project-based learning. The first is Challenge-Based Learning/Problem-Based Learning, the second is Place-Based Education, and the third is Activity-Based learning. Challenge-Based Learning is "an engaging multidisciplinary approach to teaching and learning that encourages students to leverage the technology they use in their daily lives to solve real-world problems through efforts in their homes, schools and communities." Place-based Education "immerses students in local heritage, cultures, landscapes, opportunities and experiences; uses these as a foundation for the study of language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum, and emphasizes learning through participation in service projects for the local school and/or community." Activity-Based Learning takes a kind of constructivist approach, the idea being students constructing their own meaning through hands-on activities, often with manipulatives and opportunities to. As a private school provider [[Nobel Education Network]] combines PBL with the [[International Baccalaureate]] as a central pillar of their strategy.

==Roles==
PBL relies on learning groups. Student groups determine their projects, in so doing, they engage [[student voice]] by encouraging students to take full responsibility for their learning. This is what makes PBL [[constructivist learning|constructivist]]. Students work together to accomplish specific goals.

When students use technology as a tool to communicate with others, they take on an active role vs. a passive role of transmitting the information by a teacher, a book, or broadcast. The student is constantly making choices on how to obtain, display, or manipulate information. Technology makes it possible for students to think actively about the choices they make and execute. Every student has the opportunity to get involved either individually or as a group.

Instructor role in Project Based Learning is that of a facilitator. They do not relinquish control of the classroom or student learning but rather develop an atmosphere of shared responsibility. The Instructor must structure the proposed question/issue so as to direct the student's learning toward content-based materials. The instructor must regulate student success with intermittent, transitional goals to ensure student projects remain focused and students have a deep understanding of the concepts being investigated. The students are held accountable to these goals through ongoing feedback and assessments. The ongoing assessment and feedback are essential to ensure the student stays within the scope of the driving question and the core standards the project is trying to unpack. According to Andrew Miller of the Buck Institute of Education, formative assessments are used "in order to be transparent to parents and students, you need to be able to track and monitor ongoing formative assessments, that show work toward that standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Andrew|title=Edutopia|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/effective-assessment-project-based-learning-andrew-miller|publisher=© 2013 The George Lucas Educational Foundation|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instructor uses these assessments to guide the inquiry process and ensure the students have learned the required content. Once the project is finished, the instructor evaluates the finished product and learning that it demonstrates

Student role is to ask questions, build knowledge, and determine a real-world solution to the issue/question presented. Students must collaborate expanding their active listening skills and requiring them to engage in intelligent focused communication. Therefore, allowing them to think rationally on how to solve problems. PBL forces students to take ownership of their success.

==Outcomes==
More important than learning science, students need to learn to work in a community, thereby taking on social responsibilities. The most significant contributions of PBL have been in schools languishing in poverty stricken areas; when students take responsibility, or ownership, for their learning, their self-esteem soars. It also helps to create better work habits and attitudes toward learning. In standardized tests, languishing schools have been able to raise their testing grades a full level by implementing PBL.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Although students do work in groups, they also become more independent because they are receiving little instruction from the teacher. With Project-Based Learning students also learn skills that are essential in higher education. The students learn more than just finding answers, PBL allows them to expand their minds and think beyond what they normally would. Students have to find answers to questions and combine them using critically thinking skills to come up with answers.

PBL is significant to the study of (mis-)conceptions; local concepts and childhood intuitions that are hard to replace with conventional classroom lessons. In PBL, project science ''is'' the community culture; the student groups themselves resolve their understandings of phenomena with their own knowledge building. Technology allows them to search in more useful ways, along with getting more rapid results.

Opponents of Project Based Learning warn against negative outcomes primarily in projects that become unfocused and tangential arguing that underdeveloped lessons can result in the wasting of precious class time. No one teaching method has been proven more effective than another. Opponents suggest that narratives and presentation of anecdotal evidence included in lecture-style instruction can convey the same knowledge in less class time. Given that disadvantaged students generally have fewer opportunities to learn academic content outside of school, wasted class time due to an unfocused lesson presents a particular problem. Instructors can be deluded into thinking that as long as a student is engaged and doing, they are learning. Ultimately it is cognitive activity that determines the success of a lesson. If the project does not remain on task and content driven the student will not be successful in learning the material. The lesson will be ineffective. A source of difficulty for teachers includes, "Keeping these complex projects on track while attending to students' individual learning needs requires artful teaching, as well as industrial-strength project management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/projects-partnerships-pbl-suzie-boss|title=Projects and Partnerships Build a Stronger Future - Edutopia|author=|date=|website=edutopia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any approach, Project Based Learning is only beneficial when applied successfully.

[[Problem-based learning]] is a similar pedagogic approach, however, problem-based approaches structure students' activities more by asking them to solve specific (open-ended) problems rather than relying on students to come up with their own problems in the course of completing a project.

A meta-analysis conducted by Purdue University found that when implemented well, PBL can increase long-term retention of material and replicable skill, as well as improve teachers' and students' attitudes towards learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/ijpbl/vol3/iss1/4/|title=When is PBL More Effective?

==Overcoming obstacles and criticisms==
A frequent criticism of PBL is that when students work in groups some will "slack off" or sit back and let the others do all the work.  Anne Shaw recommends that teachers always build into the structure of the PBL curriculum an organizational strategy known as Jigsaw and Expert Groups.  This structure forces students to be self-directed, independent and to work interdependently.

This means that the class is assigned (preferably randomly, by lottery) to Expert Groups.  Each of the Expert Groups is then assigned to deeply study one particular facet of the overall project.  For example, a class studying about environmental issues in their community may be divided into the following Expert Groups:

#  Air
#  Land
#  Water
#  Human impact on the environment

Each Expert Group is tasked with studying the materials for their group, taking notes, then preparing to teach what they learned to the rest of the students in the class.  To do so, the class will "jigsaw", thus creating Jigsaw Groups.  The Jigsaw Groups in the above example would each be composed of one representative from each of the Expert Groups, so each Jigsaw Group would include:

#  One expert on Air
#  One expert on Land
#  One expert on Water
#  One expert on "Human impact on the environment"

Each of these experts would then take turns teaching the others in the group.  Total interdependence is assured.  No one can "slack off" because each student is the only person in the group with that "piece" of the information.  Another benefit is that the students must have learned the concepts, skills and information well enough to be able to teach it and must be able to assess (not grade) their own learning and the learning of their peers.  This forces a much deeper learning experience.

Anne Shaw recommends that when students are teaching each other they also participate collaboratively in creating a concept map as they teach each other. This adds a significant dimension to the thinking and the learning.  The students may build upon this map each time they Jigsaw.  If a project is scheduled to last over the time period of six weeks the students may meet in their Expert Groups twice a week, and then Jigsaw twice a week, building upon their learning and exploration of the topics over time.

Once all the experts have taught each other, the Jigsaw Group then designs and creates a product to demonstrate what they now know about all four aspects of the PBL unit – air, land, water, human's impact.  Performance-based products may include a wide range of possibilities such as dioramas, skits, plays, debates, student-produced documentaries, web sites, Glogsters, VoiceThreads, games (digital or not), presentations to members of the community (such as the City Council or a community organization), student-produced radio or television program, a student-organized conference, a fair, a film festival.

Students are assessed in two ways:

#  Individual assessments for each student – may include research notes, teaching prep notes and teacher observation.  Other assessments may include those assigned by the teacher, for example, each student in the class must write an individual research paper for a topic of their choice from within the theme of the overall PBL.
#  Group assessments – each Jigsaw group creates and presents their product, preferably to an audience other than the teacher or their class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21stCenturySchools.com 21st Century Schools].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One concern is that PBL may be inappropriate in mathematics, the reason being that mathematics is primarily skill-based at the elementary level. Transforming the curriculum into an over-reaching project or series of projects does not allow for necessary practice of particular mathematical skills. For instance, factoring quadratic expressions in elementary algebra requires extensive repetition.

On the other hand, a teacher could integrate a PBL approach into the standard curriculum, helping the students see some broader contexts where abstract quadratic equations may apply. For example, Newton's law implies that tossed objects follow a parabolic path, and the roots of the corresponding equation correspond to the starting and ending locations of the object.

Another criticism of PBL is that measures that are stated as reasons for its success are not measurable using standard measurement tools, and rely on subjective rubrics for assessing results.

In PBL there is also a certain tendency for the creation of the final product of the project to become the driving force in classroom activities. When this happens, the project can lose its content focus and be ineffective in helping students learn certain concepts and skills. For example, academic projects that culminate in an artistic display or exhibit may place more emphasis on the artistic processes involved in creating the display than on the academic content that the project is meant to help students learn.

'''Society for the National Heritage of Iran''' ({{lang-fa|انجمن آثار ملی ایران}} "''anjoman asar-e meli''") or "SNH" for short, was a [[Grassroots|grass root]] political and archeological group created by a group of educated, and nationalistic [[Iran]]ians in 1922, toward the end of the [[Qajar]] governance in Iran.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The society was composed of influential Iranian figures of the time with the overall goal of preservation of Iranian [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], archeological sites, and protection of the [[Iranian culture]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and Cultural Politics Under Reza Shah: The Pahlavi State, New Bourgeoisie and the Creation of a Modern Society in Iran|author1=Bianca Devos |author2=Christoph Werner |year=2013|pages=129–136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=Society+for+National+Heritage+of+Iran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HVk6U5nwCOjMsQT2-YLADg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Society%20for%20National%20Heritage%20of%20Iran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/anjoman-e-aar-e-melli-aam-the-national-monuments-council-of-iran-established-in-1301-s |title=Anjoman-e Āsar-e Melli |last1=Sadiq |first1=I|date=15 Dec 1985|website=Encyclopedia Iranica |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran in 1922 was influenced by internal and external forces, and the SNH reflects this tug of war between what was the external forces mainly from Europe, and internal/social factors.

==Background==

Early 1900s were time of discovery and archeological exploration in Iran. It was also time of social and political change. The [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1906 had rocked the perception of the absolute control of the king in society. It created an [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian Parliament]] and had reduced the monarch's power.&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Persian Literary Humanism|author=Hamid Dabashi|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqWIhuwtppUC&amp;pg=PT223&amp;dq=Persian+constitutional+revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JW86U4yBE_DJsQTqr4DgBQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Persian%20constitutional%20revolution&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Revolution was in some ways the first political expression of the public sphere, that the poets and the literati, now completely out of the Qajar court had drafted with diligence and steadfast determination.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; The foreign interest in archeology and Iranian history has also peaked with several well known scholars from [[France]], [[England]] and [[Russia]] vying for control. France in particular was very influential in preservation of the Iranian artifacts and in fact the involved French parties exhibited both interest in Persian history, and archeology and at the same time feared that these artifacts would be dispersed and sold.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; France would play a critical role in protection of Iranian artifacts but ironically it also wanted an absolute monopoly for all Persian artifacts in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|author1=Prudence Oliver Harper |author2=Joan Aruz |author3=Françoise Tallon |author4=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1992|pages=16–18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDWJ_KBHwe4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=French+monopoly+in+Persia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O4s6U5XMI9WxsQSCpYG4Ag&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=French%20monopoly%20in%20Persia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renown French archeologist [[Jacques de Morgan]] in fact wanted to preserve Persian art to the point that in 1897 proposed to the Naser al-Din Shah the idea of creation of a [[National Museum of Iran|National Archeological museum]] in [[Tehran]].

In spite of his pure interest in Persian artifacts in Iran, after the first few seasons of archeological excavations in Iran yielded numerous rare finds, de Morgan changed his opinion and advocated an absolute French monopoly on all finds and proposed transfer of all Iranian discoveries to France.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; This attitude was not only unique to de Morgan and was shared by all French emissaries to Iran. In spite of their great contribution to Iranian artifacts specially in such places as [[Susa]], France's insistence on its absolute monopoly would lead to other foreign powers being involved in Iran and the development of resentment by the secular Iranian intellectuals who did not want Iran's history broken up and exported.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt; France's prime position in Iran, specially through influences on political figures such as the Prime minister [[Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Amin al-Sultan]] under [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] meant that France could convince the king to abandon the project.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; In fact Naser al-Din shah abandoned the project and it was not till years later when the National Museum's construction took place in 1917 under the supervision of [[Morteza Gholi Bayat|Morteza Khan Momtas al-Molk]] (Morteza Gholi).&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

It was in this context that after the [[1921 Persian coup d'etat]] led by [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] and [[Zia'eddin Tabatabaee]] and unification of Iran, a group of patriotic, educated Iranian figures namely [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]] (Zoka al-Molk), [[Ebrahim Hakimi]] (Hakim al-Molk), and [[Hassan Pirnia]] (Moshir al-Dowleh) created a cultural group that would later be known as the SNH with the aim of protecting and advocating Iran's patrimony.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran and the International System|author1=Anoushiravan Ehteshami |author2=Reza Molavi |publisher=Routledge|year=2012|pages=155–156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5o-oAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=society+for+national+heritage+of+Iran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oYg6U5_5DOnSsASDmICwDw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=society%20for%20national%20heritage%20of%20Iran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and Achievements==

The goal of the SNH was in a general sense to preserve, protect and promote Iranian patrimony but in a specific sense it focused on three aspects: 1) Establishing a museum and library in Tehran and Ending the prestigious but monopolized French archeology in Iran, 2) proper identification, registration of all artifacts and monuments that were in need of repair or catalog, and 3) preparing and recording a list of all antiques in possession of government or other groups pertaining to ancient Iran's history.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The group would be instrumental in eliciting the proper funds from the Iranian Parliament in order to achieve the aforementioned goals.

===Architectural Projects===

The group was able to secure enough funds from the Iranian parliament to remodel and build the [[Tomb of Ferdowsi]]&lt;ref name=b/&gt; as well as being critical in its design and its use of the [[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid architectural]] styling. The project was started in 1928 and ended in 1934 to coincide with [[Ferdowsi Millenary Celebration]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The group also expanded and had close connection to other secular figures at the times including [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]], and [[Keikhosrow Shahrokh]]. The official group members and the ancillary associates were critical in the decision making process and in fact often influenced each other. Perhaps as impressive as the group's involvement was in creation of the Tomb of Ferdowsi in [[Tus, Iran]], it was an equally critical player in creation of the Tomb of Avicenna (Mausoleum of [[Avicenna]]) in [[Hamedan]], Iran in 1944.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The group was also involved in creation of [[Saadi Shirazi]]'s mausoleum in [[Shiraz]], Iran, creation of [[Nadir Shah]] mausoleum and museum in [[Mashhad]], Iran, creation of the mausoleum of [[Baba Tahir]], in Hamedan, Iran, and creation of tomb of [[Omar Khayyam]] in [[Nishapur]], Iran.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The group was involved in countless culturally-themed architectural endeavors. The table at the bottom of this article denotes their most significant contributions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Archeological Monopoly===

Although not directly involved in ending the French monopoly, the SNH was part of a broader national movement to end French monopoly in Iran and to nationalize the ownership of the artifacts. The group invited speeches by such archeological figures at the time as [[Ernst Herzfeld]] head of German Institute of Oriental Archeology, and the well known American archeologist [[Arthur Upham Pope]] in form of conferences.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The first publication of the group was in fact made with help of Herzfeld and was a list of all historical archeological sites in Iran.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; Reza Shah did not interfere with the works of Ernst Herzfeld or the French archeologists neither did he take sides, but he did ensure that their excavations go smooth and that Persian monuments are recovered with the best portion of them going to Iranian ownership.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The combined efforts of the SNH and other cultural and historical groups at the time led to Iran having the majority monopoly over the recovery of its own artifacts and discoveries.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Linguistic Influence===

Although primarily an architectural and political entity, the SNH also advocated or assisted individuals who had hoped for a revitalization of the Persian language. One major move at the time of SNH was de-listing Arabic loan words and replacing them with old or new Persian words. Even though SNH was involved in publications and advocacy of a more cohesive Persian language, it was intellectuals such as Sadiq Kiya and Ibrahim Purdavus who through their publications, and their focus on Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]] created a Persian vocabulary that was mainly New, Middle, or Old Persian in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystics, Monarchs, and Messiahs: Cultural Landscapes of Early Modern Iran|author=Kathryn Babayan|publisher=Harvard CMES|year=2002|pages=490–493|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLoUePLTdfgC&amp;pg=PA492&amp;dq=Reza+Shah+Persian+words&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p6U6U6OFIqqhsQTFioG4CQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Reza%20Shah%20Persian%20words&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acta Iranica|author=Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin|publisher=Brill|year=1978|pages=409|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdZNEOza3TwC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=sadiq+kiya+persian+words&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d6Y6U6jPDYugsQTtsIGYCw&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sadiq%20kiya%20persian%20words&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless through its publications SNH was a force behind removing of foreign words from [[Persian language|Persian]].

===Legacy===
Nearly every significant Persian poet whose mausoleum is in Iran has benefited from SNH's involvement. SNH has been critical in protection and identification of Iranian artifacts and language as well. [[Iran]] having a significant Pre-Islamic history, as well an equally significant history after Islam, has always suffered from a [[dichotomy]] in its loyalties between what is essentially a desire for heritage and one that is a desire for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Iran: Politics of Resistance|author=Shabnam Holliday|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2013|pages=78–80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ebTVxwXYBaYC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=iraniyat+vs.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=86k6U-zpHKjMsQTE-oHYBw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iraniyat%20vs.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political systems in Iran seem not to be immune to this dichotomy as well. The SNH and indeed the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] seem to embrace the Iranian identity&lt;ref name=a/&gt; but ignore the Islamic identity of Iran, whilst the current regime in Iran, headed by Muslim clerics, seems to ignore or downplay Iranian identity in favor of an Islamic identity.

A '''teaching hospital''' is a [[hospital]] or medical center that provides [[medical education]] and training to future and current [[health professional]]s. Teaching hospitals are often affiliated with medical schools and work closely with medical students throughout their period of matriculation, and especially during their clerkship (internship) years.  In most cases, teaching hospitals also offer Graduate Medical Education (GME)/ physician residency programs, where medical school graduates train under a supervising (attending) physician to assist with the coordination of care. 

In addition to offering medical education to medical students and physician residents, many teaching hospitals also serve as research institutes.

==History==
Although institutions for caring for the sick are known to have existed much earlier in history, the first teaching hospital, where students were authorized to methodically practice on patients under the supervision of physicians as part of their education, was reportedly the [[Academy of Gundishapur]] in the [[Persian Empire]] during the [[Sassanid]] era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne|E. Browne]], ''Islamic Medicine'', 2002, p.16, {{ISBN|81-87570-19-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==

Many [[United States|American]] television shows, usually [[medical drama]]s, take place in teaching hospitals. Some examples are:

*''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' that takes place in the [[fictional]] St. Eligius Hospital (located in the [[South End, Boston|South End]] neighborhood of [[Boston]])
*''[[Chicago Hope]]'' that takes place in the fictional Chicago Hope Hospital (located in [[Chicago]])
*''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' that takes place in the fictional County General Hospital (located in Chicago)
*''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' that takes place in the fictional Sacred Heart Hospital (located in the state of [[California]])
*''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' that takes place in the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital (located in the state of [[New Jersey]])
*''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' that takes place in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital (located in [[Seattle]])
*''[[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' where the second season is set in the fictional C+U+R+E Institute, owned by Cathy Munsch ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]), which was originally the Our Lady Of Perpetual Suffering Hospital until a massacre occurred there on Halloween night in 1986. The location of the C+U+R+E Institute is never mentioned.

Some Canadian shows take place in teaching hospitals as well. For example, ''[[Saving Hope (TV series)|Saving Hope]]'' takes place in the fictional Hope Zion Hospital (located in [[Toronto]]).

In the [[United Kingdom]], the 1980s television documentary series ''Jimmy's'' was set in [[St James's University Hospital, Leeds]] (nicknamed Jimmy's), which formerly claimed to be the largest teaching hospital in [[Europe]].

Paris has many renowned teaching hospitals: [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Pitié-Salpêtrière]], [[Hôpital Cochin|Cochin]], [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital|Necker]] or [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu]]. They appear in many films and TV shows. An ''ER'' episode, for example, is set in [[Hôpital Saint-Antoine]] (AP-HP). Many patients are surprised to see medical students at their bedside: they know they are in top hospitals without knowing those hospitals are teaching hospitals.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

A scene in the 1992 film, [[Lorenzo's Oil]], Lorenzo is shown at the [[Boston Children's Hospital]]

'''''The Great Illusion''''' is a book by [[Norman Angell]], first published in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the title ''Europe's Optical Illusion''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Angell |first=Norman |title=Europe's Optical Illusion|edition=1|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co.|publication-date=1909|publication-place=London|page=|url=https://archive.org/stream/europesopticalil00angeuoft#page/n7/mode/2up |accessdate=15 June 2016|via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and republished in 1910 and subsequently in various enlarged and revised editions under the title ''The Great Illusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Angell |first=Norman |title=The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power in Nations to their Economic and Social Advantage|edition=3|publisher=G.P. Putnam's &amp; Sons|publication-date=1911|publication-place=New York and London|page=|url=https://archive.org/details/greatillusion00angeiala|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

In ''The Great Illusion'', Angell's primary thesis was, in the words of historian [[James Joll]], that "the economic cost of war was so great that no one could possibly hope to gain by starting a war the consequences of which would be so disastrous."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Joll|Joll, James]] (1992) ''The Origins of the First World War''. London and New York: Longman. p.202 {{ISBN|0-582-08920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, a general European war was very unlikely to start, and if it did, it would not last long.&lt;ref name=keegan&gt;[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]] (1999) ''The First World War'' New York: Knopf. p.10. {{ISBN|0-375-40052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that war was economically and socially irrational&lt;ref name=pity&gt;[[Niall Ferguson|Ferguson, Niall]] (1999) ''The Pity of War'' New York: Basic Books. pp.21-23 {{ISBN|0-465-05712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that war between industrial countries was futile because conquest did not pay. J. D. B. Miller writes: "The 'Great Illusion' was that nations gained by armed confrontation, militarism, war, or conquest."&lt;ref name=miller1985&gt;Miller (1995), p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Angell, the economic interdependence between industrial countries would be "the real guarantor of the good behavior of one state to another",&lt;ref name=pity /&gt; as it meant that war would be economically harmful to all the countries involved. Moreover, if a conquering power confiscated property in the territory it seized, "the incentive [of the local population] to produce would be sapped and the conquered area be rendered worthless. Thus, the conquering power had to leave property in the hands of the local population while incurring the costs of conquest and occupation."&lt;ref name=miller1985 /&gt;

Further, the nature of modern capitalism was such that nationalist sentiment did not motivate capitalists, because "the capitalist has no country, and he knows, if he be of the modern type, that arms and conquests and jugglery with frontiers serve no ends of his, and may very well defeat them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[James Joll|Joll, James]] (1992) ''The Origins of the First World War''. London and New York: Longman. p.161 {{ISBN|0-582-08920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angell said that arms build-up, for example the naval race between England and Germany that was happening as he wrote the book in the 1900s, was not going to secure peace. Instead, it would lead to increased insecurity and thus ratchet up the likelihood of war. The only viable route to peace would be respect for international law, implemented in a world court, in which issues would be dealt with rationally and peacefully.

==Critical reception==

''The Great Illusion'' was a best-selling popular success and was quickly translated into eleven languages, becoming something of a "cult", spawning study groups at British universities "devoted to propagating its dogma." The book was taken up by [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Viscount Esher]], a courtier who was charged with remodeling the British Army after the [[Boer War]].&lt;ref name=guns&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] (1962) ''[[The Guns of August]]'' New York: Macmillan. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Also enamored of the book was [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John Fisher]], the [[First Sea Lord]], who called it "heavenly manna".&lt;ref name=pity /&gt; Historian [[Niall Ferguson]] uses the receptiveness to the book of these paragons of the British military and naval establishments as evidence that it was not the pacifist work it superficially seemed to be, but instead a "Liberal imperialist tract directed at German opinion", with the aim of discouraging Germany from continuing its bid to become a great naval power, a program which had begun the fierce, and expensive, naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany.  The fact that Angell was employed as editor of the ''Continental Daily Mail'' by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]], a press baron whom Ferguson refers to as an "arch-scaremonger", is to Ferguson further evidence of a deeper, non-pacifist purpose to the book.&lt;ref name=pity /&gt;

It is sometimes said that the outbreak of [[World War I]] disproved Angell's argument in ''The Great Illusion,'' but Angell had not maintained that a war was impossible, rather that it would be futile. Although some aspects of Angell's argument have dated, his discussion of economic interdependence "was important and innovative."&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1986), p.106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar edition==
A new edition of ''The Great Illusion'' was published in 1933; it added "the theme of collective defence."&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1986) p.120 n.9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Angell was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1933.

==In popular culture  ==
*''The Great Illusion'' is mentioned in the 1929 novel ''[[Death of a Hero]]'' by [[Richard Aldington]]. It was used as evidence by the main character that the coming world war would not happen.

*One of the characters in the [[D. K. Broster]] story "The Window" (1929), set in pre-World War I France, mentions having read Angell's book, and uses it to argue that "it is impossible that there should be a great war nowadays".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Andrew J. (2014) ''France, Britain and the United States in the twentieth century, 1900-1940: a reappraisal''. London: Palgrave Macmillan. p.48.  {{ISBN|9780230282308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The book lent its name to [[Jean Renoir]]'s 1937 anti-war film ''[[La Grande Illusion]]''.

==History==
[[File:The Tech Museum of Innovation 01718.JPG|thumb|left|The Tech during the ''[[Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D|Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon]]'' exhibit, 2010.]]
Planning began in 1978 by members of the Junior League of Palo Alto and later assistance by the San Jose Junior League. The first {{convert|20000|sqft|adj=on}} temporary exhibit finally opened in 1990 "The Garage" as it was named, opened in San Jose's former convention center. On October 31, 1998, it opened a brand-new {{convert|132000|sqft|adj=on}} facility and has had 4,000,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The museum is composed of three floors, each with its own significance. The ground floor includes The Tech Store, The Tech Cafe, the IMAX® Dome Theater and a recreational area that is reserved for special events. The Tech's architecture is the work of Mexican architect [[Ricardo Legorreta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herhold|first=Scott|title=Herhold: Designer of two San Jose museums dies in Mexico|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19660901|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four major theme galleries fill the Upper Level and Lower Level of the museum: Communication, Exploration, Innovation and Life Tech. These galleries are constantly being revamped and changed to fit the theme movies and exhibits. On the Lower Level there is also a public piece of artwork titled ''Origin'', which is inside a {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin|url=http://www.sanjoseculture.org/public_art/collections/Tech%20Museum%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|publisher=City of San Jose|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311062627/http://www.sanjoseculture.org/public_art/collections/Tech%20Museum%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tech Museum of Innovation reflects its social context, capturing Silicon Valley's celebration of technology with a fascination with what the museum's literature refers to as the "gizmos and gadgets" produced by Valley companies. Early reviews, however, criticized The Tech for failing to provide a coherent direction or message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrin|first=Andrew|title=Making Silicon Valley : Culture, Representation, and Technology at the Tech Museum|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|issue=2|page=91|doi=10.1080/10714420212479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==

[[File:The Tech Museum of Innovation 3 2016-05-14.jpg|thumb|right|An atrium at The Tech.]]
The Tech has many exhibits dealing with energy efficiency, customization, exploration and genetics.

The Tech Museum of Innovation offers a new approach to viewing galleries from a wide variety of different media. The majority of these exhibits are interactive and allows the viewer to engage in the learning experience. The Tech also has joint partnerships with local attractions, ranging from jazz festivals to the Global Festival of Art.

The [[IMAX]] Dome Theater &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplan|first=Tracey|title=Michael L.

It is Northern California's only domed IMAX Theater and can seat up to 280 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imax.com/theatres/t/hackworth-imax-dome-the-tech-museum/|publisher=IMAX|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social robots===
The Tech has an interactive exhibit where people can design and build robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deinzer|first=Erin Caslavka|title=Places where you can interact with robots|url=http://www.sfgate.com/travel/fiveplaces/article/Places-where-you-can-interact-with-robots-5295740.php|publisher=SF Gate|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tech Studio===
The Tech created an open-to-the-public workshop space where the in-house prototypers build new exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Norman|title=Exhibit Design at The Tech Museum of Innovation|url=http://www.tested.com/art/makers/460508-exhibit-design-tech-museum-innovation/|publisher=Tested.com|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary exhibitions===
On special occasions The Tech will rent out Parkside Hall from the City of San José to host special larger exhibits. In 2007, this hall was the home to the exhibit known as Body Worlds 2, which brought in over 280,000 guests.  In winter of 2008, there was a special Leonardo da Vinci exhibit (called Leonardo: 500 Years into the Future) that displayed some of his inventions, findings and pictures.

===The Tech Virtual===
The Tech Virtual launched in December 2007. On June 4, 2008, the world's first museum exhibits developed using this open source method opened in the museum's own Virtual Test Zone gallery.
The seven exhibits, all contributed under a Creative Commons license and prototyped in the virtual world of Second Life, became part of the museum's Art, Film, Music and Games exhibition. The Virtual Test Zone gallery itself is a prototype exhibit area that will consistently feature virtual-to-real-world exhibits on specific themes resulting from The Tech Virtual programs.

'''Toxicofera''' (Greek for "those who bear [[toxin]]s") is a proposed [[clade]] of [[squamata|scaled reptiles]] (squamates) that includes the [[snake|Serpentes]] (snakes), [[Anguimorpha]] (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and [[Iguania]] (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4,600 species, (nearly 60%) of [[extant taxon|extant]] squamata.&lt;ref name="Fry2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04328 |pmid=16292255 |title=Early evolution of the venom system in lizards and snakes |journal=Nature |volume=439 |issue=7076 |pages=584–8 |year=2005 |last1=Fry |first1=Bryan G. |last2=Vidal |first2=Nicolas |last3=Norman |first3=Janette A. |last4=Vonk |first4=Freek J. |last5=Scheib |first5=Holger |last6=Ramjan |first6=S.

== Venom ==
{{Further|Evolution of snake venom}}
Venom in squamates has historically been considered a rarity; while it has been [[Asp (reptile)|known in Serpentes since ancient times]], the actual percentage of [[venomous snake|snake species considered venomous]] was relatively small (around 25%).&lt;ref name="Fry2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jprot.2009.01.009 |pmid=19457354 |title=Evolution and diversification of the Toxicofera reptile venom system |journal=Journal of Proteomics |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=127–36 |year=2009 |last1=Fry |first1=Bryan G. |last2=Vidal |first2=Nicolas |last3=Van Der Weerd |first3=Louise |last4=Kochva |first4=Elazar |last5=Renjifo |first5=Camila }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the approximately 2,650 species of advanced snakes (Caenophidia), only the front-fanged species (~650) were considered venomous by the anthropocentric definition.
Following the classification of Helodermatidae in the 19th century, their venom was thought to have developed independently.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt; In snakes, the venom gland is in the upper jaw, but in helodermatids, it is found in the lower jaw.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt; The origin of venom in squamates was thus considered relatively recent in [[evolution]]ary terms and the result of [[convergent evolution]] among the seemingly-[[polyphyletic]] venomous snake [[Family (biology)|families]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 2003  a study was published that described venom in snake subfamilies previously thought to lack it.&lt;ref name="Fry2003"&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00239-003-2461-2 |pmid=12962311 |title=Molecular Evolution and Phylogeny of Elapid Snake Venom Three-Finger Toxins |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=110–29 |year=2003 |last1=Fry |first1=B.

P. |bibcode=2003JMolE..57..110F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further study claimed nearly all "non-venomous" snakes produce venom to a certain extent, suggesting a single, and thus far more ancient origin for venom in Serpentes than had been considered until then.&lt;ref name="Fry2003-ratsnake"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00239-003-2497-3 |pmid=14708577 |title=Isolation of a Neurotoxin (α-colubritoxin) from a Nonvenomous Colubrid: Evidence for Early Origin of Venom in Snakes |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=446–52 |year=2003 |last1=Fry |first1=Bryan G. |last2=Lumsden |first2=Natalie G. |last3=Wüster |first3=Wolfgang |last4=Wickramaratna |first4=Janith C. |last5=Hodgson |first5=Wayne C. |last6=Manjunatha Kini |first6=R. |bibcode=2003JMolE..57..446F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fry2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh091 |pmid=15014162 |title=Assembling an Arsenal: Origin and Evolution of the Snake Venom Proteome Inferred from Phylogenetic Analysis of Toxin Sequences |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=870–83 |year=2004 |last1=Fry |first1=B. G. |last2=Wüster |first2=W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a practical matter, Fry cautioned:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031216075937.htm Venom Hunt Finds 'Harmless' Snakes A Potential Danger] December 16, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Some non-venomous snakes have been previously thought to have only mild 'toxic [[saliva]]'. But these results suggest that they actually possess true venoms. We even isolated from a [[rat snake]]'' [''Coelognathus radiatus'' (formerly known as ''[[Elaphe radiata]]'')&lt;ref name="Fry2003-ratsnake" /&gt;]'', a snake common in pet stores, a typical [[cobra]]-style [[neurotoxin]], one that is as potent as comparative toxins found in close relatives of the cobra. These snakes typically have smaller quantities of venom and lack fangs, but they can still deliver their venom via their numerous sharp teeth. But not all of these snakes are dangerous. It does mean, however, that we need to re-evaluate the relative danger of non-venomous snakes.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This prompted further research, which led to the discovery of venom (and venom [[genes]]) in species from groups which were not previously known to produce it, e.g. in Iguania (specifically ''[[Pogona barbata]]'' from the family [[Agamidae]]) and Varanidae (from ''[[Varanus varius]]'').&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  It is thought that this was the result of descent from a common venom-producing squamate ancestor; the hypothesis was described simply as the "venom clade" when first proposed to the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  The venom clade included Anguidae for [[phylogenetic]] reasons and adopted a previously suggested clade name: Toxicofera.&lt;ref name="Vidal2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2005.10.001 |pmid=16286089 |title=The phylogeny of squamate reptiles (lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians) inferred from nine nuclear protein-coding genes |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |volume=328 |issue=10–11 |pages=1000–8 |year=2005 |last1=Vidal |first1=Nicolas |last2=Hedges |first2=S. Blair }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that the common ancestral species that first developed venom in the venom clade lived on the order of 200 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  The venoms are thought to have evolved after genes normally active in various parts of the body [[Gene duplication|duplicated]] and the copies found new use in the [[salivary glands]].&lt;ref name="Fry2003" /&gt;

Among snake families traditionally classified as venomous, the capacity seems to have evolved to extremes more than once by [[parallel evolution]]; 'non-venomous' snake lineages have either lost the ability to produce venom (but may still have lingering venom [[pseudogene]]s) or actually do produce venom in small quantities (e.g. 'toxic saliva'), likely sufficient to assist in small prey capture, but not normally causing harm to humans if bitten.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The newly discovered diversity of squamate species producing venoms is a [[Treasure trove#Terminology|treasure trove]] for those seeking to develop new [[pharmaceutical]] drugs; many of these venoms lower [[blood pressure]], for example.&lt;ref name="Fry2006" /&gt;  Previously known venomous squamates have already provided the basis for [[medication]]s such as [[Ancrod]], [[Captopril]], [[Eptifibatide]], [[Exenatide]] and [[Tirofiban]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The world's largest venomous lizard and the largest species of venomous land animal is the [[Komodo dragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=9781908843159|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Other scientists such as [[Washington State University]] biologist Kenneth V. Kardong and toxicologists Scott A. Weinstein and Tamara L. Smith, have stated that the allegation of venom glands found in many of these animals "has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution". According to these scientists "reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey". These researchers concluded that, "Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems".&lt;ref name="Mackessy2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinstein|first1=Scott A.|last2=Smith|first2=Tamara L.|last3=Kardong|first3=Kenneth V.|editor=Stephen P.

[[File:Anarcho-Transhumanism.svg|thumb|Flag of [[anarcho-transhumanism|anarcho-transhumanism]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}]]'''Transhumanist politics''' constitutes a group of [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]] that generally express the belief in improving human individuals through science and technology.
== History ==
The term "transhumanism" with its present meaning was popularised by [[Julian Huxley]]'s 1957 essay of that name.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1957"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Huxley, Julian| title = Transhumanism| year = 1957| url = http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley/| accessdate = February 24, 2006| authorlink = Julian Huxley| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160625132722/http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley| archivedate = June 25, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natasha Vita-More]] was elected as a Councilperson for the 28th Senatorial District of Los Angeles in 1992. She ran with the Green Party, but on a personal platform of "transhumanism". She quit after a year, saying her party was "too neurotically geared toward environmentalism".&lt;ref name=rothman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/10/08/transhumanism-gets-political/|title=Transhumanism Gets Political|last=Rothman|first=Peter|date=8 October 2014|accessdate=7 July 2015|publisher=hplusmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=James|title=The Politics of Transhumanism|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm#_ftn2|website=changesurfer.com|accessdate=18 August 2016|quote=Ironically, Natasha Vita-More was actually elected to Los Angeles public office on the Green Party ticket in 1992. However her platform was “transhumanism” and she quit after one year of her two year term because the Greens were “too far left and too neurotically geared toward environmentalism.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] identifies the "neoliberal" [[Extropy Institute]], founded by philosopher [[Max More]] and developed in the 1990s, as the first organized advocates for transhumanism.

== Core values ==
According to a 2006 study by the [[European Parliament]], transhumanism is the political expression of the ideology that technology should be used to enhance human abilities.&lt;ref name="European Parliament 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[European Parliament]]|title=Technology Assessment on Converging Technologies|year=2006|at=ii|quote="On the one side are the true believers in the potential of technology to make individuals ever more perfect.

According to Amon Twyman of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] (IEET), political philosophies which support transhumanism include social futurism, [[techno-progressivism]], [[techno-libertarianism]], and anarcho-transhumanism.&lt;ref name=amon&gt;{{cite web|last=Twyman|first=Amon|title=Transhumanism and Politics|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/twyman20141007|website=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]|date=7 October 2014|quote=I would suggest that the way forward is to view transhumanism as a kind of political vector, axis, or hub rather than a single party or philosophy.

While raising objections both to [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Techno-progressivism#Contrasting stance|bioconservatism]], and [[libertarian transhumanism]], Hughes aims to encourage democratic transhumanists and their potential [[progressivism|progressive]] allies to unite as a [[new social movement]] and influence [[biopolitical]] [[public policy]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Self-identified libertarian transhumanists, such as [[Ronald Bailey]] of [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'' magazine]] and [[Glenn Reynolds]] of [[Instapundit]], are advocates of the asserted "right to [[human enhancement]]" who argue that the [[free market]] is the best guarantor of this right, claiming that it produces greater prosperity and personal freedom than other economic systems.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 LB"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bailey, Ronald|title=Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case For the Biotech Revolution|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2005|isbn=1-59102-227-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reynolds, Glenn |title=[[An Army of Davids]]: How Markets and Technology Empower Ordinary People to Beat Big Media, Big Government, and Other Goliaths|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2006|isbn=1-59555-054-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles ===
Libertarian transhumanists believe that the principle of [[self-ownership]] is the most fundamental idea from which both libertarianism and transhumanism stem. They are [[Rational egoism|rational egoists]] and [[Ethical egoism|ethical egoists]] who embrace the prospect of using [[emerging technologies]] to enhance human capacities, which they believe stems from the self-interested application of [[reason]] and [[will (philosophy)|will]] in the context of the individual [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] to achieve a [[posthuman]] state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. They extend this rational and ethical egoism to advocate a form of "[[biolibertarianism]]".&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 LB"/&gt;

As strong [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]], libertarian transhumanists hold that any attempt to limit or suppress the asserted right to human enhancement is a violation of [[civil rights]] and [[civil liberties]]. However, as strong [[Economic liberalism|economic libertarian]]s, they also reject proposed [[public policy|public policies]] of [[regulation of science|government-regulated]] and -[[universal health care|insured]] [[human enhancement technologies]], which are advocated by [[Democratic transhumanism|democratic transhumanists]], because they fear that any [[Interventionism (politics)|state intervention]] will steer or limit their choices.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 THE"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Bailey, Ronald | title = Trans-Human Expressway: Why libertarians will win the future | year = 2005 | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/34971.html | accessdate=2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Dale Carrico|Carrico, Dale]] | title = Bailey on the CybDemite Menace | year = 2005 | url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/05/bailey-on-cybdemite-menace.html | accessdate = 2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey 2009"/&gt;

[[Extropianism]], the earliest [[Transhumanism#Currents|current of transhumanist thought]] defined in 1988 by philosopher [[Max More]], initially included an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] interpretation of the concept of  "[[spontaneous order]]" in its principles, which states that a free market economy achieves a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any [[Planned economy|planned]] or [[mixed economy]] could achieve. In 2000, while revising the principles of Extropy, More seemed to be abandoning libertarianism in favor of [[Social liberalism|modern liberalism]] and [[anticipatory democracy]]. However, many Extropians remained libertarian transhumanists.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
Critiques of the [[techno-utopianism]] of libertarian transhumanists from progressive [[cultural critic]]s include [[Richard Barbrook]] and Andy Cameron's 1995 essay ''The Californian Ideology''; [[Mark Dery]]'s 1996 book ''Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century''; and [[Paulina Borsook]]'s 2000 book ''Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech''.

Barbrook argues that libertarian transhumanists are proponents of the [[Californian Ideology]] who embrace the goal of [[reactionary modernism]]: [[economic growth]] without [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbrook, Richard |author2=Cameron, Andy | title = The Californian Ideology |  year = 2000 |  url = http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-californianideology.html | accessdate = 2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Barbrook, libertarian transhumanists are unwittingly appropriating the theoretical legacy of [[Stalinism|Stalinist communism]] by substituting, among other concepts, the "[[vanguard party]]" with the "[[digerati]]", and the "[[new Soviet man]]" with the "[[posthuman]]".&lt;ref name="Barbrook"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Barbrook, Richard | title = Cyber-Communism: How the Americans Are Superseding Capitalism in Cyberspace | year = 2007 | url = http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/cyber-communism-how-the-americans-are-superseding-capitalism-in-cyberspace/ | accessdate = 2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dery coined the dismissive phrase "body-loathing" to describe the attitude of libertarian transhumanists and those in the [[cyberculture]] who want to escape from their "[[Human body|meat puppet]]" through [[mind uploading]] into [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref name="Dery 1996"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Mark Dery|Dery, Mark]] | title = Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century | publisher = Grove Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-8021-3520-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borsook asserts that libertarian transhumanists indulge in a [[subculture]] of [[selfishness]], [[elitism]], and [[escapism]].&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"&gt;{{cite book| author = Borsook, Paulina | title = Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech |publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | year = 2000 | url = https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/11/cyberselfish-redux | isbn = 1-891620-78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] is the most militant critic of libertarian transhumanism. While articulating "democratic transhumanism" as a sociopolitical program in his 2004 book ''[[Citizen Cyborg]]'',&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; Hughes sought to convince libertarian transhumanists to embrace [[social democracy]] by arguing that:
# [[State (polity)|State]] action is required to address [[existential risk|catastrophic threats]] from transhumanist technologies;
# Only believable and effective [[public policy|public policies]] to prevent adverse consequences from new technologies will reassure skittish publics that they do not have to be [[ban (law)|banned]];
# [[Social policy|Social policies]] must explicitly address public concerns that transhumanist biotechnologies will exacerbate [[social inequality]];
# [[Monopoly|Monopolistic]] practices and overly restrictive [[intellectual property]] law can seriously delay the development of transhumanist technologies, and restrict their access;
# Only a strong [[liberal democratic]] state can ensure that posthumans are not [[persecution|persecuted]]; and
# Libertarian transhumanists (who are [[antinaturalism (politics)|anti-naturalists]]) are inconsistent in arguing for the free market [[appeal to nature|on the grounds that it is a natural phenomenon]].

Klaus-Gerd Giesen, a German political scientist specializing in the [[philosophy of technology]], wrote a critique of the libertarianism he imputes to all transhumanists. While pointing out that the works of [[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] figure in practically all of the recommended reading lists of [[Extropians]], he argues that transhumanists, convinced of the sole virtues of the free market, advocate an unabashed [[social Darwinism|inegalitarianism]] and merciless [[meritocracy]] which can be reduced in reality to a biological [[fetishism|fetish]]. He is especially critical of their promotion of a science-fictional [[liberal eugenics]], virulently opposed to any political regulation of [[human genetics]], where the [[consumerism|consumerist]] model presides over their ideology. Giesen concludes that the despair of finding social and political solutions to today's sociopolitical problems incites transhumanists to [[genetic determinism|reduce everything to the hereditary gene]], as a fantasy of [[omnipotence]] to be found within the individual, even if it means transforming the subject ([[human]]) to a new draft (posthuman).&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giesen, Klaus-Gerd | title = Transhumanisme et génétique humaine | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ircm.qc.ca/bioethique/obsgenetique/cadrages/cadr2004/c_no16_04/c_no16_04_01.html | accessdate = 2006-04-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310224959/http://www.ircm.qc.ca/bioethique/obsgenetique/cadrages/cadr2004/c_no16_04/c_no16_04_01.html | archivedate = 2007-03-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It provides for several diverse matters relating to the law, some of them being significant changes to the structure of the courts and fundamental legal procedures. Part 1 provides a scheme for radical overhaul of the [[tribunal]] system in the UK, creating a new unified structure with two new tribunals to embrace the former fragmented scheme, along with  a '''Senior President of Tribunals'''. Part 2 defines new criteria for appointment as a [[judge]], generally reducing the length of experience required with the aim of increasing [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] in the [[judiciary]]. Part 3 creates a new system of '''taking control of goods''' in order to enforce [[Legal judgment|judgment]]s and abolishes ancient [[common law]] [[writ]]s and [[remedy (law)|remedies]] such as ''[[fieri facias]]'', ''[[replevin]]'' and [[distraint|distress for rent]]. It introduces a modern system of 'certified enforcement agents' and 'exempted enforcement agents' which includes civil servants such as court officers and County Court Bailiffs, civilian enforcement officers and police officers. Part 4 makes some changes to [[attachment of earnings]] and [[charging order]]s to make recovery of debts more straightforward. Part 5 makes some changes to [[insolvency]] practice in order to provide low-cost protection for people who have previously been [[social exclusion|excluded]] owing to their small debts and lack of assets. Part 6 provides protection from seizure for foreign [[antiquities]] and artefacts on display in the UK and whose [[provenance]] is alleged to be broken by misappropriation. Such artefacts can only be seized on a [[court order]] that was compelled by a [[Community obligation]] or a [[treaty]] obligation.

==Tribunals and inquiries==
{{main|Tribunals in the United Kingdom}}
These provisions started to come into force on 19 September 2007. Though {{As of|2008|07|lc=on}}, no dates have been set for completing the process, the first tribunals under the new system are planned to sit from 3 November 2008.&lt;ref name="commence1"&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No.1) Order 2007, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20072709_en_1 SI 2007/2709]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commence2"&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No.2) Order 2007, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20073613_en_1 SI 2007/3613]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commence3"&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No.3) Order 2008, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080749_en_1 SI 2008/749]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commence4"&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No.4) Order 2008, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20081158_en_1 SI 2008/1158]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commence5"&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No. 5 and Transitional Provisions) Order 2008, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20081653_en_1 SI 2008/1653]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="countdown"&gt;{{ cite web | title=Countdown to two-tier tribunal system launched | date=2008-05-19 | accessdate=2008-07-13 | publisher=Ministry of Justice | url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease190508b.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121052604/http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease190508b.htm | archive-date=2008-11-21 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
In the UK, [[tribunal]]s have been created on an ''ad hoc'' basis to perform various [[justice|judicial]] functions, for example [[Employment Tribunal]]s and [[Asylum and Immigration Tribunal]]s.&lt;ref name="explan"&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate=2008-03-05 | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/15/notes/contents | title=Explanatory Notes to Tribunals, Courts And Enforcement Act 2007 | year=2007 | publisher=Office of Public Service Information | quote=paras.1-34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunals' members were a mixture of [[judge]]s, [[lawyer]]s, [[expert]]s and [[layman|laypeople]], and were regulated by various government departments and bodies. Though these tribunals were supervised by, and had rights of [[appeal]] within, the [[Courts of the United Kingdom]], reform was recommended to create a unified and simplified structure, better integrated into the courts system.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=Leggatt, A. | url=http://www.tribunals-review.org.uk/leggatthtm/leg-00.htm | publisher=Department for Constitutional Affairs | year=2001 | title=Tribunals for Users - One System, One Service | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Transforming Public Services: Complaints, Redress and Tribunals | url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/pubs/adminjust/transformfull.pdf | author=Department of Constitutional Affairs | year=2004 | accessdate=2008-03-05 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New tribunal structure===
Section 1 of the Act recognises legally qualified members of tribunals as members of the [[judiciary of the United Kingdom]] who are guaranteed continued [[judicial independence]] (s. 1).&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], s.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 of the Act creates two new tribunals to which existing [[jurisdiction]]s will be transferred, a [[First-tier Tribunal]] and an [[Upper Tribunal]]. The tribunals are divided into several '''chambers''', each to bring together a single subject matter, for example [[employment]]. Some tribunals will still lie outside the new system. All legally-qualified members will take the title of judge. There will be a right of appeal on a [[question of law]] from the First-tier to the Upper Tribunal and some limited jurisdiction for [[judicial review]]. The Upper Tribunal will be a senior [[court of record]]. There is a right of appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], [[Courts of Northern Ireland#Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland]] or [[Court of Session]] (Scotland) (s. 13).&lt;ref name="explan1"&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate=2008-03-05 | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/15/notes/contents | title=Explanatory Notes to Tribunals, Courts And Enforcement Act 2007 | year=2007 | publisher=Office of Public Service Information | quote=paras.35-280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chambers within the First-tier Tribunal are planned to start sitting on 3 November 2008.&lt;ref name="countdown"/&gt;

The Act replaces the [[Council on Tribunals]] with an [[Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council]] and creates the office of [[Senior President of Tribunals]], to be appointed by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom|Queen]] on the recommendation of the [[Lord Chancellor]]. (s.2/ Sch.1).&lt;ref name="explan1"/&gt;

'''Chambers''' will be created flexibly by the Lord Chancellor in consultation with the '''Senior President of Tribunals'''  and each will have its own '''Chamber President''' (s. 7/ Sch. 4).&lt;ref name="explan1"/&gt;

Tribunal judgments will carry a right to a [[warrant of execution]] or entry on the [[Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines]] and will no longer require to be registered in the [[County Court]] or [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] (s. 27).&lt;ref name="explan1"/&gt;

==Judicial appointments==
These provisions started to come into force on 19 September 2007 and implementation was completed on 21 July 2008.&lt;ref name="commence1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence5"/&gt;

===Background===
In 2004, the [[Department of Constitutional Affairs]] consulted on means of increasing [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the [[judiciary]] in the UK. They concluded that the [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]] required to serve as a [[judge]] were a barrier to a broader judiciary and recommended that they be varied, in particular by shortening the period of legal practice demanded before seeking office. However, the consultation recognised the anomaly that a [[barrister]] or [[solicitor]] could seek office after a certain period of qualification, even had they never practised.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/judiciary/diversitycp25-04.htm | publisher=Department for Constitutional Affairs | title=Increasing Diversity in the Judiciary |date=October 2004 | quote=CP 25/04 | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="explan2"&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate=2008-03-05 | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/15/notes/contents | title=Explanatory Notes to Tribunals, Courts And Enforcement Act 2007 | year=2007 | publisher=Office of Public Service Information | quote=paras.281-316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The judicial-appointment eligibility condition===
The Act creates a '''judicial-appointment eligibility condition''' that a person (s.50(2)-(3)):&lt;ref name="explan2"/&gt;
*Holds a '''relevant qualification'''; and
*Has gained '''experience in law''' for a specified period while holding a '''relevant qualification'''

'''Relevant qualification''' is as a barrister or solicitor (s. 50) though the Lord Chancellor can extend this to members of the [[Institute of Legal Executives]] or other bodies (s. 51). The specified periods for which a '''relevant qualification''' must be held are generally reduced to five or seven years from the previous respective seven or ten (Sch. 10). In particular, qualification for appointment as a [[Judiciary of England and Wales#District Judges|District Judge]] requires five years' experience and, as a [[Circuit judge (UK)|Circuit Judge]], seven years.&lt;ref name="explan2"/&gt;

'''Experience in law''' can be (s. 52):
*Judicial functions of any court or tribunal;
*Acting as an [[arbitrator]];
*Practice or employment as a [[lawyer]];
*Advising on the application of the law;
*Assisting persons involved in proceedings for the resolution of issues arising under the law;
*Acting as a [[mediation|mediator]];
*Drafting documents intended to affect persons' rights or obligations;
*Teaching or researching law;
*Other activities of a broadly similar nature.

Sections 53-59 make various changes to the rules for appointing judges while section 60 requires that the chairman of the [[Law Commission]] is a judge of the [[High Court of England and Wales]] or the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="explan2"/&gt;

==Enforcement by taking control of goods==
{{As of|2008|04}} no dates have been set for the coming into force of these provisions.&lt;ref name="commence1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence5"/&gt;

===Background===
The previous system of [[warrant of execution|warrants of execution]] and [[writ]]s of ''[[fieri facias]]'' was increasingly considered as cumbersome, confusing and old-fashioned. Further, general concern about unlawful, violent and threatening behaviour by [[bailiff]]s led to a Department for Constitutional Affairs [[White Paper]] proposing modernisation and regulation.&lt;ref name="ee"&gt;{{ cite web | title=Effective Enforcement: Improved methods of recovery for civil court debt and commercial rent and a single regulatory regime for warrant enforcement agents | publisher=Lord Chancellor's Department |date=March 2003 | quote=Cm 5744 | accessdate=2008-03-05 | url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/enforcement/wp/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="explan3"&gt;{{ cite web|accessdate=2008-03-05 |url=http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/en/07en15-e.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121223200109/http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/en/07en15-e.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-23 |title=Explanatory Notes to Tribunals, Courts And Enforcement Act 2007 |year=2007 |publisher=Office of Public Service Information |quote=paras. 317-405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distress for rent===
Section 71 abolishes the ancient [[common law]] [[self-help (law)|self-help]] remedy of [[distraint|distress for rent]], replacing it, solely for [[lease]]s on [[commercial property]], by a statutory system of [[Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery]] (CRAR) (ss. 72-87/ Sch. 14).&lt;ref name="explan3"/&gt;

===Enforcing judgments against goods===
Writs of ''fieri facias'' are renamed '''writs of control'''. Warrants of execution and [[warrant of distress|warrants of distress]] are renamed '''warrants of control'''. Writs of ''[[fieri facias de bonis ecclesiasticis]]'' are unaffected. (s. 62).

Section 65 abolishes the common law rules concerning:
*Distinctions between an illegal, an irregular and an excessive exercise of a power;
*Remedies available to the [[debtor]];
*''[[Replevin]]''; and
*[[Rescuing goods]].

Schedules 12 and 13 create a new process of [[taking control of goods]].&lt;ref name="explan3"/&gt;

===Enforcement agents===
The Act replaces the ancient office of bailiff with that of '''enforcement agent'''(County Court Bailiffs are still referred to as such). Section 63 of the Act restricts the role of enforcement agent to an individual who:&lt;ref name="explan3"/&gt;
*Acts under a '''certificate''' under the Act. Certificates can be issued by various judges and the Lord Chancellor has the power to make regulations for the granting of certificates (s. 64).
*Is exempt because he acts in the course of his duty as:
**A [[constable]];
**An officer of [[HM Revenue and Customs]];
**A person appointed under section 2(1) of the [[Courts Act 2003]] (court officers and staff);
*Acts in the presence or under the direction of one of the above;
*Is exempt because he acts in the course of his duty as an officer of a government department.

Otherwise, a person who [[knowledge (English law)|knowingly]] or [[recklessness (English law)|recklessly]] purports to act as an enforcement agent is guilty of a [[summary offence]] and, on conviction, can be [[fine (penalty)|fine]]d up to level 5 on the [[standard scale]] (s. 63(6) -(7)).&lt;ref name="explan3"/&gt;

==Enforcement of judgments and orders==
{{As of|2008|04}}, no date is fixed for the coming into force of these provisions.&lt;ref name="commence1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence5"/&gt;

===Background===
Various problems were perceived to persist with the availability, quality and reliability of financial information from debtors. [[Attachment of earnings]] orders required the debtor to certify their own [[income]] and this was frequently misstated. [[Charging order]]s could not be made unless the debtor was in arrears with payments against the debt. This situation was perceived as offering opportunities for the debtor to dispose of valuable property while making modest instalments in the short term.

===Attachment of earnings orders===
Section 91 and Schedule 15 amend the [[Attachment of Earnings Act 1971]] to allow deductions to be made on the basis of a fixed rate, similar to the scheme already used for [[Council Tax]] arrears. Section 92 amends the 1971 Act to give the court the power to seek information on the details of a debtor's current employer from HM Revenue and Customs.&lt;ref name="explan4"/&gt;

===Charging orders===
Section 93 amends the [[Charging Orders Act 1979]] to enable charging orders to be made even though the debtor is not in arrears of an order for payment of the debt by instalments. However, sale can only be ordered if instalments are missed. Section 94 gives the Lord Chancellor the power to make regulations setting minimum limits on the value of debts where these provisions can be used to prevent their being invoked unfairly or vexatiously.&lt;ref name="explan4"/&gt;

===Information requests and orders===
Sections 95 to 105 establish a system of [[Application for information|applications for information]] whereby a creditor can apply to the court for an '''information order''' to obtain information about the debtor's means from the [[Department for Work and Pensions]], HM Revenue and Customs, and third parties such as [[bank]]s and [[credit reference agency|credit reference agencies]].&lt;ref name="explan4"/&gt;

==Debt management and relief==
{{As of|2008|04}}, no date is fixed for the coming into force of these provisions.&lt;ref name="commence1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commence5"/&gt;

===Background===
Consultation by the Department for Constitutional Affairs suggested that some people, especially those with small debts and few [[asset]]s, were excluded from the existing schemes for [[insolvency]] protection. In particular, the schemes of [[Administration Order]]s (AOs) and [[Enforcement Restriction Order]]s (EROs) were seen to be deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | publisher=Department for Constitutional Affairs | title=A Choice of Paths: better options to manage over-indebtedness and multiple debt |date=July 2004 | quote=Consultation Number CP23/04 | accessdate=2008-03-05 | url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/debt/debt.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="explan5"&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate=2008-03-05 | url=http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/en/07en15-h.htm.htm | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121223160353/http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/en/07en15-h.htm.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-12-23 | title=Explanatory Notes to Tribunals, Courts And Enforcement Act 2007 | year=2007 | publisher=Office of Public Service Information | quote=paras. 445-612 }}  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Relief for the Indebted - An Alternative to Bankruptcy | date=March 2005 | accessdate=2008-03-05 | url=http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/con_doc_register/consultationpaperwithnewannex1.pdf | publisher=The Insolvency Service | format=PDF | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419144009/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/con_doc_register/consultationpaperwithnewannex1.pdf | archive-date=2009-04-19 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AOs, EROs and DROs===
The act makes changes to the schemes for AOs and EROs so that they are available to a broader class of people in financial difficulties (ss. 106-107/ Sch. 16).&lt;ref name="explan5"/&gt; Section 108 and Schedules 17 to 20 amend the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] to create a new instrument of '''[[Debt Relief Order]]''' (DRO). DROs are a low-cost scheme offered under narrow criteria for those currently excluded by the insolvency system. They will be administered by [[official receiver]]s outside the courts' jurisdiction and will offer protection from creditors for a year. In 2007, it was estimated that there were 70,000 private, unregulated and unenforceable debt management schemes in operation in the UK. Sections 109 to 133 and Schedule 21 provide for a statutory system of '''Debt Management Schemes''' to regulate such practises.&lt;ref name="explan5"/&gt;

==Protection of cultural artifacts==
These provisions came into effect in England on 31 December 2007,&lt;ref name="commence2"/&gt; in Scotland on 21 April 2008,&lt;ref name="commenceScot"&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement) (Scotland) Order 2008, [http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/ssi/ssi2008/ssi_20080150_en_1 SSI 2008/150]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Wales and Northern Ireland on 22 April 2008.&lt;ref name="commence4"/&gt;

===Background===
The possibility that [[antiquities]] and cultural artifacts, sometimes allegedly misappropriated by their current custodians, would be seized by [[court order]] while on display in the UK, led to an increasing reluctance of foreign states and private individuals to allow loans for exhibitions. The provisions of the [[State Immunity Act 1978]] were inadequate.&lt;ref name="explan6"&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate=2008-03-05 | url=http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/en/07en15-j.htm | title=Explanatory Notes to Tribunals, Courts And Enforcement Act 2007 | year=2007 | publisher=Office of Public Service Information | quote=paras.613-634 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such uncertainties caused [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] tensions over a proposed loan of art works from [[Russia]] for an exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;
{{ cite news | last=Hoyle | first=Ben | title=New row with Russia over 'threat' to art | work=[[The Times]] | date=20 December 2007 | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article3073083.ece | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there was speculation that there might be attempts to seize [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' which had been appropriated by the [[Bolshevik]] government from [[Sergei Shchukin]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | last=Stephens | first=Mark | title=The Russians are right to be nervous: Are the Government and the Royal Academy complicit in preventing the return of stolen goods? | work=[[The Times]] | date=29 January 2008 | url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article3248094.ece | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new provisions of this section of the Act came into force on 31 December&lt;ref name="commence2"/&gt; and the Russian government gave permission for the paintings to travel to the UK and for the exhibition to go ahead on 9 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
{{ cite news | last=Halpin | first=Tony | title=Race against time as Russia agrees to let art show go ahead | work=[[The Times]] | date=10 January 2008 |author2=Ben Hoyle  | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article3161933.ece | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection under the Act===
Section 135 defines the articles to be protected as those normally kept and owned outside the UK, lawfully [[import]]ed for display or exhibition at an approved [[museum]] or [[art museum|gallery]]. The protection lasts for a maximum of 12 months, unless the article is damaged while in the UK and is undergoing repair, and protection only lasts while the article is:&lt;ref name="explan6"/&gt;
*On public display in a temporary exhibition at a museum or gallery;
*Going to or returning from public display in a temporary exhibition at a museum or gallery;
*Undergoing related repair, conservation or restoration;
*Going to or returning from related repair, conservation or restoration;
*Leaving the UK.

Protected articles cannot be seized save under a court order made in the UK and which the court was required to make because of a [[Community obligation]] or [[treaty]] obligation, or a [[statute]] giving effect to a Community obligation or treaty (s. 136(1)). The Act does not provide immunity against [[prosecution]] for importing, [[export]]ing or otherwise dealing with the article (s. 136(2)).&lt;ref name="explan6"/&gt; These provisions of the Act bind [[the Crown]] (s. 138).&lt;ref name="explan6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]], s. 2(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tufts University''' is a private [[research university]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]]. A charter member of the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference|New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC)]], '''Tufts College''' was founded in 1852 by [[Christian universalism|Christian universalists]] who worked for years to open a [[nonsectarian]] institution of higher learning.&lt;ref&gt;Concise Encyclopedia of Tufts History [http://dl.tufts.edu/view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&amp;chapter=T00041 "Tufts University, 1852"] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120708113718/http://dl.tufts.edu/view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&amp;chapter=T00041 |date=July 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more than a century, Tufts was a small [[New England]] [[liberal arts]] college until its transformation into a larger research university in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, Sol.

==History==
{{Main|History of Tufts University}}

===19th century===
[[Image:Tufts1853.jpg|thumb|300px|Tufts College, c. 1854]]
In the 1840s, the [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist Church]] wanted to open a college in New England, and [[Charles Tufts]] donated 20 acres to the church in 1852 to help them achieve this goal. Charles Tufts had inherited the land, a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the Boston area, called [[Walnut Hill, Medford, Massachusetts|Walnut Hill]], and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land, he said "I will put a light on it". His 20-acre donation (then valued at $20,000) is still at the heart of Tufts' now-150 acre campus, straddling [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]]. It was also in 1852 that the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] chartered Tufts College, noting the college should promote "virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended". During his tenure, Ballou spent a year travelling and studying in the United Kingdom. The methods of instruction which he initiated were based on the tutorials that were conducted in the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Now more than 160 years old, Tufts is the third-oldest college in the Boston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |title=Massachusetts's Oldest Colleges – College Rankings – College Prowler |publisher=Colleges.niche.com |accessdate=August 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814054952/http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |archivedate=August 14, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been one of the biggest influences in the establishment of the College, [[Hosea Ballou II]] became the first president in 1853, and College Hall, the first building on campus, was completed the following year. That building now bears Ballou's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dl.tufts.edu//view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&amp;chapter=B00006 |title=Tufts Digital Library: tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001 |access-date=July 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629164157/http://dl.tufts.edu/view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&amp;chapter=B00006 |archive-date=June 29, 2010 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus opened in August 1854. President Ballou died in 1861 and was succeeded by [[Alonzo Ames Miner]]. Though not a college graduate, his presidency was marked by several advances. These include the establishment of preparatory schools for Tufts which include [[Goddard College|Goddard Seminary]], [[Westbrook College|Westbrook Seminary]], and [[Dean College|Dean Academy]]. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the college actively supported the Union cause. The mansion of Major George L. Stearns which stood on part of the campus was a station on the [[Underground Railroad]]. In addition to having the largest classes spring up, 63 graduates served in the Union army. The first course of a three-year program leading to a degree in civil engineering was established in 1865, the same year MIT was founded. By 1869, the [[Crane Theological School]] was organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Tufts College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miner's successor, [[Elmer Capen]] was the first president to be a Tufts alumnus. During his time, one of the earliest innovators was [[Amos Dolbear]]. In 1875, as chair of the physics department, he installed a working telephone which connected his lab in Ballou Hall to his home on Professors Row. Two years later [[Alexander Graham Bell]] would receive the patent. Dolbear's work in Tufts was later continued by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]].&lt;ref name=thennow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then&amp;now.pdf |title=Then &amp; Now | publisher=Tufts University |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous scholars include [[William Leslie Hooper]] who in addition to serving as acting president, designed the first slotted armature for dynamos. His student at the college, [[Frederick Stark Pearson]], would eventually become one of America's pioneers of the electrical power industry. He became responsible for the development of the electric power and electric street car systems which many cities in South America and Europe used. Another notable figure is [[Stephen M. Babcock]] who developed the first practical test to determine the amount of butterfat in milk. Since its development in the college, the Babcock Test has hardly been modified. Expansion of the chemistry and biology departments were largely led by scholars [[Arthur Michael]], who was one of the first organic chemists in the U.S., and [[John Sterling Kingsley]], who was one of the first scholars of comparative anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Tufts College (1952).

[[Image:Interior view of Barnum Museum with Jumbo.jpg|thumb|200px|Jumbo in the Barnum Museum of Natural History]]

[[P. T. Barnum]] was one of the earliest benefactors of Tufts College, and the Barnum Museum of Natural History (Barnum Hall) was constructed in 1884 with funds donated by him to house his collection of animal specimens and the stuffed hide of [[Jumbo]] the elephant, who would become the university's mascot. The building stood until April 14, 1975, when fire gutted Barnum Hall, destroying the entire collection.

On July 15, 1892, the Tufts Board of Trustees voted "that the College be opened to women in the undergraduate departments on the same terms and conditions as men". Metcalf Hall opened in 1893 and served as the dormitory for women. At the same meeting, the trustees voted to create a graduate school faculty and to offer the [[Ph.D.]] degree in biology and chemistry. In 1893 the Medical School opened and in 1899 the Boston Dental College was integrated into the [[Tufts University School of Dental Medicine|university]]. In 1890, the Department of Electrical Engineering was created, and in 1892–1893 the course of three-year program in civil engineering was extended to four years. With the advent of the four-year program the degrees granted were bachelor of civil or electrical engineering. Tufts College added the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1894 and 1898, respectively. In 1898, the trustees voted to formally establish an undergraduate College of Engineering.&lt;ref name="Russell, Miller E. 1966"/&gt;

The [[Jackson College for Women]] was established in 1910 as a coordinate college adjacent to the Tufts campus. In 1980 it was integrated with the College of Liberal Arts but is still recognized in the formal name of the undergraduate arts and sciences division, the "College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College". Undergraduate women in arts and sciences continued to receive their diplomas from Jackson College until 2002.

Tufts expanded in the 1933 with the opening of the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States. The Fletcher School began as a joint effort between Tufts and [[Harvard University]], funded by an endowment from longtime Tufts benefactor and alumnus Austin Barclay Fletcher. Tufts assumed full administration of the Fletcher School in 1935, and strong linkages between the two schools remain.

During [[World War II]], Tufts College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="tuftsv-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/opportunities/AcademicAwardsList.pdf |title=General Academic Awards |publisher=[[Medford, Massachusetts]]: Tufts University |last= |first= |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to travel restrictions imposed by World War II, the [[Boston Red Sox]] conducted [[spring training]] for the [[1943 Major League Baseball season|1943 Major League season]] at Tufts College.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=John|title=365 Oddball Days in Red Sox History|year=2009|publisher=Clerisy Press|location=United States|isbn=1578603447|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, continued expansion was reflected in the change of the school's name to Tufts University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tei/tufts:UA069.005.DO.00001/chapter/T00041 |work=Concise Encyclopedia of Tufts History|title=Tufts University, 1852|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university experienced some growth during the presidency of [[Jean Mayer]] (1976–1992).&lt;ref name="nyt_mayer"&gt;McFadden, Robert D. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/02/us/jean-mayer-72-nutritionist-who-led-tufts-dies.html Jean Mayer, 72, Nutritionist Who Led Tufts, Dies]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. January 2, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer established Tufts' veterinary, nutrition, and biomedical schools and acquired the Grafton and Talloires campuses, at the same time lifting the university out of its dire financial situation by increasing the size of the endowment by a factor of 15.&lt;ref name="nyt_mayer" /&gt;

The College of Engineering added graduate study to its curriculum beginning in 1961, with master's degrees available in four departments. It added Ph.D. programs in mechanical engineering in 1963, electrical engineering in 1964, engineering design in 1981, and civil engineering in 1985. In 1984 CEO and chairman of Analogic Corporation and NeuroLogica Corporation [[Bernard Marshall Gordon]] founded the Tufts Gordon Institute as the first educational institution created to foster entrepreneurship in the engineering fields. In 1991 the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] accredited the institute to confer the degree of Master of Science in Engineering Management and in 1992 the Gordon Institute became part of the College of Engineering. In 1999, the College of Engineering became the School of Engineering, when oversight of graduate engineering programs was transferred from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. As part of the same reorganization the Faculty of Arts and Science became the Faculty of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering (AS&amp;E).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/about-us/history | title=History – Tufts University Connection – Gordon Institute | publisher=Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Hines Interests]] and TUDC, a subsidiary of the university, planned to break ground on the [[South Station Tower]]. Tufts had acquired the air rights from [[South Station]] in 1990, with former President Jean Meyer envisioning a tower that would be the center of medical research.

Tufts' main campus is located on [[Walnut Hill, Medford, Massachusetts|Walnut Hill]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], about {{convert|5|mi}} from [[Boston]]. This campus houses all undergraduates in Arts &amp; Sciences and Engineering, the graduate programs at [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] and all of the graduate programs in Arts &amp; Sciences and Engineering. While the majority of the campus is in Medford, the Somerville line intersects it, placing parts of the lower campus in Somerville and leading to the common terms "Uphill" and "Downhill".

The "Uphill" portion of the campus comprises the academic and the residential "Rez" quads, and is enclosed by a wrought-iron fence. Classes that contributed to the building of the fence are commemorated along its length. The academic quad contains the earliest buildings and was primarily built from the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century. One of Tufts' first buildings, [[Ballou Hall]] was constructed from 1852–1854 and was designed in the Italianate style by the well known Boston architect [[Gridley James Fox Bryant]]. Ballou Hall was later restored by [[McKim, Mead, and White]] in 1955–56, and houses the offices of the president, the provost, and several vice presidents and deans. Other notable buildings include: [[Packard Hall]] (1856), [[East Hall (Tufts University)|East Hall]] (1860), West Hall (1871), [[Goddard Chapel (Tufts University)|Goddard Chapel]] (1882), [[Goddard Hall (Tufts University)|Goddard Hall]] (1883), [[Barnum Museum of Natural History|Barnum Hall]] (1884), and [[Eaton Hall (Tufts University)|Eaton Hall]] (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Tolles, Bryant Franklin. (November 2004) ''Architecture &amp; Academe: College Buildings in New England Before 1860''. University Press of New England, {{ISBN|978-1-58465-891-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York firm [[Whitfield &amp; King]] was responsible for the design of Eaton Hall.

The "Uphill" residential quad contains more modern buildings. The most notable building is Carmichael Hall (1954), designed by Arland A. Dirlam. Dirlam also designed Bendetson Hall (1947) on the academic quad.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, Anne. (November 2004) ''Tufts University''. Arcadia, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-0853-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thennow /&gt; Adjacent to both quads is the Cabot Intercultural Center designed by [[ARC/Architectural Resources Cambridge, Inc.]] one of the Fletcher School's buildings. Many points on the hill have noted views of the [[Boston]] skyline, particularly the patio on the Tisch Library roof. It has been ranked one of the prettiest college campuses in the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The "Downhill" portion can be accessed with the memorial stairs. Designed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] in the 1920s, the memorial stairs form one of the main entrances to the university and allows direct access to the engineering school from the academic quad. Notable buildings around the engineering school include Bromfield-Pearson Hall (1893), Robinson Hall (1899), and Curtis Hall (1894). Boston architect [[George Albert Clough]] is responsible for the design of Curtis Hall and Goddard Hall. Additionally Arland Dirlam is responsible for the designs of many buildings downhill. These include Cohen Auditorium (1950), Hodgdon Hall (1954), and Jackson Gymnasium (1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/FinalEIR/techRpt/6.pdf|title=Historic Resources|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative offices also occupy the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby [[Davis Square]], where Tufts makes [[payment in lieu of taxes|payments in lieu of taxes]] on some of its tax-exempt (educational) properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|title=ResiStat: Tufts' Contribution|accessdate=August 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222152654/http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|archivedate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talloires===
Tufts has a [[satellite campus]] in [[Talloires, France]] at the Tufts European Center, a former [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[priory]] built in the 11th century. The priory was purchased in 1958 by Donald MacJannet and his wife Charlotte and used as a summer camp site for several years before the MacJannets gave the campus to Tufts in 1978. Each year the center hosts a number of summer study programs, and enrolled students live with local families. The Tufts Summit Program is for American high school students during the month of July. Tufts in Talloires is a 6-week program for Tufts undergraduates that extends from the middle of May until the end of June. Additionally Tufts in Annecy is a 4-week program which provides French language learners a chance to practice and learn the language. The site is frequently the host of international conferences and summits, most notably the [[Talloires Declaration]] which united 22 universities toward a goal of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/europeanCenter/about/|title=Tufts University European Center in Talloires, France|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talloires campus has been ranked as one of the best branch campuses by the National Association of Branch Campus Administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/talloires-program-ranked-among-best-branch-campuses-1.2844605#.UuKxGxAo7IU |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232938/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/talloires-program-ranked-among-best-branch-campuses-1.2844605#.UuKxGxAo7IU |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |title=Talloires program ranked among best branch campuses |first=Abigail |last=Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tufts University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is ''The Trustees of Tufts College''. The university is governed by up to forty-one Trustees and no fewer than twenty-eight. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. In addition to the president the university appoints Charter Trustees (up to 30 members) who are elected by the board and Alumni Trustees (up to 10 members) who serve for up to five years. Generally Charter Trustees are elected by majority vote of the members. Alumni Trustees are elected by alumni. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's mission and purpose, review and approve changes in academic programs, monitor the university's financial condition, establish investment and institutional policies, and authorize the budget. The officers of the corporation include the Chair of the Board, three Vice Chairs, the Treasurer, the Secretary, the Provost, the President, who serves ex officio, and the Executive Vice President.

The [[List of Presidents of Tufts University|President of Tufts University]], who is elected by the Trustees is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the President in administering the university are the Provost, the Executive Vice President, the Treasurer, and the Secretary, all of whom are appointed by the Trustees on the nomination of the President and serve at their pleasure. As the 13th president Anthony Monaco was sworn on August 1, 2011. An accomplished leader, scientist and teacher, Monaco was formerly a professor and the Pro-Vice-Chancellor at the [[University of Oxford]]. His doctoral research led to his landmark discovery of the gene responsible for X-linked [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy]]. He worked on the [[human genome project]] at the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] in London and in the human genetics laboratory at the Institute of Molecular Medicine in Oxford. Additionally he identified the first gene specifically involved in human speech and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/11/30/noted_geneticist_to_lead_tufts/?page=2|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=December 4, 2010|newspaper=BostonGlobe|title=Noted geneticist to lead Tufts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tufts is organized into ten schools. Each school has its own faculty, and is led by a [[Dean (education)|dean]] appointed by the [[president]] and the [[provost (education)|provost]] with the consent of the Board of Trustees. The School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering are the only schools that award both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The five schools offering undergraduate education are: Arts and Sciences, the liberal arts college offering both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree, the School of Engineering (also known as the [[Tufts Gordon Institute|Gordon Institute]]) offers the Bachelor of Science degree, the School of Special Studies which awards the degree of bachelor of fine arts through the [[Tufts School of the Museum of Fine Arts]]. The other two the [[Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service]] and the [[Experimental College (Tufts University)|Experimental College]] are non-degree granting.

The Tisch College was founded in 2000 "to educate for active citizenship" with the help of a $10 million gift from [[eBay]] founder [[Pierre Omidyar]] and his wife Pam. The school was renamed in 2006 after a $40 million gift from [[Jonathan Tisch]]. It has been called the "most ambitious attempt by any research university to make public service part of its core academic mission".&lt;ref&gt;Bombardieri, Marcella.

The university runs on a semester based calendar with most undergraduate students finishing within four years, however, Tisch College provides an innovative 1+4 Bridge year program where students have the opportunity to take a community service based gap year before starting in Tufts. Current projects undertaken by Bridge Year Fellows involve serving as mentors and teachers to children, caring for rescued wild animals, contributing to renewable energy and sustainability projects. Current projects are based in Brazil, Nicaragua, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://activecitizen.tufts.edu/tufts1plus4/|accessdate=May 16, 2016|title=Tufts 1+4 Bridge-Year Service Learning Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the purview of the School of Arts and Sciences is the Experimental College, created in 1964 as a proving ground for innovative, experimental, and [[interdisciplinary]] curricula and courses. It offers the opportunity for students to take for-credit courses with non-academic practitioners in a variety of fields, and also from upper-level undergraduates who have a chance to design and teach their own courses. Another successful component of the Ex College is EPIIC, a year-long program begun in 1985 to immerse students in a global issue, which culminates in an annual symposium of scholars and experts from the field.

The [[Tufts School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] offers art programs with a major museum, the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.smfa.edu/partnerships | title=Partnerships | publisher= School of the Museum of Fine Arts |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key figures in the merger, [[Nancy Bauer (philosopher)|Nancy Bauer]] became the dean of the museum school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://now.tufts.edu/articles/nancy-bauer-named-dean-museum-school | title= Nancy Bauer Named Dean of Museum School | publisher= "Tufts Now" |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduate education is offered in eight of the schools. In addition to Arts and Sciences and Engineering Tufts offers graduate degrees in the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, the oldest U.S. school for international relations and foreign affairs, the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Medicine, the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, the Friedman School of Nutrition, and the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Additionally, the university did provide master's degrees in religion through the Crane Theological School. The school was dissolved in 1968.

In 2006, Dean of Arts and Sciences [[Robert Sternberg]] added experimental criteria to the application process for undergraduates to test "creativity and other non-academic factors", including inviting applicants to submit [[YouTube]] videos to supplement their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/education/23tufts.html | work=The New York Times | title=To Impress, Tufts Prospects Turn to YouTube | first=Tamar | last=Lewin | date=February 22, 2010 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling it the "first major university to try such a departure from the norm", ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' also notes that Tufts continues to consider the [[SAT]] and other traditional criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Jaschik, Scott (2006).

Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Lee Coffin announced on April 7, 2015 that Tufts would be accepting [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]]&lt;!--Also called "undocumented" for people who wish to not give them stigma - Wikipedia uses "Illegal immigration" and "Illegal immigrant" in that article, so "illegal immigrant" is the most "neutral" word--&gt; students with and without [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)]]. Coffin said that undocumented students would no longer be considered international students, but rather domestic students. This was due to the activism of social justice group United for Immigrant Justice. The first cohort of undocumented students is in the class of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2015/04/07/tufts-accept-undocumented-students-provide-financial-aid/ | title=Tufts to accept undocumented students, provide financial aid | date=April 7, 2015 | accessdate=December 2, 2015 | author=Kerstein, Arin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university received 21,501 undergraduate applicants in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferguson|first1=Laura|title=Record Number of Applications|url=https://now.tufts.edu/articles/record-number-applications|website=Tufts Now|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, shortly after Tufts opened, its admissions application asked for statements of good character and for students to complete examinations in Greek, history, Latin, and mathematics. As part of these examinations they were asked to study a list of relevant textbooks. By 1905 the admissions requirements became lengthier and the examinations became more complex; the latter required students to write essays and translations. Julia Ryan of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that because students certified by the [[New England College Entrance Certificate Board]], ones who attended private preparatory schools in New England, were exempt from the examinations, "perhaps only a few students were even taking [the entrance examinations]."&lt;ref name=RyanJuliaHowGetting&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan, Julia|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/how-getting-into-college-became-such-a-long-frenzied-competitive-process/281336/|title=How Getting Into College Became Such a Long, Frenzied, Competitive Process|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925 Tufts set an admission quota of 650 males; the examinations were of a similar length of the 1905 ones but the entry requirements decreased in size to a level comparable of that of the 1856 ones. Standardized testing, admissions interviews, and other features of current university admissions processes were in place by 1946.&lt;ref name=RyanJuliaHowGetting/&gt;

====Graduate admissions====
The graduate schools each hold their own admission process. Students apply directly to the graduate program to which they are seeking acceptance, and so acceptance rates vary dramatically between programs.

===Libraries and museums===

[[File:Biblioteca Ginn.jpg|thumb|150px|Ginn Library at the Fletcher School]]

Completed in 1908, Tufts' first library building, Eaton Memorial Library (now Eaton Hall), was made possible with a donation from [[Andrew Carnegie]]. Carnegie's wife requested that the building be named after a Tufts graduate, Reverend Charles Eaton, who had presided over her wedding. The building received an extension in 1950 with the construction of the War Memorial Library in honor of the Tufts alumni who served in [[World War II]]. By 1965 the collection outgrew the building and was moved to a new library named Wessell Library. Additionally the demand for more square footage prompted the expansion of Wessell. In 1995, with the addition of 80,000 more square feet, the library was renamed [[Tisch Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then&amp;now.pdf | title=Tufts Then &amp; Now | publisher=''Tufts University"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the [[Tufts University Libraries|Tufts University Library System]] contains over three million volumes. The main library, Tisch Library, holds about 2.7 million volumes, with other holdings dispersed at subject libraries including the Hirsh Health Sciences Library on the Boston campus, the Edwin Ginn Library at the Fletcher School, and Webster Family Library at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine on the Grafton campus.&lt;ref name="Tufts University Fact Book 2015/2016"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://provost.tufts.edu/institutionalresearch/files/Fact-Book-2015-16_Final.pdf | publisher = Tufts University | title = Tufts University Fact Book | work = Tufts University Fact Book 2015/2016 | date = &lt;!-- (undated) --&gt; | accessdate = August 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students have access to the academic libraries of institutions in the Boston Consortium.

In addition to the [[Barnum Museum of Natural History]], Tufts had established a permanent art collection which includes a wide range of art from antiquity to the present. The Collection comprises 2,000 works from ancient Mediterranean and pre-Hispanic cultures to modern and contemporary painting, sculpture, and photography. Notable highlights in the permanent collection include works by [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Salvador Dali]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] among others.

===Student body===
According to the Princeton Review the undergraduate student body is ethnically and socioeconomically diverse.&lt;ref name="Princetonreview.com"/&gt; ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' ranks Tufts as one of the top 20 gay-friendly campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enews.tufts.edu/stories/233/2006/08/28/TuftsHailedAsGayFriendlyCampus|title=Tufts E-News: Tufts Hailed As Gay-Friendly Campus|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724084740/http://enews.tufts.edu/stories/233/2006/08/28/TuftsHailedAsGayFriendlyCampus/#|archive-date=July 24, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those accepted for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2019, 27 percent are Asian, Hispanic, African-American, or two or more races.

====Student government====

There are three forms of student government at Tufts University: the Tufts Community Union (TCU) Senate, the TCU Judiciary and the CSL (Committee on Student Life). The Senate is chaired by the student body president and led by a six-person executive board consisting of Vice President, Treasurer, Historian, Parliamentarian, and Diversity and Community Affairs Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcu.tufts.edu/|title=Tufts Community Union|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publications and broadcasting====
The ''[[Tufts Daily]]'' is the daily student newspaper, and the ''[[Tufts Observer]]'', established in 1895, is the school's biweekly magazine and the oldest publication on campus. [[The Zamboni (magazine)|The Zamboni]] is Tufts' monthly humor and satire magazine. ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' has named Tufts' college newspaper as one of the best in the country, currently ranking it No. 10.&lt;ref name="Princetonreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-college-newspaper|title=Best College Newspaper – The Princeton Review|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tufts has a television station (TUTV) which has produced and broadcast films, news, soap operas, and comedy sketch pieces. TUTV has also gone to release web series such as "Jules and Monty". The station went operational in April 1977, from Curtis Hall and consists of 40 student volunteers. Curtis Hall is also home to Tufts' own radio station [[WMFO]], which streams locally on 91.5 FM. The station first aired in 1970 and is funded by the university.

====Activism====
[[File:Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Protest at Tufts University.jpg|200px|thumb|Student protest for fossil fuel divestment]]

In 1969, Tufts was the center for Civil Rights activism due to the controversy surrounding the construction of Lewis Hall. Students staged a work strike to protest racist hiring policies practiced by the construction company Tufts had commissioned to build the residence hall. In addition to writing letters, students sat in Ballou and East Halls, and collaborated with black workers. These demonstrations eventually attracted support from major metropolitan areas in the Northeast. In 1970, Tufts adopted new hiring policies which were subsequently adopted by other universities. It led to the creation of training programs for minority employees on campus, in addition to the foundation of the Africana Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.tufts.edu/protest1969/|title=Tufts Civil Right Protests|accessdate=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609213428/http://sites.tufts.edu/protest1969/|archive-date=June 9, 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greek life====
There are 13 total Greek life organizations at Tufts. About 25% of the student body is involved in Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uss.tufts.edu/studentAffairs/resources/ofsl.asp|title=Tufts University: Student Affairs|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six national fraternities with chapters at Tufts are [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Delta Upsilon]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Theta Delta Chi]], [[Zeta Beta Tau]], and [[Zeta Psi]]. In addition, there are four sororities: [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Phi]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]]. There is also one co-ed fraternity, ATO of Massachusetts, and a local fraternity, Pi Rho Omega.

===Athletics===
{{Main|Tufts Jumbos}}

Tufts competes in the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference]]—the NESCAC—in [[NCAA Division III]]. Their [[mascot]] is [[Jumbo]], which is one of two college mascots to appear in [[Webster's Dictionary]] with the other being the Billiken of St. Louis University. The mascot comes from [[P. T. Barnum]]'s circus, as Barnum was one of the original trustees of Tufts College. According to legend, Jumbo the Elephant heroically jumped in front of a train, sacrificing himself to save a younger elephant from dying. Jumbo's stuffed skin was donated to the school, and was displayed until a 1975 fire destroyed the body, except for the tail, which had been removed for conservation work. Now, a statue of the elephant is a prominent landmark on the quad, near Barnum Hall, the Biology building.

Recently, Tufts has become one of the top athletic schools in Division III. The school has consistently ranked in the top ten of the Learfield Director's Cup, which ranks the top Division I, II, and III athletic programs in the country by awarding points in a pre-determined number of sports for men and women. In 2015-16, Tufts ranked 4th in the country, and in 2014-15 Tufts ranked 9th. Tufts men's lacrosse team won the school's first ever NCAA team championship in 2010, beating [[Salisbury State University]] in the championship game. They lost in 2011 to Salisbury in the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Salisbury routs Tufts for title |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-05-30/sports/29600194_1_salisbury-coach-jim-berkman-matt-cannone-tufts |author=Alex Prewitt |publisher=Boston Globe |date=May 30, 2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the women's field hockey team won their first national championship, beating [[Montclair State University]] 2–1 in the finals.

Performed at most football games, "Tuftonia's Day", the Tufts fight song, was written in 1912 by Elliot W. Hayes. It can also be heard at Tufts' numerous a capella concerts and at homecoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.tufts.edu/about-tufts/tufts-traditions/|title=Tufts Traditions |accessdate=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing and dining===
[[File:West Hall - Tufts University - IMG 0973.JPG|thumb|West Hall, an uphill residence hall]]
Seven out of ten undergraduates live on campus. Students can choose from 40 residences from small special interest houses, to traditional dorms, to shared apartments. There are 25 residence halls. Similar to residential colleges, students would frequently organize discussions and bring in guest speakers and plan several activities together. Upperclassmen have the option of living in special interest housing which are 15 houses reflecting a specific cultural or academic interest. Each house offers organizes several activities and events not limited to residents. Shared apartments are usually the most popular in the university with apartments like Sophia Gordon Hall (SoGo) a primary gathering place for juniors and seniors. The high density residential neighborhood around the university provides additional housing for students who opt to live off campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.tufts.edu/life-at-tufts/housing-and-res-life/|title=Housing Tufts University|accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has two main dining centers, Dewick-MacPhie serving downhill students, and Carmichael serving uphill students. Each dining hall has a different menu and atmosphere. Both offer a European-style servery with multiple stations.{{clarify|reason=What does 'European-style servery with multiple stations' mean?|date=June 2017}} ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' has listed Tufts in its "Best Campus Food" category since 2005, ranking it as high as second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfood.com/2006/08/26/princetonreview-bowdoin-campus-food/|title=Recipes and Cooking Inspiration – Kitchen Daily|work=Kitchen Daily|accessdate=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014190449/http://www.slashfood.com/2006/08/26/princetonreview-bowdoin-campus-food/|archive-date=October 14, 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeprowler.com/tufts-university/campus-dining/|title=Tufts University – Campus Food|date=May 21, 2015|work=Niche.com|accessdate=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043009/http://collegeprowler.com/tufts-university/campus-dining/|archive-date=October 18, 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://njartscouncil.com/top-schools-in-the-northeast-see-the-rankings/67/ Top Schools in the Northeast – See the Rankings : NJ Arts Council&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714184907/http://njartscouncil.com/top-schools-in-the-northeast-see-the-rankings/67/ |date=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The menus for these dining halls can be found at [https://tuftsrecipes.com Tufts Recipes].

==Traditions==

[[File:Tufts cannon support Japan.jpg|thumb|[[The Cannon (Tufts University)|The Tufts cannon]], repainted almost nightly during the academic year, is here painted in response to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami in Japan]]]]

===A Cappella===
Tufts also has a thriving a cappella scene, including the [[Beelzebubs]], known for their performances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' and ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', where the group arranged several of the songs performed by the fictional a cappella group, [[The Warblers]]. Other notable groups include the [[Amalgamates]], known also for their performances all over the United States, and the [[Jackson Jills]], Tufts' oldest female group.

===Naked Quad Run===
Every winter just prior to final exams, students would run naked laps on the Academic Quad as a way to relieve the stress of finals, much akin to similar traditions such as the [[Primal Scream (Harvard)|Primal Scream]] at Harvard. Due to increasing scrutiny from the administration and injuries incurred by slipping on the icy roads, the tradition was banned in 2011 by then-President [[Lawrence S. Bacow|Lawrence Bacow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuftsdaily.com/opinion/2011/03/14/nqr-reconsidered/|title=NQR reconsidered - The Tufts Daily|date=March 14, 2011|work=The Tufts Daily|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; much to students' dismay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuftsdaily.com/arts/2014/09/25/tufts-no-longer-a-quirky-paradise/|title=Tufts no longer a quirky paradise? - The Tufts Daily|date=September 25, 2014|work=The Tufts Daily|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuftsdaily.com/news/2011/03/14/bacow-ends-naked-quad-run/|title=Bacow ends Naked Quad Run - The Tufts Daily|date=March 14, 2011|work=The Tufts Daily|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tuftsobserver.org/the-end-of-an-era/|title=The End of an Era|date=December 4, 2011|work=Tufts Observer|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest run took place the following year, with some students donning nude colored leotards and others taking the opposite tack calling their event the "Excessively Overdressed Quad Stroll".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/somerville/tufts-naked-quad-run-becomes-excessively-overdressed-7cd675062b|title=Tufts Naked Quad Run Becomes 'Excessively Overdressed Quad Stroll'|date=December 13, 2011|work=Somerville, MA Patch|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2016, the tradition was revitalized for spring finals week and briefly became an annual tradition once more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17201">{{short description|Citation style that uses numbers within the text to cite references}}
The '''Vancouver system''', also known as '''Vancouver reference style''' or the '''author–number system''', is a [[citation]] style that uses numbers within the text that refer to numbered entries in the reference list. It is popular in the [[physical sciences]] and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine, the other being the [[Harvard referencing|author–date, or "Harvard", system]].&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{vcite web|title=Reference styles|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/library/library-guide/reference-styles|date=|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hundreds of [[scientific journals]] use author-number systems. They all follow the same essential logic (that is, numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries), although the trivial details of the output mask, such as [[punctuation]], [[letter case#Case styles|casing of titles]], and [[italic type|italic]], vary widely among them. They have existed for over a century; the names "Vancouver system" or "Vancouver style" have existed since 1978. The latest version of the latter is ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', per the ''References &gt; Style and Format'' section of the ICMJE Recommendations.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations&gt;{{Citation |author=ICMJE |title=Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals |url=http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broad sense, the Vancouver system refers to any author-number system regardless of the formatting details.  A narrower definition of the Vancouver system refers to a specific author-number format specified by the [[ICMJE Recommendations]] (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts, URM).  For example, the [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA reference style]] is Vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author-number system that conforms to the URM, but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the NLM/PubMed style (such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed).

==History==
Author–number systems have existed for over a century and throughout that time have been one of the main types of [[citation]] style in [[scientific journal]]s (the other being [[parenthetical referencing|author–date]]). In 1978, a committee of editors from various [[medical journal]]s, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), met in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC, Canada]] to agree to a unified set of requirements for the articles of such journals. This meeting led to the establishment of the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] (URMs). Part of the URMs is the reference style, for which the ICMJE selected the long-established author–number principle.

The URMs were developed 15 years before the [[World Wide Web]] debuted. During those years, they were published as articles or supplements in various ICMJE member journals. These included the 1991 BMJ publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=2001512 |pmc=1669007 |year=1991 |month=Feb |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=302 |issue=6772 |pages=338–341 |issn=0959-8138 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |doi=10.1136/bmj.302.6772.338}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1995 ''[[CMAJ]]'' publication&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=7728695 |pmc=1337910 |year=1995 |month=May |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals.  | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=152 |issue=9 |pages=1459–1473 |issn=0820-3946 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1997 ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=8992922 |year=1997 |month=Jan |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. |author=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=36–47 |issn=0003-4819 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8992922 |format=Free full text |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-126-1-199701010-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s and early 2000s, journals were asked to cite the 1997 ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' version&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=9062335 |year=1997 |month=Mar |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=277 |issue=11 |pages=927–934 |issn=0098-7484 |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |doi=10.1001/jama.277.11.927}}&lt;/ref&gt; when reprinting the ''Uniform requirements''.

In the early 2000s, with the Web having become a major force in academic life, the idea gradually took hold that the logical home for the latest edition of the URMs would be the [http://www.icmje.org/ ICMJE website] itself (as opposed to whichever journal article or supplement had most recently published an update). For example, as of 2004, the editors of ''[[Haematologica]]'' decided simply to invite their authors to visit www.icmje.org for the 2003 revision of the ''Uniform requirements''.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=15020262 |year=2004 |month=Mar |author=International Committee Of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) |title=Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: writing and editing for biomedical publication |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=264 |issn=0390-6078 |journal=Haematologica |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15020262 |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early to mid-2000s, the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (which runs [[MEDLINE]] and [[PubMed]]) has hosted the ICMJE's "Sample References" pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html |author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors | title = Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Sample References | accessdate = 2006-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2007, the NLM created ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', its [[style guide]] for citation style, as a new home for the style's details. The ICMJE Recommendations now point to ''[[Citing Medicine]]'' as the home for the formatting details of Vancouver style.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt; For example, in the December 2013 edition of the ICMJE Recommendations, the relevant paragraph is IV.A.3.g.ii. (''References &gt; Style and Format'').&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt;

==Sample usage==

===Labelling citations===
References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text – they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] in [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]''' (1)''', [[square brackets]]''' [1]''', [[superscript]]'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''', or a combination'''&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The number usually appears at the end of the material it supports, and an entry in the reference list would give full bibliographical information for the source:

{{quote|Blood loss and the number of patients requiring post-operative blood transfusions were significantly greater, but operation and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter, for the DHS versus the PFNA group&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

And the entry in the reference list would be: 1. {{cite journal|vauthors=Xu YZ, Geng DC, Mao HQ, Zhu XS, Yang HL|title=A comparison of the proximal femoral nail antirotation device and dynamic hip screw in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fracture.|pmid=20925999|journal=J Int Med Res|date=2010|volume=38|pages=1266–1275}}

===Placing citations===
Several descriptions of the Vancouver system say that the number can be placed ''outside'' the text punctuation to avoid disruption to the flow of the text, ''or'' be placed ''inside'' the text punctuation, and that there are different cultures in different traditions.&lt;ref name="url_Leicester"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/help/citing/vancouver-numbered-system | title = Vancouver (Numbered) System | publisher = University of Leicester  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlmedind.nic.in"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://medind.nic.in/jbc/t04/i1/jbct04i1p21.pdf | title = Reference systems deciphered for you | publisher = Department of Forensic Medicine, Govt. Medical College, Patiala }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first method is recommended by some universities and colleges,&lt;ref name="urllibrary.vcc.ca"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | title = Vancouver Citation Style | publisher = Vancouver Community College | quote = The citation in brackets is placed after any commas and periods, and before any colons and semi-colons | accessdate = 2015-01-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043418/http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2015-02-09 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter method is required by scientific publications such as the [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA]]&lt;ref name="urlMLA Citation Style | Cornell University Library"&gt;{{vcite web | url = https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation/mla | title = MLA Citation Style | publisher =  Cornell University Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IEEE]]&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt; except for in the end of a block quotation. (IEEE are using Vancouver style labels within brackets, for example [1] to cite the first reference in the list, but otherwise refer to [[Chicago Style Manual]].)&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | title = IEEE Citation Reference | format =  | work = IEEE | quote = References ... appear on the line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation. | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110408195511/http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | archivedate = 2011-04-08 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Vancouver system documents (the [[ICMJE recommendations]] and Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals) do not discuss placement of the citation mark.

===Format of citations===
Different formats exist for different types of sources, e.g. books, journal articles etc. Author names are abbreviated to at most two initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/ |title=Citing Medicine: The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers [Internet] | edition=2nd | first = K | last = Patrias | editor-first  = D | editor-last = Wendling |location=Bethesda, MD | publisher = National Library of Medicine (US) | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2012-02-22 | quote = Convert given (first) names and middle names to initials, for a maximum of two initials following each surname | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Citing Medicine'' does not explicitly mandate merging initials (e.g. "R. K." would be merged into "RK"), the examples used throughout the book do.

====Journal articles====

=====Standard journal articles=====
* Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M. H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects. Clin Exp Allergy. 2002 Apr;32(4):489-498.
* Tashiro J, Yamaguchi S, Ishii T, Suzuki A, Kondo H, Morita Y, Hara K, Koyama I. Inferior oncological prognosis of surgery without oral chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer in clinical settings. World J Surg Oncol. 2014 May 10;12(1):145. [Epub ahead of print]

As an option, if a journal carries continuous pagination throughout a volume (as many medical journals do), the month and issue number may be omitted.

* Thomas MC. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs – the triple whammy. Med J Aust. 2000;172:184-185.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] lists all authors for all articles, because it is appropriate for capturing all authors and all of their publications in the MEDLINE database to be found by searches. However, in the reference lists of articles, most journals truncate the list after 3 or 6 names, followed by "[[et al.]]" (which most medical journals do not italicize):

* Guilbert TW, Morgan WJ, Zeiger RS, Mauger DT, Boehmer SJ, Szefler SJ, et al. Long-term inhaled corticosteroids in preschool children at high risk for asthma. N Engl J Med. 2006 May 11;354(19):1985-1997.

Optionally, a unique identifier (such as the article's [[digital object identifier|DOI]] or [[PubMed#PubMed identifier|PMID]]) may be added to the citation:

* von Itzstein M, Wu WY, Kok GB, Pegg MS, Dyason JC, Jin B, et al. Rational design of potent sialidase-based inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Nature. 1993 Jun 3;363(6428):418-423. {{PMID|8502295}}.

NLM elides ending page numbers and uses a hyphen as the range indicating character (184-5). Some journals do likewise, whereas others expand the ending page numbers in full (184-185), use an en dash instead of a hyphen (184–5), or both (184–185).

Virtually all medical journal articles are published online. Many are published online only, and many others are published online ahead of print. For the date of online publication, at the end of the citation NLM puts "[Epub Year Mon Day]" (for online-only publication) or "[Epub ahead of print]" for online ahead of print (with the month and day following the year in its normal position). In contrast, [[AMA style]] puts "[published online Month Day, Year]" at the end of the article title. It no longer uses the term "Epub" and no longer includes the words "ahead of print". It omits the year from its normal location after the journal title abbreviation if there is no print data to give (online-only publication).

The titles of journals are abbreviated. There are no periods in the abbreviation. A period comes after the abbreviation, delimiting it from the next field. The abbreviations are standardized. The standardization was formerly incomplete and internal to organizations such as NLM. It is now formalized at the [[supraorganization]]al level by documents including [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7251/ ''Citing Medicine'' at Appendix A: Abbreviations for Commonly Used English Words in Journal Titles], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z39.5, [[ISO 4|ISO 4: Information and documentation -- Rules for the abbreviation of title words and titles of publications]], and the [http://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-the-ltwa/ ISSN.org List of Title Word Abbreviations (LTWA)].

=====Articles not in English=====
As per journal articles in English:

* Forneau E, Bovet D. Recherches sur l'action sympathicolytique d'un nouveau dérivé du dioxane. Arch Int Pharmacodyn. 1933;46:178-191. French.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] adds an English translation of the title enclosed in square brackets right after the title. The language is specified in full after the location (pagination), followed by a period.&lt;!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/box/A33262/?report=objectonly --&gt;

The '''Virginia Institute of Marine Science''' (VIMS) is one of the largest marine research and education centers in the United States. Founded in 1940, VIMS  is unique among marine science institutions in its legal mandate to provide research, education, and advisory service to government, citizens, and industry. Funding for VIMS comes from the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]], grants and contracts from federal and state agencies, and private giving. The School of Marine Science (SMS) at VIMS is the graduate school in marine science for the [[College of William &amp; Mary]]. Offering both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in marine science, the school has 57 faculty members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vims.edu/about/directory/faculty/index.php|title=VIMS Faculty Listing|last=VIMS|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enrollment of 80-100 students, and includes 4 academic departments. VIMS' main campus is located in [[Gloucester Point, Virginia|Gloucester Point]], [[Virginia]].

== Mission  ==
VIMS provides research, education, and advisory service in marine science to Virginia, the nation, and the world. VIMS' mission is mandated in the [http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title28.2/chapter11/ Code of Virginia].

==History==
VIMS was started by Prof. Donald W. Davis as the William &amp; Mary Maritime Laboratory in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=VIMS|title=VIMS FAQ|url=http://www.vims.edu/about/faqs/index.php|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1940 was chartered by the Commonwealth as the Virginia Fisheries Laboratory. Its original building, Maury Hall,  is named for Virginian [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], the "Father of Modern Oceanography." VIMS' Eastern Shore Laboratory, established in 1962 in the seaside village of [[Wachapreague, Virginia|Wachapreague]], jumpstarted Virginia's large hard-clam industry. VIMS scientists were leaders in establishing the national Sea Grant and Coastal Zone Management programs in the 1960s.

==Research programs==
[[Image:Vims nomad buoy.jpg|right|thumb|300px|VIMS [[Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device|NOMAD]] real-time data buoy]]
VIMS research spans a broad range of topics. A 2009 analysis of research citations by [[Thomson Reuters]] Essential Science Indicators found VIMS among the top 1% of institutions in the fields of Plant &amp; Animal Science and Environment &amp; Ecology.

Early programs included:

* oyster research in the 1950s that was the seminal work on the ecology of these shellfish;
* juvenile fish and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]] surveys in Chesapeake Bay began in 1955; these key fishery management tools continue today;
* [http://www.vims.edu/research/departments/fisheries/programs/sharks/index.php annual shark survey] started in 1973, this is now the world's longest-running fishery independent shark survey;
* seagrass restoration efforts that are the most successful in the world, with more than {{convert|6,000|acre|km2}} restored to coastal bays.

Current active research includes:

* Coastal Research - more than 50 coastal projects on every continent including Antarctica;
* Blue Crab sustainability
* Oyster restoration and aquaculture
* Bay Grasses / Submerged aquatic vegetation
* Aquatic Diseases &amp; Immunity
* Fisheries and Aquaculture
* Global Change
* Marine Life &amp; Processes
* Observing &amp; Modeling - computer models using real-time data to help predict storm surge, sediment transport, and [[food-web]] dynamics.
* Coastal Economies &amp; Recreation
* Pollution detection and risk of marine pollutants

==Academics==
VIMS' School of Marine Science is one of four graduate and professional schools of [[College of William and Mary|William &amp; Mary]]. The school has 57 faculty members and a student body ranging from 80-100 students, approximately half of whom are women. M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are offered in four major areas:

*Aquatic Health Sciences - chemicals and biological factors that can deleteriously affect the health of aquatic ecosystems.
*Biological Sciences - biological, physical, and human-induced forces governing marine ecosystems on local and global scales.
*Fisheries Science - investigation of living marine resources, especially finfish and shellfish
*Physical Sciences - chemical, geological, and physical oceanography

== Facilities and research vessels ==

In addition to specialized facilities at the Eastern Shore Laboratory and Kaufman Aquaculture Center, the main campus includes:

*The Seawater Research Laboratory, the largest facility of its kind in the U.S, provides 800-gallons per minute to an acre of research tanks and lab space.
*The [[William J. Hargis, Jr. Library]] with 88,000 marine science volumes.
*Visitor Center with aquaria and life-sized models shows how VIMS research benefits Chesapeake Bay and the ocean.
*[http://www.vims.edu/research/facilities/fishcollection/index.php Nunnally Ichthyology Collection] features more than 125,000 specimens in 247 fish families from Chesapeake Bay and surrounding waters.[[File:R-V Virginia.jpg|thumb|475x265px|VIMS R/V ''Virginia'']]
*Andrews Hall, a {{convert|71000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building that features 39 laboratories, 25 faculty offices, and space for nearly 100 students, technicians, and visiting scientists.
