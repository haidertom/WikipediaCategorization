[[File:Beckton STP, Activated Sludge Tank - geograph.org.uk - 1481906.jpg|thumb|Activated sludge tank at Beckton [[sewage treatment plant]], UK - the white bubbles are due to the diffused air aeration system]]
The '''activated sludge''' process is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] process for treating [[sewage]] or [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewaters]] using [[aeration]] and a biological [[floc (biofilm)|floc]] composed of bacteria and [[protozoa]].

The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items: An aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected in the mixed liquor. This is followed by a settling tank (usually referred to as "final clarifier" or "secondary settling tank") to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.

==Purpose==
[[Image:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|right|300 px|A generalized, schematic diagram of an activated sludge process.]]
[[File:Activated sludge addition to membrane bioreactor (5729651741).jpg|thumb|Activated sludge addition (seeding) to a pilot scale membrane bioreactor in Germany]]
[[File:Mikrofoto.de-Belebtschlamm 6.jpg|thumb|Activated sludge under the microscope]]
In a sewage (or industrial wastewater) treatment plant, the activated sludge process is a biological process that can be used for one or several of the following purposes: oxidizing [[biotic material|carbonaceous biological matter]], oxidizing nitrogenous matter: mainly [[ammonium]] and [[nitrogen]] in biological matter, removing [[nutrients]] (nitrogen and phosphorus).

==Process description==
The process takes advantage of [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] micro-organisms that can digest organic matter in sewage, and clump together (by [[flocculation]]) as they do so. It thereby produces a liquid that is relatively free from suspended solids and organic material, and flocculated particles that will readily settle out and can be removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/pdf/WW/publications/pipline/PL_SP03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items:
* Aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected in the mixed liquor.
* Settling tank (usually referred to as "final clarifier" or "secondary settling tank") to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.
  
Treatment of nitrogenous matter or phosphate involves additional steps where the mixed liquor is left in anoxic condition (meaning that there is no residual dissolved oxygen).

===Bioreactor and final clarifier===
The process involves air or [[oxygen]] being introduced into a mixture of screened, and primary treated sewage or industrial wastewater ([[wastewater]]) combined with organisms to develop a biological [[flocculation|floc]] which reduces the [[organic matter|organic]] content of the [[sewage]]. This material, which in healthy sludge is a brown floc, is largely composed of [[saprotrophic]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] but also has an important [[protozoa]]n flora component mainly composed of [[amoeba]]e, [[Spirotrich]]s, [[Peritrich]]s including [[Vorticella|Vorticellids]] and a range of other filter-feeding species. Other important constituents include motile and sedentary [[Rotifer]]s. In poorly managed activated sludge, a range of [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] filamentous bacteria can develop including ''[[Sphaerotilus natans]]'' which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket decanting over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality. This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal communities are relatively uncommon.

The combination of wastewater and biological mass is commonly known as ''mixed liquor''. In all activated sludge plants, once the wastewater has received sufficient treatment, excess mixed liquor is discharged into settling tanks and the treated [[supernatant]] is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the [[sludge]], is returned to the head of the [[aeration]] system to re-seed the new wastewater entering the tank. This fraction of the floc is called ''return activated sludge'' (R.A.S.).

The space required for a sewage treatment plant can be reduced by using a [[membrane bioreactor]] to remove some wastewater from the mixed liquor prior to treatment. This results in a more concentrated waste product that can then be treated using the activated sludge process.

Many sewage treatment plants use [[axial flow pump]]s to transfer nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification.  These pumps are often referred to as internal mixed liquor recycle pumps (IMLR pumps). The raw sewage, the RAS, and the nitrified mixed liquor are mixed by [[submersible mixer]]s in the anoxic zones in order to achieve denitrification.

=== Sludge production===
Activated sludge is also the name given to the active biological material produced by activated sludge plants. Excess sludge is called "surplus activated sludge" or "waste activated sludge" and is removed from the treatment process to keep the ratio of biomass to food supplied in the wastewater in balance. This [[sewage sludge]] is usually mixed with primary sludge from the primary clarifiers and undergoes further [[sewage sludge treatment|sludge treatment]] for example by [[anaerobic digestion]], followed by thickening, dewatering, [[composting]] and land application.

The amount of sewage sludge produced from the activated sludge process is directly proportional to the amount of wastewater treated. The total sludge production consists of the sum of primary sludge from the primary sedimentation tanks as well as waste activated sludge from the bioreactors. The activated sludge process produces about 70–100&amp;nbsp;kg/ML of waste activated sludge (that is kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). A value of 80&amp;nbsp;kg/ML is regarded as being typical.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title = Wastewater engineering : treatment and reuse|publisher = Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA|isbn = 0-07-112250-8|page = 1456|edition = 4th|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 110–170&amp;nbsp;kg/ML of primary sludge is produced in the primary sedimentation tanks which most - but not all - of the activated sludge process configurations use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A variant of the activated sludge process is the [[Nereda]] process where aerobic granular sludge is developed by applying specific process conditions that favour slow growing organisms.

===Process control===

The general process control method is to monitor sludge blanket level, SVI (Sludge Volume Index), MCRT (Mean Cell Residence Time), F/M (Food to Microorganism), as well as the biota of the activated sludge and the major nutrients DO ([[Dissolved oxygen]]), [[nitrogen]], [[phosphate]], BOD ([[Biochemical oxygen demand]]), and COD ([[Chemical oxygen demand]]). In the reactor/aerator and clarifier system, the sludge blanket is measured from the bottom of the clarifier to the level of settled solids in the clarifier's water column; this, in large plants, can be done up to three times a day.

The SVI is the volume of settled sludge in milliliters occupied by 1 gram of dry sludge solids after 30 minutes of settling in a 1000 milliliter graduated cylinder.&lt;ref name="MECC"&gt;[http://water.me.vccs.edu/courses/ENV149/operationb.htm#svi Operation and Control] From the Water/ Wastewater Distance Learning Website of the Mountain Empire Community College in Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath"&gt;[http://www.ragsdaleandassociates.com/WastewaterSystemOperatorsManual/Chapter%2017%20-%20Mathematics.pdf Mathematics For Wastewater Operators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907112903/http://www.ragsdaleandassociates.com/WastewaterSystemOperatorsManual/Chapter%2017%20-%20Mathematics.pdf |date=2012-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCRT is the total mass (lbs) of mixed liquor suspended solids in the aerator and clarifier divided by the mass flow rate (lbs/day) of mixed liquor suspended solids leaving as WAS and final effluent.&lt;ref name="MECC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath" /&gt; The F/M is the ratio of food fed to the microorganisms each day to the mass of microorganisms held under aeration. Specifically, it is the amount of BOD fed to the aerator (lbs/day) divided by the amount (lbs) of [[Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids]] (MLVSS) under aeration. Note:  Some references use MLSS (Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids) for expedience, but MLVSS is considered more accurate for the measure of microorganisms.&lt;ref name="MECC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath" /&gt; Again, due to expedience, COD is generally used, in lieu of BOD, as BOD takes five days for results.

Based on these control methods, the amount of settled solids in the mixed liquor can be varied by wasting activated sludge (WAS) or returning activated sludge (RAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckenfelder, Jr.|first1=W.

==Types of plants==

There are a variety of types of activated sludge plants.&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; These include:

===Package plants===
There are a wide range of types of package plants, often serving small communities or industrial plants that may use hybrid treatment processes often involving the use of aerobic sludge to treat the incoming sewage. In such plants the primary settlement stage of treatment may be omitted. In these plants, a biotic floc is created which provides the required substrate.  Package plants are designed and fabricated by specialty engineering firms in dimensions that allow for their transportation to the job site in public highways, typically width and height of 12 by 12 feet.  Length varies with capacity with larger plants being fabricated in pieces and welded on site.  Steel is preferred over synthetic materials (e.g., plastic) for its durability.

Package plants are commonly variants of [[extended aeration]], to promote the 'fit &amp; forget' approach required for small communities without dedicated operational staff. There are various standards to assist with their design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishwater.co.uk/Document/Download.aspx?uid=3d63842c-eb86-48b1-be17-12eebf7487a5 Code of Practice, ''Flows and Loads-2'', British Water]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://products.ihs.com/cis/Doc.aspx?AuthCode=&amp;DocNum=252510 Review of UK and international standards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105619/http://products.ihs.com/cis/Doc.aspx?AuthCode=&amp;DocNum=252510 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardsdirect.org/standards/standards4/StandardsCatalogue24_view_5158.html British Standard BS 6297:1983]&lt;/ref&gt;

To use less space, treat difficult waste, and intermittent flows, a number of designs of hybrid treatment plants have been produced. Such plants often combine at least two stages of the three main treatment stages into one combined stage. In the UK, where a large number of wastewater treatment plants serve small populations, package plants are a viable alternative to building a large structure for each process stage. In the US, package plants are typically used in rural areas, highway rest stops and trailer parks.&lt;ref name="EPA Package"&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2000). [http://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/package_plant.pdf "Package Plants."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document no. EPA 832-F-00-016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidation ditch===
In some areas, where more land is available, sewage is treated in large round or oval ditches with one or more horizontal aerators typically called brush or disc aerators which drive the mixed liquor around the ditch and provide aeration.&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; These are oxidation ditches, often referred to by manufacturer's trade names such as Pasveer, Orbal, or Carrousel. They have the advantage that they are relatively easy to maintain and are resilient to shock loads that often occur in smaller communities (i.e. at breakfast time and in the evening).

Oxidation ditches are installed commonly as 'fit &amp; forget' technology, with typical design parameters of a [[hydraulic retention time]] of 24 – 48 hours, and a sludge age of 12 – 20 days. This compares with nitrifying activated sludge plants having a retention time of 8 hours, and a sludge age of 8 – 12 days.

===Deep shaft / Vertical treatment===
Where land is in short supply sewage may be treated by injection of oxygen into a pressured return sludge stream which is injected into the base of a deep columnar tank buried in the ground. Such shafts may be up to 100 metres deep and are filled with sewage liquor. As the sewage rises the oxygen forced into solution by the pressure at the base of the shaft breaks out as molecular oxygen providing a highly efficient source of oxygen for the activated sludge biota. The rising oxygen and injected return sludge provide the physical mechanism for mixing of the sewage and sludge. Mixed sludge and sewage is decanted at the surface and separated into supernatant and sludge components. The efficiency of deep shaft treatment can be high.

Surface aerators are commonly quoted as having an aeration efficiency of 0.5 - 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh, diffused aeration as 1.5 - 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KWh. Deep Shaft claims 5 – 8&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh.

However, the costs of construction are high. Deep Shaft has seen the greatest uptake in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wholewater.com/H2OTREATMENT/verticalshaftprojects.htm Vertical Shaft Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; because of the land area issues. Deep Shaft was developed by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], as a spin-off from their [[Pruteen]] process. In the UK it is found at three sites: Tilbury, Anglian water, treating a wastewater with a high industrial contribution;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=8054833 Tilbury construction]&lt;/ref&gt; Southport, United Utilities, because of land space issues; and Billingham, ICI, again treating industrial effluent, and built (after the Tilbury shafts) by ICI to help the agent sell more.

DeepShaft is a patented, licensed, process. The licensee has changed several times and currently (2015) Noram Engineering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noram-eng.com/groups/biosystems-group-overview.html NORAM VERTREAT™ (VERtical TREATment)]&lt;/ref&gt; sells it.

===Surface-aerated basins===
{{further|Aerated lagoon}}
[[Image:Surface-Aerated Basin.png|thumb|right|318px|A Typical Surface-Aerated Basing (using motor-driven floating aerators)]]
Most biological oxidation processes for treating industrial wastewaters have in common the use of oxygen (or air) and microbial action. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90% removal of [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] with retention times of 1 to 10 days.&lt;ref name=Basin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, M.R.|year=1971|title=Performance of surface-aerated basins|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress Symposium Series|volume=67|issue=107|pages=322–339|issn=}} [http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes Available at CSA Illumina website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114140052/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes |date=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres and utilize motor-driven aerators floating on the surface of the wastewater.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

In an aerated basin system, the aerators provide two functions: they transfer air into the basins required by the biological oxidation reactions, and they provide the mixing required for dispersing the air and for contacting the reactants (that is, oxygen, wastewater and microbes). Typically, the floating surface aerators are rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;kg [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[kW]]h. However, they do not provide as good mixing as is normally achieved in activated sludge systems and therefore aerated basins do not achieve the same performance level as activated sludge units.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 40&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4&amp;nbsp;°C and 32&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

=== Sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) ===
{{Main|Sequencing batch reactor}}
[[Sequencing batch reactor]]s (SBRs) treat wastewater in batches within the same vessel. This means that the bioreactor and final clarifier are not separated in space but in a timed sequence. The installation consists of at least two identically equipped tanks with a common inlet, which can be switched between them. While one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is [[aeration|aerating]] and filling.

== Aeration methods ==

===Diffused aeration ===

Sewage liquor is run into deep tanks with [[Diffuser (sewage)|diffuser]] grid aeration systems that are attached to the floor. These are like the diffused [[airstone]] used in [[tropical fish]] tanks but on a much larger scale. Air is pumped through the blocks and the curtain of bubbles formed both oxygenates the liquor and also provides the necessary mixing action. Where capacity is limited or the sewage is unusually strong or difficult to treat, oxygen may be used instead of air. Typically, the air is generated by some type of blower or compressor.

=== Surface aerators (cones) ===
Vertically mounted tubes of up to 1-metre diameter extending from just above the base of a deep concrete tank to just below the surface of the sewage liquor. A typical shaft might be 10 metres high. At the surface end, the tube is formed into a cone with helical vanes attached to the inner surface. When the tube is rotated, the vanes spin liquor up and out of the cones drawing new sewage liquor from the base of the tank. In many works, each cone is located in a separate cell that can be isolated from the remaining cells if required for maintenance. Some works may have two cones to a cell and some large works may have 4 cones per cell.

===Pure oxygen aeration===
Pure oxygen activated sludge aeration systems are sealed-tank reactor vessels with surface aerator type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen carbon liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen entrainment, or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), can be controlled by a weir adjusted level control, and a vent gas oxygen controlled oxygen feed valve. Oxygen is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, [[pressure swing adsorption]], or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.

== Recent developments ==
A new development of the activated sludge process is the [[Nereda]] process which produces a granular sludge that settles very well (the sludge volume index is reduced from 200-300 to 40 mL/g). A new process reactor system is created to take advantage of this quick settling sludge and is integrated into the aeration tank instead of having a separate unit outside.&lt;ref name="thesourcemagazine.org"&gt;http://www.thesourcemagazine.org/mark-van-loosdrecht-professor-at-delft-university-of-technology/&lt;/ref&gt; About 30 Nereda wastewater treatment plants worldwide are operational, under construction or under design, varying in size from 5,000 up to 858,000 person equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/15338-first-of-three-nereda-wastewater-treatment-plants-in-ireland-took-flow.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610185342/http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/15338-first-of-three-nereda-wastewater-treatment-plants-in-ireland-took-flow.html |archive-date=2016-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Davyhulme Laboratory - early 20th century.jpg|thumb|The [[Davyhulme#Davyhulme Sewage Works|Davyhulme Sewage Works Laboratory]], where the activated sludge process was developed in the early 20th century.]]
The activated sludge process was discovered in 1913 in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] by two engineers, Edward Ardern and W.T. Lockett,&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd | year=1967 | id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were conducting research for the Manchester Corporation Rivers Department at [[Davyhulme Sewage Works]]. This development led to arguably the single most significant improvement in [[public health]] and the [[Ecology#Physical environments|environment]] during the course of the century.

In 1912, Dr. [[Gilbert John Fowler|Gilbert Fowler]], a scientist at the [[University of Manchester]], observed experiments being conducted at the Lawrence Experiment Station at [[Massachusetts]] involving the aeration of sewage in a bottle that had been coated with algae. Fowler's engineering colleagues, Ardern and Lockett,&lt;ref name="Beychok"/&gt; experimented on treating sewage in a [[sequencing batch reactor|draw-and-fill reactor]], which produced a highly treated effluent. They aerated the waste-water continuously for about a month and were able to achieve a complete nitrification of the sample material. Believing that the sludge had been activated (in a similar manner to [[activated carbon]]) the process was named ''activated sludge''. Not until much later was it realized that what had actually occurred was a means to concentrate biological organisms, decoupling the liquid retention time (ideally, low, for a compact treatment system) from the solids retention time (ideally, fairly high, for an effluent low in BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ammonia.)

Their results were published in their seminal 1914 paper, and the first full-scale continuous-flow system was installed at [[Worcester]] two years later. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]] the new treatment method spread rapidly, especially to the USA, [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Canada]]. By the late 1930s, the activated sludge treatment became a well-known biological wastewater treatment process in those countries where [[sanitary sewer|sewer systems]] and [[sewage treatment plant]]s were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_v0WjdM6sLoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Culture of Flushing: A Social and Legal History of Sewage|author=Benidickson, Jamie|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acute radiation syndrome''' ('''ARS''') is a collection of health effects that are present within 24 hours of exposure to high [[absorbed dose|doses]] of [[ionizing radiation]]. It is also called '''radiation poisoning''', '''radiation sickness''' and '''radiation toxicity'''.

The onset and type of symptoms depend on the amount of radiation exposure, both in any one dose, and cumulative exposure. Relatively smaller doses result in [[gastrointestinal]] effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and symptoms related to falling blood counts, and predisposition to infection and bleeding. Relatively larger doses can result in neurological effects, including but not limited to seizures, tremors, lethargy, and rapid death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Treatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally supportive with [[blood transfusions]] and [[antibiotics]], with some extreme cases requiring more aggressive treatments, such as bone marrow transfusions.&lt;ref name="Review10" /&gt;

The radiation  causes [[Autophagy|cellular degradation]] due to damage to [[DNA]] and other key molecular structures within the cells in various tissues. This destruction, particularly because it affects the ability of cells to divide normally, in turn causes the symptoms. The symptoms can begin within one hour and may last for several months.&lt;ref name=Review10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Donnelly EH, Nemhauser JB, Smith JM |title=Acute radiation syndrome: assessment and management |journal=South.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Signs and symptoms of radiation poisoning}}
[[File:Radiation Sickness.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Radiation sickness]]
Classically acute radiation syndrome is divided into three main presentations: [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoietic]], [[gastrointestinal]], and [[neurological]]/[[vascular]]. These syndromes may or may not be preceded by a [[prodrome]].&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; The speed of onset of symptoms is related to radiation exposure, with greater doses resulting in a shorter delay in symptom onset.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; These presentations presume whole-body exposure and many of them are markers which are not valid if the entire body has not been exposed. Each syndrome requires that the tissue showing the syndrome itself be exposed. The hematopoietic syndrome requires exposure of the areas of bone marrow actively forming blood elements (i.e., the pelvis and sternum in adults). The neurovascular symptoms require exposure of the brain. The gastrointestinal syndrome is not seen if the stomach and intestines are not exposed to radiation. Some areas affected are:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

#Hematopoietic. This syndrome is marked by a drop in the number of [[blood cells]], called [[aplastic anemia]]. This may result in infections due to a low amount of [[white blood cells]], bleeding due to a lack of [[platelets]], and [[anemia]] due to too few [[red blood cells]] in the circulation.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; These changes can be detected by blood tests after receiving a whole-body acute dose as low as {{convert|0.25|Gy|rad|lk=on}}, though they might never be felt by the patient if the dose is below {{convert|1|Gy|rad}}. Conventional trauma and burns resulting from a bomb blast are complicated by the poor wound healing caused by hematopoietic syndrome, increasing mortality. 
#Gastrointestinal. This syndrome often follows absorbed doses of {{convert|6|-|30|Gy|rad}}.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; The signs and symptoms of this form of radiation injury include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], and [[abdominal pain]].&lt;ref name="Christensen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Christensen DM, Iddins CJ, Sugarman SL |title=Ionizing radiation injuries and illnesses|date=February 2014|journal=Emerg Med Clin North Am|volume=32|issue=1|pages=245–65|pmid=24275177|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2013.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole body exposures that are in the fatal range above {{convert|4|Gy|rad}}. Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplant, death with this dose is common.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; The death is generally more due to infection than gastrointestinal dysfunction.
#Neurovascular. This syndrome typically occurs at absorbed doses greater than {{convert|30|Gy|rad}}, though it may occur at {{convert|10|Gy|rad}}.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; It presents with neurological symptoms such as [[dizziness]], [[headache]], or [[decreased level of consciousness]], occurring within minutes to a few hours, and with an absence of vomiting. It is invariably fatal.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt;

The prodrome (early symptoms) of ARS typically includes [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[headache]]s, fatigue, [[fever]], and a short period of [[Erythema|skin reddening]].&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; These symptoms may occur at radiation doses as low as {{convert|0.35|Gy|rad}}. These symptoms are common to many illnesses, and may not, by themselves, indicate acute radiation sickness.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt;

===Whole-body absorbed dose effect===
{{Whole-body absorbed dose symptom}}

===Skin changes===
{{main|radiation burn}}

[[List of cutaneous conditions#Ionizing radiation-induced|Cutaneous radiation syndrome]] (CRS) refers to the skin symptoms of radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="arsphysicianfactsheet" /&gt; Within a few hours after irradiation, a transient and inconsistent [[erythema|redness]] (associated with [[itch]]ing) can occur. Then, a latent phase may occur and last from a few days up to several weeks, when intense reddening, [[blister]]ing, and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]] of the irradiated site are visible. In most cases, healing occurs by regenerative means; however, very large skin doses can cause permanent hair loss, damaged [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] and [[sweat gland]]s, [[atrophy]], [[fibrosis]] (mostly [[keloids]]), decreased or increased skin pigmentation, and ulceration or [[necrosis]] of the exposed tissue.&lt;ref name="arsphysicianfactsheet" /&gt; Notably, as seen at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], when skin is irradiated with high energy [[beta particles]], moist [[desquamation]] (peeling of skin) and similar early effects can heal, only to be followed by the collapse of the dermal vascular system after two months, resulting in the loss of the full thickness of the exposed skin.&lt;ref&gt;The medical handling of skin lesions following high level accidental irradiation, IAEA Advisory Group Meeting, September 1987 Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect had been demonstrated previously with pig skin using high energy beta sources at the Churchill Hospital Research Institute, in [[Oxford, England|Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Wells J |contribution=Non-Uniform Irrradiation of Skin: Criteria for limiting non-stochastic effects |title=Proceedings of the Third International Symposium of the Society for Radiological Protection |series=Advances in Theory and Practice |isbn=0-9508123-0-7 |volume=2 |pages=537–542 |year=1982 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
{{main|radiation-induced cancer}}
According to the [[linear no-threshold model]], any exposure to ionizing radiation, even at doses too low to produce any symptoms of radiation sickness, can induce cancer due to cellular and genetic damage. Under the assumption, survivors of acute radiation syndrome face an increased risk of developing cancer later in life. The probability of developing cancer is a linear function with respect to the [[effective radiation dose]]. In radiation-induced cancer, the speed at which the condition advances, the [[prognosis]], the degree of pain, and every other feature of the disease are not believed to be functions of the radiation dosage.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

However, [[Linear no-threshold model#Controversy|some studies]] contradict the linear no-threshold model. These studies indicate that some low levels of radiation do not increase cancer risk at all, and that there may exist a threshold dosage of ionizing radiation below which exposure should be considered safe. Nonetheless the 'no safe amount' assumption is the basis of US and most national regulatory policies regarding "man-made" sources of radiation.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Cause==
[[File:Death by haematopoietic syndrome of radiation sickness- influence of dose rate.png|thumb|300px|Both dose and dose rate contribute to the severity of acute radiation syndrome. The effects of [[dose fractionation]] or rest periods before repeated exposure, also shifts the [[LD50]] dose, upwards.]]
Radiation sickness is caused by exposure to a large dose of ionizing radiation (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy) over a short period of time. (&gt;&amp;nbsp;~0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h) This might be the result of a [[nuclear explosion]], a [[criticality accident]], a [[radiotherapy]] accident as in [[Therac-25]], a [[solar flare]] during interplanetary travel, misplacement of radioactive waste as in the 1987 [[Goiânia accident]], human error in a nuclear reactor, or other possibilities. Acute radiation sickness due to ingestion of radioactive material is possible, but rare; examples include the 1987 contamination of [[Leide das Neves Ferreira]] and the 2006 [[poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} &lt;!--People who don't belong here: There were other ARS cases in the Goiânia accident, but not from ingestion. Eben Byers died of radiation-induced cancer in 1932, but his dose rate was too low to cause acute radiation syndrome. Byers may have experienced [[chronic radiation syndrome]], but that would be OR.--&gt;

Alpha and beta radiation have low penetrating power and are unlikely to affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and beta radiation can only do so if [[radioactive contamination]] or [[nuclear fallout]] is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hands and measuring the time to onset of [[erythema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=William C.

===Spaceflight===
During spaceflight, particularly flights beyond [[low Earth orbit]], astronauts are exposed to both [[galactic cosmic ray|galactic cosmic radiation]] (GCR) and [[Solar proton event|solar particle event]] (SPE) radiation.  Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels which would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142 |title=Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts |publisher=New Scientist |date=21 March 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327023245/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142 |archivedate=27 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GCR levels which might lead to acute radiation poisoning are less well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Research Council (U.S.).

==Pathophysiology==
The most commonly used predictor of acute radiation symptoms is the whole-body [[absorbed dose]]. Several related quantities, such as the [[equivalent dose]], [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]], and [[committed dose]], are used to gauge long-term stochastic biological effects such as cancer incidence, but they are not designed to evaluate acute radiation syndrome.&lt;ref name="ICRP103"&gt;{{cite journa l|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection |journal=Annals of the ICRP |year=2007 |volume=37 |series=ICRP publication 103 |issue=2–4 |url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116084754/http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP+Publication+103 |archivedate=16 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help avoid confusion between these quantities, absorbed dose is measured in units of [[gray (unit)|grays]] (in [[SI]], unit symbol '''Gy''') or [[rad (unit)|rads]] (in [[CGS]]), while the others are measured in [[sievert (unit)|sieverts]] (in SI, unit symbol '''Sv''') or [[rem (unit)|rems]] (in CGS). 1&amp;nbsp;rad = 0.01&amp;nbsp;Gy and 1&amp;nbsp;rem = 0.01&amp;nbsp;Sv.&lt;ref name="remdefinition"&gt;{{cite work |title=The Effects of Nuclear Weapons |edition=Revised |publisher=US Department of Defense |year=1962 |page=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the acute exposure scenarios that lead to radiation sickness, the bulk of the radiation is external whole-body gamma, in which case the absorbed, equivalent and effective doses are all equal. There are exceptions, such as the [[Therac-25]] accidents and the 1958 [[Cecil Kelley criticality accident]], where the absorbed doses in Gy or rad are the only useful quantities.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Radiotherapy]] treatments are typically prescribed in terms of the local absorbed dose, which might be 60&amp;nbsp;Gy or higher. The dose is fractionated (about 2&amp;nbsp;Gy per day for curative treatment), which allows for the normal tissues to undergo [[DNA repair|repair]], allowing it to tolerate a higher dose than would otherwise be expected.  The dose to the targeted tissue mass must be averaged over the entire body mass, most of which receives negligible radiation, to arrive at a whole-body absorbed dose that can be compared to the table above.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===DNA damage===

High radiation doses can cause [[DNA]] damage.  If left unrepaired, this damage can create serious and even lethal chromosomal aberrations.  Ionizing radiation can produce [[reactive oxygen species]], which are very damaging to DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yu Y |author2=Cui Y |author3=Niedernhofer L |author4=Wang Y |title=Occurrence, biological consequences and human health relevance of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage |journal=Chemical Research in Toxicology |volume=29 |pages=2008–2039 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionizing radiation does direct damage to cells by causing localized ionization events, creating clusters of DNA damage.&lt;ref name="Eccles L. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eccles L. |author2=O’Neill P. |author3=Lomax M. |title=Delayed repair of radiation induced DNA damage: Friend or foe? |journal=Mutation Research |volume=711 |pages=134–141 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This damage includes loss of [[nucleobases]] and breakage of the sugar-phosphate backbone that binds to the nucleobases.  Breakages can happen to one or both of the backbone strands.  Single-stranded breakages are easier to repair than double-stranded breakages, because there is still an unbroken complementary strand to use as a template.  The DNA organization at the level of [[histones]], nucleosomes, and [[chromatin]] also affects its susceptibility to radiation damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lavelle C. |author2=Foray N. |title=Chromatin structure and radiation-induced DNA damage: From structural biology to radiobiology |journal=International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology |volume=49 |pages=84–97 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clustered damage, defined as at least two lesions within a helical turn, is especially harmful.&lt;ref name="Eccles L. 2011"/&gt; While DNA damage happens frequently and naturally in the cell from endogenous sources, clustered damage is a unique effect of radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodhead D. |title=Initial events in the cellular effects of ionizing radiations: Clustered damage in DNA |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=65 |pages=7–17 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clustered damage takes longer to repair than isolated breakages, and is less likely to be repaired at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Georgakilas A. |author2=Bennett P. |author3=Wilson D. |author4=Sutherland B. |title=Processing of bistranded abasic DNA clusters in gamma-irradiated human hematopoietic cells |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=32 |pages=5609–5620 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger radiation doses are more prone to cause tighter clustering of damage, and closely localized damage is increasingly less likely to be repaired.&lt;ref name="Eccles L. 2011"/&gt;

Somatic mutations cannot be passed down from parent to offspring, but these mutations can propagate in cell lines within an organism.  Radiation damage can also cause chromosome and chromatid aberrations, and their effect depends on what stage of the mitotic cycle the cell is currently in when the irradiation occurs. If the cell is in interphase, while it is still a single strand of chromatin, the damage will be replicated during the S1 phase of [[cell cycle]], and there will be a break on both chromosome arms.  Then the damage will be apparent in both daughter cells.  If the irradiation occurs after replication, only one arm will bear the damage. This damage will only be apparent in one daughter cell.  A damaged chromosome may cyclize, binding to another chromosome, or to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hall E. |author2=Giaccia A. |title=Radiobiology for the Radiobiologist |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |edition=Sixth |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically made based on a history of significant radiation exposure and suitable clinical findings.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; An [[Complete blood count|absolute lymphocyte count]] can give a rough estimate of radiation exposure.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; Time from exposure to vomiting can also give estimates of exposure levels if they are less than 1000&amp;nbsp;rad.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt;

==Prevention==
{{See also|Radiation protection}}

===Time===
The longer that humans are subjected to radiation the larger the dose will be. The advice in the [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] manual entitled "[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]" published by [[Cresson Kearny]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] was that if one needed to leave the shelter then this should be done as rapidly as possible to minimize exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H. |authorlink=Cresson Kearny |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |url=http://oism.org/nwss/ |year=1988 |publisher=Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine |isbn=0-942487-01-X |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017183044/http://www.oism.org/nwss/ |archivedate=2017-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 12, he states that "''[q]uickly putting or dumping wastes outside is not hazardous once fallout is no longer being deposited. For example, assume the shelter is in an area of heavy fallout and the dose rate outside is 400 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen (R)]] per hour, enough to give a potentially fatal dose in about an hour to a person exposed in the open. If a person needs to be exposed for only 10 seconds to dump a bucket, in this 1/360 of an hour he will receive a dose of only about 1 R. Under war conditions, an additional 1-R dose is of little concern.''" In peacetime, radiation workers are taught to work as quickly as possible when performing a task which exposes them to radiation. For instance, the recovery of a radioactive source should be done as quickly as possible.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Distance===
Increasing distance from the radiation source reduces the dose according to the [[inverse-square law]] for a point source.  Distance can sometimes be effectively increased by means as simple as handling a source with [[forceps]] rather than fingers. This could reduce [[erythema]] to the fingers, but the extra few centimeters distance from the body will give little protection from acute radiation syndrome.
{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Shielding===
Matter attenuates radiation in most cases, so placing any mass (e.g., lead, dirt, sandbags, vehicles) between humans and the source will reduce the radiation dose. This is not always the case, however; care should be taken when constructing shielding for a specific purpose. For example, although high atomic number materials are very effective in shielding [[photon]]s, using them to shield [[beta particle]]s may cause higher radiation exposure due to the production of [[bremsstrahlung]] x-rays, and hence low atomic number materials are recommended. Also, using material with a high [[neutron activation]] [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] to shield neutrons will result in the shielding material itself becoming radioactive and hence more dangerous than if it were not present.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are many types of shielding strategies which can be used to reduce the effects of radiation exposure. Internal contamination protective equipment such as respirators are used to prevent internal deposition as a result of inhalation and ingestion of radioactive material. Dermal protective equipment, which protects against external contamination, provides shielding to prevent radioactive material from being deposited on external structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.remm.nlm.gov/radiation_ppe.htm|title=Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in a Radiation Emergency - Radiation Emergency Medical Management|website=www.remm.nlm.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these protective measures do provide a barrier from radioactive material deposition, they do not shield from externally penetrating gamma radiation. This leaves anyone exposed to penetrating gamma rays at high risk of Acute Radiation Syndrome.

Naturally, shielding the entire body from high energy gamma radiation is optimal, but the required mass to provide adequate attenuation makes functional movement nearly impossible. In the event of a radiation catastrophe, medical and security personnel need [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile protection equipment]] in order to safely assist in containment, evacuation, and many other necessary public safety objectives.

Research has been done exploring the feasibility of partial body shielding, a radiation protection strategy which provides adequate attenuation to only the most radio-sensitive organs and tissues inside the body. Irreversible stem cell damage in the bone marrow is the first life-threatening effect of intense radiation exposure and therefore one of the most important bodily elements to protect.  Due to the regenerative property of [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s, it is only necessary to protect enough bone marrow to repopulate the exposed areas of the body with the shielded supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Gideon|last2=Kase|first2=Kenneth|last3=Orion|first3=Itzhak|last4=Broisman|first4=Andrey|last5=Milstein|first5=Oren|date=September 2017|title=Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/hp.0000000000000688|journal=Health Physics|volume=113|issue=3|pages=195–208|doi=10.1097/hp.0000000000000688|issn=0017-9078}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept allows for the development of  lightweight [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile radiation protection equipment]], which provides adequate protection, deferring the onset of Acute Radiation Syndrome to much higher exposure doses. One example of such equipment is the [[StemRad#Technology|360 gamma]], a radiation protection belt which applies selective shielding to protect the bone marrow stored in the pelvic area as well as other radio sensitive organs in the abdominal region without hindering functional mobility.

More information on bone marrow shielding can be found in the [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/pages/default.aspx Health Physics Radiation Safety Journal] article [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2017/09000/Selective_Shielding_of_Bone_Marrow___An_Approach.4.aspx Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation], or in the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] and the [[Nuclear Energy Agency|Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)]]'s 2015 report: [https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/docs/2014/crpph-r2014-5.pdf Occupational Radiation Protection in Severe Accident Management].

===Reduction of incorporation===
Where [[radioactive contamination]] is present, a [[gas mask]], dust mask, or good hygiene practices may offer protection, depending on the nature of the contaminant. [[Potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets can reduce the risk of cancer in some situations due to slower uptake of ambient radioiodine. Although this does not protect any organ other than the thyroid gland, their effectiveness is still highly dependent on the time of ingestion which would protect the gland for the duration of a twenty-four-hour period. They do not prevent acute radiation syndrome as they provide no shielding from other environmental radionuclides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiation and its Health Effects |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/rad-health-effects.html |publisher=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014200532/http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/rad-health-effects.html |archivedate=2013-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractionation of dose===
{{main|dose fractionation}}
If an intentional dose is broken up into a number of smaller doses, with time allowed for recovery between irradiations, the same total dose causes less [[cell death]]. Even without interruptions, a reduction in dose rate below 0.1&amp;nbsp;Gy/h also tends to reduce cell death.&lt;ref name=ICRP103 /&gt; This technique is routinely used in radiotherapy.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The human body contains many types of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and a human can be killed by the loss of a single type of cells in a vital organ. For many short term radiation deaths (3 days to 30 days), the loss of two important types of cells that are constantly being regenerated causes death. The loss of cells forming [[blood cells]] ([[bone marrow]]) and the cells in the digestive system ([[Intestinal villus|microvilli]] which form part of the wall of the [[intestines]]) is fatal.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Management==
[[File:Death by haematopoietic syndrome of radiation sickness- influence of medical care.png|thumb|300px|Effect of medical care on acute radiation syndrome]]
Treatment is supportive with the use of [[antibiotics]], [[blood products]], [[colony stimulating factors]], and [[stem cell transplant]] as clinically indicated.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt; Symptomatic measures may also be employed.&lt;ref name=Review10/&gt;

===Antimicrobials===
{{main|Treatment of infections after exposure to ionizing radiation}}

There is a direct relationship between the degree of the [[neutropenia]] that emerges after exposure to radiation and the increased risk of developing infection. Since there are no controlled studies of therapeutic intervention in humans, most of the current recommendations are based on animal research.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The [[Treatment of infections after accidental or hostile exposure to ionizing radiation|treatment]] of established or suspected infection following exposure to radiation (characterized by neutropenia and fever) is similar to the one used for other febrile neutropenic patients. However, important differences between the two conditions exist. Individuals that develop neutropenia after exposure to radiation are also susceptible to irradiation damage in other tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and central nervous system. These patients may require therapeutic interventions not needed in other types of neutropenic patients. The response of irradiated animals to antimicrobial therapy can be unpredictable, as was evident in experimental studies where [[metronidazole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jac/33.1.63 |vauthors=Brook I, Ledney GD |title=Effect of antimicrobial therapy on the gastrointestinal bacterial flora, infection and mortality in mice exposed to different doses of irradiation |journal=[[Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]] |issn=1460-2091 |volume=33 |pages=63–74 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pefloxacin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patchen ML, Brook I, Elliott TB, Jackson WE |title=Adverse effects of pefloxacin in irradiated C3H/HeN mice:  correction with glucan therapy |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |issn=0066-4804 |volume=37 |issue=9 |pages=1882–9 |year=1993 |pmid=8239601 |pmc=188087 |doi=10.1128/AAC.37.9.1882}}&lt;/ref&gt; therapies were detrimental.

Antimicrobials that reduce the number of the strict [[Anaerobic infection|anaerobic]] component of the gut flora (i.e., [[metronidazole]]) generally should not be given because they may enhance systemic infection by aerobic or facultative bacteria, thus facilitating mortality after irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09553008814551081 |vauthors=Brook I, Walker RI, MacVittie TJ |title=Effect of antimicrobial therapy on the bowel flora and bacterial infection in irradiated mice |journal=[[International Journal of Radiation Biology]] |issn=1362-3095 |volume=53 |pages=709–718 |year=1988 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An empirical regimen of antimicrobials should be chosen based on the pattern of bacterial susceptibility and nosocomial infections in the affected area and medical center and the degree of [[neutropenia]]. Broad-spectrum empirical therapy (see below for choices) with high doses of one or more antibiotics should be initiated at the onset of fever. These antimicrobials should be directed at the eradication of Gram-negative aerobic bacilli ( i.e., Enterobacteriace, Pseudomonas ) that account for more than three quarters of the isolates causing sepsis. Because aerobic and facultative Gram-positive bacteria (mostly alpha-hemolytic streptococci) cause [[sepsis]] in about a quarter of the victims, coverage for these organisms may also be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brook I, Ledney D |title=Quinolone therapy in the management of infection after irradiation |journal=[[Crit Rev Microbiol]] |year=1992 |pages=18235–18246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A standardized management plane of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria ([[quinolones]]: i.e., [[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]], a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., [[cefepime]], [[ceftazidime]], or an aminoglycoside: i.e. [[gentamicin]], [[amikacin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B97F0spKl2OwZTkzYTAyZjgtODRhYy00NzAwLWEzNjgtNTkyOTNmMjNlOGU4 |vauthors=Brook I, Elliot TB, Ledney GD, Shomaker MO, Knudson GB |title=Management of postirradiation infection: lessons learned from animal models |journal=[[Military Medicine (journal)|Military Medicine]] |issn=0026-4075 |year=2004 |volume=169 |pages=194–197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acute effects of ionizing radiation were first observed when [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed, though he misattributed them to ozone, a [[free radical]] produced in air by X-rays. Other free radicals produced within the body are now understood to be more important. His injuries healed later.

The [[Radium Girls]] were female factory workers who contracted [[radiation poisoning]] from painting watch dials with [[radioluminescence|self-luminous]] paint at the [[United States Radium Corporation|United States Radium]] factory in [[Orange, New Jersey]], around 1917.

Ingestion of radioactive materials caused many [[radiation-induced cancer]]s in the 1930s, but no one was exposed to high enough doses at high enough rates to bring on acute radiation syndrome. [[Marie Curie]] died of [[aplastic anemia]] caused by radiation, a possible early incident of acute radiation syndrome.

The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] resulted in high acute doses of radiation to a large number of Japanese, allowing for greater insight into its symptoms and dangers. Red Cross Hospital Surgeon Terufumi Sasaki led intensive research into the syndrome in the weeks and months following the Hiroshima bombings. Dr Sasaki and his team were able to monitor the effects of radiation in patients of varying proximities to the blast itself, leading to the establishment of three recorded stages of the syndrome. Within 25–30 days of the explosion, the Red Cross surgeon noticed a sharp drop in white blood cell count and established this drop, along with symptoms of fever, as prognostic standards for Acute Radiation Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carmichael |first=Ann G. |title=Medicine: A Treasury of Art and Literature |year=1991 |publisher=Harkavy Publishing Service|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-991-2 |page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Actress [[Midori Naka]], who was present during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was the first incident of radiation poisoning to be extensively studied. Her death on 24&amp;nbsp;August 1945, was the first death ever to be officially certified as a result of acute radiation syndrome (or "Atomic bomb disease").

===Notable incidents===
{{Main|Nuclear and radiation accidents|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}
There are two major databases that track radiation accidents: The American [[ORISE]] REAC/TS and the European [[IRSN]] ACCIRAD. REAC/TS shows 417 accidents occurring between 1944 and 2000, causing about 3000 cases of acute radiation syndrome, of which 127 were fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turai |first=István |author2=Veress, Katalin |title=Radiation Accidents: Occurrence, Types, Consequences, Medical Management, and the Lessons to be Learned |journal=Central European Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |url=http://www.omfi.hu/cejoem/Volume7/Vol7No1/CE01_1-01.html |accessdate=1 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515051324/http://www.omfi.hu/cejoem/Volume7/Vol7No1/CE01_1-01.html |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ACCIRAD lists 580 accidents with 180 ARS fatalities for an almost identical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chambrette |first=V. |author2=Hardy, S. |author3=Nenot, J.

The detailed accounting is difficult because of confounding factors. ARS may be accompanied by conventional injuries such as steam burns, or may occur in someone with a pre-existing condition undergoing radiotherapy. There may be multiple causes for death, and the contribution from radiation may be unclear. Some documents may incorrectly refer to radiation-induced cancers as radiation poisoning, or may count all overexposed individuals as survivors without mentioning if they had any symptoms of ARS. The table below attempts to catalog some cases of ARS. Many of these incidents involved additional fatalities from other causes, such as cancer, which are excluded from this table.

'''Amsterdam University College''' (AUC) is a public [[liberal arts college]] in the [[Netherlands]] with an enrolment of about 900 students from more than 60 countries.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; All teaching is in English.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). AUC Informational Sheet 2013-2015. Retrieved January 13, 2013 from [http://www.auc.nl/binaries/content/assets/projectsites/amsterdam-university-college/study-abroad/auc-information-sheet-2014-2015.pdf AUC.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The college was founded in 2009 as a joint initiative of the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[VU University Amsterdam]] with a particular focus on the natural sciences. Although AUC has its own campus, students can also use facilities of both parent universities. The college is part of a recent wave of [[University college#Netherlands|university colleges in the Netherlands]] which have introduced liberal arts education to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Redden, E. (2013). Liberal Arts Go Dutch. ''Inside Higher Ed''. Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/02/08/netherlands-growth-liberal-arts-colleges-has-influenced-higher-ed-sector-whole insidehighered.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

AUC offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in the social sciences and humanities and a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in science, which are pursued by about 50%, 15%, and 33% of the student body, respectively.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; The curriculum is strongly interdisciplinary; within each field, students have to pursue at least two disciplines. AUC further emphasizes its 'academic core', which makes up a large part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="core"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2012). Academic Core. Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.auc.nl/academic-programme/programme-structure/academic-core/academic-core.html auc.nl].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The foundation of AUC goes back to an initiative of the two large universities in Amsterdam, [[University of Amsterdam]] (UvA) and [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] (VU), as well as the municipality. It is part of an initiative to make Amsterdam a hub for research and development in the natural sciences{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

AUC was officially founded in 2008, and took up operation with its founding class in 2009. The first dean of the college is Prof. Dr. [[Marijk van der Wende]], Professor of Higher Education at the VU. The first class of graduates received their diplomas in 2012. In 2016, van der Wende was succeeded as AUC dean by Prof. [[Murray Pratt]].

==Academics==

===Reputation===
In the 2016 Keuzegids Universiteiten, AUC earned a designation as top-rated programme based on student ratings and evaluations by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2015, November 3). [http://www.auc.nl/news-events/auc-news/news-and-media/news-and-media/content/folder-5/11/auc-top-rated-programme-2016.html?page=2&amp;pageSize=20 AUC earns Top Rated Programme designation for 2016]. ''AUC.nl''. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 Nationale Studentenquête, AUC received a high rating of 4.3 out of 5, placing it among the best programmes at the University of Amsterdam and in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Nationale Studentenenquête. (n.d.). [https://www.studiekeuze123.nl/opleidingen/liberal-arts-and-sciences-joint-degree-universiteit-van-amsterdam-wo-bachelor Universiteit van Amsterdam: Liberal Arts and Sciences]. ''Studiekeuze123''. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at Amsterdam University College receive a joint degree from the University of Amsterdam and the VU University. The University of Amsterdam regularly ranks among the best 100 universities in the world (2015/16 [[QS World University Rankings]]: 56).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-amsterdam University of Amsterdam]. Topuniversities. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Academic programme===
AUC offers a three-year honours degree in three very broad majors in science, social sciences, and humanities. During the academic year 2013/14, students could choose between approximately 200 courses across eight fields in the sciences, nine in the social sciences, seven in the humanities, as well as the academic core.&lt;ref name="major"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). Your major. ''AUC.nl''. Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.auc.nl/academic-programme/programme-structure/your-major/your-major.html auc.nl].&lt;/ref&gt; As part of AUC's interdisciplinary orientation, students have to pursue 'tracks' in at least two fields within their major. Interdisciplinarity is also emphasized by AUC's themes, which link fields across majors.&lt;ref name="major" /&gt;

The college emphasizes a strong academic core, which includes academic writing and basic calculus or statistics, but also more unusual courses such as logic or 'identity and diversity', which are compulsory for students of all majors. Furthermore, students are required to take two to three language courses; in 2013/14, the languages offered were Arabic, Dutch, French, German, and Spanish.

AUC has branded itself as a 'science college', and places particular emphasis on the natural sciences. In 2013/14, courses were offered in eight 'tracks': information sciences, mathematics, physics, earth and environmental sciences, chemistry, biology, biomedical sciences, and health.  Although during the first years less than 35% of students were majoring in the sciences, this number is expected to rise to 50% in the future.&lt;ref name="qr2013"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). Quality Report 2012-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

While teachers for many core and introductory courses are employed by AUC directly, the college draws on its parent institutions for most of its lecturers.

Graduates receive a joint degree from the University of Amsterdam and VU University; a Bachelor of Arts in the social sciences or humanities or a Bachelor of Science in science. Students graduation with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher receive an honours degree. Cum laude degrees are awarded for graduation with a GPA of 3.5 or higher, and summa cum laude degrees for a 3.9 or higher.

====Study abroad====

Around a third of all students spend a semester abroad during their studies at AUC.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; The college has a number of partners on its own, but students can also apply to the exchange partners of UvA and VU on all continents.

===Admissions===
In 2010, AUC admitted 200 of about 900 applicants for its class of 2013. The maximum number of admissions per year is 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auc.nl/admissions-aid/policy-on-admissions/policy-on-admissions.html|title=AUC's policy on admissions|last=Amsterdam University College|first=|date=23 December 2016|website=AUC.nl|access-date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average grade of admitted students in the [[Grade (education)#Netherlands|Dutch system]] was 7.6, the highest of all Dutch university colleges that publish such information. Unusually for a European public university, AUC's application procedure includes an individual essay, motivation letter, and interview. In a country where access to most courses of study is unrestricted, this gives the college unusual freedoms to select its students. AUC in particular takes into account international experience.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). AUC's admission requirements.

==Tuition and scholarships==
As of the academic year of 2012/13, the tuition fee amounts to 3,901 Euro for Dutch and EU/[[European Economic Area|EEA]] students and 11,491 Euro for all other international students.&lt;ref name="feesandcosts"&gt;Amsterdam University College.

The AUC Scholarship Fund is supported by VU, UvA, and the [[Amsterdam University College Student Association]]; as well as a range of corporate sponsors. The latter include [[Rabobank]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Schiphol Group]], [[Akzo Nobel]], [[KLM]], and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].&lt;ref name="scholarship" /&gt;

==Accreditation==
The AUC programme is a fully accredited joint bachelor programme of the VU University Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The Dutch government allocates responsibility for accreditation to the NVAO (the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders). The AUC programme was accredited by the NVAO on 2 September 2008. Upon successful completion of the programme students receive a joint Bachelor honours degree from the VU University Amsterdam and University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the title Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc).

AUC has been awarded the "Distinctive feature of small-scale and intensive education" by the Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Council (NVAO), which is required from Dutch institutes of higher education for raising tuition fees beyond the national standard.&lt;ref name="feesandcosts" /&gt;

==Campus and location==
[[File:Amsterdam university college.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The AUC building at Amsterdam Science Park.]]
[[File:Amsterdam University College - level 2.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Inside the building.]]
AUC is a residential college with a campus in the Science Park. It is located in the borough of [[Amsterdam-Oost]], in what was formerly the borough of [[Watergraafsmeer]]. The campus houses an academic building, completed in 2012, and student residences managed by the student housing cooperation DUWO.

===Academic building===
AUC has a main academic building in [[Science Park Amsterdam]], where most classes are taught. In line with AUC's promise of small classes, the building does not have an auditorium; larger events take place in its common room area. Lecture rooms and study areas are spread over four levels, and teacher's rooms are notably located in areas accessible to students.&lt;ref name="dereuver"&gt;de Reuver, P. (2012). [http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/1424/STADSGEZICHTEN/article/detail/3319541/2012/09/20/Stadsgezichten-Amsterdam-University-College.dhtml Stadsgezichten: Amsterdam University College]. [[Het Parool]]. Retrieved September 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AUC academic building, opened in 2012, was designed by [[Mecanoo]] architects. Its exterior appearance is dominated by a façade of rust-coloured steel plates. The interior design received praise in the media for its "open character".&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt; The building won the 2013 Amsterdam Architecture Prize, for "the simplicity of its shape [and] its surprising interior. A variety of different types of space with a range of educational functions meet, connect and merge under one substantial roof, which is spectacular and yet unobtrusive."&lt;ref&gt;ARCAM. (2013). [http://www.arcam.nl/algemeen/770_nl.html Amsterdam University College Winnaar Gouden A.A.P. 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513180428/http://www.arcam.nl/algemeen/770_nl.html |date=May 13, 2013 }}. Retrieved April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of the academic building emphasises environmental sustainability. The roof is planted with grass, increasing insulation and acting as a water storeroom. In combination with a geothermal heat pump, this serves to minimise energy loss and consumption.&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt;

Before moving to its current location, for the first three years of its existence AUC had a temporary academic building in the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]] quarter, associated with the Roeterseiland location of the University of Amsterdam and opposite of the city's zoo, [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]].

===Student residences===

Students are required to maintain residence on campus for the whole duration of their studies. The student dorms are located on the Science Park campus in close proximity to AUC's academic building. The dorm buildings are administered by Dutch student housing specialist [[DUWO]].

===Science Park===
The Science Park Amsterdam was initiated in 1996 as the location for a cluster of university buildings, research institutes and businesses.&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt; Next to AUC, the area also houses the University of Amsterdam Faculty of Sciences and several research institutes for physics, computer science, and mathematics. With two [[colocation centre|colocations]] of the [[Amsterdam Internet Exchange]] at the institutes [[Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam|SARA]] and [[NIKHEF]], the Science Park Amsterdam is one of the major Internet hubs in Europe.

The [[Amsterdam Science Park railway station]] connects the area to [[Amsterdam Centraal|Amsterdam Central Station]] and [[Schiphol Airport]] in one direction and [[Almere]] in the other. A bus line connects the Science Park to [[Amsterdam Muiderpoort railway station|Muiderpoort]] and [[Amsterdam Amstel railway station|Amstel]] railway stations.

==Student life==

As a small residential college, AUC has a close-knit student community. Parts of campus life are organised by student committees, although many activities take place in an informal framework. In particular Dutch students of AUC also participate in student organisations off campus, including fraternities at the University of Amsterdam and the traditional student rowing clubs, [[Nereus Rowing Club|Nereus]] and [[Skøll]].

===Student body===

AUC annually admits 300 students, most of whom join for the fall semester; though spring admission is possible.&lt;ref name="300students"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2012). [https://archive.is/20130222153236/http://www.auc.nl/news-events/news-and-media/news-and-media/news-and-media/content/folder/08/auc-welcomes-class-of-2015.html AUC Welcomes Class of 2015]. AUC.nl. Retrieved December 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the year of 2013/14, enrollment was at about 750 students.

About 40% of student at Amsterdam University College come from abroad, roughly as many as come from the Netherlands (minority and foreign-educated Dutch students excluded). International students hail from more than 60 countries, though most are citizens of the European Union. In addition, in 2012/13, 12% of AUC students had a Dutch minority background. AUC has stated its aim to raise the minority population to 20% by means of scholarships and increased outreach to high schools.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013).

Retrieved September 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clubs and organisations===

Student activities at AUC are organised under the umbrella of the Amsterdam University College Student Association. The Student Association derives its budget from an annual membership fee collected via tuition payments. Funds are used to support independently run student committees. In 2013-14, there were 22 recognised student committees.&lt;ref&gt;AUCSA. (2012). [http://myauc.nl/committees/ Committees]. MyAUC. Retrieved December 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student politics===

Until the academic year 2012/13, students were represented by the elected five-member Student Council responsible for administrative matters, as well as three non-elected student members (alongside three faculty members) on the Board of Studies, with an advisory function on academic matters. As of 2012/13, Student Council and Board of Studies have undergone an experimental merger, forming a College Council with five representatives of student body and faculty each.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College.

'''Ashton Nichols''' is the current Walter E. Beach ’56 Distinguished Chair in Sustainable Studies and Professor of English Language and Literature at [[Dickinson College]]. His interests are in literature, contemporary [[ecocriticism]], [[Romanticism]], and [[nature writing]]. Nichols teaches courses in [[Romanticism]], 19th century literature, literature and the environment, and nature writing. He is especially well-known for his study of [[James Joyce]]'s literary concept of "epiphany" and his coinage of the phrase "urbanatural roosting," an idea which links urban with natural modes of existence and argues for ways of living more lightly on the earth, for inhabiting our planet the way birds do, by altering our environments without harming those same environments.

== Academic background ==

Nichols graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a B.A. with high honors in Philosophy in 1975. As an undergraduate, he received a four-year full academic scholarship as a DuPont Regional Scholar and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He was also selected for an Honors Program in philosophy, a program which allowed him to sit in on any class at the university and work individually with a separate tutor for each of three semesters: in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, and then to write an honors thesis in his final semester. On the advice of Cora Diamond,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cora Diamond]]&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[University College London]] in from 1973 to 1974 to study philosophy. He served as a staff reporter for the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] ''Free Lance-Star'', where he received awards from the [[Associated Press|AP]] and the Virginia Press Association, and as an editor for the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] before returning to the University of Virginia for an M.A. and later a Ph.D. in English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature. He spent time as a Visiting Researcher at [[Cambridge University]] with John Beer.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Beer]]&lt;/ref&gt; His Ph.D. dissertation, supervised by Robert Langbaum&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Langbaum]]&lt;/ref&gt; was entitled, “The Poetics of Epiphany: Nineteenth-Century Origins of the Modern Literary Moment.” It was later revised for publication with the same title, as his first book.

Nichols's time at Dickinson is punctuated by active membership on the President's Commission on Environmental Sustainability (PCES)--and before that, on the steering committee of the Center for Sustainability Education (CSE)--as a member of the Climate Change Curriculum Task Force, and a recipient of the Willoughby Institute Award for Teaching with Technology;&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703180319/http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he has also served on the Science Advisory Committee and the General Education Committee of the college. In 1994-95, he was a Visiting Lecturer at the [[University of East Anglia]] and Director of the Dickinson Programs in the Humanities and Sciences in [[Norwich]], U.K. He is a member of the selection committee for the Sam Rose '58 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/749/the_sam_rose_58_and_julie_walters_prize_at_dickinson_college_for_global_environmental_activism&lt;/ref&gt; a $100,000 a year award to a major environmentalist whose impact has been powerful and fully international. Recipients so far have included Bill McKibben&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill McKibben]]&lt;/ref&gt; (author and climate activist), Lisa P. Jackson&lt;ref&gt;[[Lisa P. Jackson]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Barack Obama's first EPA administrator), James Balog&lt;ref&gt;[[James Balog]]&lt;/ref&gt; (video and still photographer of melting glaciers and icecaps), Mark Ruffalo&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Ruffalo]]&lt;/ref&gt; (actor and river activist), Elizabeth Kolbert&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Kolbert]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Pulitzer Prize-winning environmental writer for ''The New Yorker'' and professor at Williams College), Brett Jenks&lt;ref&gt;[[Rare (conservation organization)|Rare]]&lt;/ref&gt; (CEO and president of conservation organization ''Rare''), and Our Children's Trust&lt;ref&gt;[[Our Children's Trust]]&lt;/ref&gt; the organization that supports 21 young people--aged 11-22--who have brought suit against the federal U. S. government, claiming that the climate of the earth is being damaged in ways that threaten the youths' rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness). In addition to his current joint appointment in the Environmental Studies and Sciences, as well as the English, departments, Nichols has also served terms as Chair of both of these departments. He has also been an Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Dickinson.

== Recognition ==

Nichols was awarded the Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching&lt;ref name="archives.dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dickinson.edu/lists-rosters/ganoe-award-inspirational-teaching |title=Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching &amp;#124; Dickinson College |publisher=Archives.dickinson.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1993-1994). Speaking to his ability to reach students, this award is given by members of the senior class prior to graduation. He has also won the Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching&lt;ref name="dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/programs/english/Faculty/ |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006135309/http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/programs/english/Faculty/ |archivedate=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1992-1993); selected by fellow faculty members, it recognizes superior educators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia. His most recent book, ''Beyond Romantic Ecocriticism: Toward Urbanatural Roosting''&lt;ref&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/beyondromanticecocriticism/AshtonNichols&lt;/ref&gt; has been widely praised, from ''Choice'': "Combining literary, anecdotal, and philosophical perspectives, this invaluable book crossbreeds political, spiritual, scientific, and aesthetic elements within the outworn dichotomy of town and country. Summing Up: Essential"&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson.edu"&gt;http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat/2011/07/20/new-york-times-review/&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''Sierra'' Club Magazine: "Both critically and artfully, Nichols explores how our conceptions of nature have derived from Enlightenment-era ideas (humans and nature are separate) and Romantic poetry (humans and nature are connected). Relying heavily on poetic examples, Nichols also envisions an 'urbanatural' future in which we see ourselves as part of the earth.";&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson.edu"/&gt; the book was released in paperback in 2012. Nichols is now at work on a follow-up to ''Urbanatural Roosting'', entitled ''Humanature: 21st-Century Challenges to ''Homo sapiens'' in a World of Plants and Animals''.

[[The Teaching Company]] selected Nichols as one of the approximately 100 professors chosen to video and audio tape (also download) as part of their ''Great Courses''&lt;ref&gt;[[The Great Courses]]&lt;/ref&gt; Program; he has so far produced 24 lectures on "Emerson, Thoreau and American Transcendentalism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Transcendentalism]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in ''Who's Who in America'' in 2000 and ''Who's in the World'' in 2002. In recent years, he has delivered keynote speeches and lectures in countries around the world: in England, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Portugal, France, Italy, Morocco, Cameroon, India, China, and Japan.

== Research ==

His ongoing writing and research includes a website that organizes and analyzes sources of eco-criticism and natural history to explore the definition of nature.&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat |title=Romantic Natural History &amp;#124; A survey of relationships between literary works &amp; natural history in the century before Charles Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'' (1859) |publisher=Blogs.dickinson.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarah Freierman, of ''The New York Times'', says of the project:

:''A Romantic Natural History, maintained by Dr. Ashton Nichols, a professor of English at Dickinson College, examines the way artists, writers and scientists viewed nature in the century before Charles Darwin published ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859. The timeline offers wonderful juxtapositions, like the publication of Jane Austen’s ”Sense and Sensibility” and the ”New Idea of the Anatomy of the Brain,” a paper by Charles Bell, in 1811; and the 1832 posthumous publication of ”Faust, Part II,” by Goethe, followed by an 1834 entry noting the invention of the first computer, an ”analytical engine” by Charles Babbage.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shelly Freierman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/21/technology/news-watch-views-of-nature-before-darwin-jumped-into-the-debate.html |title=NEWS WATCH; Views of Nature Before Darwin Jumped Into the Debate - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-09-21 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;''
  
The multidisciplinary application of Nichols' research has been praised not only by literary critics and environmentalists but also by urban planners and architects such as Charles Morris Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture#Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture]]&lt;/ref&gt; This link between "urbanature" and architecture is evident in urban design projects such as The Olympic Sculpture Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |title=Olympic Sculpture Park, Seattle Art Museum |publisher=World Buildings Directory |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217034444/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |archivedate=2014-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Seattle, WA and Project Phoenix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/327179/world-class-soccer-stadium-underway-in-haiti/ |title=World-Class Soccer Stadium Underway in Haiti |publisher=ArchDaily |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a soccer stadium in Haiti.

Most recently, Nichols has established a blog on [http://blogs.dickinson.edu/urbanaturalroosting/ urbanatural roosting], also accessible at this superscript&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/urbanaturalroosting/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site offers practical applications and descriptions of urbanatural roosting in cities ([[Boston]], [[New York City]], and [[Baltimore]], for example) as well as in natural areas (The [[Adirondacks]], [[Cape Cod]], the [[Chesapeake Bay]], and the like). These examples show how modern cities have naturalized themselves to produce sustainable forms of energy (sunlight electricity, wind energy, hydroelectric power), to grow food (greenroofs, greenwalls), and to increase the size of natural environment in urban spaces ([[Central Park]], [[Boston Common]], the [[Baltimore Inner Harbor]], etc.). Likewise, the site shows how human culture and urban ideas have helped to make natural spaces more livable: strict architectural regulations in the Adirondacks and in national and state parks, careful use of roads and trails throughout natural areas nationwide, and detailed rules for living with nonhuman species in wild and wilderness areas (hunting and trapping regulations, catch-and-release fishing streams, and strict protections for even the wildest species: rattlesnakes, wolves, and grizzly bears). In addition to other nature writing—currently for the [http://thoreaufarm.org/?s=ashton+nichols Thoreau Farm blog "The Roost"] in Concord, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;http://thoreaufarm.org/?s=ashton+nichols&lt;/ref&gt;—Nichols has also published poetry and short fiction.

== Personal ==

Nichols has been married since 1975 (to the calligrapher Kimberley Anne Smith), with whom he has four daughters (born 1979, 1981, 1982, 1984), three granddaughters and three grandsons.

'''Avanti''' was established by the [[UK]] [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] in 2002&lt;ref name="berr.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file37735.pdf DTI The Construction Research Programme, February 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227054835/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file37735.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to formulate an approach to collaborative working in order to enable [[construction]] [[project]] [[business partner|partners]] to work together effectively. The project was promoted by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.excitech.co.uk/DPJ/sublibrary.asp?vol=3&amp;iss=6 Design Productivity Journal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127013111/http://www.excitech.co.uk/DPJ/sublibrary.asp?vol=3&amp;iss=6 |date=November 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the support of most of the largest UK firms in the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/ceavanti/companies.jsp |title=Full list of collaborative companies |access-date=2008-02-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119051402/http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/ceavanti/companies.jsp |archive-date=2008-11-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Avanti also involved the [[buildingSMART|International Alliance for Interoperability]] (IAI), [[Loughborough University]] and Co-Construct, a network of five construction research and information organizations.

The Avanti programme aimed to help overcome problems caused by incomplete,
inaccurate and ambiguous information.&lt;ref name="RICS"&gt;[http://www.rics.org/NR/rdonlyres/B8DEFACA-CB65-43E7-8708-3308C2B7EE39/0/Construction_april06.pdf "An historical problem"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227054836/http://www.rics.org/NR/rdonlyres/B8DEFACA-CB65-43E7-8708-3308C2B7EE39/0/Construction_april06.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}, Construction Journal, [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]], April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Tavistock Institute]] report (1965) printed an extract from an [[RICS]] meeting of 1910 which stated "Architectural information is invariably inaccurate, ambiguous and incomplete".&lt;ref name="RICS" /&gt; By the 1940s, the impact of this was valued at an additional 10% to the construction cost. By 1994 the [[Latham Report]] ''Constructing the Team'' suggested waste in the industry accounted for 25-30% of project costs. This figure is supported by earlier publications from the [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) and the [[BSRIA|Building Services Research and Information Association]] (BSRIA), which led to reports in 1987 from the Coordinating Committee for Project Information (now [[Construction Project Information Committee|CPIC]]) that recommended a common format and disciplined approach to reduce the problem. These suggestions were proven on DTI-funded projects and case studies at Endeavour House at [[London Stansted Airport]] and the BAA [[Heathrow Express]], which showed that significant savings in project cost and drawing production could be made by addressing people and process issues.

==The problem and approach==
Most construction projects are complex and involve co-ordination between many project participants both on- and off-site. As projects have increased in size and complexity, the number of participants involved in a single project has also increased. To improve collaboration between participants, the industry needs tools that work well, appropriate processes to implement them, and the right approach from the people involved. Tackling these points was at the heart of the Avanti action research programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modbs.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/273/Moving_forward_with_collaborative_working.html Modern Building Services (MBS) Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its purpose was to support live construction project teams, as they collaborate to deliver projects, by helping them apply the appropriate technologies. It worked through a team of partners representing each stage of the project process, with the objective of improving project and business performance through the use of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) to support collaborative working. It set out to show the advantages of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems over conventional [[drawings]], with information managed as a [[database]] rather than a drawing cabinet, and aimed to demonstrate that [[3D Computer Aided Design]] systems could revolutionise projects, provided they were used for more than  [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualisation]].

To reduce the risks involved in adopting new working methods, Avanti brought together areas of current best practice (such as [[Construction Project Information Committee|CPIC]] [[Methodology|protocols]]) that had previously gained too little market penetration to have significant impact on the sector. The objective was to deliver improved project and business performance by using ICT to support collaborative working.

Avanti focused on early access to all project information by all partners, on early involvement of the [[supply chain]], and on sharing of information, drawings and schedules, in an agreed and consistent manner. The Avanti approach was supported by handbooks, toolkits and on-site mentoring and was reliant on advice and materials provided by CPIC.

Avanti mobilised existing technologies to improve business performance by increasing the quality of information and predictability of outcomes and by reducing risk and waste. The core of the Avanti approach to a project's whole life cycle was based on team-working and access to a common [[information model]]. All CAD information was generated with the same origin, orientation and scale, and organised in layers that could be shared. All layers and CAD model files were named consistently within a specific Avanti convention to allow others to find the relevant CAD data.

==Guidance and Phases==
Learning from early projects, Avanti produced practical working documentation and tested the methods on live projects. This information supplemented the CPIC document [[Construction Project Information Committee#Code_of_Procedure_for_the_Construction_Industry|Code of Procedure for the Construction Industry]] and addressed problems of incomplete, inaccurate and ambiguous information. Avanti guidance included:
* ''Standard Method and Procedure'' - advice on classification standards, spatial and technical co-ordination, example file and directory structures, and naming conventions.
* ''Design Management Principles'' - comprising typical design management processes, information management processes, guidance on detailed task management and typical responsibilities of delivery team leaders.

The advice also covers areas such as:
* a business case on the commercial imperatives for collaborative ICT 
* guidance on ensuring the software chain supported the design and supply chains 
* authoring information in a common data environment and controlling the sharing of information in a multi-author environment 

For most projects, using this guidance consisted of three phases:

* ''Phase 1'': Change the poor industry practice of producing information to individual standards and throwing it ‘over the wall’ to the next person in the supply chain who then reproduces their own information. Using an agreed standard for the project, spatially co-ordinated and high-quality 2D information will then be produced for the parties involved.
* ''Phase 2'': Implementation of those same principles to generate 3D project models to produce 2D drawings and material measurement.
* ''Phase 3'': Full implementation of 3D object-oriented and [[Building information modeling|Building information modelling]] systems. Each live project captures the lessons learned and the benefits gained.

==Further development==
In July 2006, the Avanti DTI Project documentation and brand ownership was transferred to [[Constructing Excellence]]. Since the handover, Constructing Excellence endeavoured to promote the savings demonstrated on live projects. Further work was also carried out to make Avanti part of the update of [[BS 1192]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030163398 British Standards, BS 1192:2007 Collaborative production of architectural, engineering and construction information. Code of practice]&lt;/ref&gt; The BS 5555 committee coded the methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000000294037  BS 5555]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Evaluation of the impacts of the Avanti project  showed: &lt;ref name="berr.gov.uk"/&gt;
* Early commitment offering up to 80% saving on implementation cost on medium size project.
* 50-85% saving on effort spent receiving information and formatting for reuse.
* 60-80% saving on effort spent finding information and documents.
* 75–80% saving in effort to achieve design co-ordination.
* 50% saving on time spent to assess tenders and award sub-contracts.
* 50% saving on effort in sub-contractor design approval.

==The future==
Constructing Excellence is developing a self-sustaining business to support roll out of the Avanti methodology to the UK construction industry. It will also draw on the results of other DTI-supported collaborative research such as ''Building Down Barriers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B935410C-ACA9-4F1E-B4BC-FCF91D202B93/0/supplychainhandbook.pdf Building Down Barriers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312071152/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B935410C-ACA9-4F1E-B4BC-FCF91D202B93/0/supplychainhandbook.pdf |date=March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110620">'''Bahá'í studies''' refers to the scholarly study of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], its [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], [[History of the Bahá'í Faith|history]] and [[Bahá'í literature|literature]].  Bahá'í studies are currently conducted in a variety of venues, including institutes of the [[Bahá'í administration]] as well as non-affiliated universities.  Some scholars study some aspect of the Bahá'í Faith as part of research on related matters while others engage in Bahá'í studies as a primary focus of their research. Scholars' comments on the religion and its predecessor [[Bábism]] date back to the at least 1845, the year after its founding. Initially they were often [[Orientalism|Orientalist]]s or [[Christian missionaries]] but through time both Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'í researchers have addressed the religion especially in tune with the [[Growth of religion#Bahá'í Faith|growth of the religion]], which has been called significant.

While there were previous Iran or near-Iranian sources of scholarship of the religion in early periods, wide-ranging publications covering mostly western literature include Moojan Momens' 1981 '''The Babi and Baha'i Religions, 1844–1944: Some Contemporary Western Accounts''',&lt;ref name="Momen1981" /&gt; William Collins' 1992 '''Bibliography of English-language works on the Bábí and Bahá'í faiths, 1844–1985''',&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite book|author=William P.

Mostly these works explicitly ignored newspaper accounts.

===19th century===

A wide variety of accounts, encounters and investigations began to circulate outside of Persia as events began to unfold from the Spring of 1844 with the [[Declaration of the Báb]]. Initially viewed as an Iranian development and often through Christian missionary perspectives, the [[growth of religion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Johnson| first =Todd M. |author2=Brian J.

==Bahá'í review==
{{main|Bahá'í review}}
Bahá'í scholars who are also members of the faith must submit their work for [[Bahá'í review|review]] by the [[Bahá'í administration]] and obtain prior approval. According to the administration of the religion, the purpose of the review is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=101|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance.html&amp;chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To ensure the accuracy of the presentation of the teachings of the religion
* To protect the religion from misrepresentation by its own followers
* To ensure dignity of the form

[[Juan Cole]], a former Bahá'í who had disagreements with the Bahá'í administration on account of the [[Bahá'í review|review]] describes it as "a system of in-house censorship" which "has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink = Juan Cole | last2= |first2= |date= June 1998 |title= The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 | url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal= The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |publisher= |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages= |doi= |access-date= September 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several conflicts originating from the practice of review, and a number of prominent academics, including [[Juan Cole]], [[Denis MacEoin]] and [[Abbas Amanat]], have either been excommunicated or forced to resign due to academic disagreements with the religious hierarchy.  Denis MacEoin has said that the review has stifled research in Bahá'í studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= MacEoin |first= Denis| authorlink = Denis MacEoin| last2= |first2= |date= 1990 |title= The crisis in Babi and Baha'i studies: part of a wider crisis in academic freedom? |url= http://fglaysher.com/bahaicensorship/archives/Denis%20MacEoin,%20Crisis%20in%20Babi%20and%20Baha'i%20Studies.pdf |journal= British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies |publisher= |volume= 17 |issue= 1 |pages= 55–61|doi=10.1080/13530199008705506 |access-date= September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moojan Momen, another academic in the field of Bahá'í Studies who has labeled Juan Cole and Denis MacEoin "apostates," disagrees and states that "there is no more 'censorship' involved in this process than with any other academic journal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Marginality and Apostasy in the Bahá'í Community | url= http://bahai-library.com/momen_marginality_apostasy| first = Moojan | last= Momen | journal="Religion" | pages = 187–209 | year = 2007 | number = 37:3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4913">[[File:Singapadu Bali Pura-Puseh-Desa-03.jpg|thumb|right|A representation of a Bhoma head guarding the top of the portal to a Balinese temple in Singapadu.]]
In a [[Balinese temple|Balinese temple architecture]],  a '''Bhoma''' is a carved or formed [[Chimera (architecture)|grotesque]] which decorates certain parts in the Balinese temple complex. The statue is similar to the Javanese [[Batara Kala|Kala]], and was intended to protect the temple complex from malevolent spirit.

==Mythology==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zilveren broche voorstellende een Bhoma monsterkop TMnr 2252-6.jpg|thumb|left|The bhoma in a silver brooch.]]
In Balinese mythology, Bhoma is the son of [[Vishnu|Dewa Wisnu]] and [[Prithvi|Dewi Pertiwi]], the god of rain and the goddess of earth. One day, when Wisnu was digging the earth in the form of [[Varaha]], his avatar in the form of a wild boar, he encountered a beautiful earth goddess named Dewi Pertiwi. The encounter leads to a union between Wisnu and Pertiwi, which produce a terrifying son named Bhoma. 

The story of Wisnu as a wild boar digging up to the bottom of the earth to meet Pertiwi symbolizes torrents of stormy rainwater entering the earth. The figure of Bhoma that was produced by this union is seen as the growth of vegetation or forest ([[Vanaspati]]) as a result of the earth receiving the (rain) water. In Javanese and Balinese culture, Vanaspati is the king of the plant, not different with the European [[Green Man]]. The word Bhoma came from the Sanskrit word ''bhaumá'', which means something that grows or is born from earth or something related to the earth.  

==Architecture==
[[File:Balinese temple pillar.jpg|thumb|left|In the [[Padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]], the central shrine of a Balinese temple complex, the Bhoma head is carved at the bottom of Padmasana shrine to symbolize the forest which surrounds the base of a mountain.]] 
Bhoma is basically the Balinese [[kirtimukha]]. In Balinese temple architecture, Bhoma has the same function as the Javanese [[Batara Kala|Kala]] which act as a guardian spirit of the temple complex. The head of Bhoma can be found carved at the temple gate which marks the entrance to the holiest part of the shrine ([[paduraksa]]) and at the base of the padmasana, the holiest and most central shrine in the Balinese temple.

The [[Padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]] is the holiest shrine in a Balinese temple complex. The padmasana is attributed to the Supreme God, the [[Acintya|Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa]]). Like many religious constructions in Indonesia, the shrine padmasana is divided into three sections, from the base to the top, the ''bhur'' (world of demons), ''bhuwah'' (world of men), and ''swah'' (world of gods). The head figure of Bhoma normally added the base of the padmasana, together with other monstrous figures e.g. the Bedawang Nala, the world-supporting turtle, and the two snakes, Anantaboga, and Basuki, a symbol of man's earthly needs. In this context, the head of Bhoma at the base of the padmasana symbolizes the forest which surrounds the foot of a mountain (''batur pepalihan'').{{sfn|Eiseman|2011}} 

In some Balinese houses, the doorway to some enclosed pavilion (e.g. the ''[[Balinese traditional house|bale meten]]'') is decorated with ornaments to form ventilation grill which is sometimes paneled. This is usually topped with a decorative frieze, which is sometimes carved in the form of the Bhoma's head.{{sfn|Davison|Granquist|2012}}

The head of Bhoma is also seen in the [[Ngaben|Balinese cremation towers]].{{sfn|Slattum|2003|pp=100-1}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">In video technology, '''blanking level''' is the level of the [[composite video signal]] during the front and back porches of the video signal.

The composite video signal is actually the video information superimposed on blanking. The total level of the composite video signal (blanking + video) is 1000 mV.  This level can also be given in [[IRE (unit)|IRE]] units such that the level difference reserved for video information is 100 IRE units. So white corresponds to 100 IRE units and blanking level corresponds to 0 IRE units. The level of black is 0 IRE units in the case of [[CCIR System B]] and [[CCIR System G]] (European systems) and 7.5 IRE units in the case of [[CCIR System M]] (American system).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolumbus.fi/pami1/video/pal_ntsc.html Kolumbus page]&lt;/ref&gt; So, while there is no difference between the black and the blanking levels in most systems they differ by 50 mV. in system M. (When defined in terms of voltage difference, 7.5 IRE units is almost equal to 50 mV.)

A 2006 ''[[Shanghai Daily]]'' news report stated that Chinese scientists would begin naming 46 newly surveyed, anonymous Antarctic islands and that the CAA, with its teammate [[Sina.com]], would collect candidate names.&lt;ref name="ChinaEntersIceAge"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/eyeonasia/archives/2006/04/china_enters_the_ice_age.html|title=China enters the Ice Age|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|date=2006-04-03|work=[[Business Week]]|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 through 2009, the CAA organized a government sponsored research project to enhance its understanding of the legal, military and political issues associated with the Arctic. The agency also operates a winter training base at [[Yabuli Ski Resort]] in the northern province of [[Heilongjiang]].&lt;ref name="BriefIntroduction"/&gt;

The [[International Polar Year]] 2007-2008 China Programme included a partnership between the [[International Polar Foundation]], the CCA, and the [[Polar Research Institute of China]]. This included the participation of Jean de Pomereu, reporter and photographer, in the 25th CHINARE Expedition late in the year in 2008.

'''Cladh Hallan''' ({{lang-gd|Cladh Hàlainn}}, {{IPA-gd|kʰl̪ˠɤɣ ˈhaːl̪ˠɪɲ}}) is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site on the island of [[South Uist]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]]  in [[Scotland]]. It is significant as the only place in [[Great Britain]] where [[prehistoric]] [[mummy|mummies]] have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/archaeology/excavations_techniques/mummies_cladhhallan_01.shtml "Mummification in Bronze Age Britain"] [[BBC History]]. Retrieved 11 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Excavations were carried out there between 1988 and 2002, indicating the site was occupied from 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/cladh-hallan "The Prehistoric Village at Cladh Hallan"]. [[University of Sheffield]]. Retrieved 21 Feb 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cladh-Hallan Man.svg|thumb|upright|left|Composition of the male mummy:&lt;br/&gt;blue: male c. 1600 BC&lt;br/&gt;yellow: male c. 1500-1400 BC&lt;br/&gt;red: male c. 1440-1360 BC]]
In 2001, a team of [[archaeologist]]s found four [[skeleton]]s at the site, one of them a male who had died c. 1600 BC, and another a female who had died c. 1300 BC. (about the same time as King [[Tutankhamun]] of [[Egypt]]). At first the researchers did not realise they were dealing with mummies, since the [[soft tissue]] had decomposed and the skeletons had been [[burial|buried]]. But tests revealed that both bodies had not been buried until about 1120 BC, and that the bodies had been preserved shortly after death in a peat [[bog]] for 6 to 18 months. The preserved bodies were then apparently retrieved from the bog and set up inside a dwelling, presumably having religious significance. Archaeologists do not know why the bodies were buried centuries later. The Cladh Hallan skeletons differ from most [[bog body|bog bodies]] in two respects: unlike most bog bodies, they appear to have been put in the bog for the express purpose of preservation (whereas most bog bodies were simply interred in the bog), and unlike most bog bodies, their soft tissue was no longer preserved at the time of discovery.

== Analysis ==
{{update section|date=January 2017}}
The skeletons and other finds are being analysed in laboratories in Scotland, [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Following the provisions of the Treasure Trove Act, all the finds from Cladh Hallan, including the skeletons, will be allocated to a [[Scottish museum]] after the lengthy process of analysis and reporting is completed. According to recent anthropological and [[DNA]]-analysis the skeletons of a female and a male were compiled from body parts of at least 6 different human individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kaufman | first = Rachel  | authorlink = | title = "Frankenstein" Bog Mummies Discovered in Scotland; Two ancient bodies made from six people, new study reveals | work = National Geographic | publisher = | date = 2012-07-06 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120706-bog-mummies-body-parts-frankenstein-ancient-science/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage}}
[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration]]
A '''conservator-restorer''' is a professional responsible for the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation of artistic and cultural artifacts]], also known as [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation#.WSymX8m1tPs About Conservation: What is conservation? What is a conservator?]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects.&lt;ref name="Defining2003"&gt;Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies. (2003). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning [[collections care]] or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research.&lt;ref name="Careers2014"&gt;Careers in Conservation. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VPPIxMaLTwN.&lt;/ref&gt;  A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the [[public]].&lt;ref name="Neuman2011"&gt;Neuman, R. (2011). MFA Highlights: Conservation and Care of Museum Collections. Boston, MA: Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation and restoration ==
Essentially, the term "conservation" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object.&lt;ref name="Landry2000"&gt;Landry, G. (2000). The Wintertbur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. Winterthur, Delaware, DE: Winterthur Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "restoration" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt; "Restoration" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term "conservation".&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;  Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.

== Responsibilities and duties ==
Conservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], [[art]], and specimens.&lt;ref name="Baker2015"&gt;Baker, G. D. (2015). How to Become a Museum Conservator. Retrieved from http://collegemouse.com/jobs/how-to-become-a-museum-conservator.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examining artifacts, both visually and using scientific tools such as x-rays, infrared photography and microscopic analysis to determine the extent and causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013"&gt;Johnston, L. (2013). Museum/gallery conservator job description. Retrieved from http://www.prospects.ac.uk/museum_gallery_conservator_job_description.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation science (sometimes called museum science) aids every aspect of a museum’s mission to study its collections, both inside and out of the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Maintaining full conservation records by documenting the condition of an object or site, including any previous restoration work and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Documentation ensures the careful recording of treatment procedures and materials so there can be no misunderstanding in the future about what is part of the original work of art and what has been added or altered by the conservator&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Producing a visual record of the object for identification purposes and to illustrate its condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The examination of the object, treatment proposal, and the actual treatment is documented with written reports and photographs&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Monitoring and recording display and storage conditions with the aim of keeping objects in a stable condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Preservation is the ultimate goal of conservation.  By taking into account the possible day-to-day stresses caused by an object’s environment, museum conservators do their best to preserve art for generations to come.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Proposing and estimating the costs of treatments to halt decay and stabilize an artifact.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservators, present a proposal for work to be done as well as a report on the completion of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Although conservators cannot exactly recapture the original appearance, they are able to make highly educated decisions about how to restore an object if they identify the materials from which it was made and fully understand their properties.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Organizing the logistics of long-term projects and collaborating with other conservators.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  This collaboration can take place when items are on loan or when outside help is needed for complex conservation projects.
* Working out creative solutions to clean, support and repair sensitive objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Ultimately, just as every object is unique, every conservation decision must be considered on its own and on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Developing and maintaining appropriate standards within the specialist area.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Critical information can be lost and an object permanently damaged when things are cared for without basic guidelines and information.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Keeping up to date with the latest conservation techniques and practices, through research and training.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservation is a young profession, which means it continues to evolve over time and conservators must be able to keep up to date with the latest trends.
* Advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials .  Museum conservators strive to maintain the integrity of each work of art throughout its life, whenever it is handled, stored, displayed, or shipped to other locations for exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Direct and supervise curatorial, technical, and student staff in the handling, mounting, care, and storage of art objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Other museum departments look to conservators and restorers for direction on safety procedures when it comes to objects in the museum's collection.
* Recommend preservation procedures, such as control of temperature and humidity, to curatorial and building staff.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The most important step you can take to ensure the preservation of any collection is to create a safe display and storage environment that will not cause further deterioration of the objects.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;

== Knowledge and skills ==
* Working knowledge of the vocabulary of conservation and scientific methodology in order to effectively examine an object, assess its state, understand its history, and articulate its needs.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Must have a firm grasp of philosophical precepts expressed in the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice in order to formulate a treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;  The conservator must understand that it’s important to respect the integrity of the object and that his or her actions should not jeopardize the long-term preservation of the object.
* Understanding and appreciation of the aesthetic, cultural, economic, historical, political, religious, scientific, and social values of objects, buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;  This understanding and appreciation are critically important when devising preservation and conservation plans, strategies, and treatments.
* Working knowledge of how materials constituting cultural heritage were acquired, modified, processed, or manufactured and how craft or manufacturing techniques and processes have evolved through time.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Possess knowledge of the chemical and physical properties and long-term behavior of a wide range of materials and whether these materials were used in the original fabrication of an object or in its subsequent treatment and preservation.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Must be aware of issues that arise from the ways that culturally significant materials will be accessed or used by society.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Knowledge of the context in which cultural heritage is used, as context may be critically important to understanding its condition, formulating appropriate treatment and recommending future care.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Knowledgeable about safety in the workplace and must carry out his or her practice in compliance with federal, state, and logical regulations.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Working knowledge of scientific principles as they apply to conservation, including how to access and use scientific literature and how to assess the validity of published research in conservation and allied fields.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Ability to recognize and understand the changes that occur in cultural heritage over time and be able to distinguish the cause of the changes (natural, chemical, physical, biological, or by human influence).&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Versed in the many ways in which light, relative humidity, temperature, and pollutants can influence the long-term preservation of cultural heritage and must be familiar with techniques, equipment, and resources that can assist in managing these important environmental factors&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Ability to conduct a safe, thorough examination of cultural materials in order to gather relevant information about their condition and to formulate an appropriate plan for preservation and treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Know which tools and techniques are appropriate, how extensive the examination should be, and how or whether to perform external, intrusive, and occasionally destructive sampling.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Understand the purposes of documentation and must be knowledgeable and proficient in appropriate methods of written and pictorial documentation as well as in the maintenance and preservation of the body of information produced during examination and treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Awareness of various treatment methods available as well as their effects on different types of cultural heritage, based on an understanding of condition, natural use, cultural, historic, and scientific significance, and, if applicable, the artist’s or maker’s intent.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;

== Education and training ==

=== Undergraduate and graduate education ===
Conservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites.  This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservation-related programs are described on the websites of the AIC,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/jobs/become-a-conservator#.WSycysm1tPt Careers in Conservation: Become a Conservator]".

Society of American Archivists (SAA). www.archivists.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-graduate fellowships ===
Post-graduate fellowships have also been cited as valuable experiences in their professional development.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  These fellowships provide intensive research, practice, and exposure to diverse professional staff or significant collections.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  A few institutions that offer fellowships include the [[Getty Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/gradinterns/ Graduate Internships]".

Harvard Art Museums. www.harvardartmuseums.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued professional development ===
The specialty of conservation is ever-changing and evolving, which means that practicing conservators must stay up-to-date of advances in technology and methodology.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservators usually expand their knowledge through reading publications, attending professional meetings, and enrolling in short-term workshops or courses.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt; AIC offers many workshops, conferences, and online courses and tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/courses#.WSykcMm1tPt Professional Development Courses in Conservation Education]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation OnLine (CoOL) also offers resources for conservation professionals.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cool.conservation-us.org/ Welcome to CoOL]". Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of specialty ==
Some conservators specialize in a particular material or group of objects, such as archaeology, ceramics and glass, furniture and wood, gilding and decorative surfaces, historic interiors, metals, paintings, paper and books, photographic materials, stained glass, stone and wall paintings, textiles, sculptures, and architecture.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;

== Ethics ==
The primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property.  In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property.  An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.VPPM0saLTwM Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practive]" (2015). American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;  Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration.  Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;

A '''contig''' (from ''contiguous'') is a set of overlapping DNA segments that together represent a [[Consensus sequence|consensus region of DNA]].&lt;ref name="contig assembly"&gt;Gregory, S. ''Contig Assembly''.  Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Shotgun sequencing#Whole genome shotgun sequencing|bottom-up sequencing]] projects, a contig refers to overlapping sequence data (reads);&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Greg |last2=Muse |first2=Spencer V. |title=A Primer of Genome Science |edition=3rd |page=84 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-878-93236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shotgun sequencing#Hierarchical Shotgun sequencing|top-down sequencing]] projects, contig refers to the overlapping clones that form a [[Gene mapping#Physical Mapping|physical map]] of the genome that is used to guide sequencing and [[Sequence assembly|assembly]].&lt;ref name="genome map"&gt;Dear, P. H.  ''Genome Mapping''.  Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, 2005. {{doi|10.1038/npg.els.0005353}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contigs can thus refer both to overlapping DNA sequence and to overlapping physical segments (fragments) contained in clones depending on the context.

==Original definition of contig==

In 1980, Staden &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staden|first1=R|title=A new computer method for the storage and manipulation of DNA gel reading data|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1980|volume=8|issue=16|pages=3673–3694|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC324183/pdf/nar00433-0185.pdf|accessdate=June 7, 2017|doi=10.1093/nar/8.16.3673|pmc=324183|pmid=7433103}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: ''In order to make it easier to talk about our data gained by the shotgun method of sequencing we have invented the word "contig". A contig is a set of gel readings that are related to one another by overlap of their sequences. All gel readings belong to one and only one contig, and each contig contains at least one gel reading. The gel readings in a contig can be summed to form a contiguous consensus sequence and the length of this sequence is the length of the contig.''

==Sequence contigs==

A sequence contig is a continuous (not contiguous) sequence resulting from the reassembly of the small DNA fragments generated by [[Shotgun sequencing|bottom-up sequencing]] strategies. This meaning of contig is consistent with the original definition by [[Rodger Staden]] (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Staden R |year=1979 |title=A strategy of DNA sequencing employing computer programs |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume= 6|pages=2601–2610 |pmc=327874 |pmid=461197 |doi=10.1093/nar/6.7.2601}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom-up [[DNA sequencing]] strategy involves shearing genomic DNA into many small fragments ("bottom"), sequencing these fragments, reassembling them back into contigs and eventually the entire genome ("up"). Because current technology allows for the direct sequencing of only relatively short DNA fragments (300–1000 nucleotides), genomic DNA must be fragmented into small pieces prior to sequencing.&lt;ref name="genome sequencing"&gt;Dunham, I.  ''Genome Sequencing''. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In bottom-up sequencing projects, [[Polymerase chain reaction|amplified]] DNA is sheared randomly into fragments appropriately sized for sequencing. The subsequent sequence reads, which are the data that contain the sequences of the small fragments, are put into a database. The [[Genome project#Assembly software|assembly software]]&lt;ref name="genome sequencing" /&gt; then searches this database for pairs of overlapping reads. Assembling the reads from such a pair (including, of course, only one copy of the identical sequence) produces a longer contiguous read (contig) of sequenced DNA. By repeating this process many times, at first with the initial short pairs of reads but then using increasingly longer pairs that are the result of previous assembly, the DNA sequence of an entire chromosome can be determined.

Today, it is common to use [[DNA sequencing theory#Pairwise end-sequencing|paired-end sequencing]] technology where both ends of ''consistently sized'' longer DNA fragments are sequenced. Here, a contig still refers to any contiguous stretch of sequence data created by read overlap.  Because the fragments are of known length, the distance between the two end reads from each fragment is known.&lt;ref name="pet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fullwood MJ, Wei C, Liu ET |title=Next-generation DNA sequencing of paired-end tags (PET) for transcriptome and genome analyses |journal=Genome Research |year=2009 |volume=19 |pages=521–532 |doi=10.1101/gr.074906.107 |pmid=19339662 |issue=4|display-authors=etal|pmc=3807531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives additional information about the orientation of contigs constructed from these reads and allows for their assembly into '''scaffolds'''. [[File:PET contig scaffold.png|thumb|Overlapping reads from paired-end sequencing form contigs; contigs and gaps of known length form scaffolds.]] Scaffolds consist of overlapping contigs separated by gaps of known length. The new constraints placed on the orientation of the contigs allows for the placement of highly repeated sequences in the genome. If one end read has a repetitive sequence, as long as its [[mate pair]] is located within a contig, its placement is known.&lt;ref name="pet" /&gt; The remaining gaps between the contigs in the scaffolds can then be sequenced by a variety of methods, including PCR amplification followed by sequencing (for smaller gaps) and [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|BAC]] cloning methods followed by sequencing for larger gaps.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt;

==BAC contigs==
Contig can also refer to the overlapping [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|clones]] that form a [[Gene mapping#Physical Mapping|physical map]] of a chromosome when the '''top-down''' or '''[[Shotgun sequencing#Hierarchical Shotgun sequencing|hierarchical]]''' sequencing strategy is used.&lt;ref name="contig assembly" /&gt;  In this sequencing method, a low-resolution [[Gene mapping#Physical Mapping|map]] is made prior to sequencing in order to provide a framework to guide the later assembly of the sequence reads of the genome. This map identifies the relative positions and overlap of the clones used for sequencing.  Sets of overlapping clones that form a contiguous stretch of DNA are called contigs; the minimum number of clones that form a contig that covers the entire chromosome comprise the tiling path that is used for sequencing. Once a tiling path has been selected, its component BACs are sheared into smaller fragments and sequenced. Contigs therefore provide the framework for hierarchical sequencing.&lt;ref name="genome map" /&gt;
The assembly of a contig map involves several steps.  First, DNA is sheared into larger (50–200kb) pieces, which are cloned into BACs or [[P1-derived artificial chromosome|PACs]] to form a BAC [[Library (biology)|library]].  Since these clones should cover the entire genome/chromosome, it is theoretically possible to assemble a contig of BACs that covers the entire chromosome.&lt;ref name="contig assembly" /&gt;  Reality, however, is not always ideal.  Gaps often remain, and a scaffold—consisting of contigs and gaps—that covers the map region is often the first result.&lt;ref name="contig assembly" /&gt;  The gaps between contigs can be closed by various methods outlined below.

===Construction of BAC contigs===
BAC contigs are constructed by aligning BAC regions of known overlap via a variety of methods. One common strategy is to use [[sequence-tagged site]] (STS) content mapping to detect unique DNA sites in common between BACs.  The degree of overlap is roughly estimated by the number of STS markers in common between two clones, with more markers in common signifying a greater overlap.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; Because this strategy provides only a very rough estimate of overlap, [[restriction digest]] fragment analysis, which provides a more precise measurement of clone overlap, is often used.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt;  In this strategy, clones are treated with one or two [[restriction enzyme]]s and the resulting fragments separated by [[gel electrophoresis]].  If two clones, they will likely have restriction sites in common, and will thus share several fragments.&lt;ref name="genome map" /&gt;  Because the number of fragments in common and the length of these fragments is known (the length is judged by comparison to a size standard), the degree of overlap can be deduced to a high degree of precision.

===Gaps between contigs===
Gaps often remain after initial BAC contig construction.  These gaps occur if the [[Bacterial Artificial Chromosome]] (BAC) library screened has low complexity, meaning it does not contain a high number of STS or restriction sites, or if certain regions were less stable in cloning hosts and thus underrepresented in the library.&lt;ref name="contig assembly" /&gt;  If gaps between contigs remain after STS landmark mapping and restriction fingerprinting have been performed, the sequencing of contig ends can be used to close these gaps.  This end-sequencing strategy essentially creates a novel STS with which to screen the other contigs.  Alternatively, the end sequence of a contig can be used as a primer to [[Primer walking|primer walk]] across the gap.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3298">A '''cooling flow''' occurs according to the theory that the [[intracluster medium]] (ICM) in the centres of [[galaxy clusters]] should be rapidly cooling at the rate of tens to thousands of solar masses per year.&lt;ref&gt;Fabian A.C.: [http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Fabian3/frames.html Cooling flows in clusters of galaxies], Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 1994. 32: 277-318&lt;/ref&gt; This should happen as the ICM (a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) is quickly losing its energy by the emission of [[X-rays]]. The X-ray brightness of the ICM is proportional to the square of its density, which rises steeply towards the centres of many clusters. Also the temperature falls to typically a third or a half of the temperature in the outskirts of the cluster. The typical [predicted] timescale for the ICM to cool is relatively short, less than a billion years. As material in the centre of the cluster ''cools out'', the pressure of the overlying ICM should cause more material to flow inwards (the cooling flow).

In a steady state, the rate of ''mass deposition'', i.e. the rate at which the plasma cools, is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{M} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{L \mu m}{kT},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is the bolometric (i.e. over the entire spectrum) [[luminosity]] of the cooling region, ''T'' is its temperature, ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''μm'' is the mean molecular mass.

==Cooling flow problem==
It is currently thought that the very large amounts of expected cooling are in reality much smaller, as there is little evidence for cool X-ray emitting gas in many of these systems.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson J.R., et al.: [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...590..207P High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopic Constrains on Cooling Flow Models for Clusters of Galaxies]. ApJ 2003. 590: 207&lt;/ref&gt; This is the ''cooling flow problem''. Theories for why there is little evidence of cooling include&lt;ref&gt;Peterson J.R., Fabian A.C.: [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006PhR...427....1P X-ray spectroscopy of cooling clusters], Physics Reports. 2006. 427: 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heating by the central [[Active galactic nucleus]] (AGN) in clusters, possibly via [[sound waves]] (seen in the [[Perseus Cluster|Perseus]] and [[Virgo cluster]]s)
* [[Thermal conduction]] of heat from the outer parts of clusters
* [[Cosmic ray]] heating
* Hiding cool gas by absorbing material
* Mixing of cool gas with hotter material
Heating by AGN is the most popular explanation, as they emit a lot of energy over their lifetimes, and some of the alternatives listed have theoretical problems.

'''Dynamic range compression''' ('''DRC''') or simply '''compression'''  is an [[audio signal processing]] operation that reduces the volume of loud [[sound]]s or amplifies quiet sounds thus reducing or ''compressing'' an [[audio signal]]'s [[dynamic range]]. Compression is commonly used in [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[broadcasting]],&lt;ref name="Follansbee"&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Follansbee |first1= Joe |title= Hands-on Guide to Streaming Media: An Introduction to Delivering On-Demand Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEN1GbEgb5AC |year=2006 |publisher= Focal Press |page=84|isbn= 9780240808635}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sound reinforcement system|live sound reinforcement]] and in some [[instrument amplifier]]s.

A dedicated electronic hardware unit or audio software that applies compression is called a '''compressor'''. In the 2000s, compressors became available as software plugins that run in [[digital audio workstation]] software. In recorded and live music, compression parameters may be adjusted to change the way they affect sounds. Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A [[limiter]] is a compressor with a high [[#Ratio|ratio]] and, generally, a short [[#Attack and release|attack time]].

''Downward compression'' reduces loud sounds over a certain threshold while quiet sounds remain unaffected. A [[limiter]] is an extreme type of downward compression. ''Upward compression'' increases the loudness of sounds below a certain threshold while leaving louder sounds unaffected. Both downward and upward compression reduce the [[Dynamic_range#Audio|dynamic range]] of an audio signal.&lt;ref name="Reese"&gt;{{Cite book   | last1 = Reese | first1 = David | last2 = Gross | first2 = Lynne| last3 = Gross | first3 = Brian | title = Audio Production Worktext: Concepts, Techniques, and Equipment   | publisher = Focal Press | year =  2009  | pages = 149 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NH1Q0BI2YPcC  | isbn = 0-240-81098-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:Compressors Feed Design.gif|frame|A feed-forward compressor design (left) and feedback design (right)]]

The signal entering a compressor is split; one copy is sent to a [[variable-gain amplifier]] and the other to a ''side-chain'' where the signal level is measured and a circuit controlled by the measured signal level applies the required gain to the amplifier. This design, known as a ''feed-forward'' type, is used today in most compressors. Earlier designs were based on a ''feedback'' layout where the signal level was measured after the amplifier.

There are a number of technologies used for variable-gain amplification, each having different advantages and disadvantages. [[Vacuum tube]]s are used in a configuration called ''variable-mu'' where the grid-to-cathode voltage changes to alter the gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tangible-technology.com/dynamics/comp_lim_ec_dh_pw2.html |title=Gain Control Devices, Side Chains, Audio Amplifiers |access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optical compressors use a [[photoresistor]] and a small lamp ([[Incandescent light bulb|Incandescent]], [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] or [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent panel]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uaudio.com/_works/pdf/manuals/LA-2A_manual.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113094825/http://www.uaudio.com/_works/pdf/manuals/LA-2A_manual.pdf |archive-date=2006-11-13 |title=Model LA-2A Leveling Amplifier}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create changes in signal gain. Other technologies used include [[field effect transistor]]s and a [[diode bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2006/april/index4.html |title=Analog Obsession: Compression Technology and Topology |publisher=Universal Audio |access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with digital audio, [[digital signal processing]] techniques are commonly used to implement compression as [[audio plug-in]]s, in [[mixing console]]s, and in [[digital audio workstation]]s. Often the algorithms used emulate the above analog technologies.

== Controls and features ==
[[File:Compression ratio.svg|thumb|right|220px|Different compression ratios for a signal level above the theshold]]
A number of user-adjustable control parameters and features are used to adjust dynamic range compression signal processing algorithms and components.

=== Threshold ===
A compressor reduces the level of an audio signal if its amplitude exceeds a certain ''threshold''. Threshold is commonly set in [[decibels]] dB, where a lower threshold (e.g. -60&amp;nbsp;dB) means a larger portion of the signal is treated. When the signal level is below the threshold, no processing is performed and the input signal is passed, unmodified, to the output. Thus a higher threshold of, e.g., −5&amp;nbsp;dB, results in less processing, less compression.

Threshold timing behavior is subject to attack and release settings (see [[#Attack and release|below]]). When the signal level goes above threshold, compressor operation is delayed by the ''attack'' setting. For an amount of time determined by the ''release'' after the input signal has fallen below the threshold, the compressor continues to apply dynamic range compression.

=== Ratio ===
The amount of gain reduction is determined by '''ratio''': a ratio of 4:1 means that if input level is 4&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] over the threshold, the output signal level is reduced to 1&amp;nbsp;dB over the threshold. The gain and output level has been reduced by 3&amp;nbsp;dB.

The highest ratio of ∞:1 is often known as ''limiting''. It is commonly achieved using a ratio of 60:1, and effectively denotes that any signal above the threshold is brought down to the threshold level once the ''attack'' time has expired.

=== Attack and release ===
[[File:Audio Compression Attack and Release-2.svg|thumb|220px|The attack and release phases in a compressor]]
A compressor may provide a degree of control over how quickly it acts. The ''attack'' is the period when the compressor is decreasing gain in response to increased level at the input to reach the gain determined by the ratio. The ''release'' is the period when the compressor is increasing gain in response to reduced level at the input to reach the output gain determined by the ratio, or, to unity, once the input level has fallen below the threshold. Because the loudness pattern of the source material is modified by the time-varying operation of compressor, it may change the character of the signal in subtle to quite noticeable ways depending on the attack and release settings used.

The length of each period is determined by the rate of change and the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor's attack and release controls are labeled as a unit of time (often milliseconds). This is the amount of time it takes for the gain to change a set amount of dB or a set percentage towards the target gain. There is no industry standard for the exact meaning of these time parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rane.com/pdf/ranenotes/Dynamics_Processors.pdf |publisher=[[Rane Corporation]] |date=September 2005 |author1=Rick Jeffs |author2=Scott Holden |author3=Dennis Bohn |title=RaneNote 155: Dynamics Processors – Technology &amp; Applications |quote=There is no industry standard and different manufacturers define [release time] differently. |page=6-7 |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many compressors the attack and release times are adjustable by the user. Some compressors, however, have the attack and release times determined by the circuit design and these cannot be adjusted by the user. Sometimes the attack and release times are ''automatic'' or ''program dependent'', meaning that the behavior may change dependent on the input signal.

=== Soft and hard knees ===
[[File:Compression knee.svg|thumb|220px|right|Hard Knee and Soft Knee compression]]
Another control a compressor might offer is hard knee or soft knee selection.  This controls whether the bend in the response curve between below threshold and above threshold is abrupt (hard) or gradual (soft). A soft knee slowly increases the compression ratio as the level increases and eventually reaches the compression ratio set by the user. A soft knee reduces the potentially audible transition from uncompressed to compressed, and is especially applicable for higher ratio settings where the changeover at the threshold would be more noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec00/articles/adcompression.htm |publisher=Sound On Sound |date=December 2000 |author=Paul White |title=Advanced Compression Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peak vs RMS sensing ===
A peak-sensing compressor responds to the peak level of the input signal. While providing tighter peak level control, peak level sensing does not necessarily relate to human perception of loudness. Some compressors apply an power measurement function (commonly [[root mean square]] or RMS) on the input signal before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces a more relaxed compression that more closely relates to human perception of loudness.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

=== Stereo linking ===

A compressor in stereo linking mode applies the same amount of gain reduction to both the left and right channels. This is done to prevent image shifting that can occur if each channel is compressed individually. It becomes noticeable when a loud element that is panned to either edge of the stereo field raises the level of the program to the compressor's threshold, causing its image to shift toward the center of the stereo field.

Stereo linking can be achieved in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono the left and right channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one might wish to have less compression for left-side events&lt;ref&gt;UAD Powered Plug-Ins, User Manual, Version 4.10, Fairchild 670 section, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Makeup gain ===

Because the compressor is reducing the gain (or level) of the signal, the ability to add a fixed amount of ''make-up gain'' at the output is usually provided so that an optimum level can be used.

=== Look-ahead ===
The look-ahead function is designed to overcome the problem of being forced to compromise between slow attack rates that produce smooth-sounding gain changes, and fast attack rates capable of catching transients. Look-ahead is a misnomer in that the future is not actually observed. Instead, the input signal is split, and one side is delayed. The non-delayed signal is used to drive the compression of the delayed signal, which then appears at the output. This way a smooth-sounding slower attack rate can be used to catch transients. The cost of this solution is that the signal is delayed.

== Uses ==

=== Public spaces ===
Compression is often used to make music sound louder without increasing its peak amplitude.  By compressing the peak (or loudest) signals, it becomes possible to increase the overall gain (or volume) of a signal without exceeding the dynamic limits of a reproduction device or medium. The net effect, when compression is applied along with a gain boost, is that relatively quiet sounds become louder, while louder sounds remain unchanged.

Compression is often applied in this manner in audio systems for restaurants, retail, and similar public environments that play background music at a relatively low volume and need it compressed, not just to keep the volume fairly constant, but also to make quiet parts of the music audible over ambient noise.

Compression can increase average output gain of a [[Amplifier|power amplifier]] by 50 to 100% with a reduced dynamic range. For paging and evacuation systems, this adds clarity under noisy circumstances and saves on the number of amplifiers required.

=== Music production ===
Compression is often used in music production to make performances more consistent in dynamic range so that they "sit" in the mix of other instruments better and maintain consistent attention from the listener. Vocal performances in [[rock and roll|rock music]] or [[pop music]] are usually compressed to make them stand out from the surrounding instruments and add clarity.

Compression can also be used on instrument sounds to create effects not primarily focused on boosting [[loudness]]. For instance, drum and cymbal sounds tend to decay quickly, but a compressor can make the sound appear to have a more sustained tail.  Guitar sounds are often compressed to produce a fuller, more sustained sound.

Most devices capable of compressing audio dynamics can also be used to reduce the volume of one audio source when another audio source reaches a certain level; this is called [[side-chaining]].

In [[electronic dance music]], side-chaining is often used on [[bassline]]s, controlled by the kick drum or a similar percussive trigger, to prevent the two conflicting, and provide a pulsating, rhythmic dynamic to the sound.

=== Voice ===
A compressor can be used to reduce [[Sibilant consonant|sibilance]] ('ess' sounds) in vocals by feeding the compressor with an [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]] set to the relevant frequencies, so that only those frequencies activate the compressor.  If unchecked, sibilance could cause distortion even if sound levels are not very high.  This usage is called [[de-essing]].

Compression is used in voice communications in [[amateur radio]] that employ [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB modulation]].  Often it is used to make a particular station's signal more readable to a distant station, or to make one's station's transmitted signal stand out against others.  This occurs especially in [[pileup (disambiguation)|pileup]]s where amateur radio stations are competing for the opportunity to talk to a [[DX communication|DX]] station. Since an SSB signal's [[amplitude]] depends on the level of [[modulation]], the net result is that the average amplitude of the signal, and hence average transmitted power is stronger than it would be without compression.&lt;ref&gt;"HF Radio Systems &amp; Circuits", Sabin &amp;  Schoenike, editors. Noble, 1998, pp. 13–25, 271–290&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern amateur radio SSB transceivers have speech compressors built in.

Compression is also used in [[Two-way radio|land mobile radio]], especially in transmit audio of professional [[walkie-talkie]]s and in [[Tone remote|remote control dispatch consoles]].

=== Broadcasting ===
Compression is used extensively in [[broadcasting]] to boost the perceived volume of sound while reducing the dynamic range of source audio (typically CDs) to a range that can be accommodated by the narrower-range broadcast signal. Broadcasters in most countries have legal limits on instantaneous peak volume they may broadcast. Normally these limits are met by permanently inserted hardware in the on-air chain (see [[#Multiband compression|multiband compression]] above).

As was alluded to above, the use of compressors to boost perceived volume is a favorite trick of broadcasters who want their station to sound "louder" at the same volume than comparable stations on the dial. The effect is to make the more heavily compressed station "jump out" at the listener at a given volume setting.

But loudness jumps are not limited to inter-channel differences; they also exist between programme material within the same channel. Loudness differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that seem too loud. Complicating this is that many broadcasters use (quasi-)peak meters and peak-levelling. Unfortunately the peak level reading does not correlate well with the perceived loudness. It basically should only be used to prevent overmodulation.

The European Broadcasting Union has been addressing this issue in the EBU PLOUD Group, which consist of over 240 audio professionals, many from broadcasters and equipment manufacturers. In 2010, the EBU published EBU Recommendation R 128, which introduces a new way of metering and normalising audio. The Recommendation is based on [[ITU-R BS.1770]]. Several European TV stations have already announced to support the new norm and over 20 manufacturers have announced products supporting the new 'EBU Mode' Loudness meters.&lt;ref name="EBU3341"&gt;[http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help audio engineers understand what Loudness Range their material consists of (e.g. to check if some compression may be needed to fit it into the channel of a specific delivery platform), the EBU also introduced the Loudness Range Descriptor.&lt;ref name="EBU3342"&gt;[http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3342.pdf EBU Tech 3342]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cd loudness trend-something.gif|right|thumb|305px|The trend of increasing loudness as shown by waveform images of the same song mastered on CD four times since 1983.]]
Record companies, mixing engineers and mastering engineers have been gradually increasing the overall volume of commercial albums. The greater [[loudness]] is achieved by using higher degrees of compression and limiting during [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[Audio mastering|mastering]]; compression algorithms have been engineered specifically to accomplish the task of maximizing audio level in the digital stream. Hard limiting or [[clipping (audio)|clipping]] can result, affecting the tone and timbre of the music. The effort to increase loudness has been referred to as the [[loudness war]].

Most television commercials are heavily compressed (typically to a dynamic range of no more than 3&amp;nbsp;dB) to achieve near-maximum perceived loudness while staying within permissible limits. This causes a problem that TV viewers often notice: when a station switches from minimally compressed program material to a heavily compressed commercial, the volume sometimes seems to increase dramatically. Peak loudness might be the same—meeting the letter of the law—but high compression puts much more of the audio in the commercial at close to the maximum allowable, making the commercial seem much louder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/bargains-and-rip-offs/ask-an-expert/article.html?in_article_id=484363&amp;in_page_id=513 Are these noisy TV adverts legal?, This is Money, 9 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-8114 TV ads sound too loud and rules should change, says regulator. Out-law.com, June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses ===
Some applications use a compressor to reduce the dynamic range of a signal for transmission, expanding it afterward. This reduces the effects of a channel with limited dynamic range.  See ''[[Companding]]''.

[[Bass amplifier]]s and [[keyboard amplifier]]s often include compression circuitry to prevent sudden high-wattage peaks that could damage the speakers. [[Electric bass]] players often use compression effects, either [[effects unit]]s available in pedal, [[rackmount]] units, or built-in devices in bass amps, to even out the sound levels of their [[bassline]]s.

[[Gain pumping]], where a regular amplitude peak (such as a kick drum) causes the rest of the mix to change in volume due to the compressor, is generally avoided in music production. However, many [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and hip-hop musicians purposefully use this phenomenon, causing the mix to alter in volume rhythmically in time with the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhippinpost.co.uk/mixing-music/compression-audio-mixing.htm |title=Compression in Audio Music Mixing |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hearing aid]]s use a compressor to bring the audio volume into the listener's hearing range. To help the patient perceive the direction sound comes from, some hearing aids use [[binaural recording|binaural]] compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Textbook of Hearing Aid Amplification |author=Robert E. Sandlin |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=2000 |isbn=9781565939974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compressors are also used for [[Hearing protectors|hearing protection]] in some electronic "active sound protection" [[earmuffs]] and [[earplugs]], to let sounds at ordinary volumes be heard normally while attenuating louder sounds, possibly also amplifying softer sounds. This allows, for example, shooters wearing hearing protection at a shooting range to converse normally, while sharply attenuating the much louder sounds of the gunshots, and similarly for musicians to hear quiet music but be protected from loud noises such as drums or cymbal crashes.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Limiting ==
[[File:Clipping compared to limiting.svg|thumb|220px|Limiting and clipping compared. Note that clipping introduces a large amount of distortion whereas limiting only introduces a small amount while keeping the signal within the threshold.]]
{{Main|Limiter}}
Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A [[limiter]] is a compressor with a high ratio and, generally, a fast attack time. Compression with ratio of 10:1 or more is generally considered limiting.&lt;ref name="tcelectronic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcelectronic.com/media/droney_massey_2001_compres.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231072136/http://www.tcelectronic.com/media/droney_massey_2001_compres.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-31 |publisher=[[TC Electronic]] |author1=Maureen Droney |author2=Howard Massey |title=Compression Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brick wall limiting'' has a very high ratio and a very fast attack time. Ideally, this ensures that an audio signal never exceeds the amplitude of the threshold. Ratios of 20:1  all the way up to ∞:1 are considered 'brick wall'.&lt;ref name="tcelectronic.com"/&gt;  The sonic results of more than momentary and infrequent hard/brick-wall limiting are harsh and unpleasant, thus it is more common as a safety device in live sound and broadcast applications.

Some [[bass amp]]s and [[PA system]] amplifiers include limiters to prevent sudden volume peaks from causing distortion and/or damaging the speakers. Some modern consumer electronics devices incorporate limiters. [[Sony]] uses the [[automatic volume limiter system]] (AVLS), on some audio products and the [[PlayStation Portable]].

== Side-chaining ==

[[File:Compressor Sidechain.svg|thumb|300px|The sidechain of a feed-forward compressor]]
{{listen | filename = Uplifting Trance Sidechain.ogg| title = Uplifting Trance Sidechain| description = The first 8 bars are without side-chaining applied, the second 8 are with side-chaining. | format = [[Ogg]]}}

A compressor with a side-chain input controls gain from main input to output based on the level of the signal at the side-chain input.&lt;ref name="Colletti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonicscoop.com/2013/06/27/beyond-the-basics-sidechain-compression/ |title=Beyond The Basics: Sidechain Compression |author=Justin Colletti |date=June 27, 2013 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compressor behaves in the conventional manner when both inputs are supplied with the same signal. The side-chain input is used by [[disc jockey]]s for [[ducking]] – lowering the music volume automatically when speaking. The DJ's microphone signal is routed to the side-chain input so that whenever the DJ speaks the compressor reduces the volume of the music. A sidechain with [[equalization (audio)|equalization]] controls can be used to reduce the volume of signals that have a strong spectral content within a certain frequency range: it can act as a [[de-esser]], reducing the level of vocal [[sibilance]] in the range of 6–9&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Techniques For Vocal De-essing |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may09/articles/deessing.htm |author=Mike Senior |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A de-esser helps reduce high frequencies that tend to overdrive [[preemphasis|preemphasized]] media (such as phonograph records and FM radio). Another use of the side-chain in music production serves to maintain a loud bass track without the [[bass drum]] causing undue peaks that result in loss of overall [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]].&lt;ref name="Colletti"/&gt;

==Parallel compression==

One technique is to insert the compressor in a parallel signal path. This is known as [[parallel compression]], a form of upward compression that facilitates dynamic control without significant audible side effects, if the ratio is relatively low and the compressor's sound is relatively neutral. On the other hand, a high compression ratio with significant audible artifacts can be chosen in one of the two parallel signal paths—this is used by some concert mixers and recording engineers as an artistic effect called ''New York compression'' or ''Motown compression''. Combining a linear signal with a compressor and then reducing the output gain of the compression chain results in low-level detail enhancement without any peak reduction (since the compressor significantly adds to the combined gain at low levels only). This is often beneficial when  compressing transient content, since it maintains high-level dynamic liveliness, despite reducing the overall dynamic range.

== {{visible anchor|Multiband compression}} == &lt;!-- [[Multiband compression]] redirects here --&gt;

Multiband compressors can act differently on different frequency bands. The advantage of multiband compression over full-bandwidth compression is that unneeded audible gain changes or "pumping" in other frequency bands is not caused by changing signal levels in a single frequency band.

Multiband compressors work by first splitting the signal through some number of [[band-pass filters]] or [[audio crossover|crossover filters]]. The frequency ranges or crossover frequencies may be adjustable. Each split signal then passes through its own compressor and is independently adjustable for threshold, ratio, attack, and release. The signals are then recombined and an additional limiting circuit may be employed to ensure that the combined effects do not create unwanted peak levels.

Software plug-ins or [[digital signal processing|DSP]] emulations of multiband compressors can be complex, with many bands, and require corresponding computing power.

Multiband compressors are primarily an [[audio mastering]] tool, but their inclusion in [[digital audio workstation]] plug-in sets is increasing their use among mix engineers. On-air signal chains of [[radio station]]s commonly use hardware multiband compressors to increase apparent [[loudness]] without fear of [[overmodulation]]. Having a louder sound is often considered an advantage in commercial competition. However, adjusting a radio station's multiband output compressor requires some artistic sense of style, plenty of time, and good ears. This is because the constantly changing [[spectral balance]] between audio bands may have an equalizing effect on the output, by dynamically modifying the on-air frequency response. A further development of this approach is programmable radio output processing, where the parameters of the multiband compressor automatically change between different settings according to the current programme block style or the time of day.

==Serial compression==
Serial compression is a [[wikt:technique|technique]] used in [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]].  Serial compression is achieved by using two fairly different compressors in a signal chain.  One compressor generally stabilizes the [[dynamic range]] while the other aggressively compresses stronger peaks.  This is the normal internal signal routing in common combination devices marketed as ''compressor-limiters'', where an RMS compressor (for general gain control) is followed by a fast peak sensing limiter (for overload protection). Done properly, even heavy serial compression can sound natural in a way not possible with a single compressor.  It is most often used to even out erratic [[vocal]]s and [[guitar]]s.

== Software audio players ==

Some [[audio player (software)|software audio players]] support [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] that implement compression.  These can increase perceived volume of audio tracks, or even out the volume of highly-variable music (such as [[classical music]], or a playlist that spans multiple music types). This improves listenability of audio played through poor-quality speakers, or when played in noisy environments (such as in a car or during a party).  Such software may also be used in [[micro-broadcasting]] or home-based audio mastering.

== Objective influence on the signal ==

Five signal descriptors were considered: [[RMS power]], EBU3341/R128 integrated loudness,&lt;ref name="EBU3341" /&gt; [[crest factor]], EBU3342 LRA,&lt;ref name="EBU3342" /&gt; and density of clipped samples. RMS power accounts for the signal's physical level, EBU3341 loudness for the perceived level.&lt;ref name="EBU3341" /&gt; The crest factor, which is the difference between the signal's peak and its average power,&lt;ref name="DerutyTardieuAES" /&gt; is on occasions considered as a basis for the measure of micro-dynamics, for instance in the ''TT Dynamic Range Meter'' plug-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/loudnesswar/loudness_war.pdf |title=The Loudness War: Background, Speculation and Recommendations |author=Earl Vickers |publisher=[[Audio Engineering Society]] |work=AES 2010: Paper Sessions: Loudness and Dynamics |location=San Francisco |date=November 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Dynamic Range Meter | url = http://www.pleasurizemusic.com/free-downloads  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, EBU3342 LRA has been repeatedly considered as a measure of macro-dynamics or dynamics in the musical sense.&lt;ref name="DerutyTardieuAES" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOS_Dynamic_Range"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Deruty | first = Emmanuel | title = 'Dynamic Range' &amp; The Loudness War | work = Sound on Sound | accessdate = 2013-10-24 | date = September 2011 | url = http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep11/articles/loudness.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=26 July 2012 |title=Measuring the Evolution of Contemporary Western Popular Music |trans_title= |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=2 |series= |issue= |page= 521|at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |language= |arxiv=1205.5651 |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= 22837813|pmc= 3405292|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.521S |doi=10.1038/srep00521 |accessdate=26 July 2012 |url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120726/srep00521/full/srep00521.html |laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=  | last1 = Serrà | first1 = J | last2 = Corral | first2 = A | last3 = Boguñá | first3 = M | last4 = Haro | first4 = M | last5 = Arcos | first5 = JL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jens Hjortkjær |author2=Mads Walther-Hansen | publisher  = Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |date=January 2014 |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=17085/ |title=Perceptual Effects of Dynamic Range Compression in Popular Music Recordings |accessdate=2014-06-06|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author  = Esben Skovenborg | publisher  = AES 132nd Convention |date=April 2012 |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=16254/ |title=Loudness Range (LRA) – Design and Evaluation |accessdate=2014-10-25|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limiters ===

The tested limiters had the following influence on the signal:
* increase of RMS power,
* increase of EBU3341 loudness,
* decrease of crest factor,
* decrease of EBU3342 LRA, but only for high amounts of limiting,
* increase of clipped sample density.

In other words, limiters increase both physical and perceptual levels, increase the density of clipped samples, decrease the crest factor and decrease macro-dynamics (LRA) given that the amount of limiting is substantial.

=== Compressors ===

As far as the compressors are concerned, the authors performed two processing sessions, using a fast attack (0.5 ms) in one case, and a slow attack (50 ms) in the other. Gain make-up is deactivated, but the resulting file is normalized.

Set with a fast attack, the tested compressors had the following influence on the signal:
* slight increase of RMS power,
* slight increase of EBU3341 loudness,
* decrease of crest factor,
* decrease of EBU3342 LRA,
* slight decrease of clipped sample density.

In other words, fast-attack compressors increase both physical and perceptual levels, but only slightly. They decrease the density of clipped samples, and decrease both crest factor and macro-dynamics.

Set with a slow attack, the tested compressors had the following influence on the signal:
* decrease of RMS power,
* decrease of EBU3341 loudness,
* no influence on crest factor,
* decrease of EBU3342 LRA,
* no influence on clipped sample density.

In other words, slow-attack compressors decrease both physical and perceptual levels, decrease macro-dynamics, but have no influence on crest factor and clipped sample density.

[[File:Hydraulic dynamometer (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Early hydraulic dynamometer, with dead-weight torque measurement]]

A '''dynamometer''' or '''"dyno"''' for short, is a device for measuring [[force]], [[torque]], or [[Power (physics)|power]]. For example, the power produced by an [[Heat engine|engine]], [[Electric motor|motor]] or other rotating [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]] can be calculated by simultaneously measuring torque and [[rotational speed]] ([[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]).

In addition to being used to determine the torque or power characteristics of a machine under test, dynamometers are employed in a number of other roles. In standard emissions testing cycles such as those defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], dynamometers are used to provide simulated road loading of either the engine (using an engine dynamometer) or full powertrain (using a chassis dynamometer). In fact, beyond simple power and torque measurements, dynamometers can be used as part of a testbed for a variety of engine development activities, such as the calibration of engine management controllers, detailed investigations into combustion behavior, and [[tribology]].

In the medical terminology, hand-held dynamometers are used for routine screening of grip and [[hand strength]], and the initial and ongoing evaluation of patients with hand trauma or dysfunction. They are also used to measure grip strength in patients where compromise of the cervical nerve roots or peripheral nerves is suspected.

In the [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], [[kinesiology]], and [[ergonomics]] realms, force dynamometers are used for measuring the back, grip, arm, and/or leg strength of athletes, patients, and workers to evaluate physical status, performance, and task demands. Typically the force applied to a lever or through a cable is measured and then converted to a moment of force by multiplying by the perpendicular distance from the force to the axis of the level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.uottawa.ca/biomech/courses/apa4311/dynamometry.pps health.uottawa.ca], Dynamometry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation of torque power (absorbing) dynamometers==
An absorbing dynamometer acts as a load that is driven by the prime mover that is under test (e.g. [[Pelton wheel]]). The dynamometer must be able to operate at any speed and load to any level of torque that the test requires.

Absorbing dynamometers are not to be confused with "inertia" dynamometers, which calculate power solely by measuring power required to accelerate a known mass drive roller and provide no variable load to the prime mover.

An absorption dynamometer is usually equipped with some means of measuring the operating torque and speed.

The power absorption unit (PAU) of a dynamometer absorbs the power developed by the prime mover. This power absorbed by the dynamometer is then converted into heat, which generally dissipates into the ambient air or transfers to cooling water that dissipates into the air. Regenerative dynamometers, in which the prime mover drives a DC motor as a generator to create load, make excess DC power and potentially - using a DC/AC inverter - can feed AC power back into the commercial electrical power grid.

Absorption dynamometers can be equipped with two types of control systems to provide different main test types.

===Constant force===
The dynamometer has a "braking" torque regulator - the power absorption unit is configured to provide a set braking force torque load, while the prime mover is configured to operate at whatever throttle opening, fuel delivery rate, or any other variable it is desired to test. The prime mover is then allowed to accelerate the engine through the desired speed or RPM range. Constant force test routines require the PAU to be set slightly torque deficient as referenced to prime mover output to allow some rate of acceleration. Power is calculated based on rotational speed x torque x constant. The constant varies depending on the units used.

===Constant speed===
If the dynamometer has a speed regulator (human or computer), the PAU provides a variable amount of braking force (torque) that is necessary to cause the prime mover to operate at the desired single test speed or RPM. The PAU braking load applied to the prime mover can be manually controlled or determined by a computer. Most systems employ eddy current, oil hydraulic, or DC motor produced loads because of their linear and quick load change abilities.

Power is calculated based on rotational speed x torque x constant, with the constant varying with the output unit desired and the input units used.

A ''motoring dynamometer'' acts as a motor that drives the equipment under test. It must be able to drive the equipment at any speed and develop any level of torque that the test requires. In common usage, AC or DC motors are used to drive the equipment or "load" device.

In most dynamometers [[Power (physics)|power]] (''P'') is not measured directly, but must be calculated from torque (''τ'') and angular velocity (''ω''){{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} values or force (''F'') and linear velocity (''v''):
:&lt;math&gt;P=\tau\cdot\omega&lt;/math&gt;
:or
:&lt;math&gt;P=F \cdot v&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''P'' is the power in [[watt]]s
::''τ'' is the torque in [[newton metre]]s
::''ω'' is the angular velocity in [[radian per second|radians per second]]
::''F'' is the force in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s
::''v'' is the linear velocity in [[metre per second|metres per second]]

Division by a conversion constant may be required, depending on the units of measure used.

For imperial units,
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{hp}={\tau_\mathrm{lb \cdot ft}\cdot\omega_\mathrm{RPM} \over 5252}&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''P''&lt;sub&gt;hp&lt;/sub&gt; is the power in [[horsepower]]
::''τ''&lt;sub&gt;lb·ft&lt;/sub&gt; is the torque in [[foot-pound force|pound-feet]]
::''ω''&lt;sub&gt;RPM&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotational velocity in [[revolutions per minute]]

For metric units,
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{kW}={\tau_\mathrm{N \cdot m}\cdot\omega_\mathrm{RPM} \over 9549}&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''P''&lt;sub&gt;kW&lt;/sub&gt; is the power in [[watt|kilowatts]]
::''τ''&lt;sub&gt;N·m&lt;/sub&gt; is the torque in [[newton metre]]s
::''ω''&lt;sub&gt;RPM&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotational velocity in [[revolutions per minute]]

==Detailed dynamometer description==
[[Image:Dynamometer01CJC.svg|thumb|right|Electrical dynamometer setup showing engine, torque measurement arrangement and tachometer]]
A dynamometer consists of an absorption (or absorber/driver) unit, and usually includes a means for measuring torque and rotational speed. An absorption unit consists of some type of rotor in a housing. The rotor is coupled to the engine or other equipment under test and is free to rotate at whatever speed is required for the test. Some means is provided to develop a braking torque between the rotor and housing of the dynamometer. The means for developing torque can be frictional, hydraulic, electromagnetic, or otherwise, according to the type of absorption/driver unit.

One means for measuring torque is to mount the dynamometer housing so that it is free to turn except as restrained by a torque arm. The housing can be made free to rotate by using [[trunnion]]s connected to each end of the housing to support it in pedestal-mounted trunnion bearings. The torque arm is connected to the dyno housing and a [[weighing scale]] is positioned so that it measures the force exerted by the dyno housing in attempting to rotate. The torque is the force indicated by the scales multiplied by the length of the torque arm measured from the center of the dynamometer. A [[load cell]] [[transducer]] can be substituted for the scales in order to provide an [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical signal]] that is proportional to torque.

Another means to measure torque is to connect the engine to the dynamo through a [[torque sensor|torque sensing]] coupling or torque transducer. A torque transducer provides an electrical signal that is proportional to the torque.

With electrical absorption units, it is possible to determine torque by measuring the current drawn (or generated) by the absorber/driver. This is generally a less accurate method and not much practiced in modern times, but it may be adequate for some purposes.

When torque and speed signals are available, test data can be transmitted to a [[data acquisition]] system rather than being recorded manually. Speed and torque signals can also be recorded by a [[chart recorder]] or [[plotter]].

==Types of dynamometers==
In addition to classification as absorption, motoring, or universal, as described above, dynamometers can also be classified in other ways.

A dyno that is [[coupling|coupled]] directly to an engine is known as an ''engine dyno''.

A dyno that can measure torque and power delivered by the power train of a vehicle directly from the drive wheel or wheels (without removing the engine from the frame of the vehicle), is known as a ''chassis dyno''.

Dynamometers can also be classified by the type of absorption unit or absorber/driver that they use. Some units that are capable of absorption only can be combined with a motor to construct an absorber/driver or "universal" dynamometer.

===Types of absorption units===
* [[eddy current brake|Eddy current]] (absorption only)
* Magnetic powder brake (absorption only)
* [[Hysteresis]] brake (absorption only)
* [[Electric motor]]/[[Electric generator|generator]] (absorb or drive)
* Fan brake (absorption only)
* [[Hydraulic]] brake (absorption only)
* Force lubricated, oil shear friction brake (absorption only)
* [[Water brake]] (absorption only)
* Compound dyno (usually an absorption dyno in tandem with an electric/motoring dyno)

===Eddy current type absorber===
Eddy current (EC) dynamometers are currently the most common absorbers used in modern chassis dynos. The EC absorbers provide a quick load change rate for rapid load settling. Most are air cooled, but some are designed to require external water cooling systems.

Eddy current dynamometers require an electrically conductive core, shaft, or disc moving across a magnetic field to produce resistance to movement. Iron is a common material, but copper, aluminum, and other conductive materials are also usable.

In current (2009) applications, most EC brakes use cast iron discs similar to vehicle disc brake rotors, and use variable electromagnets to change the magnetic field strength to control the amount of braking.

The electromagnet voltage is usually controlled by a computer, using changes in the magnetic field to match the power output being applied.

Sophisticated EC systems allow steady state and controlled acceleration rate operation.

===Powder dynamometer===
A powder dynamometer is similar to an eddy current dynamometer, but a fine magnetic powder is placed in the air gap between the rotor and the coil. The resulting flux lines create "chains" of metal particulate that are constantly built and broken apart during rotation, creating great torque. Powder dynamometers are typically limited to lower RPM due to heat dissipation problems.

===Hysteresis dynamometers===
Hysteresis dynamometers use a magnetic rotor, sometimes of AlNiCo alloy, that is moved through flux lines generated between magnetic pole pieces. The magnetisation of the rotor is thus cycled around its B-H characteristic, dissipating energy proportional to the area between the lines of that graph as it does so.

Unlike eddy current brakes, which develop no torque at standstill, the hysteresis brake develops largely constant torque, proportional to its magnetising current (or magnet strength in the case of permanent magnet units) over its entire speed range&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magtrol.com/manuals/hbmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Units often incorporate ventilation slots, though some have provision for forced air cooling from an external supply.

Hysteresis and Eddy Current dynamometers are two of the most useful technologies in small ({{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} and less) dynamometers.

===Electric motor/generator dynamometer===
[[Electric motor]]/[[electric generator|generator]] dynamometers are a specialized type of [[adjustable-speed drive]]. The absorption/driver unit can be either an [[alternating current]] (AC) motor or a [[direct current]] (DC) motor. Either an AC motor or a DC motor can operate as a generator that is driven by the unit under test or a motor that drives the unit under test. When equipped with appropriate control units, electric motor/generator dynamometers can be configured as universal dynamometers. The control unit for an AC motor is a [[variable-frequency drive]], while the control unit for a DC motor is a [[Adjustable-speed drive#DC drives|DC drive]]. In both cases, regenerative control units can transfer power from the unit under test to the electric utility. Where permitted, the operator of the dynamometer can receive payment (or credit) from the utility for the returned power via [[net metering]].

In engine testing, universal dynamometers can not only absorb the power of the engine, but can also drive the engine for measuring friction, pumping losses, and other factors.

Electric motor/generator dynamometers are generally more costly and complex than other types of dynamometers.

===Fan brake===
A fan is used to blow air to provide engine load. The torque absorbed by a fan brake may be adjusted by changing the gearing or the fan itself, or by restricting the airflow through the fan. It should be noted that, due to the low [[viscosity]] of air, this variety of dynamometer is inherently limited in the amount of torque that it can absorb.

===Force lubricated oil shear brake===
An oil shear brake has a series of friction discs and steel plates similar to the clutches in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the friction discs is attached to the load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of friction discs and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit.  Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.&lt;ref name=shear&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ien.com/article/slashing-test-time/187285 |title=Slashing Test Time with Oil Shear Brake |work=Industrial Equipment News |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydraulic brake===
The hydraulic brake system consists of a hydraulic pump (usually a gear-type pump), a fluid reservoir, and piping between the two parts. Inserted in the piping is an adjustable valve, and between the pump and the valve is a gauge or other means of measuring hydraulic pressure. In simplest terms, the engine is brought up to the desired RPM and the valve is incrementally closed. As the pumps outlet is restricted, the load increases and the throttle is simply opened until at the desired throttle opening. Unlike most other systems, power is calculated by factoring flow volume (calculated from pump design specifications), hydraulic pressure, and RPM. Brake HP, whether figured with pressure, volume, and RPM, or with a different load cell-type brake dyno, should produce essentially identical power figures. Hydraulic dynos are renowned for having the quickest load change ability, just slightly surpassing eddy current absorbers. The downside is that they require large quantities of hot oil under high pressure and an oil reservoir.

===Water brake-type absorber===
[[File:Tech-Talk_Animation_on_How_Water-Brakes_Work.webm|thumb|A  4-minute ‘how-it-works video’ tutorial explaining how engine-dynamometer water-brake absorbers work.]]
The [[water brake]] absorber is sometimes mistakenly called a "hydraulic dynamometer". Invented by British engineer [[William Froude]] in 1877 in response to a request by the [[Admiralty]] to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.froudehofmann.com/about/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} About Us|publisher=Froude Hoffmann|accessdate=9 Jan 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302070601/http://www.froudehofmann.com/about/history/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; water brake absorbers are relatively common today. They are noted for their high power capability, small size, light weight, and relatively low manufacturing costs as compared to other, quicker reacting, "power absorber" types.

Their drawbacks are that they can take a relatively long period of time to "stabilize" their load amount, and that they require a constant supply of water to the "water brake housing" for cooling. In many parts of the country,{{Where|date=July 2011}} environmental regulations now prohibit "flow through" water, and so large water tanks must be installed to prevent contaminated water from entering the environment.

The schematic shows the most common type of water brake, known as the "variable level" type. Water is added until the engine is held at a steady RPM against the load, with the water then kept at that level and replaced by constant draining and refilling (which is needed to carry away the heat created by absorbing the horsepower). The housing attempts to rotate in response to the torque produced, but is restrained by the scale or torque metering cell that measures the torque.
[[Image:Dyno schematic.svg|frame|center|This schematic shows a water brake, which is actually a fluid coupling with a housing restrained from rotating&amp;mdash;similar to a water pump with no outlet.]]

===Compound dynamometers===
In most cases, motoring dynamometers are symmetrical; a 300&amp;nbsp;kW AC dynamometer can absorb 300&amp;nbsp;kW as well as motor at 300&amp;nbsp;kW. This is an uncommon requirement in engine testing and development. Sometimes, a more cost-effective solution is to attach a larger absorption dynamometer with a smaller motoring dynamometer. Alternatively, a larger absorption dynamometer and a simple AC or DC motor may be used in a similar manner, with the electric motor only providing motoring power when required (and no absorption). The (cheaper) absorption dynamometer is sized for the maximum required absorption, whereas the motoring dynamometer is sized for motoring. A typical size ratio for common emission test cycles and most engine development is approximately 3:1. Torque measurement is somewhat complicated since there are two machines in tandem - an inline torque transducer is the preferred method of torque measurement in this case. An eddy-current or waterbrake dynamometer, with electronic control combined with a variable frequency drive and AC induction motor, is a commonly used configuration of this type. Disadvantages include requiring a second set of test cell services (electrical power and cooling), and a slightly more complicated control system. Attention must be paid to the transition between motoring and braking in terms of control stability.

==How dynamometers are used for engine testing==
Dynamometers are useful in the development and refinement of modern engine technology. The concept is to use a dyno to measure and compare power transfer at different points on a vehicle, thus allowing the engine or drivetrain to be modified to get more efficient power transfer. For example, if an engine dyno shows that a particular engine achieves {{convert|400|N.m|lbf.ft|abbr=on|0|round=5}} of torque, and a chassis dynamo shows only {{convert|350|N.m|lbf.ft|abbr=on|0|round=5}}, one would know that the drivetrain losses are nominal. Dynamometers are typically very expensive pieces of equipment, and so are normally used only in certain fields that rely on them for a particular purpose.

==Types of dynamometer systems==
[[Image:boxsterdyno.png|right|thumb|300px|Dyno graph 1]]
[[Image:dynograph96.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Dyno graph 2]]

A 'brake' dynamometer applies variable load on the prime mover (PM) and measures the PM's ability to move or hold the RPM as related to the "braking force" applied. It is usually connected to a [[computer]] that records applied braking torque and calculates engine power output based on information from a "load cell" or "strain gauge" and a speed sensor.

An 'inertia' dynamometer provides a fixed inertial mass load, calculates the power required to accelerate that fixed and known mass, and uses a computer to record RPM and acceleration rate to calculate torque. The engine is generally tested from somewhat above idle to its maximum RPM and the output is measured and plotted on a [[Graph of a function|graph]].

A 'motoring' dynamometer provides the features of a brake dyno system, but in addition, can "power" (usually with an AC or DC motor) the PM and allow testing of very small power outputs (for example, duplicating speeds and loads that are experienced when operating a vehicle traveling downhill or during on/off throttle operations).

==Types of dynamometer test procedures==
There are essentially 3 types of dynamometer test procedures:

# Steady state: where the engine is held at a specified RPM (or series of usually sequential RPMs) for a desired amount of time by the variable brake loading as provided by the PAU (power absorber unit). These are performed with brake dynamometers.
# Sweep test: the engine is tested under a load (i.e. inertia or brake loading), but allowed to "sweep" up in RPM, in a continuous fashion, from a specified lower "starting" RPM to a specified "end" RPM. These tests can be done with inertia or brake dynamometers.
# Transient test: usually done with AC or DC dynamometers, the engine power and speed are varied throughout the test cycle. Different test cycles are used in different jurisdictions. Chassis test cycles include the US light-duty UDDS, HWFET, US06, SC03, ECE, EUDC, and CD34, while engine test cycles include ETC, HDDTC, HDGTC, WHTC, WHSC, and ED12.

===Types of sweep tests===
#'''Inertia sweep''': an inertia dyno system provides a fixed inertial mass flywheel and computes the power required to accelerate the flywheel (the load) from the starting to the ending RPM. The actual rotational mass of the engine (or engine and vehicle in the case of a chassis dyno) is not known, and the variability of even the mass of the tires will skew the power results. The inertia value of the flywheel is "fixed", so low-power engines are under load for a much longer time and internal engine temperatures are usually too high by the end of the test, skewing optimal "dyno" tuning settings away from the optimal tuning settings of the outside world. Conversely, high powered engines commonly complete a "4th gear sweep" test in less than 10 seconds, which is not a reliable load condition{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} as compared to operation in the real world. By not providing enough time under load, internal combustion chamber temperatures are unrealistically low and power readings - especially past the power peak - are skewed to the low side.
#'''Loaded sweep''', of the brake dyno type, includes:
## '''Simple fixed load sweep''': a fixed load - of somewhat less than the output of the engine - is applied during the test. The engine is allowed to accelerate from its starting RPM to its ending RPM, varying at its own acceleration rate, depending on power output at any particular rotational speed. Power is calculated using (rotational speed x torque x constant) + the power required to accelerate the dyno and engine's/vehicle's rotating mass.
## '''Controlled acceleration sweep''': similar in basic usage as the (above) simple fixed load sweep test, but with the addition of active load control that targets a specific rate of acceleration. Commonly, 20fps/ps is used.{{By whom|date=June 2011}}
#'''Controlled acceleration rate''': the acceleration rate used is controlled from low power to high power engines, and overextension and contraction of "test duration" is avoided, providing more repeatable tests and tuning results.

In every type of sweep test, there remains the issue of potential power reading error due to the variable engine/dyno/vehicle total rotating mass. Many modern computer-controlled brake dyno systems are capable of deriving that "inertial mass" value, so as to eliminate this error.{{Or|date=June 2011}}

A "sweep test" will almost always be suspect, as many "sweep" users ignore the rotating mass factor, preferring to use a blanket "factor" on every test on every engine or vehicle. Simple inertia dyno systems aren't capable of deriving "inertial mass", and thus are forced to use the same (assumed) inertial mass on every vehicle tested.

Using steady state testing eliminates the rotating inertial mass error of a sweep test, as there is no acceleration during this type of test.

===Transient test characteristics===
Aggressive throttle movements, engine speed changes, and engine motoring are characteristics of most transient engine tests. The usual purpose of these tests are vehicle emissions development and homologation. In some cases, the lower-cost eddy-current dynamometer is used to test one of the transient test cycles for early development and calibration. An eddy current dyno system offers fast load response, which allows rapid tracking of speed and load, but does not allow motoring. Since most required transient tests contain a significant amount of motoring operation, a transient test cycle with an eddy-current dyno will generate different emissions test results. Final adjustments are required to be done on a motoring-capable dyno.

===Engine dynamometer===
[[Image:TitanTestStand Rev2011.jpg|thumb|right|HORIBA engine dynamometer TITAN]]
An [[engine dynamometer]] measures power and torque directly from the engine's [[crankshaft]] (or [[flywheel]]), when the engine is removed from the vehicle. These dynos do not account for power losses in the drivetrain, such as the [[gearbox]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[differential (mechanics)|differential]].

===Chassis dynamometer (rolling road)===
{{main|Chassis dynamometer}}
[[Image:chassisdyno.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saab 96]] on chassis dynamometer]]
A [[chassis]] dynamometer, sometimes referred to as a rolling road,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rolling Road Dyno|url=http://www.tuningtools.co.uk/rolling-road-dyno-sales.html|work=Tuning Tools|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures power delivered to the surface of the "drive roller" by the drive [[wheel]]s. The vehicle is often parked on the roller or rollers, which the car then turns, and the output measured thereby.

Modern roller-type chassis dyno systems use the "Salvisberg roller",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=10&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=salvisberg&amp;OS=salvisberg&amp;RS=salvisberg|title=United States Patent: D798762 - Watch strap link|author=|date=|website=uspto.gov|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which improves traction and repeatability, as compared to the use of smooth or [[Knurling|knurled]] drive rollers. Chassis dynamometers can be fixed or portable, and can do much more than display RPM, horsepower, and torque. With modern electronics and quick reacting, low inertia dyno systems, it is now possible to tune to best power and the smoothest runs in real time.

Other types of chassis dynamometers are available that eliminate the potential for wheel slippage on old style drive rollers, attaching directly to the vehicle hubs for direct torque measurement from the axle.

[[Motor vehicle emissions]] development and homologation dynamometer test systems often integrate emissions sampling, measurement, engine speed and load control, data acquisition, and safety monitoring into a complete test cell system. These test systems usually include complex emissions sampling equipment (such as constant volume samplers and raw [[exhaust gas]] sample preparation systems) and analyzers. These analyzers are much more sensitive and much faster than a typical portable exhaust gas analyzer. Response times of well under one second are common, and are required by many transient test cycles. In retail settings it is also common to tune the air-fuel ratio using a wideband [[oxygen sensor]] that is graphed along with the RPM.

Integration of the dynamometer control system with automatic calibration tools for engine system calibration is often found in development test cell systems. In these systems, the dynamometer load and engine speed are varied to many engine operating points, while selected engine management parameters are varied and the results recorded automatically. Later analysis of this data may then be used to generate engine calibration data used by the engine management software.

Because of frictional and mechanical losses in the various drivetrain components, the measured rear wheel brake horsepower is generally 15-20 percent less than the brake horsepower measured at the crankshaft or flywheel on an engine dynamometer.&lt;ref&gt;John Dinkel, "Chassis Dynamometer", ''Road and Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary'', (Bentley Publishers, 2000) p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Graham-Desaguliers Dynamometer was invented by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] and mentioned in the writings of [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desagulier]] in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Allen W. and Daryl E. Miller, 1998, Movement Skill Assessment&lt;/ref&gt; Desaguliers modified the first dynamometers, and so the instrument became known as the Graham-Desaguliers dynamometer.

The Regnier dynamometer was invented and made public in 1798 by [[Edmé Régnier L'Aîné|Edmé Régnier]], a French rifle maker and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Régnier, Edmé. Description et usage du dynamomètre, 1798.&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent was issued (dated June 1817)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0YOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA757&amp;dq=marriott's+patent+weighing+machine&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=L-XITq_lLaiB4ASfo5jcAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=marriott's+patent+weighing+machine&amp;f=false|title=The Engineer's and Mechanic's Encyclopædia: Comprehending Practical Illustrations of the Machinery and Processes Employed in Every Description of Manufacuture of the British Empire|first=Luke|last=Hebert|date=7 April 2018|publisher=Kelly|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1EoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;dq=marriott+patent+weighing+machine+fleet+street&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dXpBfYJsnJ&amp;sig=1RMSAuTtewKrTUHUSNaa55S_72k&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=bu7IToarB-n04QT1qKgw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marriott+patent+weighing+machine+fleet+street&amp;f=false|title=The Monthly Magazine|author=|date=7 April 2018|publisher=R.

[[Gaspard de Prony]] invented the [[de Prony brake]] in 1821.

[[Macneill's road indicator]] was invented by [[John Benjamin Macneill|John Macneill]] in the late 1820s, further developing Marriot's patented weighing machine.

Froude Hofmann, of Worcester, UK, manufactures engine and vehicle dynamometers. They credit [[William Froude]] with the invention of the hydraulic dynamometer in 1877, and say that the first commercial dynamometers were produced in 1881 by their predecessor company, [[Heenan &amp; Froude]].

In 1928, the German company "''[[Carl Schenck]] Eisengießerei &amp; Waagenfabrik''" built the first vehicle dynamometers for brake tests that have the basic design of modern vehicle test stands.

The eddy current dynamometer was invented by Martin and Anthony Winther around 1931, but at that time, DC Motor/generator dynamometers had been in use for many years. A company founded by the Winthers brothers, Dynamatic Corporation, manufactured dynamometers in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] until 2002. Dynamatic was part of [[Eaton Corporation]] from 1946 to 1995. In 2002, Dyne Systems of [[Jackson, Washington County, Wisconsin|Jackson, Wisconsin]] acquired the Dynamatic dynamometer product line. Starting in 1938, Heenan &amp; Froude manufactured eddy current dynamometers for many years under license from Dynamatic and Eaton.&lt;ref name="Winther, Eddy currents" &gt;{{Cite book

Within the field of [[anthropology]] and other [[social science]]s, [[ethnography]] is a form of research that relies on a range of sources of data, but usually tends to rely mainly on [[participant observation]]. However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a ''genre of writing, one'' used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Works and Lives: The anthropologist as author|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=Stanford CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand. A work written using ethnographic realism may be referred to as a '''realist ethnography''', and classified as a subgenre of ethnography.

'''Extra-low voltage''' ('''ELV''') is an [[electricity supply]] [[voltage]] in a range which carries a low risk of dangerous [[electrical shock]].&lt;ref&gt;[[BS 7671]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[DIN]]/[[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|VDE]] 0100-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60364-4-41: Low-voltage electrical installations – Part 4-41: Protection for safety – Protection against electric shock.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61140: Protection against electric shock – Common aspects for installation and equipment.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various standards that define extra-low voltage. The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] member organizations and the UK IET (BS 7671:2008) define an ELV device or circuit as one in which the [[electrical potential]] between [[electrical conductor|conductor]] or electrical conductor and [[ground (electrical)|earth]] (ground) '''does not exceed''' 50&amp;nbsp;V a.c. or 120&amp;nbsp;V d.c. (ripple free). EU's [[Low Voltage Directive]] applies from 50&amp;nbsp;V a.c. or 75&amp;nbsp;V d.c.

The IEC and IET go on to define actual types of extra-low voltage systems, for example SELV, PELV, FELV. These can be supplied using sources including motor / fossil fuel generator sets, transformers, switched PSU's or rechargeable battery. SELV, PELV, FELV, are distinguished by various [[safety]] properties, supply characteristics and design voltages.

Some types of [[landscape lighting]] use SELV / PELV (extra-low voltage) systems. Modern battery operated hand tools fall in the SELV category. In more arduous conditions 25 [[volt]]s [[root mean square|RMS]] [[alternating current]] / 60 volts (ripple-free) [[direct current]] can be specified to further reduce hazard. Lower voltage can apply in wet or conductive conditions where there is even greater potential for electric shock. These systems should still fall under the SELV / PELV (ELV) safety specifications.

==Types==

===Separated or safety extra-low voltage (SELV)===
IEC defines a SELV system as "an electrical system in which the voltage cannot exceed ELV under normal conditions, and under single-fault conditions, ''including'' [[Ground (electricity)|earth fault]]s in other circuits". It is generally accepted that the acronym: '''SELV''' stands for '''separated extra-low voltage''' (separated from earth) as defined in installation standards (e.g. [[BS 7671]]), though BS EN 60335 refers to it as '''safety extra-low voltage'''.

A SELV circuit must have:
* Electrical protective-separation (i.e. [[double insulation]], reinforced insulation or protective screening) from all circuits other than SELV and PELV (i.e. all circuits that might carry higher voltages)
* Simple separation from other SELV systems, from PELV systems and from earth (ground)

The safety of a SELV circuit is provided by
* The extra-low voltage
* The low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage
* The lack of a return path through earth (ground) that [[electric current]] could take in case of contact with a human body

The design of a SELV circuit typically involves an isolating [[transformer]], guaranteed minimum distances between conductors and [[electrical insulation]] barriers.  The [[electrical connector]]s of SELV circuits should be designed such that they do not mate with connectors commonly used for non-SELV circuits.

Typical examples for a SELV circuit: decorative out-door lighting, [[Appliance classes|Class III]] [[battery charger]], fed from a Class II [[power supply]]. Modern cordless hand tools are considered SELV equipment.

===Protected extra-low voltage (PELV)===
IEC 61140 defines a PELV system as "an electrical system in which the voltage cannot exceed ELV under normal conditions, and under single-fault conditions, ''except'' earth faults in other circuits".

A PELV circuit only requires protective-separation from all circuits other than SELV and PELV (i.e., all circuits that might carry higher voltages), but it may have connections to other PELV systems and earth (ground).

In contrast to a SELV circuit, a PELV circuit can have a [[protective earth]] (ground) connection. A PELV circuit, just as with SELV, requires a design that guarantees a low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage. For a transformer, this can mean that the primary and secondary windings must be separated by an extra insulation barrier, or by a conductive shield with a protective earth connection.

A typical example for a PELV circuit is a [[computer]] with a [[Appliance classes|Class I]] [[power supply]].

===Functional extra-low voltage (FELV)===
The term functional extra-low voltage (FELV) describes any other extra-low-voltage circuit that does not fulfill the requirements for an SELV or PELV circuit. Although the FELV part of a circuit uses an extra-low voltage, it is not adequately protected from accidental contact with higher voltages in other parts of the circuit. Therefore the protection requirements for the higher voltage have to be applied to the entire circuit.

Examples for FELV circuits include those that generate an extra low voltage through a [[semiconductor]] device or a [[potentiometer]] or a transformer. A typical example is an electronically controlled toaster where the timer circuit runs off extra low voltage derived from a tap on the heating element. Another is the old door-bell circuit fed from a transformer.

===UK Reduced low voltage (RLV)===
The IET / BSI (BS 7671) also define Reduced low voltage (RLV) which can be either single phase or three phase A.C. This system has been used for many years on construction sites. Both single and three phase. The single phase voltage is 110&amp;nbsp;V a.c. though having a "centre tapped Earth" reducing the voltage to Earth to 55&amp;nbsp;V a.c. The three phase is 110&amp;nbsp;V phase to phase, 63&amp;nbsp;V to Neutral / Earth. This system is slightly outside ELV but still very commonly used for cord powered hand tools and temporary lighting in hazardous areas.

==Stand-alone power systems==
Cabling for extra-low voltage systems, such as in [[remote-area power system]]s (RAPS), is designed to minimise energy losses while maximising safety. Lower voltages require a higher current for the same power. The higher current results in greater resistive losses in the cabling. Cable sizing must therefore consider maximum demand, voltage drop over the cable, and [[current-carrying capacity]]. Voltage drop is usually the main factor considered, but [[current-carrying capacity]] is as important when considering short, high-current runs such as between a battery bank and inverter.

[[Electric arc|Arcing]] is a risk in DC ELV systems, and some fuse types which can cause undesired arcing include semi-enclosed, rewireable and [[fuse (automotive)|automotive fuse]] types. Instead [[Fuse (electrical)#Characteristic parameters|high rupturing capacity]] fuses and appropriately rated [[circuit breaker]]s are the recommended type for RAPS. Cable termination and connections must be done properly to avoid arcing also, and [[soldering]] is not recommended.

==Regulations==
Precise definitions of "extra low voltage" are given in applicable wiring regulations in a region.

===EU===
In the European Union, the ''[[Low Voltage Directive]]'' defines low voltage starting from 50&amp;nbsp;V AC, and 75&amp;nbsp;V DC. The directive only covers electrical equipment and not voltages appearing inside equipment or voltages in electrical components. [[IEC 60364]] defines it as 50 V AC and 120 V DC.

===Australia and New Zealand===
AS/NZS 3000 ''Wiring Rules'' define "extra low voltage" as "Not exceeding 50&amp;nbsp;V a.c or 120&amp;nbsp;V ripple-free d.c." However, AS/ACIF S009 Clause 3.1.78.1 Extra-Low Voltage (ELV)states: "a voltage not exceeding 42.4&amp;nbsp;V peak or 60&amp;nbsp;V d.c.[AS/NZS 60950.1:2003]" and adds a note: "This definition differs from the ELV definition contained in AS/NZS 3000:2000" which is more closely aligned to the Telecommunications Network Voltage (TNV) limits&amp;nbsp;... i.e. 120&amp;nbsp;V d.c. or 70.7&amp;nbsp;V a.c. peak (50&amp;nbsp;V a.c. r.m.s.)" which accommodates telephone ringing voltage on the nominally &amp;minus;48&amp;nbsp;Vdc battery supply which could be encountered on a telephone line and was not considered hazardous, whereas 120&amp;nbsp;Vac without current limiting at its source can inject 115mA into individuals leading to fibrillation of the heart.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, ELV (''Extra-baixa tensão'' or ''EBT'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is officially defined in Regulatory Standard no. 10 from the [[Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment]] as any voltage "not exceeding 50 volts a.c. or 120 volts d.c.".&lt;ref name="NR10"&gt;{{cite web | website = Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment Website | url = http://portal.mte.gov.br/data/files/8A7C816A38CF493C013906EC437E23BF/NR-10%20%28atualizada%29.pdf | language = portuguese | date = December 7, 2004 | accessdate = September 9, 2015 | title = NR-10 atualizada - Glossário |trans-title=updated NR-10 - Glossary }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that standard defines safety rules for electricity, the Regulatory Standard no. 12 requires an even lower voltage for start and stop devices on machines and equipment made from March 2012 and on, stating it shall not exceed 25 volts a.c. or 60 volts d.c.&lt;ref name="NR12"&gt;{{cite web | website = Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment Website | url = http://portal.mte.gov.br/data/files/8A7C816A4DA189CA014E505FF4496DF0/NR-12%20%28atualizada%202015%29.pdf | language = portuguese | date = June 25, 2015 | accessdate = September 9, 2015 | title = NR-12 atualizada - item 12.36 |trans-title=updated NR-12 - Item 12.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gene redundancy''' is the existence of multiple genes in the genome of an organism that perform the same function. This is the case for many sets of [[paralogous]] genes. When an individual gene in such a set is disrupted by mutation or targeted [[gene knockout|knockout]], there can be little effect on [[phenotype]] as a result of gene redundancy, whereas the effect is large for the knockout of a gene with only one copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pérez-Pérez JM, Candela H, Micol JL |title=Understanding synergy in genetic interactions |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=368–76 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19665253 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gene Duplication.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Figure 1. Common mechanisms of gene duplication.]]

== Origin and Evolution of Redundant Genes ==
Gene redundancy most often results from [[Gene duplication]]. When a gene is duplicated within a genome, the two copies are initially functionally redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Genetic Redundancy Caused By Gene Duplications And Its Evolution In Networks Of Transcriptional Regulators|last = Wagner|first = Andreas|date = 1996|journal = Biological Cybernetics|doi = 10.1007/s004220050267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the more common mechanisms of gene duplication are [[Retroposon|retroposition,]] unequal [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]], and non-homologous segmental duplication. Retroposition is when the mRNA transcript of a gene is reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted into the genome at a different location. During unequal crossing over, [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] chromosomes exchange uneven portions of their DNA. This can lead to the transfer of one chromosome's gene to the other chromosome, leaving two of the same gene on one chromosome, and no copies of the gene on the other chromosome. Non-homologous duplications result from replication errors that shift the gene of interest into a new position. A tandem duplication then occurs, creating a chromosome with two copies of the same gene. Figure 1 to the left provides a good visual explanation of these three mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurles|first=Matthew|title=Gene Duplication: The Genomic Trade in Spare Parts|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020206|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=2|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020206|pmc=449868|pmid=15252449|page=e206}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Evolution of redundant genes.png|thumb|398x398px|Figure 2. After a duplication event, redundant genes undergo either subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or gene loss]]As the genome is replicated over many generations, the redundant gene's function will most likely evolve due to [[Genetic drift]]. This means that the gene will acquire mutations that change the overall function. The three mechanisms of functional differentiation in genes are nonfunctionalization (or gene loss), neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Evolutionary Fate and Consequences of Duplicate Genes|last = Lynch|first = M.|date = 2000|journal = Science|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During nonfunctionalization, or degeneration/gene loss, one copy of the duplicated gene acquires mutations that render it inactive or [[Gene silencing|silent]]. At this time, the gene has no function and is called a [[pseudogene]]. Pseudogenes can be lost over time due to genetic mutations. Neofunctionalization occurs when one copy of the gene accumulates mutations that give the gene a new, beneficial function that is different than the original function. Subfunctionalization occurs when both copies of the redundant gene acquire mutations. Each copy becomes only partially active; two of these partial copies then act as one normal copy of the original gene. Figure 2 to the right provides a visual explanation.

== Gene Maintenance Hypotheses ==
The evolution and origin of redundant genes remain unknown, largely because evolution happens over such a long period of time. Theoretically, a gene can not be maintained without mutation unless it has a selective pressure acting on it. Gene redundancy, therefore, would allow both copies of the gene to accumulate mutations as long as the other was still able to perform its function. This means that all redundant genes should theoretically become a [[pseudogene]] and eventually be lost. Scientists have devised two hypothesis as to why redundant genes can remain in the genome: the backup hypothesis and the piggyback hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Genetic Redundancies and Their Evolutionary Maintenance|last = Zhang|first = Jianzhi|date = 2012|journal = Evolutionary Systems Biology Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The backup hypothesis proposes that redundant genes remain in the genome as a sort of "back-up plan". If the original gene loses its function, the redundant gene is there to take over and keep the cell alive. The piggyback hypothesis states that two [http://homepage.usask.ca/~ctl271/857/def_homolog.shtml paralogs] in the genome have some kind of non-overlapping function as well as the redundant function. In this case, the redundant part of the gene remains in the genome due to the proximity to the area that codes for the unique function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Qian|first = Wenfeng|last2 = Liao|first2 = Ben-Yang|last3 = Chang|first3 = Andrew Y.-F.|last4 = Zhang|first4 = Jianzhi|date = 2010-10-01|title = Maintenance of duplicate genes and their functional redundancy by reduced expression|journal = Trends in Genetics|volume = 26|issue = 10|pages = 425–430|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.002|issn = 0168-9525|pmc = 2942974|pmid = 20708291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason redundant genes remain in the genome is an ongoing question and gene redundancy is being studied by researchers everywhere. There are many hypotheses in addition to the backup and piggyback models. For example, at the University of Michigan, a study provides the theory that redundant genes are maintained in the genome by reduced expression.

== Research ==

=== Gene Families and Phylogeny ===
Researchers often use the history of redundant genes in the form of [[Gene family|gene families]] to learn about the phylogeny of a species. It takes time for redundant genes to undergo functional diversification;  the degree of diversification between [http://homepage.usask.ca/~ctl271/857/def_homolog.shtml orthologs] tells us how closely related the two genomes are. Gene duplication events can also be detected by looking at increases in gene duplicates.

A good example of using gene redundancy in evolutionary studies is the [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00438-015-1142-3 Evolution of the KCS gene family in plants]. This paper studies how one KCS gene evolved into an entire gene family via duplication events. The number of redundant genes in the species allows researchers to determine when duplication events took place and how closely related species are.

=== Locating and Characterizing Redundant Genes ===
Currently, there are three ways to detect paralogs in a known genomic sequence: simple homology (FASTA), gene family evolution ([http://treefam.genomics.org.cn/ TreeFam]) and [http://eggnogdb.embl.de/ orthology (eggNOG v3]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=Minou|date=2006-01-01|title=Identification and mapping of paralogous genes on a known genomic DNA sequence|journal=[[Methods in Molecular Biology]]|volume=338|pages=21–29|doi=10.1385/1-59745-097-9:21|issn=1064-3745|pmid=16888348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Human Genome Project]]'s completion, researchers are able to annotate the human genome much more easily. Using online databases like the [https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway Genome Browser] at UCSC, researchers can look for homology in the sequence of their gene of interest.

== Human Redundant Genes ==

=== Olfactory Receptors ===
The Human Olfactory Receptor (OR) gene family contains 339 intact genes and 297 pseudogenes. These genes are found in different locations throughout the genome, but only about 13% are on different chromosomes or on distantly spaced loci. 172 subfamilies of OR genes have been found in humans, each at its own loci. Because the genes in each of these subfamilies are structurally and functionally similar, and in close proximity to each other, it is hypothesized that each evolved from single genes undergoing duplication events. The high number of subfamilies in humans explains why we are able to recognize so many odors.

Human OR genes have homologues in other mammals, such as mice, that demonstrate the evolution of Olfactory Receptor genes. One particular family that is involved in the initial event of odor perception has been found to be highly conserved throughout all of vertebrate evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malnic|first=Bettina|last2=Godfrey|first2=Paul A.|last3=Buck|first3=Linda B.|date=2004-02-24|title=The human olfactory receptor gene family|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/8/2584|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|language=en|volume=101|issue=8|pages=2584–2589|doi=10.1073/pnas.0307882100|issn=0027-8424|pmc=356993|pmid=14983052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease ===
Duplication events and redundant genes have often been thought to have a role in some human diseases. Large scale whole genome duplication events that occurred early in vertebrate evolution may be the reason that human monogenic disease genes often contain a high number of redundant genes. Chen et al. hypothesizes that the functionally redundant paralogs in human monogenic disease genes mask the effects of dominant deletorious mutations, thereby maintaining the disease gene in the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Wei-Hua|last2=Zhao|first2=Xing-Ming|last3=van Noort|first3=Vera|last4=Bork|first4=Peer|date=2013-05-01|title=Human Monogenic Disease Genes Have Frequently Functionally Redundant Paralogs|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=9|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073|issn=1553-734X|pmc=3656685|pmid=23696728|page=e1003073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole genome duplications may be a leading cause of retention of some tumor causing genes in the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malaguti|first=Giulia|last2=Singh|first2=Param Priya|last3=Isambert|first3=Hervé|date=2014-05-01|title=On the retention of gene duplicates prone to dominant deleterious mutations|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=93|pages=38–51|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2014.01.004|issn=1096-0325|pmid=24530892}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Strout et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strout|first=Matthew P.|last2=Marcucci|first2=Guido|last3=Bloomfield|first3=Clara D.|last4=Caligiuri|first4=Michael A.|date=1998-03-03|title=The partial tandem duplication of ALL1 (MLL) is consistently generated by Alu-mediated homologous recombination in  acute myeloid leukemia|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=95|issue=5|pages=2390–2395|issn=0027-8424|pmc=19353|pmid=9482895|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.5.2390}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that tandem duplication events, likely via homologous recombination, are linked to [[acute myeloid leukemia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Gerontechnology''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic and professional field combining [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[House|housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]] and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of  ages.

==Description==
Gerontechnology, which has also been called '''''gerotechnology''''' is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the [[life-span]]. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the [[cost of care]].

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of '''domains of human activity''': (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, and (2) '''technology interventions''' or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research. Such research supports the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

==Gerontological design==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization.  Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population. Demographic Realities: Opportunities and Challenges |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |url=http://www.mcys.gov.sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028115440/http://www.mcys.gov.sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies show that in 2002, 7% of the world's population is aged 65 and above. By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond. International Brief (Report No. WP/02-1)|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=July 31, 2008|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/wp02-1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Population ageing|aging population]] and its impact on [[economics]], [[politics]], [[education]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is no longer an isolated issue but a global concern. Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

'''HomeSeer Technologies LLC''' is a technology company based in [[Bedford, New Hampshire]], in the United States. HomeSeer makes [[home automation]] controllers and software, designed to integrate lighting, [[HVAC]], security, [[Audiovisual|AV]] and other subsystems in most homes. Additionally, the company maintains an online store of compatible home automation products and a free online community [[Internet forum|forum]] for users and dealers.

== History ==

===1999-2004===
[[File:HomeSeer_HS1_CD_Media.png|thumb|HS1 v1.7 distribution CD from 2004.]]
HomeSeer was founded in 1999 by company president Richard Helmke. At the time, Helmke was employed as Software Project Leader for [[Cabletron Systems|Cabletron]] (later becoming [[Enterasys Networks|Enterasys]]) in [[Rochester, New Hampshire]]. Helmke developed an interest in home automation and set about to find a software program that would fit his needs. After trying several programs, Helmke elected to create his own program (initially named ''AutoHome''), and launched that effort, as a part-time pursuit, under the company name "Keware". Shortly after release, Keware was renamed ''HomeSeer'' and AutoHome was renamed ''HomeSeer v1'' or ''HS1'' for short. At first, the software was compatible with [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]] light switches, plug-in modules and controllers. Over time, support was added for additional products such as the ADI Ocelot, JDS Stargate controller and WGL W800 wireless receivers. An open [[API]] coupled with a freely available [[Software development kit|SDK]] was added to encourage 3rd party development of plug-in (drivers) for support of additional technologies and products. HS1 included support for remote internet access and voice control using [[Microsoft Speech API|Microsoft speech technology (SAPI)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chron.com/news/article/Working-Home-2016743.php| title=Simple, low-cost automation kit turns lights on when nobody's home |publisher=Houston Chronicle| last=Currid| first=Cheryl| date=16 August 2001| accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sales of HS1 increased, a message board forum was implemented to provide community-based support for HS1 users.

In 2002, Helmke left his position at Enterasys to focus solely on HomeSeer.

In 2003, driver support was added to HS1 for [[Z-Wave]], a wireless [[Mesh networking|mesh network]] technology. At that time, the technology was in its infancy with only a handful of lighting products available from ''Advanced Control Technologies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://products.z-wavealliance.org/Search/DoAdvancedSearch?regionId=2&amp;category=-1&amp;manufacturer=13|title=Z-Wave Product Catalog|publisher=Z-Wave Alliance|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]]. As of 2015, the [[Z-Wave|Z-Wave Alliance]] reported there were more than 1,400 Z-Wave certified products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave-pavilion-promotes-robust-smart-home-ecosystem-to-installer-community-at-cedia-expo/|title=Z-Wave Pavilion Promotes Robust Smart Home Ecosystem to Installer Community at CEDIA EXPO.|publisher=[[Z-Wave|Z-Wave Alliance]]|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including light switches, thermostats, door locks, water valves, garage door controllers, sensors and other products.

In 2004, HomeSeer released its first hardware product, the ''ZU0100-001'' Z-Wave USB interface. This product functioned as a Z-Wave [[transceiver]] to allow HS1 software to communicate with wireless Z-Wave devices.

===2005-2010===
August 2005 marked the release of HS2 software. The new version was designed as a [[web application]] to allow for remote set up and configuration, as well as remote control. A professional version (HSPRO) targeting custom installers and featuring advanced Z-Wave support with pre-licensed plug-ins, was also released. In December, the company's first hardware controller (PRO-100) was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/reviews/channel-programs/189501102/review-homeseers-home-controller-gets-smarter.htm|title=Review: HomeSeer's Home Controller Gets Smarter|publisher=CRN|last=Morejon|first=Mario|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRO-100 was a [[Mechanical fan|fan-less]] design with [[Solid-state drive#DOM|DOM]] storage that included an embedded installation of HSPRO software.

In 2006, HomeSeer released the ''Z-Troller'', a handheld Z-Wave network controller that doubled as a Z-Wave interface. Since Z-Troller was both a network controller ''and'' interface, it supported advanced features such as network optimization and network backup and restore. In October, the PRO-100 was upgraded to a faster Series II model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/10/28/homeseer-announces-pro-100-series-ii-home-automation-controller/|title=HomeSeer announces PRO-100 Series-II home automation controller|publisher=Engadget|last=Murph|first=Darren|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, HomeSeer released the ''HSM100'', a battery operated Z-Wave 'multisensor' with built-in sensors for [[Motion detector|motion]], [[Thermometer|temperature]] and [[Photodetector|light level]]. The HSM100 was well suited for home automation ''events'' that relied on some combination of its sensor data. HomeSeer's ''HomeTroller'' was also released in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/press_release_homeseer_unveils_new_hometroller_home_automation_controller/ |title=HomeSeer Unveils New HomeTroller Home Automation Controller |publisher=CEPro.com |accessdate=25 November 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide functionality similar to the PRO-100 but at a lower price point. Unlike the PRO-100, the original HomeTroller was equipped with a conventional mechanical hard drive, active cooling (with fans) and embedded HS2 software. Subsequent versions were released with passive cooling (no fans) and with DOM, [[Secure Digital|SD Card]] or [[SSD]] storage to improve reliability.

In 2009, HomeSeer released its first [[mobile app]], a software program called ''HSTouch''. Originally developed for [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iOS]] platform, HSTouch gave HomeSeer users the ability to monitor and control their homes with their [[iPhone]]s and [[iPod]]s. A companion program, ''HSTouch Designer'', was also released for those who wished to customize the mobile app with their own screen designs and graphics.

In 2010, HomeSeer released its [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version of HSTouch mobile app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_hstouch_android_app/|title=HomeSeer is putting customized HSTouch control into the palm of Android users.|publisher=CEPro|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, HomeTroller was upgraded to the S3 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_exploits_rise_of_android_fall_of_charmed_quark/|title=HomeSeer Exploits Rise of Android, Fall of Charmed Quark|publisher=CEPro|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011-2013===
[[File:HomeTroller-SE_Home_Controller.png|thumb|HomeTroller-SE was in production from 2011-2014]]
In 2011, HomeSeer released the HomeTroller-SE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/reviews/homeseer-hometroller-se-pro-home-automation-controller-review.html|title=HomeSeer Hometroller SE-Pro Home Automation Controller Review|publisher=Automated Home|last=Watt|first=Ken|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its new entry level controller. The -SE model featured a less powerful [[CPU]] and fewer features than the standard HomeTroller model but at approximately half the cost. An even lower cost ''HomeTroller-Mini'' was also in the works with a prototype unit debuting at CES 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/01/07/homeseer-hometroller-mini-home-automation-controller-gets-you-on/|title=HomeSeer HomeTroller-Mini home automation controller gets you one step closer to the bachelor pad of the future|publisher=Engadget|last=Trout|first=Christopher|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the HomeTroller-Mini design was later abandoned before release because of parts availability and cost issues.

In 2013, HomeSeer released HS3, a significant upgrade to the HS2 version. HS3 included an all-new [[JQuery UI|JQuery]] web [[GUI]], redesigned automation 'engine', multi-network Z-Wave support and new counter and timer features. A professional version, ''HS3PRO'', was also released to service the dealer channel.

HomeSeer's HomeTroller Zee was also released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_debuts_its_smallest_cheapest_home_automation_hub/|title=HomeSeer Debuts its Smallest, Cheapest Home Automation Hub|publisher=CEPro|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zee was based on the [[Raspberry Pi|Raspberry Pi1 model B computer]], included HS3 software and was bundled with an [[Aeon Labs]] Z-Stick Z-Wave interface. HomeTroller Zee replaced the HomeTroller-SE as the company's entry level home controller.

===2014===
In January 2014, HomeSeer introduced voice programming and automatic camera support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocoontech.com/forums/page/articles/_/news/events/ces-2014-exclusive-update-homeseer-technologies-r781|title=CES 2014: Exclusive Update - HomeSeer Technologies|publisher=Cocoontech|last=Lavelle|first=Morgan|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_adds_camera_voice_support_to_hometroller_zee/|title=HomeSeer Adds Camera, Voice Support to HomeTroller Zee|publisher=CEPro|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their controllers. Voice programming allowed users to create automation events solely by voice using any Android mobile device. Automatic camera support was designed to automatically detect and configure settings for [[Foscam]] brand IP cameras. This allowed the cameras to be viewed with the HSTouch mobile app.

In March, HomeSeer released the model WFTT07 ''Control Pad'' free-standing 7" Android tabletop [[touchscreen]] embedded with their HSTouch mobile app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-makes-a-tabletop-touchscreen-for-android-users/|title=HomeSeer Makes a Tabletop Smart Home Touchscreen for Android Users|publisher=Electronic House|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was designed to function as a WiFi connected control [[Web portal|portal]] for HomeSeer controllers.

In April, HomeSeer launched ''MyHomeSeer-Remote'' (''MyHS'') remote access web service for HS3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/homeseer_adds_cloud_service_to_home_automation_system/|title=HomeSeer Adds Cloud Service to Home Automation System|publisher=CEPro|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MyHS simplified the process of enabling remote access to HomeSeer systems by eliminating the need to adjust [[Router (computing)|router]] settings or use [[DDNS]] technology. MyHS was also designed to optimize connection performance in the home by automatically providing a direct [[Local area network|LAN]] connection for users attempting to access their systems on the local [[Subnetwork|sub-net]].

In September, HomeSeer released their ''HomeTroller-SEL'' to replace the HomeTroller-SE as the company's mid-level controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-makes-new-hometroller-sel-home-controller-faster-and-more-affordab/|title=HomeSeer Makes New HomeTroller-SEL Home Controller Faster and More Affordable|publisher=Electronic House|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the [[Windows XP|WindowsXP]]-based SE, the new SEL model included a faster CPU, twice the [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and SSD storage, all running on a [[Debian]] distribution of [[Linux]].

Also in September, HomeSeer released their ''A2Z-Link'' Z-Wave bridge module and the ''HSM200'' Z-Wave multi-sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-puts-z-wave-into-2-new-home-automation-products/|title=HomeSeer Puts Z-Wave into 2 New Home Automation Products|publisher=Electronic House|last=Cericola|first=Rachel|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The A2Z-Link module was similar in design to the HomeTroller Zee but also included a newly developed [[Communications protocol|protocol]] to allow other controller manufacturers to communicate with Z-Wave devices using simple [[JSON]] or [[ASCII]] commands. A2Z-Link was conceived as an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] product; not intended for direct to consumer sales.
* The new HSM200 was [[Mains electricity|line-powered]], allowing the unit to function as a Z-Wave [[repeater]]. HSM200 also included an [[RGB color model|RGB]] [[LED]] indicator that could be controlled by HomeSeer systems to change colors when things happened in the home.

In November, the HomeTroller S6 becomes HomeSeer's new [[flagship]] home controller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-promises-efficient-home-automation-with-hometroller-s6/|title=HomeSeer Promises Efficient Home Automation with HomeTroller S6|publisher=Electronic House|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the PRO-100.

===2015===
In January 2015, HomeSeer released the Z-NET,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/homeseer-z-net-can-combine-232-z-wave-home-automation-devices/|title=HomeSeer Z-NET Can Combine Up to 232 Z-Wave Home Automation Devices|publisher=Electronic House|last=Rachel|first=Cericola|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Internet Protocol|IP-enabled]] remote Z-Wave interface for use with its HS3-based systems. Since Z-NET works over a network connection, it can be placed nearly anywhere in the home and may also be used in outbuildings, vacation homes or other secondary residences.

In April, HomeSeer launched its [[IFTTT]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/enabling_richer_home_automation_through_limited_ifttt_smart_home_engine/|title=Enabling Richer Home Automation Through IFTTT Smart-Home Engine|publisher=CEPro|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFTTT is a web service that allows users to create ''recipes'' that connect products, services and apps from more than 200 different companies around the world. The principal benefit of launching the channel is that it provides web-based integration for products, services and apps for which there are no native HomeSeer drivers (plug-ins). For example, a HomeSeer/IFTTT user could activate the [[ESPN]] sports network IFTTT channel and create a recipe to launch a HomeSeer event to turn on their TV and speak an alert when a sporting event begins.

In May, HomeSeer released its HomeTroller Zee S2 controller, based on the Raspberry Pi2 computer. Compared to the original Zee, the S2 model included a faster CPU, had twice the RAM and it included an internal [[Sigma Designs|Sigma]] 500 series Z-Wave module for native Z-Wave support. At the same time, several HomeSeer products underwent and achieved [http://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave_plus_certification/ Z-Wave Plus certification]. These products included HS3 software, HomeTroller Zee S2, HomeTroller-SEL, HomeTroller S6, Z-NET, SmartStick+ and A2Z-Link.

In December, HomeSeer released its Skill (app) for the [[Amazon Echo]]. The Skill allows HomeSeer users to control their systems by voice using the Amazon Echo.

===2016===
In March 2016, HomeSeer released a line of Z-Wave Plus lighting products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twice.com/news/home-automation/homeseer-adds-z-wave-plus-products/60922|title=HomeSeer Adds Z-Wave Plus Products|publisher=Twice.com|last=Palenchar|first=Joseph|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line included the HS-WS100+ wall switch, HS-WD100+ wall dimmer, HS-WA100+ wall accessory (for 3-way circuits), HS-PD100+ lamp module, HS-PA100+ appliance module and HS-DTA19+ smart light bulb.

== Compatible Technologies &amp; Products ==

Discussing the role of the hype man in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[Royce da 5'9"]] describes how a hype man can contribute to a live performance: "a lot of my verses [can] be so constant with the flow [that] I'd need somebody to help me."&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lateef the Truthspeaker|Lateef]] has stated, "You're gonna have to have somebody say something somewhere to give you a breath... usually it's just a matter of getting somebody to hit some line or some word in a line—that's all you really need."&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"/&gt;

==Origins==
Early [[hip hop]] hype men included Cowboy and Creole of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].&lt;ref name= Hilltop/&gt;&lt;ref name=IconsofHipHop/&gt; [[Kool Moe Dee]] calls Creole “the original hype man”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thafoundation.com/moedee.htm |title=Kool Moe Dee |publisher=Thafoundation.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Public Enemy 4.jpg|thumb|right|American rapper [[Flavor Flav]] hyping up a crowd in May 2008]]
The quintessential hype man, for many fans and musicians of the era, was [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s hype man [[Flavor Flav]], whose exuberant approach to the art in the group's recordings and videos made him, arguably, the first household-name hype man, a figure more famous than many MCs. He established many of the conventions of the craft, such as an outlandish sense of style (epitomized by his wearing of large clocks around his neck) and a vocal style that contrasted dramatically with that of the MC (his rasping high voice was a counterpoint to [[Chuck D]]'s booming baritone).
[[File:Hype-Man Relione with Chef Sean .jpg|thumb|right|Hype man Relione (right) performing with rapper Chef Sean]]

==Examples==&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE WITHOUT RELIABLE CITATIONS --&gt;

Examples of hype men include [[Freaky Tah]] of the [[The Lost Boyz|Lost Boyz]], [[Memphis Bleek]] for [[Jay-Z]], and [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] and [[Mr. Porter]] of [[D12]] for [[Eminem]].&lt;ref name="IconsofHipHop" /&gt; ''Icons of Hip Hop'' also notes that some producers, such as [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Swizz Beatz]], and [[Jermaine Dupri]], "have transitioned from a hype man role to become [[rapper]]s and stars in their own right".&lt;ref name="IconsofHipHop" /&gt;

The '''I Look Like an Engineer''' movement was created in August 2015 by software developer [[Isis Anchalee]] (formerly Isis Wenger) as a response to the backlash the [[OneLogin]] recruitment ad in which she was featured received. The movement aspired to break the [[stereotype]]s and promote diversity around [[Minority group|unrepresented groups]], particularly (Women, POC, and LGBTQ+) within the engineering industry. Its primary tactic is the use of the [[hashtag]] #ILookLikeAnEngineer on social media sites such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Instagram]], along with pictures of engineers or engineering students.

The I Look Like an Engineer movement has sparked other similar movements that also seek to break stereotypes in their industry, such as I Look Like a Surgeon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/surgeon-hashtag-takes-highlighting-women-article-1.2325102|title=‘I Look Like a Surgeon’ hashtag takes off after ‘I Look Like an Engineer’ movement that celebrated women in STEM|website=New York Daily News|publisher=New York Daily News|last1=Engel|first1=Meredith|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; I Look like a Professor and I Look Like a Civil Engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilooklikeacivilengineer.com|title=Diversity in Civil Engineering – I Look Like a Civil Engineer|website=www.ilooklikeacivilengineer.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== OneLogin campaign ==
In the summer of 2015 [[OneLogin]], a software company in San Francisco created a recruitment campaign aimed at attracting engineers to their home office in San Francisco. Four employees were invited to participate, including Anchalee. The ads were placed in the BART public transit stations and showed several OneLogin engineers sharing their experience working for the company. The ad featuring Anchalee went viral on several social media sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-33783007|title=What does an engineer look like?|date=2015-08-05|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-look-like-an-engineer_us_55c0be70e4b06363d5a35cfd|title=#ILookLikeAnEngineer Destroys The Tech Nerd Stereotype|last=Fellow|first=Lorenzo Ligato Editorial|last2=Post|first2=The Huffington|date=2015-08-04|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/technology/hashtag-aims-to-break-gender-stereotypes-in-engineering.html|title=Woman Behind #ILookLikeAnEngineer Says Campaign Against Gender Stereotypes Is ‘Long Overdue’|last=Varn|first=Kathryn|date=2015-08-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the launch of the campaign went viral, OneLogin posted an article on their blog that talked about the importance of diversity, inclusion, and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onelogin.com/blog/we-are-onelogin|title=We are OneLogin - OneLogin|website=OneLogin|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movement beginnings ==
The [[OneLogin]] recruitment ad featuring Isis Anchalee went viral as her particular ad received comments stating the belief that she was a model and not an actual engineer. Anchalee took to [https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f#.o1j97etct social media] where she posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper describing her job and a caption with the hashtag, #ILookLikeanEngineer. In her post she stated her belief that it is important to raise awareness in tech diversity and break the stereotypes of what an engineer should look like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lien|first1=Tracy|title=Think you know what an engineer looks like? #ilooklikeanengineer says think again|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-i-look-like-an-engineer-20150804-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tyler|first1=Carolyn|title=BAY AREA WOMAN CHALLENGES ENGINEER STEREOTYPES IN NEW AD CAMPAIGN|url=http://abc7news.com/technology/bay-area-woman-challenges-engineer-stereotypes-in-campaign/905064/|website=[[ABC 7 News]]|publisher=ABC|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her post started the hashtag trend and the hashtag was used 86,000 times by August 7, 2015. The hashtag has been used in approximately 50 countries. The hashtag is mainly used by women and LGBTQ engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Avianne|title=ILookLikeAnEngineer Campaign Expands From Twitter to Billboard in Fight Against Stereotypes|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ilooklikeanengineer-campaign-expands-twitter-billboard-fight-stereotypes/story?id=32945366|website=ABC News|publisher=ABC|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mather|first1=Laura|title=From Awareness to Action: How Technology Can Transform Its Industry's Own Bias Problem|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-mather/technology-bias-problem_b_8009896.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f|title=You May Have Seen My Face on BART – The Coffeelicious|last=Anchalee|first=Isis|date=2015-08-01|website=Medium|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Anchalee put up a now-defunct [http://www.ilooklikeanengineer.com/ webpage] to establish a safe platform for individuals to share their experiences related to diversity issues within tech fields.

== Support ==
In an effort to make a lasting impact, Michelle Glauser (the spouse of Anchalee co-worker) began a fundraising campaign using [[Indiegogo]] to create billboards with pictures that people had shared on social media using the hashtag #ILookLikeanEngineer. The proceeds were used to put up more billboards to further the I Look Like an Engineer campaign and excess proceeds were used to fund organizations that teach programming to minorities. The fundraiser’s goal was to raise $3,500. The campaigned ended on September 5, 2015 with $47,285 raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/let-s-put-up-an-ilooklikeanengineer-billboard#/|title=Let's Put Up An #ILookLikeAnEngineer Billboard|website=Indiegogo|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, an [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ilooklikeanengineer-community-gathering-tickets-18026391422 #ILookLikeanEngineer community gathering] organized by Michelle Glauser through Eventbrite as part of efforts to continue further the movement was hosted on August 13, 2015 in San Francisco, CA. During the gathering, photographers collected portraits of willing participants for the billboards and as an effort to document the event. The event was sponsored by Segment, [[Rackspace]], [[OneLogin]], and [https://hackbrightacademy.com/ HackBright Academy]. The event included networking, discussions and a Q&amp;A panel which included [https://twitter.com/isisAnchalee Isis Wenger], [https://twitter.com/AliciaMorga Alicia Morga], [https://twitter.com/waynesutton Wayne Sutton], [https://twitter.com/EricaJoy Erica Baker], [https://twitter.com/shaft Leslie Miley], and [https://twitter.com/Itshella_dom Dom DeGuzman].

== Significance ==
The struggles that women face in the field of engineering have a long-documented history. In the postwar era, female engineering students found themselves in a mixture of conflicting and positive situations that shaped not only their professional experiences but the field itself. Women faced backlash from not just male students and professors who objectified and viewed female engineers as potential girlfriends instead of fellow students, but also from women faculty or older female students who demanded that younger women endured the same struggles they did.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Girls Coming to Tech|last=Bix|first=Amy|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=9780262019545|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus and corporate climate did not change until the mid-1970s when companies began to face civil rights pressure to be more inclusive of female engineers. However, even with these radical changes women continued to experience subtle and overt forms of discrimination in the workplace. During the 1970s, organizations like the [[Society of Women Engineers]] (founded in 1952) among others provided women with support and guidance both on college campuses and in the corporate world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recognizing the challenges that women faced and continue to face in male-dominated fields raises awareness about the importance of diversity and intersectionality in the field of engineering and other tech fields. Social movements are taking place in online spaces more frequently as the community of users tends to be wider and more diverse. It is here where users can use their own personal experiences and public outcry to start global dialogues that can enact change.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8761">An '''Imieliński-Lipski algebras''' is an extension of [[relational algebra]] onto tables with different types of [[Null (SQL)|null values]].  It is used to operate on relations with incomplete information.

Imieliński-Lipski algebras are defined to satisfy precise conditions for  semantically meaningful extension of the usual relational operators, such as projection, selection, union, and join, from operators on relations to operators on relations with various kinds of "null values".

These conditions require that the system be ''safe'' in the sense that no incorrect conclusion is derivable by using a specified subset F of the relational operators; and that it be ''complete'' in the sense that all valid conclusions expressible by relational expressions using operators in F are in fact derivable in this system.  
For example, it is well known that the 3-valued logic approach to deal with null values, supported  treatment of nulls values by [[SQL]] is not complete, see [[Jeffrey Ullman|Ullman]] book.&lt;ref name="Ullman1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.D.

Take SQL query Q

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
                Select NAME
                         From T
                             Where CLASS = 'Networks' &amp; SEMESTER = 'Spring' OR GRADE = 'A' &amp; SEMESTER != 'Spring'
&lt;/source&gt;

SQL query Q will return empty set (no results) under 3-valued semantics currently adopted by all variants of SQL.  This is the case because in SQL,  NULL is never equal to any constant – in this case, neither to “Spring” nor “Fall” nor “Winter” (if  there is Winter semester in this school).  NULL=’Spring” will evaluate to MAYBE and so will NULL=’Fall”. The disjunction MAYBE OR MAYBE evaluates to  MAYBE (not TRUE). Thus Igor will not be part of the answer (and of course neither will Rohit). But Igor should be returned as the answer.

Indeed, regardless what semester Igor took the Networks class (no matter what was the unknown value of NULL), the selection condition will be true.  This “Igor” will be missed by SQL and the SQL answer  won’t be  complete according to completeness requirements specified in  Imieliński, Witold Lipski, 'Incomplete Information in Relational Databases'.&lt;ref name="JACM 1984"/&gt;  It is also argued there that 3-valued logic (TRUE, FALSE, MAYBE) can never provide guarantee  of complete answer for tables with incomplete information.

Three algebras which satisfy conditions of safety and completeness are defined as Imielinski-Lipski algebras: the [[Relational algebra|Codd-Tables]] algebra, the V-tables algebra and the Conditional tables (C-tables) algebra.

===Codd-tables Algebra===

Codd-tables Algebra is based on the usual Codd's   singe NULL values. The table T above is an example of Codd-table. Codd-table algebra supports projection and positive selections only.  It is also demonstrated in [IL84 that it is not possible to correctly extend more relational operators over Codd-Tables.  For example, such basic operation as join is not extendable over Codd-tables.  It is not possible to define selections with Boolean conditions involving negation and preserve completeness.  For example, queries like the above query Q cannot be supported.
In  order to be able to extend more relational operators,  more expressive form of  null value representation is needed in tables  which are called  V-table.

===V-Tables Algebra===

V-tables algebra is based on many different ("marked") null values or variables allowed to appear in a table.  V-tables allow to show that a value may be unknown but the same for different tuples. For example, in the table below Gaurav and Igor order the same (but unknown) beer in two unknown bars (which may, or may not be different – but remain unknown).   Gaurav and Jane frequent the same unknown bad (Y1). Thus, instead one NULL value, we use indexed variables, or ''Skolem constants''  
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title= Skolem constants |url=http://www.sds.lcs.mit.edu/spd/larch/LP/glossary/skolem.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |-
 ! DRINKER   !! BEER !! BAR 
 |-
 | Zhihan  || Heineken  || Cabana
 |-
 | Gaurav  || X1  || Y1
 |-
 | Igor  || X1  || Y2
 |-
 | Jane  || Bud  || Y1
 |-
 | John  || X2  || Y3
 |-
|}

V-Tables algebra is shown to correctly support projection, positive selection (with no negation occurring in the selection condition), union, and renaming of attributes, which allows for processing arbitrary conjunctive queries.
A very desirable property enjoyed by the V-table algebra is that all relational operators on tables are performed in exactly the same way as in the case of the usual relations.

'''Conditional Tables (C-Tables) Algebra'''

Example of conditional table (c-table) is shown below.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |-
 ! NAME   !! CLASS !! GRADE !! SEMESTER !! con
 |-
 | Rohit  || Databases  || B || Spring || true
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || x ='Spring'
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || x !='Spring'
 |-
|}

It has additional column “con” which is a Boolean condition involving variables, null values – same as in V-tables.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
                Select *
                     From T
                          Where CLASS='Networks' &amp; SEMESTER='Spring' OR GRADE = 'A' &amp; SEMESTER !='Spring'
&lt;/source&gt;

over the following table c-table

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;"
 |+ T1=
 |-
 ! NAME   !! CLASS !! GRADE !! SEMESTER !! con
 |-
 | Rohit  || Databases  || B || Spring || true
 |-
 | Igor  || Networks  || A || x || true
 |-
|}

Conditional Tables algebra, mainly of theoretical interest, supports projection, selection, union, join, and renaming.  Under closed world assumption, it can also handle the operator of difference, thus it can support all relational operators.

[[Systems science]] is the [[interdisciplinary]] field of science surrounding [[systems theory]], [[cybernetics]], the science of [[complex systems]]. It aims to develop interdisciplinary foundations, which are applicable in a variety of areas, such as engineering, biology, medicine and social sciences. Systems science and [[systemics]] are names for all research related to [[systems theory]]. It is defined as an emerging branch of science that studies [[holistic]] systems and tries to develop logical, mathematical, engineering and philosophical paradigms and frameworks in which physical, technological, biological, social, [[cognitive]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] systems can be studied and developed.

This '''list of systems sciences organizations''' gives an overview of global and local [[organization]]s in the field of [[systems science]]. This list shows all kinds of organizations and institutes listed thematically.

Throughout its history, the MBA has had a Royal Patron. The current patron of the MBA is [http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheDukeofEdinburgh/TheDukeofEdinburgh.aspx H.R.H. The Prince Philip], Duke of Edinburgh. In 2013, the MBA was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in recognition of the MBA's scientific preeminence in its field.&lt;ref&gt;"A Royal Charter for the MBA" http://www.mba.ac.uk/membership/a-royal-charter-for-the-marine-biological-association/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and foundation==
In 1866 the [[Royal Commission]] on the Sea Fisheries, which included among its officers Professor [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], had reported that fears of over-exploitation of the sea fisheries were unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;J. Caird, T. H. Huxley &amp; G. S. Lefevre (1866) Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Enquire into the Sea Fisheries of the United Kingdom. London HMSO, Vol. I, 108 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; They recommended removing existing laws regulating fishing grounds and closed seasons. However, the increase in the size and number of fishing vessels was causing widespread concern, and there were reports from all around the UK coasts about the scarcity of particular fish. This concern was expressed at the [[International Fisheries Exhibition]] in London in 1883, a conference called to discuss the commercial and scientific aspects of the fishing industry, and which was attended by many leading scientists of the day. Nevertheless, in his opening address,&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Huxley (1884) Inaugural address. International Fisheries Exhibition, 1883, Literature, 4, 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley discounted reports of fish scarcities and repeated the views of the Royal Commission of 1866. He stated that with existing methods of fishing, it was inconceivable that the great sea fisheries, such as those for cod (''[[Gadus morhua]]''), herring (''[[Clupea harengus]]'') and mackerel (''[[Scomber scombrus]]''), could ever be exhausted.

Many of the representatives of science and commerce present had different views to Huxley. Their views were put forward by [[E. Ray Lankester]], who summed up the scientific contributions in an essay on what we would now call ecology. He pointed out that "it is a mistake to suppose that the place of fish removed from a particular fishing ground is immediately taken by some of the grand total of fish, which are so numerous in comparison with man's depredations as to make his operations in this respect insignificant...there is on the contrary evidence that shoal fish, like herrings, mackerel and pilchard (''[[Sardina pilchardus]]''), and ground-fish, such as soles and other flat-fishes, are really localised. If man removes a large proportion of these fish from the areas which they inhabit, the natural balance is upset and chiefly in so far as the production of young fish is concerned."&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Lankester (1884) The scientific results of the exhibition. International Fisheries Exhibition, 1883, Literature, 4, 443-446.&lt;/ref&gt; During this masterly address he went on to develop this theme and concluded with an appeal for the formation of a society to foster the study of marine life, both for its scientific interest and because of the need to know more about the life histories and habitats of food fishes. Professor Lankester envisaged that such a society would construct a laboratory close to the coast, with the building containing aquaria and apparatus for the circulation of seawater and, most importantly, laboratory accommodation for scientists. The appeal was answered by a group of eminent scientists, who resolved to form a society and build a laboratory on the British coast.

===Founders===
The Committee formed at the International Fisheries Exhibition 1883 resolved to take action to establish a British Marine Laboratory, an initiative that ultimately led to the formation of the Marine Biological Association and building of the Laboratory in Plymouth. They were:
* [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]], MP (later Lord Avebury)
* [[Philip Sclater|P. L. Sclater]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], Secretary of the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]
* [[F. Jeffrey Bell]], Professor of Zoology at [[King's College London]]
* [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], Professor of Physiology at [[University of Cambridge]]

The Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom was formed at a meeting held in the rooms of the [[Royal Society]] in London on 31 March 1884. All but two of the signatories of the resolution of 1883 were present, together with some other scientists. By this time Professor Huxley had been persuaded to give his support and was elected as the first President of the Association, with Ray Lankester as Honorary Secretary.

==Current Research Programme==
The MBA research programme reflects a long-standing commitment to the development of marine biology. It addresses both fundamental and strategic issues in marine science and is structured around two principal themes: [http://www.mba.ac.uk/ecology/ Ecosystems and Environmental Change], and the [http://www.mba.ac.uk/molecular/ Mechanisms Underlying Biogeochemical and Ecological Processes].

The research programme covers a range of disciplines including [[cell biology]], [[physiology]] and functional biology, [[phytoplankton]] dynamics, [[ecology]] and [[animal behaviour]] and [[ecosystem]] change. An overarching rationale for the MBA research programme is to understand mechanisms that underlie key marine life processes. This includes research on model marine organisms that informs a broader knowledge of fundamental mechanisms as well as research that is specifically targeted at understanding biogeochemical and ecological processes and their complex interactions with environmental factors, including long-term and rapid [[environmental change]]. [http://www.mba.ac.uk/long-term-change/ Long-term science] observations of physical and biological parameters in the ocean have been collected by the MBA for over 100 years providing a foundation of data supporting studies aimed at understanding biological responses to marine environmental changes including effects of [[climate change]]. 

The research programme is managed by the MBA Council through its Director and Deputy Director (Research) with the prime aim being to promote individually motivated research into problems of fundamental importance in marine biology. This is achieved by interweaving the work of resident [http://www.mba.ac.uk/research-staff/ Research Fellows] with that of visiting workers. The groundbreaking work of MBA research scientists has been recognised by many national and international awards over the years, including the Royal Society's [[Royal Medal]], [[Darwin Medal]] and [[Croonian Lecture]], the Zoological Society of London's [[Frink Medal]], and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science's [[International Prize for Biology]]. 

==National Marine Biological Library==
The National Marine Biological Library (NMBL) began in 1887 as the research support library for the MBA.&lt;ref name="Southward"/&gt; Today, it provides research support for the MBA,  the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder|Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science]] and [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]]. The  NMBL's holdings include periodicals, serials, journals, reports and grey literature, a large collection of historical and modern books, an extensive reprint collection, and expedition reports. These cover the vast majority of the world. The NMBL’s Special Collections include the research libraries of several eminent MBA scientists; these are [[George Parker Bidder (marine biologist)|George Parker Bidder]], [[Edward Thomas Browne]], [[Sidney Frederic Harmer]], [[E. Ray Lankester]], [[Marie Victoire Lebour]] and [[John Zachary Young]]. Additionally, the NMBL curates the MBA Archive Collection which details the MBA's institutional history as well the history of marine biology in Britain since the late-nineteenth century, especially through the collection’s personal papers. These include scientific papers and material from [[Walter Garstang]], [[Sidney Frederic Harmer|Sidney Harmer]], [[H. W. Harvey|Hildebrand Wolfe Harvey]], [[Thomas Hincks]], [[Thomas Vere Hodgson|Thomas V. Hodgson]], [[Stanley W. Kemp]], [[Charles Atwood Kofoid|Charles A. Kofoid]], [[Mary Parke]], [[John Richardson (naturalist)|John Richardson]], [[Frederick Stratten Russell|Frederick S. Russell]], [[Thomas Alan Stephenson|Thomas A. Stephenson]], [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon]], [[Edward A. Wilson]] and [[William Yarrell]].

'''Nanzo-in''' ({{Nihongo2|南蔵院|help=yes}}) is a Shingon sect Buddhist temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It is notable for its bronze statue of a reclining Buddha, said to be the largest bronze statue in the world.

==History==
[[File:Gate of Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Kasuya, Fukuoka.JPG|thumb|Gate to Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka, Japan.]]
Nanzo-in temple was originally located on [[Mountain Kōya|Mt. Koyasan]], but local anti-Buddhist authorities threatened to destroy the temple in 1886&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japan.travel/in/spot/2167/|title=Nanzo-in Temple|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Public outcry lead to a decade-long effort to have the temple transferred to [[Sasaguri, Fukuoka|Sasaguri]].&lt;ref name=ACROS&gt;{{cite book|last1=ACROS|first1=Fukuoka|title=Fukuoka Guide Spring 2011|date=2011|publisher=ACROS Fukuoka}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was moved in 1899, under the leadership of Sasaguri priest, Hayashi Satoshiun.&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanko|first1=Sasaguri|title=Sasaguri Tourism: Nanzoin Temple (Japanese)|url=http://www.sasagurikanko.com/temple/nanzoin/|website=Sasagurikanko.com|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanzo-in temple is the main location among the 88 temples that make up the Sasaguri pilgrimage route, one of the three famous walking [[pilgrimage]]s in Japan.&lt;ref name=Crossroads /&gt;

Today, the temple and its surrounding grounds receive more than 1 million visitors annually.&lt;ref name=Crossroads&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fukuoka|first1=Crossroads|title=Nanzoin Temple|url=http://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/event/?mode=detail&amp;id=4000000000402&amp;isSpot=1|publisher=Crossroads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lottery===
A chief priest of Nanzo-in temple once won the lottery after laying his ticket next to a statue of [[Daikokuten|Daikoku]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://taiken.co/single/nanzo-in-temple-the-reclining-buddha-temple/|title=Nanzo-in Temple: The Reclining Buddha Temple|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The temple claims that others who have made a similar effort have also won the lottery, bringing the temple associations with luck and lottery tickets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bemarietravels.com/nanzoin-temple-fukuoka/|title=The Beautiful Nanzoin Temple Fukuoka|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclining Buddha==
[[File:Reclining Buddha in Nanzoin Temple 20150429.JPG|thumb|The reclining Buddha statue at Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka, Japan.]]
The reclining [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] statue, known as either ''Nehanzo'' or ''Shaka Nehan'' ("Nirvana")&lt;ref name=Macleans&gt;{{cite web|title=Karmic Cleansing|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/karmic-cleansing/|website=Macleans.ca|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is 41 meters long, 11 meters high, and weighs nearly 300 tons.&lt;ref name="Sasaguri Town"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sasaguri-shi|title=Sasaguri Sight-Seeing Spots|publisher=Sasaguri Town|url=http://www.town.sasaguri.fukuoka.jp/userfiles/files/data/create/lecture/sightseeing_spots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue depicts Buddha at the moment of death, or entrance into [[nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The interior holds ashes of Buddha and two Buddhist adherents, [[Ananda]] and [[Maudgalyayana]]. Those relics were a gift from Myanmar as thanks for the sect's donations of medical supplies to children in both [[Nepal]] and [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko /&gt; In 1995, 1,300 monks from Myanmar and Nepal attended the unveiling of the reclining Buddha statue.&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko /&gt;

Inside the sculpture, sand from each of the 88 shrines that make up the [[Shikoku Pilgrimage|Shikoku pilgrimage]] are stored below bricks within a narrow hallway.&lt;ref name=Nakamura&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nakamura|first1=Connie|title=Sasaguri Town - Mini Pilgrimage And More!|url=http://taiken.co/single/sasaguri-town-mini-pilgrimage-and-more|website=Taiken.co|publisher=Taiken|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, hundreds of Buddhists come together to clean the statue using bamboo leaves tied to five-meter poles.&lt;ref name=Macleans /&gt;

==Funerals==
Nanzo-in Temple has 4,315 ''nokotsudo,'' places where bones of the deceased are stored.&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; The temple has a non-traditional fee structure for housing remains. First, it is open to all sects of Buddhism, and is even open to [[Shinto]] remains. Secondly, many Buddhist temples rely on a monthly fee for housing the bones of the deceased, which are then disposed of after a set period of time. Nanzo-in Temple has one fee, which covers 200 years.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=Clifton|title=Handbook of Death and Dying|date=2003|publisher=SAGE|page=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:National Humanities Medal cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The obverse of the National Humanities Medal]]

The '''National Humanities Medal''' is an American award that annually recognizes several individuals, groups, or institutions for work that has "deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened our citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities."&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/awards.html |title=Awards and Honors |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |accessdate=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- is it always, or always nowadays, or not always conferred ceremonially by the US President? --&gt;

The annual '''[[Charles Frankel]] Prize in the Humanities''' was established in 1988 and succeeded by the National Humanities Medal in 1997. The initial design for the National Humanities Medal was created by a 1995 Frankel Prize winner, [[David Macaulay]], and was used for all recipients through 2012.&lt;ref name=awards /&gt; During 2013, The National Endowment for the Humanities ran a public competition for a new medal design, judged by metalsmith [[Chunghi Choo]], coin engraver [[Don Everhart]] of the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]] and sculptor [[George Anthonisen]]. In June 2013, the agency announced that a design by Paul C. Balan of Illinois had been selected as the winner. The final medal will be unveiled in Washington D.C. in November 2013. The new design was used for the first time for the 2013 National Humanities Medals, which were presented in mid-2014.&lt;ref name=NewNHM2013&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul C.

Medals are conferred once annually, usually by the U.S. President, to as many as twelve living candidates and existing organizations nominated early in the calendar year. The President selects the winners in consultation with the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref name=nominations&gt;{{cite  web |url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/medalsnominate.html |title=National Humanities Medals Nominations |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEH asks that nominators consult the list of previous winners and consider the [[National Medal of Arts]] to recognize contributions in "the creative or performing arts".&lt;ref name=nominations /&gt;

'''Occam's razor''' (also '''Ockham's razor''' or '''Ocham's razor'''; [[Latin]]: ''lex parsimoniae'' "'''law of parsimony'''") is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the correct one. When presented with competing [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. The idea is attributed to English [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.

In science, Occam's razor is used as an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] [[heuristic]] in the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"&gt;Hugh G. Gauch, ''Scientific Method in Practice, Cambridge University Press'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-01708-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01708-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Roald |last2=Minkin |first2=Vladimir I. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Barry K. |title=Ockham's Razor and Chemistry |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |date=1997 |volume=3 |pages=3–28 |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/3/hoffman.htm |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[scientific method]], Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the [[falsifiability]] criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.  Since one can always burden failing explanations with [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]] to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more [[test method|testable]].&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"&gt;{{cite book |origyear=2004 |year=2010 |author=Alan Baker |chapter=Simplicity |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ |publisher=Stanford University |place=California |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Courtney |first1=A. |last2=Courtney |first2=M. |title=Comments Regarding 'On the Nature of Science' |arxiv=0812.4932 |journal=Physics in Canada |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=7–8|bibcode=2008arXiv0812.4932C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elliott |last=Sober |chapter=Let's Razor Occam's Razor |pages=73–93 |editor-first=Dudley |editor-last=Knowles |title=Explanation and Its Limits |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''Occam's razor'' did not appear until a few centuries after [[William of Ockham]]'s death in 1347. [[Libert Froidmont]], in his ''On Christian Philosophy of the Soul'', takes credit for the phrase, speaking of "''novacula occami''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ockam's Razor: A User's Manual|last=Sober|first=Elliott|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=1107692539|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham did not invent this principle, but the "razor"—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ariew, Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" ({{lang|la|Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate}}) was formulated by the Irish [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] philosopher [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]] in his 1639 commentary on the works of [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;Johannes Poncius's commentary on John Duns Scotus's ''Opus Oxoniense,'' book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus ''Opera Omnia'', vol.15, Ed. Luke Wadding, Louvain (1639), reprinted Paris: Vives, (1894) p.483a&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formulations before William of Ockham ===
[[File:Pluralitas.jpg|thumb|Part of a page from Duns Scotus' book  ''Commentaria oxoniensia ad IV libros magistri Sententiarus'', novis curis edidit p. Marianus Fernandez Garcia (1914, p. 211)': "{{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}}", i.e., "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity"]]

The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265–1308), [[Robert Grosseteste]] (1175–1253), [[Maimonides]] (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 189a15, ''On the Heavens'' 271a33. See also Franklin, ''op cit.'' note 44 to chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = M. J. | year = 1956 | title = Aristotle's Razor | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies (Ireland) | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 105–112 | doi=10.5840/philstudies1956606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle writes in his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', "We may assume the superiority {{lang|la|ceteris paribus}} [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedians, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC ''Complexity and Dynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112734/https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC |date=17 June 2016 }} citing [[Richard McKeon]] (tr.) Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (1963) p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] ({{nowrap|c. AD 90 – c. AD 168}}) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)|first=James|last=Franklin|year= 2001|title= The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}} Chap 9. p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] writing.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Robert Grosseteste, in ''Commentary on'' [Aristotle's] ''the Posterior Analytics Books'' (''Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros'') (c. 1217–1220), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]], ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science 1100–1700'' (1953) pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) states that "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many." Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to [[God's existence]], an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. ''[[quinque viae]]''), and specifically, through an argument based on [[causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also [[Correlation does not imply causation]]).

=== William of Ockham ===
[[William of Ockham]] (''circa'' 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and [[theologian]], an influential medieval [[philosopher]] and a [[nominalist]]. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term ''razor'' refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

While it has been claimed that Occam's razor is not found in any of William's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |first=Jacques |last=Vallee |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331171919/http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |archivedate=31 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can cite statements such as {{Lang|la|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate}}[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William%20of%20Occam] ("Plurality must never be posited without necessity"), which occurs in his theological work on the [[The Four Books of Sentences|''Sentences of Peter Lombard'']] (''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi''; ed. Lugd., 1495, i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).

Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, {{lang|la|Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem}} (Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |year=2007 |title=The linguistics Student's Handbook |location=Edinburgh |publisher= Edinburgh University Press}} p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; are absent in his extant works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Antony |author-link= Antony Flew |year=1979 |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |location=London |publisher=Pan Books}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; this particular phrasing comes from [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie, Alistair Cameron]] (1959), ''Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard, Vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; who described the principle as a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') of the Scholastics.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; William of Ockham's contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God's power; so, in the [[Eucharist]], a plurality of miracles is possible, simply because it pleases God.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

This principle is sometimes phrased as {{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}} ("Plurality should not be posited without necessity").&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |title=Ockham's razor |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823154602/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Summa Totius Logicae'', i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, {{lang|la|Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora}} ("It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"; Thorburn, 1918, pp.&amp;nbsp;352–53; [[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale]] and Kneale, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;243.)

=== Later formulations ===
To quote [[Isaac Newton]], "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes."&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Shoulders of Giants|first=Stephen |last=Hawking|authorlink=Stephen Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0eRZr_HK0LgC&amp;pg=PA731|page=731|isbn=0-7624-1698-X|year=2003|publisher=Running Press|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Primary source: {{harvtxt|Newton|2011|p=387}} wrote the following two "philosophizing rules" at the beginning of part&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] 1726 edition.

: Regula I. Causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti debere, quam quæ &amp; veræ sint &amp; earum phænomenis explicandis sufficient.
: Regula II. Ideoque effectuum naturalium ejusdem generis eædem assignandæ sunt causæ, quatenus fieri potest.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offers a particular version of Occam's razor: "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-construction/|title=Logical Constructions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols.

[[Ernst Mach]] formulated the stronger version of Occam's razor into [[physics]], which he called the Principle of Economy stating: "Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Philosophical Views of Ernst Mach |first=Erich |last=Becher |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=1905 |pages=535–562 |doi=10.2307/2177489 |jstor=2177489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote "Nature operates in the shortest way possible."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt; The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories, though not the intent of the original expression of Occam's razor, has been assimilated into our culture as the widespread layman's formulation that "the simplest explanation is usually the correct one."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt;

== Justifications ==

=== Aesthetic ===
Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices."&lt;ref&gt;Pegis 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}

=== Empirical ===
Occam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see "Applications" section below for some examples).

In the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).

==== Testing the razor ====
The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It is coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]

Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary. So there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.

Put another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. "... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too") successfully prevent outright falsification. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called [[saving hypothesis|saving hypotheses]], cannot be ruled out—except by using Occam's razor.&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education, pp. 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis."

None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy. In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K.

=== Practical considerations and pragmatism ===
{{See also|Pragmatism|Problem of Induction}}

=== Mathematical ===
One justification of Occam's razor is a direct result of basic [[probability theory]]. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.

There have also been other attempts to derive Occam's razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E. T. Jaynes]]. The probabilistic (Bayesian) basis for Occam's razor is elaborated by [[David J. C. MacKay]] in chapter 28 of his book ''Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043535/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | archivedate=15 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favour of simpler models is not required.

[[William H. Jefferys]] and [[James Berger (statistician)|James O. Berger]] (1991) generalize and quantify the original formulation's "assumptions" concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data.&lt;ref name="Jefferys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jefferys|first=William H.|last2=Berger |first2=James O.|title=Ockham's Razor and Bayesian Statistics |journal=[[American Scientist]]|year=1991|volume=80|issue=1|pages=64–72|jstor=29774559|url=http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304065538/http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2005|df=dmy-all}} (preprint available as "Sharpening Occam's Razor on a Bayesian Strop").&lt;/ref&gt; They state, "A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability, due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp."&lt;ref name="Jefferys" /&gt; The model they propose balances the precision of a theory's predictions against their sharpness{{vague|date=September 2016}}—preferring theories that sharply{{vague|date=September 2016}} make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results. This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in [[Bayesian inference]] (namely [[marginal probability]], [[conditional probability]], and [[posterior probability]]).

The [[bias–variance tradeoff]] is a framework that incorporates the Occam's razor principal in its balance between overfitting (i.e. variance minimization) and underfitting (i.e. bias minimization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spall |first1=James C. |title=Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471441908 |pages=330–331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===

==== Karl Popper ====
[[Karl Popper]] argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its [[falsifiability]] criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones "because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable" (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.

==== Elliott Sober ====
The philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.&lt;ref name=Sober975&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |year=1975 |title=Simplicity |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-824407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an [[epistemology|epistemic]] justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'"&lt;ref name=Sober2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |year=2004 |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |editor1-first=Arnold |editor1-last=Zellner |editor2-first=Hugo A. |editor2-last=Keuzenkamp |editor2-link=Hugo A.

==== Richard Swinburne ====

[[Richard Swinburne]] argues for simplicity on logical grounds:

{{quote|... the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate ''a priori'' epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth.|Swinburne 1997}}

According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see [[Underdetermination]] and [[Duhem-Quine thesis]]), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: "Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth." (Swinburne 1997).

==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====
From the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':

* 3.328 "If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor."
: (If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
* 4.04 "In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models)."
* 5.47321 "Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless."

and on the related concept of "simplicity":

* 6.363 "The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences."

=== Science and the scientific method ===
[[File:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Andreas Cellarius]]'s illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' (1660). Future positions of the sun, moon and other solar system bodies can be calculated using a [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] model (the earth is at the centre) or using a [[Heliocentrism#The view of modern science|heliocentric model]] (the sun is at the centre). Both work, but the geocentric model arrives at the same conclusions through a much more complex system of calculations than the heliocentric model. This was pointed out in a preface to [[Copernicus]]' first edition of ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.]]
In [[science]], Occam's razor is used as a [[heuristic]] to guide scientists in developing theoretical models rather than as an arbiter between published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In [[physics]], parsimony was an important heuristic in [[Albert Einstein]]'s formulation of [[special relativity]],&lt;ref name="fn_(102)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=German |first=Albert |last=Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content? |journal=Annalen der Physik |pages=639–41 |year=1905 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(103)"&gt;L.

In [[chemistry]], Occam's razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a [[reaction mechanism]].&lt;ref name="fn_(107)"&gt;RA Jackson, Mechanism: An Introduction to the Study of Organic Reactions, Clarendon, Oxford, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(108)"&gt;Carpenter, B. K. (1984). ''Determination of Organic Reaction Mechanism'', New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In this context, Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einstein's Constraint: "It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience".&lt;!-- ref: "On the Method of Theoretical Physics" The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933); also published in ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (April 1934), pp. 163–169., p. 165. --&gt; An often-quoted version of this constraint (which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529075018/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but not simpler."

In the scientific method, parsimony is an [[epistemological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[heuristic]] preference, not an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt; As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

When scientists use the idea of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

It has been suggested that Occam's razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption. There is little [[empirical evidence]] that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true than complex ones.&lt;ref name="fn_(120)"&gt;{{cite journal |date=4 February 1994 |author1=Naomi Oreskes |author2=Kristin Shrader-Frechette |author3=Kenneth Belitz |title=Verification, Validation, and Confirmation of Numerical Models in the Earth Sciences |journal=Science |volume=263 |pages=641–646 |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see note 25 |issue=5147 |bibcode=1994Sci...263..641O |doi=10.1126/science.263.5147.641 |pmid=17747657 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042408/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, Occam's razor is a conservative tool, cutting out "crazy, complicated constructions" and assuring "that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day", thus yielding "normal" science: models of explanation and prediction.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)" /&gt; There are, however, notable exceptions where Occam's razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary. For example, [[Max Planck]] interpolated between the [[Wien approximation|Wien]] and [[Rayleigh–Jeans law|Jeans]] radiation laws and used Occam's razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis, even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;

Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, [[ball lightning]], [[continental drift]], and [[reverse transcriptase]]{{fact|date=August 2018}}. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the [[atomic theory]] was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected. [[Ernst Mach]] and the logical positivists rejected [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] until the reality of atoms was more evident in [[Brownian motion]], as shown by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=Pojman2009&gt;{{cite book |year=2009 |author=Paul Pojman |chapter=Ernst Mach |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ernst-mach/ |place=California |publisher=Stanford University |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, postulating the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] is more complex than transmission of light through a [[vacuum]]. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as [[wave–particle duality|light behaves like waves and like particles]].

Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

There are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data. Simplicity principles are useful philosophical preferences for choosing a more likely theory from among several possibilities that are all consistent with available data. A single instance of Occam's razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; Michael Lee and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = M.

If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

=== Biology ===
Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." (Morgan 1903).

However, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.

[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called "the selfish herd".

[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sober|first1=Elliot|title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference|date=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-69144-2|page=7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})&lt;/ref&gt;  For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article "Let's Razor Ockham's Razor" (1990).

Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.

[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."&lt;ref&gt;Crick 1988, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.

=== Religion ===
{{Main| Existence of God}}

In the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that "nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |publisher=Stanford |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |contribution=William Ockham |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."&lt;ref&gt;Dale T Irvin &amp; Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).

Various [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).

Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[Solipsism|solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.

Occam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''Mémoires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napoléon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ainé&lt;/ref&gt; Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.

In his article "Sensations and Brain Processes" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as "pain", "joy", "desire", "fear", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

=== Penal ethics ===
In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s "parsimony principle" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tonry | first1 = Michael | year = 2005 | title =  Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf | journal = [[Columbia Law Review]] | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 1233–1275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probability theory and statistics ===
Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.

There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference. Papers&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David M. Boulton; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 11, Issue 2, 1968 Page(s):185–194, "An information measure for classification."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David L. Dowe; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 42, Issue 4, Sep 1999 Page(s):270–283, "Minimum Message Length and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested a connection between Occam's razor and [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref name="Volker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|title=A short introduction to Model Selection, Kolmogorov Complexity and Minimum Description Length|last=Nannen|first=Volker|accessdate=2010-07-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602044851/http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|archivedate=2 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].

Statistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent "simplicity" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

==== Objective razor ====
The minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a "natural" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|title=Algorithmic Information Theory|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|archivedate=24 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the program for the universal program as the "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] that "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized."&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. B. Vitányi and Ming Li; ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'', Volume 46, Issue 2, Mar 2000 Page(s):446–464, "Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the [[minimum message length]] (MML) principle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam's razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanation/formulation generator. Some attempts have been made to re-derive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0001020|title= Why Occam's Razor|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|volume=17|issue=3|pages=255–266|last1=Standish|first1=Russell K|year=2000|doi=10.1023/B:FOPL.0000032475.18334.0e|bibcode=2004FoPhL..17..255S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the appropriate mathematical theory of Occam's razor already exists, namely, [[Ray Solomonoff|Solomonoff's]] [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of optimal inductive inference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomonoff | first1 = Ray | authorlink = Ray Solomonoff | year = 1964 | title = A formal theory of inductive inference.

== Controversial aspects of the razor ==
Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.{{Refn|"Ockham's razor does not say that the more simple a hypothesis, the better."&lt;ref name=SkepticDict2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert T. Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter=Occam's Razor |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last updated 18 February 2012 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301193834/http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |archivedate=1 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Occam's razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed "theoretical scrutiny" tests and are equally well-supported by evidence.{{Refn|"Today, we think of the principle of parsimony as a heuristic device. We don't assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false. We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong. Until proved otherwise, the more complex theory competing with a simpler explanation should be put on the back burner, but not thrown onto the trash heap of history until proven false."&lt;ref name="SkepticDict2012" /&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Furthermore, it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses; thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simpler-to-test hypothesis.

Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or [[syntax]]), while its [[ontology]] (or [[semantics]]) becomes simpler, or vice versa.{{Refn|"While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is important to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions. Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to be formulated more simply, while reducing the ontology of a theory may only be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex."&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two perspectives as "economy of practical expression" and "economy in grammar and vocabulary", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W V O|last=Quine|author-link= W. V. Quine|year=1961|chapter=Two dogmas of empiricism|title= From a logical point of view|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=20–46|isbn=0-674-32351-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei]] lampooned the ''misuse'' of Occam's razor in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]''. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.

== Anti-razors ==
Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347) who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor:'' "If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on." Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution ''Se non è vero, è ben trovato'' ("Even if it is not true, it is well conceived") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.

Anti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902–1985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: "The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Critique of Pure Reason|year=1929|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]|editor=Norman Kemp-Smith transl|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=92|quote=Entium varietates non temere esse minuendas|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: "Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy" and "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the "science of imaginary solutions" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, "'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own." Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]". There is also [[Crabtree's Bludgeon]], which cynically states that "[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."

It has been introduced in 2001 by Lions, Maday and Turinici. Since then, it has become one of the most widely studied parallel-in-time integration methods {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

== Parallel-in-time integration methods ==

In contrast to e.g. [[Runge–Kutta methods|Runge-Kutta]] or [[Linear multistep method|multi-step]] methods, some of the computations in Parareal can be performed [[Parallel computing|in parallel]] and
Parareal is therefore one example of a ''parallel-in-time'' integration method.
While historically most efforts to parallelize the [[Numerical partial differential equations|numerical solution]] of [[partial differential equation]]s focussed on the spatial discretization, in view of the challenges from [[exascale computing]], parallel methods for [[temporal discretization]] have been identified as a possible way to increase concurrency in [[List of numerical analysis software|numerical software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

Because Parareal computes the numerical solution for multiple time steps in parallel, it is categorized as a ''parallel across the steps'' method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== History ==

Parareal can be derived as both a [[multigrid method]] in time method or as [[Direct multiple shooting method|multiple shooting]] along the time axis.&lt;ref name="gander2007"&gt;{{cite journal

Both ideas, multigrid in time as well as adopting multiple shooting for time integration, go back to the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ideas to parallelize the solution of initial value problems go back even further: the first paper proposing a parallel-in-time integration method appeared in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;

== Algorithm ==
[[File:Parareal Animation.ogg|thumb|708x708px|Visualization of the Parareal algorithm. The coarse propagator here is labelled &lt;math&gt;\bar{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; whereas the fine propagator is labelled &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Parareal solves an initial value problem of the form

&lt;math&gt; \dot{y}(t) = f(y(t), t), \quad y(t_0) = y_0 \quad \text{with} \quad t_0 \leq t \leq T.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the right hand side &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can correspond to the spatial discretization of a partial differential equation in a [[method of lines]] approach.

Parareal now requires a [[Domain decomposition methods|decomposition]] of the time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_0, T]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; so-called time slices &lt;math&gt;[t_j, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt; [t_0, T] = [t_0, t_1] \cup [t_1, t_2] \cup \ldots \cup [t_{P-1}, t_{P} ].&lt;/math&gt;

Each time slice is assigned to one processing unit when parallelizing the algorithm, so that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of processing units used for Parareal: in an [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] based code for example, this would be the number of processes, while in an [[OpenMP]] based code, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be equal to the number of [[Thread (computing)|threads]].

Parareal is based on the iterative application of two methods for [[Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations|integration of ordinary differential equations]].
One, commonly labelled &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, should be of high accuracy and computational cost while the other, typically labelled &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, must be computationally cheap but can be much less accurate. 
Typically, some form of Runge-Kutta method is chosen for both coarse and fine integrator, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; might be of lower order and use a larger time step than &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.
If the initial value problem stems from the discretization of a PDE, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; can also use a coarser spatial discretization, but this can negatively impact convergence unless high order interpolation is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruprecht|first=Daniel|date=2014-12-01|title=Convergence of Parareal with spatial coarsening|journal=PAMM|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1031–1034|doi=10.1002/pamm.201410490|issn=1617-7061|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/90536/1/paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The result of numerical integration with one of these methods over a time slice &lt;math&gt;[t_{j}, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; for some starting value &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; given at &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; is then written as

&lt;math&gt; y = \mathcal{F}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) &lt;/math&gt;   or   &lt;math&gt;y = \mathcal{G}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) &lt;/math&gt;.

Serial time integration with the fine method would then correspond to a step-by-step computation of

&lt;math&gt; y_{j+1} = \mathcal{F}(y_j, t_j, t_{j+1}), \quad j=0, \ldots, P-1.&lt;/math&gt;

Parareal instead uses the following iteration

&lt;math&gt; y_{j+1}^{k+1} = \mathcal{G}(y^{k+1}_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) + \mathcal{F}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1}) - \mathcal{G}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1}), \quad j=0, \ldots, P-1, \quad k=0, \ldots, K-1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the iteration counter. 
As the iteration converges and &lt;math&gt;y^{k+1}_j - y^k_j \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, the terms from the coarse method cancel out and Parareal reproduces the solution that is obtained by the serial execution of the fine method only.
It can be shown that Parareal converges after a maximum of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; iterations.&lt;ref name="gander2007" /&gt;
For Parareal to provide speedup, however, it has to converge in a number of iterations significantly smaller than the number of time slices, that is &lt;math&gt;K \ll P&lt;/math&gt;.

In the Parareal iteration, the computationally expensive evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(y^k_j, t_j, t_{j+1})&lt;/math&gt; can be performed in parallel on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; processing units.
By contrast, the dependency of &lt;math&gt;y^{k+1}_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}(y^{k+1}_j, t_j, t_{j+1})&lt;/math&gt; means that the coarse correction has to be computed in serial order.

===Speedup===
Under some assumptions, a simple theoretical model for the [[Amdahl's law|speedup]] of Parareal can be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last       = Minion
| first      = Michael L.

| bibcode    = 
| doi        = 10.2140/camcos.2010.5.265
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although in applications these assumptions can be too restrictive, the model still is useful to illustrate the trade offs that are involved in obtaining speedup with Parareal.

First, assume that every time slice &lt;math&gt;[t_j, t_{j+1}]&lt;/math&gt; consists of exactly &lt;math&gt;N_f&lt;/math&gt; steps of the fine integrator and of &lt;math&gt;N_c&lt;/math&gt; steps of the coarse integrator.
This includes in particular the assumption that all time slices are of identical length and that both coarse and fine integrator use a constant step size over the full simulation.
Second, denote by &lt;math&gt;\tau_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; the computing time required for a single step of the fine and coarse methods, respectively, and assume that both are constant.
This is typically not exactly true when an [[Temporal discretization#Implicit Time Integration|implicit]] method is used, because then runtimes vary depending on the number of iterations required by the [[Iterative method|iterative solver]].

Under these two assumptions, the runtime for the fine method integrating over &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; time slices can be modelled as

&lt;math&gt; c_{\text{fine}} = P N_{f} \tau_f. &lt;/math&gt;

The runtime of Parareal using &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; processing units and performing &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; iterations is

&lt;math&gt; c_{\text{parareal}} = (K+1) P N_{c} \tau_c + K N_{f} \tau_f. &lt;/math&gt;

Speedup of Parareal then is

&lt;math&gt; S_{p} = \frac{c_{\text{fine}}}{c_{\text{parareal}}} = \frac{1}{ (K+1) \frac{N_c}{N_f} \frac{\tau_c}{\tau_f} + \frac{K}{P}} \leq \min\left\{ \frac{N_f \tau_f}{N_c \tau_c}, \frac{P}{K}  \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

These two bounds illustrate the trade off that has to be made in choosing the coarse method: on the one hand, it has to be cheap and/or use a much larger time step to make the first bound as large as possible, on the other hand the number of iterations &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has to be kept low to keep the second bound large.
In particular, [[Speedup#Additional Details|Parareal's parallel efficiency]] is bounded by

&lt;math&gt; E_{p} = \frac{S_p}{P} \leq \frac{1}{K},&lt;/math&gt;

that is by the inverse of the number of required iterations.

=== Instability for imaginary eigenvalues ===
The vanilla version of Parareal has issues for problems with imaginary [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]].&lt;ref name="gander2007" /&gt; It typically only converges toward the very last iterations, that is as &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and the speedup &lt;math&gt; S_p&lt;/math&gt; is always going to be smaller than one.  So either the number of iterations is small and Parareal is unstable or, if &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is large enough to make Parareal stable, no speedup is possible. This also means that Parareal is typically unstable for [[Hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stability of the Parareal Algorithm|last=Staff|first=Gunnar Andreas|last2=Rønquist|first2=Einar M.|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540225232|editor-last=Barth|editor-first=Timothy J.|series=Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering|pages=449–456|language=en|doi=10.1007/3-540-26825-1_46|editor-last2=Griebel|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Keyes|editor-first3=David E.|editor-last4=Nieminen|editor-first4=Risto M.|editor-last5=Roose|editor-first5=Dirk|editor-last6=Schlick|editor-first6=Tamar|editor-last7=Kornhuber|editor-first7=Ralf|editor-last8=Hoppe|editor-first8=Ronald|editor-last9=Périaux|editor-first9=Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the formal analysis by Gander and Vandewalle covers only linear problems with constant coefficients, the problem also arises when Parareal is applied to the nonlinear [[Navier-stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] when the [[viscosity]] coefficient becomes too small and the [[Reynolds number]] too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Convergence of Parareal for the Navier-Stokes Equations Depending on the Reynolds Number|last=Steiner|first=Johannes|last2=Ruprecht|first2=Daniel|last3=Speck|first3=Robert|last4=Krause|first4=Rolf|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319107042|editor-last=Abdulle|editor-first=Assyr|series=Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering|pages=195–202|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10705-9_19|editor-last2=Deparis|editor-first2=Simone|editor-last3=Kressner|editor-first3=Daniel|editor-last4=Nobile|editor-first4=Fabio|editor-last5=Picasso|editor-first5=Marco|citeseerx = 10.1.1.764.6242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different approaches exist to stabilise Parareal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dai|first=X.|last2=Maday|first2=Y.|date=2013-01-01|title=Stable Parareal in Time Method for First- and Second-Order Hyperbolic Systems|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=35|issue=1|pages=A52–A78|doi=10.1137/110861002|issn=1064-8275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farhat|first=Charbel|last2=Cortial|first2=Julien|last3=Dastillung|first3=Climène|last4=Bavestrello|first4=Henri|date=2006-07-30|title=Time-parallel implicit integrators for the near-real-time prediction of linear structural dynamic responses|journal=International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering|language=en|volume=67|issue=5|pages=697–724|doi=10.1002/nme.1653|issn=1097-0207|bibcode=2006IJNME..67..697F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Use of Reduced Basis Methods to Accelerate and Stabilize the Parareal Method|last=Chen|first=Feng|last2=Hesthaven|first2=Jan S.|last3=Zhu|first3=Xueyu|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319020891|editor-last=Quarteroni|editor-first=Alfio|series=MS&amp;A - Modeling, Simulation and Applications|pages=187–214|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_7|editor-last2=Rozza|editor-first2=Gianluigi|url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/190666}}&lt;/ref&gt; one being Krylov-subspace enhanced Parareal.

== Variants ==
There are multiple algorithms that are directly based or at least inspired by the original Parareal algorithm.

=== Krylov-subspace enhanced Parareal ===
Early on it was recognised that for linear problems information generated by the fine method &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\delta t}&lt;/math&gt; can be used to improve the accuracy of the coarse method &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally, the idea was formulated for the parallel implicit time-integrator PITA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farhat|first=Charbel|last2=Chandesris|first2=Marion|date=2003-11-07|title=Time-decomposed parallel time-integrators: theory and feasibility studies for fluid, structure, and fluid–structure applications|journal=International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering|language=en|volume=58|issue=9|pages=1397–1434|doi=10.1002/nme.860|issn=1097-0207|bibcode=2003IJNME..58.1397F}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method closely related to Parareal but with small differences in how the correction is done. In every iteration &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the result &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\delta t}(y^k_j)&lt;/math&gt; is computed for values &lt;math&gt;u^k_j \in \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=0, \ldots, P-1&lt;/math&gt;. Based on this information, the [[Vector space|subspace]]

&lt;math&gt;
S_k := \left\{ y^{k'}_j : 0 \leq k' \leq k, j=0, \ldots, P-1 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

is defined and updated after every Parareal iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gander|first=M.|last2=Petcu|first2=M.|title=Analysis of a Krylov subspace enhanced parareal algorithm for linear problems|journal=ESAIM: Proceedings|volume=25|pages=114–129|doi=10.1051/proc:082508|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denote as &lt;math&gt; P_k&lt;/math&gt; the [[orthogonal projection]] from &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; S_k&lt;/math&gt;. Then, replace the coarse method with the improved integrator &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{K}_{\Delta t}(y) = \mathcal{F}_{\delta t}(P_k y) + \mathcal{G}_{\Delta t}((I-P_k)y)&lt;/math&gt;.

As the number of iterations increases, the space &lt;math&gt; S_k&lt;/math&gt; will grow and the modified propagator &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{K}_{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; will become more accurate. This will lead to faster convergence. This version of Parareal can also stably integrate linear hyperbolic partial differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruprecht|first=D.|last2=Krause|first2=R.|date=2012-04-30|title=Explicit parallel-in-time integration of a linear acoustic-advection system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045793012000709|journal=Computers &amp; Fluids|volume=59|pages=72–83|doi=10.1016/j.compfluid.2012.02.015|arxiv=1510.02237}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension to nonlinear problems based on the reduced basis method exists as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Hybrid Parareal spectral deferred corrections ===
A method with improved parallel efficiency based on a combination of Parareal with spectral deferred corrections (SDC) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutt|first=Alok|last2=Greengard|first2=Leslie|last3=Rokhlin|first3=Vladimir|date=2000-06-01|title=Spectral Deferred Correction Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations|journal=BIT Numerical Mathematics|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=241–266|doi=10.1023/A:1022338906936|issn=0006-3835}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed by M. Minion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minion|first=Michael|date=2011-01-05|title=A hybrid parareal spectral deferred corrections method|url=http://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-2/p05.xhtml|journal=Communications in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science|volume=5|issue=2|pages=265–301|doi=10.2140/camcos.2010.5.265|issn=2157-5452}}&lt;/ref&gt; It limits the choice for coarse and fine integrator to SDC, sacrificing flexibility for improved parallel efficiency. Instead of the limit of &lt;math&gt;1/K&lt;/math&gt;, the bound on parallel efficiency in the hybrid method becomes

&lt;math&gt;E_p \leq \frac{K_s}{K_p}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;K_s&lt;/math&gt; being the number of iterations of the serial SDC base method and &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; the typically greater number of iterations of the parallel hybrid method. The Parareal-SDC hybrid has been further improved by addition of a ''full approximation scheme''  as used in nonlinear [[Multigrid method|multigrid]]. This led to the development of the ''parallel full approximation scheme in space and time'' (PFASST).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emmett|first=Matthew|last2=Minion|first2=Michael|date=2012-03-28|title=Toward an efficient parallel in time method for partial differential equations|url=http://msp.org/camcos/2012/7-1/p04.xhtml|journal=Communications in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science|volume=7|issue=1|pages=105–132|doi=10.2140/camcos.2012.7.105|issn=2157-5452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance of PFASST has been studied for PEPC, a [[Barnes–Hut simulation|Barnes-Hut]] tree code based particle solver developed at [[Jülich Supercomputing Centre|Juelich Supercomputing Centre]]. Simulations using all 262,144 cores on the IBM [[Blue Gene|BlueGene]]/P system JUGENE showed that PFASST could produce additional speedup beyond saturation of the spatial tree parallelisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Speck|first=R.|last2=Ruprecht|first2=D.|last3=Krause|first3=R.|last4=Emmett|first4=M.|last5=Minion|first5=M.|last6=Winkel|first6=M.|last7=Gibbon|first7=P.|date=2012-11-01|title=A massively space-time parallel N-body solver|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6468522|journal=High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC), 2012 International Conference for|pages=1–11|doi=10.1109/SC.2012.6|isbn=978-1-4673-0805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) ===
The multigrid reduction in time method (MGRIT) generalises the interpretation of Parareal as a multigrid-in-time algorithms to multiple levels using different smoothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falgout|first=R.|last2=Friedhoff|first2=S.|last3=Kolev|first3=T.|last4=MacLachlan|first4=S.|last5=Schroder|first5=J.|date=2014-01-01|title=Parallel Time Integration with Multigrid|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=36|issue=6|pages=C635–C661|doi=10.1137/130944230|issn=1064-8275|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.2603}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a more general approach but for a specific choice of parameters it is equivalent to Parareal. The [http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/parallel-time-integration-multigrid XBraid] library implementing MGRIT is being developed by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].

=== ParaExp ===
ParaExp uses [[exponential integrator]]s within Parareal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gander|first=M.|last2=Güttel|first2=S.|date=2013-01-01|title=PARAEXP: A Parallel Integrator for Linear Initial-Value Problems|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=35|issue=2|pages=C123–C142|doi=10.1137/110856137|issn=1064-8275|citeseerx=10.1.1.800.5938}}&lt;/ref&gt; While limited to linear problems, it can produce almost optimal parallel speedup.

'''Private jurisdiction''' is the right of an individual or a [[Legal person|legal entity]] to establish [[Court|courts of law]]. It was prevalent during [[feudalism]].

A [[Exclusive right|franchise]], such as a [[corporation]], a jurisdiction, or a right to collect certain tolls or taxes, was, in effect, a kind of property: an "[[incorporeal hereditament]]". Under [[English law]] incorporeal hereditaments (including jurisdictions) were either granted or recognized in [[charter]]s. 

Franchise jurisdictions included those of [[manorial court]]s, secular courts of ecclesiastical corporations (in addition to the Church's own jurisdiction over [[family law]]), [[borough courts]] of [[municipal corporation]]s, merchant courts established on markets and fairs, and mining courts of mines and mining villages.

In medieval England franchises could also be established for jurisdiction over partially or entirely privatized administrative territories such as "[[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]]" and [[county|counties]]. Broad jurisdictional powers were also granted to many colonial corporations (such as the [[East India Company]]). 

In medieval England for many substantive areas of law the king's courts only reviewed whether the franchise courts stayed within their jurisdictional and certain procedural bounds and not the substance of the case. Generally, the only way to remove or undo the remedy of a franchise court case in royal court was to bring one of several varieties of lawsuits for [[trespass]] ([[tort]]) against the franchise court.

Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BC, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', p. 173. Cambridge University Press}} was an [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] and the eponymous founder of the [[Pythagoreanism]] movement.&lt;!-- Please do NOT add "mathematician". Despite the famous theorem that now bears his name, scholars dispute whether the historical Pythagoras was involved in mathematics at all. Please read the rest of the lead and the "Attributed discoveries" section for further information. Thank you. --&gt; His political and religious teachings were well known in [[Magna Graecia]] and influenced the philosophies of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and, through them, [[Western philosophy]]. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a [[Seal carving|seal engraver]] on the island of [[Samos]]. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to [[Crotone|Croton]], where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a [[Communalism|communal]], [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included [[vegetarianism]], although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism.

The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is ''[[metempsychosis]]'', or the "transmigration of souls", which holds that every [[soul]] is [[immortality|immortal]] and, upon death, [[reincarnation|enters into a new body]]. He may have also devised the doctrine of ''[[musica universalis]]'', which holds that the [[Classical planet|planets]] move according to [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[equation]]s and thus resonate to produce an inaudible [[symphony]] of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the [[Numerology|numerological]] and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]]. Following Croton's decisive victory over [[Sybaris]] in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of [[Greek democracy|democracy]] and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or escaped to [[Metapontum]], where he eventually died.

In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[Pythagorean tuning]], the [[Platonic solids|five regular solids]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Theory of Proportions]], the [[Spherical Earth|sphericity of the Earth]], and the identity of the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning]] and [[Hesperus|evening stars]] as the planet [[Venus]]. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"){{efn|[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 (citing [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli), [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.}} and that he was the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climatic zones]]. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or [[natural philosophy]].

Pythagoras influenced Plato, whose [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]], especially his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted [[ancient Greek art]]. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonists]], coinciding with the rise of [[Neopythagoreanism]]. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] and his teachings as portrayed in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' influenced the modern vegetarian movement.

No authentic writings of Pythagoras have survived,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=796}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=4}} and almost nothing is known for certain about his life.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=3–5}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=21–23}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} The earliest sources on Pythagoras's life are brief, ambiguous, and often [[satire|satirical]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=4}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=299}} The earliest source on Pythagoras's teachings is a satirical poem probably written after his death by [[Xenophanes of Colophon]], who had been one of his contemporaries.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=62}} In the poem, Xenophanes describes Pythagoras interceding on behalf of a [[dog]] that is being beaten, professing to recognize in its cries the voice of a departed friend.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=299}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} [[Alcmaeon of Croton]], a doctor who lived in Croton at around the same time Pythagoras lived there,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}} incorporates many Pythagorean teachings into his writings{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=12–13}} and alludes to having possibly known Pythagoras personally.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=12–13}} The poet [[Heraclitus of Ephesus]], who was born across a few miles of sea away from Samos and may have lived within Pythagoras's lifetime,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}} mocked Pythagoras as a clever charlatan,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}} remarking that "Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practiced inquiry more than any other man, and selecting from these writings he manufactured a wisdom for himself—much learning, artful knavery."{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}

The Greek poets [[Ion of Chios]] ({{circa|480|421&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}) and [[Empedocles of Acragas]] ({{circa|493|432&amp;nbsp;BC}}) both express admiration for Pythagoras in their poems.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=14–15}} The first concise description of Pythagoras comes from the historian [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] ({{circa|484|420&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}),{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} who describes him as "not the most insignificant" of Greek sages&lt;ref&gt;4. 95. &lt;/ref&gt; and states that Pythagoras taught his followers how to attain [[immortality]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writings attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]], who lived in the late fifth century BC, are the earliest texts to describe the numerological and musical theories that were later ascribed to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=88}} The [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] [[rhetoric]]ian [[Isocrates]] (436–338 BC) was the first to describe Pythagoras as having visited Egypt.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} [[Aristotle]] wrote a treatise ''On the Pythagoreans'', which is no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;He alludes to it himself, ''Met.'' i. 5. p. 986. 12, ed. Bekker.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of it may be preserved in the ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]''. Aristotle's disciples [[Dicaearchus]], [[Aristoxenus]], and [[Heraclides Ponticus]] also wrote on the same subject.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

Most of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the [[Ancient Greece#Roman Greece|Roman period]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} by which point, according to the German classicist [[Walter Burkert]], "the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone."{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} Three [[Biography#Historical biography|lives]] of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The two later lives were written by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosophers [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Iamblichus]]{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} and were partially intended as polemics against the [[rise of Christianity]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

During Pythagoras's formative years, Samos was a thriving cultural hub known for its feats of advanced architectural engineering, including the building of the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]], and for its riotous festival culture.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=45–47}} It was a major center of trade in the Aegean where traders brought goods from the [[Near East]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} According to Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, these traders almost certainly brought with them Near Eastern ideas and traditions.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} Pythagoras's early life also coincided with the flowering of early Ionian [[natural philosophy]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=44–45}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}} He was a contemporary of the philosophers [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and the historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]], all of whom lived in [[Miletus]], across the sea from Samos.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=44–45}}

===Alleged travels===

Pythagoras is traditionally thought to have received most of his education in the Near East.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Modern scholarship has shown that the culture of [[Archaic Greece]] was heavily influenced by those of Near Eastern cultures.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Like many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=22–23}} By the time of Isocrates in the fourth century BC, Pythagoras's alleged studies in Egypt were already taken as fact.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=59}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writer [[Antiphon (writer)|Antiphon]], who may have lived during the Hellenistic Era, claimed in his lost work ''On Men of Outstanding Merit'', used as a source by Porphyry, that Pythagoras learned to speak [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] from the [[Pharaoh]] [[Amasis II]] himself, that he studied with the Egyptian priests at [[Thebes, Egypt|Diospolis]] (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship.&lt;ref name="Porphyry6"&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} The [[Middle Platonist]] biographer [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|46|120&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}) writes in his treatise ''[[Moralia|On Isis and Osiris]]'' that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] (meanwhile [[Solon]] received lectures from a [[Sonchis of Sais]]).&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html On Isis And Osiris]'', ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Christian theologian]] [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|150|215&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=no}}), "Pythagoras was a disciple of Soches, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as [[Plato]] of Sechnuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]."{{sfn|Press|2003|page=83}} Some ancient writers claimed, that Pythagoras learned geometry and the doctrine of metempsychosis from the Egyptians.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}&lt;ref&gt;cf. Antiphon. ap. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 7; Isocrates, ''Busiris'', 28–9; Cicero, ''de Finibus'', v. 27; Strabo, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient writers, however, claimed that Pythagoras had learned these teachings from the [[Magi]] in [[Persia]] or even from [[Zoroaster]] himself.&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Diogenes Laërtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited [[Crete]], where he went to the [[Mount Ida|Cave of Ida]] with [[Epimenides]].&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"/&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]ns are reputed to have taught Pythagoras [[arithmetic]] and the [[Chaldea]]ns to have taught him astronomy.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} By the third century BC, Pythagoras was already reported to have studied under the [[Jews]] as well.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Contradicting all these reports, the novelist [[Antonius Diogenes]], writing in the second century BC, reports that Pythagoras discovered all his doctrines himself by [[Dream interpretation|interpreting dreams]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The third-century AD [[Sophist]] [[Philostratus]] claims that, in addition to the Egyptians, Pythagoras also studied under [[Hinduism|Hindu]] sages in [[India]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus expands this list even further by claiming that Pythagoras also studied with the [[Celts]] and [[Iberians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}}

Ancient sources also record Pythagoras having studied under a variety of native Greek thinkers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Some identify [[:fr:Hermodamas|Hermodamas of Samos]] as a possible tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 2, Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Hermodamas represented the indigenous Samian rhapsodic tradition and his father Creophylos was said to have been the host of rival of the poet [[Homer]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Others credit [[Bias of Priene]], Thales,&lt;ref name="Iamblichus, Vit.

Pyth.'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Other traditions claim the mythic bard [[Orpheus]] as Pythagoras's teacher, thus representing the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic Mysteries]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The Neoplatonists wrote of a "sacred discourse" Pythagoras had written on the gods in the [[Doric Greek]] dialect, which they believed had been dictated to Pythagoras by the Orphic priest Aglaophamus upon his initiation to the orphic Mysteries at [[Leibethra]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus credited Orpheus with having been the model for Pythagoras's manner of speech, his spiritual attitude, and his manner of worship.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=8–9}} Iamblichus describes Pythagoreanism as a synthesis of everything Pythagoras had learned from Orpheus, from the Egyptian priests, from the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], and from other religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=8–9}} Riedweg states that, although these stories are fanciful, Pythagoras's teachings were definitely influenced by Orphism to a noteworthy extent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Of the various Greek sages claimed to have taught Pythagoras, [[Pherecydes of Syros]] is mentioned most often.&lt;ref&gt;Aristoxenus and others in Diogenes Laërtius, i. 118, 119; Cicero, ''de Div.'' i. 49&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Similar miracle stories were told about both Pythagoras and Pherecydes, including one in which the hero predicts a shipwreck, one in which he predicts the conquest of a city, and one in which he drinks from a well and predicts a shipwreck.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Apollonius Paradoxographus]], a paradoxographer who may have lived in the second century BC, identified Pythagoras's [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgic]] ideas as a result of Pherecydes's influence.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Another story, which may be traced to the Neopythagorean philosopher [[Nicomachus]], tells that, when Pherecydes was old and dying on the island of [[Delos]], Pythagoras returned to care for him and pay his respects.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Duris of Samos|Duris]], the historian and tyrant of Samos, is reported to have patriotically boasted of an epitaph supposedly penned by Pherecydes which declared that Pythagoras's wisdom exceeded his own.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} On the grounds of all these references connecting Pythagoras with Pherecydes, Riedweg concludes that there may well be some historical foundation to the tradition that Pherecydes was Pythagoras's teacher.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Before 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met [[Thales of Miletus]], who would have been around fifty-four years older than him. Thales was a philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and engineer,&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Carl B. |url=https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known for a [[Thales' Theorem|special case]] of the [[inscribed angle theorem]]. Pythagoras's birthplace, the island of [[Samos]], is situated in the Northeast [[Aegean Sea]] not far from [[Miletus]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}} Diogenes Laërtius cites a statement from [[Aristoxenus]] (fourth century BC) stating that Pythagoras learned most of his [[moral]] doctrines from the [[Pythia|Delphic priestess]] [[Themistoclea]].&lt;ref name="Laertiusviii18"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=8:chapter=1&amp;highlight=themistoclea ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers''], viii. 1, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""Ellen Waithe"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x7ngECDpxmMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Mary Ellen Waithe, ''Ancient women philosophers, 600 B.C.–500 A.D.'', p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Malone |first=John C. |title=Psychology: Pythagoras to present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6Qa6cMQj8AC&amp;pg=PA22 |accessdate=25 October 2010 |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01296-6 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyry agrees with this assertion,&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_life_of_pythagoras_02_text.htm ''Life of Pythagoras''], 41.&lt;/ref&gt; but calls the priestess Aristoclea (''Aristokleia'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Ménage]]: ''The history of women philosophers''.

Porphyry repeats an account from [[Antiphon]], who reported that, while he was still on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the "semicircle".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Here, Samians debated matters of public concern.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Supposedly, the school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Christoph Riedweg, a German scholar of early Pythagoreanism, states that it is entirely possible Pythagoras may have taught on Samos,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} but cautions that Antiphon's account, which makes reference to a specific building that was still in use during his own time, appears to be motivated by Samian patriotic interest.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}

Around 530 BC, when Pythagoras was around forty years old, he left Samos.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=22}} His later admirers claimed that he left because he disagreed with the [[Tyrant#Historical forms|tyranny]] of [[Polycrates]] in Samos,&lt;ref name=Boyer /&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Riedweg notes that this explanation closely aligns with Nicomachus's emphasis on Pythagoras's purported love of freedom, but that Pythagoras's enemies portrayed him as having a proclivity towards tyranny.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Other accounts claim that Pythagoras left Samos because he was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit.

Diogenes Laërtius states that Pythagoras "did not indulge in the pleasures of love"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=58}} and that he cautioned others to only have sex "whenever you are willing to be weaker than yourself".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married [[Theano (philosopher)|Theano]], a lady of [[Crete]] and the daughter of Pythenax{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and had several children with her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Porphyry writes that Pythagoras had two sons named [[Telauges]] and [[Arignote]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and a daughter named Myia,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} who "took precedence among the maidens in Croton and, when a wife, among married women."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions none of these children{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and instead only mentions a son named Mnesarchus after his grandfather.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} This son was raised by Pythagoras's appointed successor Aristaeus and eventually took over the school when Aristaeus was too old to continue running it.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

The wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] was said to have been a close associate of Pythagoras{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} and was credited with having saved the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} This association may been the result of confusion with a different man named Pythagoras, who was an athletics trainer.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Diogenes Laërtius records Milo's wife's name as Myia.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions Theano as the wife of Brontinus of Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius states that the same Theano was Pythagoras's pupil{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and that Pythagoras's wife Theano was her daughter.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius also records that works supposedly written by Theano were still extant during his own lifetime{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and quotes several opinions attributed to her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} These writings are now known to be [[pseudepigraphica]]l.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

===Death===
Pythagoras's emphasis on dedication and asceticism are credited with aiding in Croton's decisive victory over the neighboring colony of [[Sybaris]] in 510 BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} After the victory, some prominent citizens of Croton proposed a [[Greek democracy|democratic constitution]], which the Pythagoreans rejected.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} The supporters of democracy, headed by [[Cylon of Croton|Cylon]] and [[Ninon of Croton|Ninon]], the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from Pythagoras's brotherhood, roused the populace against them.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} Followers of Cylon and Ninon attacked the Pythagoreans during one of their meetings, either in the house of Milo or in some other meeting-place.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} Accounts of the attack are often contradictory and many probably confused it with later anti-Pythagorean rebellions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} The building was apparently set on fire,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} and many of the assembled members perished;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} only the younger and more active members managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 255–259; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 54–57; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 39; comp. Plutarch, ''de Gen. Socr.'' p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree regarding whether Pythagoras was present when the attack occurred and, if he was, whether or not he managed to escape.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} In some accounts, Pythagoras was not at the meeting when the Pythagoreans were attacked because he was on Delos tending to the dying Pherecydes.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} According to another account from Dicaearchus, Pythagoras was at the meeting and managed to escape,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} leading a small group of followers to the nearby city of [[Locris]], where they pleaded for sanctuary, but were denied.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} They reached the city of [[Metapontum]], where they took shelter in the temple of the [[Muses]] and died there of starvation after forty days without food.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=278}} Another tale recorded by Porphyry claims that, as Pythagoras's enemies were burning the house, his devoted students laid down on the ground to make a path for him to escape by walking over their bodies across the flames like a bridge.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} Pythagoras managed to escape, but was so despondent at the deaths of his beloved students that he committed suicide.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} A different legend reported by both Diogenes Laërtius and Iamblichus states that Pythagoras almost managed to escape, but that he came to a bean field and refused to run through it, since doing so would violate his teachings, so he stopped instead and was killed.{{sfn|Simoons|1998|pages=225–228}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} This story seems to have originated from the writer Neanthes, who told it about later Pythagoreans, not about Pythagoras himself.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}

==Teachings==
===Metempsychosis===
[[File:Cropped image of Pythagoras from Raphael's School of Athens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Scene from Raphael's School of Athens showing Pythagoras as a balding, bearded man writing in a book with a quill.

Averroes, shown as a stereotypical Middle Easterner with a mustache and wearing a turban, peers over his left shoulder while another bearded, balding philosopher in classical garb, probably Anaxagoras, peers over his right shoulder, taking notes into a much smaller notepad.

Although the exact details of Pythagoras's teachings are uncertain,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=5–6}} it is possible to reconstruct a general outline of his main ideas.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=9–11}} Aristotle writes at length about the teachings of the Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} but without mentioning Pythagoras directly.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} One of Pythagoras's main doctrines appears to have been ''[[metempsychosis]]'',{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|pages=300–301}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}} the belief that all [[soul]]s are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}} This teaching is referenced by Xenophanes, Ion of Chios, and Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36, comp. Aristotle, ''de Anima'', i. 3; Herodotus, ii. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}} Nothing whatsoever, however, is known about the nature or mechanism by which Pythagoras believed metempsychosis to occur.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=25}}

[[Empedocles]] alludes in one of his poems that Pythagoras may have claimed to possess the ability to recall his former incarnations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=12}} Diogenes Laërtius reports an account from [[Heraclides Ponticus]] that Pythagoras told people that he had lived four previous lives that he could remember in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–167}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 26; Pausanias, ii. 17; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 5; Horace, ''Od.'' i. 28,1. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these lives was as [[Aethalides]] the son of [[Hermes]], who granted him the ability to remember all his past incarnations.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–165}} Next, he was incarnated as [[Euphorbus]], a minor hero from the [[Trojan War]] briefly mentioned in the ''[[Iliad]]''.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=165–166}} He then became the philosopher [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]],{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} who recognized the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Apollo.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} His final incarnation was as Pyrrhus, a fisherman from [[Delos]].{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} One of his past lives, as reported by [[Dicaearchus]], was as a beautiful courtesan.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, iv. 11&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}

===Mysticism===
Another belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the "[[Musica universalis|harmony of the spheres]]",{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} which maintained that the planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, which correspond to musical notes and thus produce an inaudible symphony.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven [[Muse]]s were actually the [[Classical planet|seven planets]] singing together.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} In his philosophical dialogue [[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|''Protrepticus'']], [[Aristotle]] has his literary double say:

{{quote|When Pythagoras was asked [why humans exist], he said, "to observe the heavens," and he used to claim that he himself was an observer of nature, and it was for the sake of this that he had passed over into life.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonJohnson&gt;{{cite web|author1=D.

Pythagoras was said to have practiced [[divination]] and [[prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Divin.'' i. 3, 46; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the visits to various places in Greece—[[Delos]], [[Sparta]], [[Phlius]], [[Crete]], etc.—which are ascribed to him, he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 25; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 17; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 3, 13; Cicero, ''Tusc. Qu.'' v. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} They believed that all things were made of numbers.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=265}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=27}} The number one (the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]) represented the origin of all things{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} and the number two (the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]]) represented matter.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} The number three was an "ideal number" because it had a beginning, middle, and end{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god [[Apollo]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} The number four signified the [[Seasons|four seasons]] and the [[Classical element|four elements]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} They believed that [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]] were [[masculine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} that even numbers were [[feminine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=467}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=170}}

Ten was regarded as the "perfect number"{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Pythagoras was credited with devising the [[tetractys]], the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Iamblichus, in his ''Life of Pythagoras'', states that the tetractys was "so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it]," that Pythagoras's students would swear oaths by it.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'', 29&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|page=66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Andrew Gregory concludes that the tradition linking Pythagoras to the tetractys is probably genuine.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=28}}

Modern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus of Croton]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=87–88}} In his landmark study ''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=3}} According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, [[Mathematical proof|proofless]] [[arithmetic]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}} but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=465}}

{{main|Pythagoreanism}}
Both [[Plato]] and [[Isocrates]] state that, above all else, Pythagoras was known as the founder of a new way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', 600a, Isocrates, ''Busiris'', 28&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=168}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=277}} The organization Pythagoras founded at Croton was called a "school",&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit.

Scholars Press.; D. J. O'Meara, (1989), ''Pythagoras Revived. Mathematics and Philosophy in Late Antiquity'', pages 35–40. Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Iamblichus, in particular, presents the "Pythagorean Way of Life" as a pagan alternative to the Christian monastic communities of his own time.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}}

Two groups existed within early Pythagoreanism: the ''mathematikoi'' ("learners") and the ''akousmatikoi'' ("listeners").{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The ''akousmatikoi'' are traditionally identified by scholars as "old believers" in mysticism, numerology, and religious teachings;{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} whereas the ''mathematikoi'' are traditionally identified as a more intellectual, modernist faction who were more rationalist and scientific.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Gregory cautions that there was probably not a sharp distinction between them and that many Pythagoreans probably believed the two approaches were compatible.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The study of mathematics and music may have been connected to the worship of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ii. 26; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 13; Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8, 91, 141&lt;/ref&gt; The Pythagoreans believed that music was a purification for the soul, just as medicine was a purification for the body.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} One anecdote of Pythagoras reports that when he encountered some drunken youths trying to break into the home of a virtuous woman, he sang a solemn tune with long [[spondee]]s and the boys' "raging willfulness" was quelled.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} The Pythagoreans also placed particular emphasis on the importance of [[physical exercise]];{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}} therapeutic [[dance|dancing]], daily morning walks along [[scenic route]]s, and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] were major components of the Pythagorean lifestyle.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}} Moments of contemplation at the beginning and end of each day were also advised.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=33–34}}

Pythagorean teachings were known as "symbols" (''symbolon''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}} and members took a vow of silence that they would not reveal these symbols to non-members.&lt;ref&gt;Scholion ad Aristophanes, ''Nub.'' 611; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

New initiates were allegedly not permitted to meet Pythagoras until after they had completed a five-year initiation period,{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} during which they were required to remain silent.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Sources indicate that Pythagoras himself was unusually progressive in his attitudes towards women{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} and female members of Pythagoras's school appear to have played an active role in its operations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}}{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} Iamblichus provides a list of 235 famous Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} seventeen of whom are women.{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} In later times, many prominent female philosophers contributed to the development of [[Neopythagoreanism]].{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|pages=xvi–xvii}}

Within his own lifetime, Pythagoras was already the subject of elaborate [[hagiography|hagiographic]] legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} Aristotle described Pythagoras as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=30–31}} In a fragment, Aristotle writes that Pythagoras had a golden thigh,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=11}} which he publicly exhibited at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} and showed to [[Abaris the Hyperborean]] as proof of his identity as the "Hyperborean Apollo".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit.

Pythagoras was said to have dressed all in white.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=47}} He is also said to have borne a golden [[wreath]] atop his head{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} and to have worn [[trousers]] after the fashion of the [[Thrace|Thracians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} Diogenes Laërtius presents Pythagoras as having exercised remarkable [[self-control]];{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} he was always cheerful,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} but "abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indulgences as jests and idle stories".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Pythagoras was said to have had extraordinary success in dealing with animals.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} A fragment from Aristotle records that, when a deadly snake bit Pythagoras, he bit it back and killed it.{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=155}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}} Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat beans{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}} and that he once convinced a notoriously destructive bear to swear that it would never harm a living thing again, and that the bear kept its word.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}

Riedweg suggests that Pythagoras may have personally encouraged these legends,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} but Gregory states that there is no direct evidence of this.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Anti-Pythagorean legends were also circulated.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=60–61}} Diogenes Laërtes retells a story told by Hermippus of Samos, which states that Pythagoras had once gone into an underground room, telling everyone that he was descending to the underworld.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} He stayed in this room for months, while his mother secretly recorded everything that happened during his absence.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} After he returned from this room, Pythagoras recounted everything that had happened while he was gone,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} convincing everyone that he had really been in the underworld{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} and leading them to trust him with their wives.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}}

Although Pythagoras is most famous today for his alleged mathematical discoveries,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=21–22}} classical historians dispute whether he himself ever actually made any significant contributions to the field.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Many mathematical and scientific discoveries were attributed to Pythagoras, including [[Pythagorean theorem|his famous theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12; Plutarch, ''Non posse suav. vivi sec.

Nat.'' ii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ancient Greek medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12, 14, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least the first century BC, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the [[Pythagorean theorem]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=26–27}} a theorem in geometry that states that "in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal [to the sum of] the squares of the two other sides"{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}—that is, &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;. According to a popular legend, after he discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a whole ''[[hecatomb]]'', to the gods.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=428}} Cicero rejected this story as spurious{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} because of the much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood sacrifices.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} Porphyry attempted to explain the story by asserting that the ox was actually made of [[dough]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}

The Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and [[Indian mathematics|Indians]] centuries before Pythagoras,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=429, 462}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=6–7}} but it is possible that he may have been the first one to introduce it to the Greeks.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}} Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he&amp;mdash;or his students&amp;mdash;may have constructed the first [[Mathematical proof|proof]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=33}} Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) [[cuneiform]] sources.{{efn|There are about 100,000 unpublished cuneiform sources in the [[British Museum]] alone.

{{See also|Pythagorean tuning |Pythagorean hammers}} 
According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and heard the sound of their [[Pythagorean hammers|hammers]] clanging against the anvils.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=27–28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} Thinking that the sounds of the hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for one,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} he rushed into the [[blacksmith]] shop and began testing the hammers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} He then realized that the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size of the hammer and therefore concluded that music was mathematical.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} However, this legend is demonstrably false,{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} as these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a [[monochord]]), and not to hammer weight.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}}

===In astronomy===
In ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary [[Parmenides|Parmenides of Elea]] were both credited with having been the first to teach that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth was spherical]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climactic zones]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} and the first to identify the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning star]] and the [[Hesperus|evening star]] as the [[Venus|same celestial object]].{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Of the two philosophers, Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the first{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=306–308}} and the attribution of these discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a [[pseudepigrapha]]l poem.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Empedocles, who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that the earth was spherical.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=53}} By the end of the fifth century BC, this fact was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.{{sfn|Dicks|1970|page=68}}

{{See also|Timaeus (dialogue)}}

Sizeable Pythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, [[Phlius]], and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] during the early fourth century BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=48–49}} Around the same time, the Pythagorean philosopher [[Archytas]] was highly influential on the politics of the city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in Magna Graecia.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} According to later tradition, Archytas was elected as ''[[strategos]]'' ("general") seven times, even though others were prohibited from serving more than a year.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} Archytas was also a renowned mathematician and musician.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–43}} He was a close friend of Plato{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–40}} and he is quoted in Plato's ''Republic''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=40, 44–45}}&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' VII, 530d&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle states that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans.&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=1}} Cicero repeats this statement, remarking that ''Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia'' ("They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean").&lt;ref&gt;Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato's middle dialogues, including ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', have a strong "Pythagorean coloring",{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=55}} and his last few dialogues (particularly ''[[Philebus]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}} are extremely Pythagorean in character.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}}

According to [[R. M. Hare]], Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' may be partially based on the "tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers" established by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Plato and Pythagoras shared a "mystical approach to the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and its place in the material world"{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} and it is probable that both were influenced by [[Orphicism|Orphism]].{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} The historian of philosophy [[Frederick Copleston]] states that Plato probably borrowed [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|his tripartite theory of the soul]] from the Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=37}} [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time.{{sfn|Russell|2008|pages=33–37}} He concludes that "I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought."{{sfn|Russell|2008|page=37}}

A revival of Pythagorean teachings occurred in the first century BC{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=123–124}} when [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonist]] philosophers such as [[Eudorus of Alexandria|Eudorus]] and [[Philo of Alexandria]] hailed the rise of a "new" Pythagoreanism in [[Alexandria]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=124}} At around the same time, [[Neopythagoreanism]] became prominent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} The first-century AD philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by Pythagorean teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The later first-century Neopythagorean philosopher [[Moderatus of Gades]] expanded on Pythagorean number philosophy{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} and probably understood the soul as a "kind of mathematical harmony."{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The Neopythagorean mathematician and musicologist [[Nicomachus]] likewise expanded on Pythagorean numerology and music theory.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} [[Numenius of Apamea]] interpreted Plato's teachings in light of Pythagorean doctrines.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=126–127}}

Greek sculpture sought to represent the permanent reality behind superficial appearances.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}} Early [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] sculpture represents life in simple forms, and may have been influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies.{{efn|"For [[Thales]], the origin was water, and for [[Anaximander]] the infinite ([[apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]), which must be considered a material form"{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}}}} The Greeks generally believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}), which was mathematically calculated.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=62}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} When dimensions changed, architects sought to relay permanence through mathematics.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–63}}{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}} [[Maurice Bowra]] believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students, who believed that "all things are numbers".{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}}

During the sixth century BC, the number philosophy of the Pythagoreans triggered a revolution in Greek sculpture.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–65}} Greek sculptors and architects attempted to find the mathematical relation ([[aesthetic canon|canon]]) behind aesthetic perfection.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} Possibly drawing on the ideas of Pythagoras,{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} the sculptor [[Polykleitos]] writes in his ''Canon'' that beauty consists in the proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}{{efn|"Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole": ''Canon of Polykleitos'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I.vi.i: Nigel Spivey, pp. 290–294.}} In the Greek architectural orders, every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. [[Rhys Carpenter]] states that the ratio 2:1 was "the generative ratio of the [[Doric order]], and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes."{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}

The oldest known building designed according to Pythagorean teachings is the [[Porta Maggiore Basilica]],{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=154}} a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=154–156}} The basilica was built underground because of the Pythagorean emphasis on secrecy{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=157–158}} and also because of the legend that Pythagoras had sequestered himself in a cave on Samos.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=158}} The basilica's apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=158–159}} It has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=159}} The building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=159–161}} with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul approaching the unity of Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} The apse depicts a scene of the poetess [[Sappho]] leaping off the [[Lefkada|Leucadian cliffs]], clutching her lyre to her breast, while Apollo stands beneath her, extending his right hand in a gesture of protection,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} symbolizing Pythagorean teachings about the immortality of the soul.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} The interior of the sanctuary is almost entirely white because the color white was regarded by Pythagoreans as sacred.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=162–164}}

The emperor [[Hadrian]]'s [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] was also built based on Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=166–181}} The temple's circular plan, central axis, hemispherical [[dome]], and alignment with the four cardinal directions symbolize Pythagorean views on the order of the universe.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=167–168}} The single [[oculus]] at the top of the dome symbolizes the monad and the sun-god Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=168}} The twenty-eight ribs extending from the oculus symbolize the moon, because twenty-eight was the same number of months on the Pythagorean lunar calendar.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=169–170}} The five coffered rings beneath the ribs represent the marriage of the sun and moon.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}}

===In early Christianity===
Many early Christians had a deep respect for Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–65}} [[Eusebius]] ({{circa}} 260 – {{circa}} 340 AD), bishop of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], praises Pythagoras in his ''Against Hierokles'' for his rule of silence, his frugality, his "extraordinary" morality, and his wise teachings.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In another work, Eusebius compares Pythagoras to [[Moses]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In one of his letter, the [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Jerome]] ({{circa}} 347 – 420 AD) praises Pythagoras for his wisdom{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} and, in another letter, he credits Pythagoras for his belief in the immortality of the soul, which he suggests Christians inherited from him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–58}} [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354 – 430 AD) rejected Pythagoras's teaching of metempsychosis without explicitly naming him, but otherwise expressed admiration for him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=58–59}} In ''[[On the Trinity]]'', Augustine lauds the fact that Pythagoras was humble enough to call himself a ''philosophos'' or "lover of wisdom" rather than a "sage".{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}} In another passage, Augustine defends Pythagoras's reputation, arguing that Pythagoras certainly never taught the doctrine of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}}

==After antiquity==
===In the Middle Ages===
[[File:Pythagore-chartres.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Medieval carving of a man with long hair and a long beard hunched over a musical instrument he is working on|Pythagoras appears in a relief sculpture on one of the [[archivolts]] over the right door of the west portal at [[Chartres Cathedral]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and music, two of the [[Seven Liberal Arts]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} He appears in numerous medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures on the portal of the [[Cathedral of Chartres]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The ''Timaeus'' was the only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western Europe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} which led [[William of Conches]] (c. 1080-1160) to declare that Plato was Pythagorean.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In the 1430s, the Camaldolese friar [[Ambrose Traversari]] translated Diogenes Laërtius's ''Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'' from Greek into Latin{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} and, in the 1460s, the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] translated Porphyry and Iamblichus's ''Lives of Pythagoras'' into Latin as well,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} thereby allowing them to be read and studied by western scholars.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In 1494, the Greek Neopythagorean scholar [[Constantine Lascaris]] published ''[[The Golden Verses of Pythagoras]]'', translated into Latin, with a printed edition of his ''Grammatica'',{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} thereby bringing them to a widespread audience.{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} In 1499, he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work ''Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum'', issued in [[Messina]].{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}}

===On modern science===
In his preface to his book ''[[On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres]]'' (1543), [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on the development of his [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the universe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} deliberately omitting mention of [[Aristarchus of Samos]], a non-Pythagorean astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} [[Johannes Kepler]] considered himself to be a Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=161–171}}{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=265}} He believed in the Pythagorean doctrine of ''musica universalis''{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this doctrine that led to his discovery of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} Kepler titled his book on the subject ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonics of the World''), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=162}} Near the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the sound of the heavenly music, "warmed by having drunk a generous draught... from the cup of Pythagoras."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=274}}

[[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=279}} Though Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their discoveries,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} he attributed the discovery of the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Law of Universal Gravitation]] to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} [[Albert Einstein]] believed that a scientist may also be "a Platonist or a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}} The English philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] argued that "In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a doctor".{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|pages=36–37}} By this measure, Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are "following the pure Pythagorean tradition."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|page=36}}

===On vegetarianism===
[[File:Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism (1618-20); Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Painting showing Pythagoras on the far left quizzically stroking his beard as he gazes upon a massive pile of fruits and vegetables. Two followers stand behind him, fully clothed. A man with a greying beard sits at the base of a tree gesturing to the pile of produce. Next to him, a fleshy, nude woman with blonde hair plucks fruits from it. Slightly behind her, two other women, one partially clothed and the other nude but obscured by the tree branch, are also plucking fruits. At the far right end of the painting, two nude, faun-like men with beards and pointed ears hurl more fruits upon the pile.|''Pythagoras Advocating Vegetarianism'' (1618-1630) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was inspired by Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}} The painting portrays the Pythagoreans with corpulent bodies, indicating a belief that vegetarianism was healthful and nutritious.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}}]]

A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=189}} in which he delivers a speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian diet.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} It was through [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 English translation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} [[John Donne]]'s ''Progress of the Soul'' discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the speech{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[Michel de Montaigne]] quoted the speech no less than three times in his treatise "Of Cruelty" to voice his moral objections against the mistreatment of animals.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[William Shakespeare]] references the speech in his play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=282}} [[John Dryden]] included a translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work ''[[Fables, Ancient and Modern]]''{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[John Gay]]'s 1726 fable "Pythagoras and the Countryman" reiterates its major themes, linking carnivorism with tyranny.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Lord Chesterfield]] records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} Until the word ''vegetarianism'' was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were referred to in English as "Pythagoreans".{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote an ode entitled "To the Pythagorean Diet"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}} and [[Leo Tolstoy]] adopted the Pythagorean diet himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}}

===On Western esotericism===
Early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] drew heavily on the teachings of Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The German [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Johannes Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) synthesized Pythagoreanism with [[Christian theology]] and Jewish [[Kabbalah]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} arguing that Kabbalah and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by [[Moses|Mosaic]] tradition{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} and that Pythagoras was therefore a kabbalist.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} In his dialogue ''De verbo mirifico'' (1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the [[Ineffability|ineffable]] divine name [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} ascribing each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according to Pythagorean mystical teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}}

[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s popular and influential three-volume treatise ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|De Occulta Philosophia]]'' cites Pythagoras as a "religious magi"{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} and indicates that Pythagoras's mystical numerology operates on a [[Allegory in Renaissance literature#Three world theory|supercelestial]] level.{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} The [[Freemasonry|freemasons]] deliberately modeled their society on the community founded by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=133}} [[Rosicrucianism]] used Pythagorean symbolism,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} as did [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637),{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} who believed his own musical writings to have been inspired by Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} [[John Dee]] was heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideology,{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} particularly the teaching that all things are made of numbers.{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} [[Adam Weishaupt]], the founder of the [[Illuminati]], was a strong admirer of Pythagoras{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=284–288}} and, in his book ''Pythagoras'' (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras's commune at Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=287–288}} [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=286–287}} [[Sylvain Maréchal]], in his six-volume 1799 biography ''The Voyages of Pythagoras'', declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the "heirs of Pythagoras".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=288}}

===On literature===
[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|alt=Engraving showing two small silhouettes standing before a tunnel of innumerably manifold circling angels leading to a bright, beautiful light at the end.|[[Dante Alighieri]]'s description of Heaven in his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' incorporates Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}}]]

[[Dante Alighieri]] was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} and based his descriptions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and [[Heaven]] on Pythagorean numbers.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=90}} and, in ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' XV, 56–57, he declares: "five and six, if understood, ray forth from unity."{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=90–91}} The number eleven and its multiples are found throughout the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', each book of which has thirty-three [[canto]]s, except for the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general introduction.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Dante describes the ninth and tenth bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven miles respectively,{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} which correspond to the fraction {{sfrac|22|7}}, which was the Pythagorean approximation of [[pi]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven are all described as circular{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} and Dante compares the wonder of [[God in Christianity|God]]'s majesty to the mathematical puzzle of [[squaring the circle]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} The number three also features prominently:{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} the ''Divine Comedy'' has three parts{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=91–92}} and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is associated with the number nine, which is equal to three times three.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=92}}

The [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] read the ancient ''Lives of Pythagoras'' as guides on how to live a model life.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] was impacted by [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s translations of Iamblichus's ''Life of Pythagoras'' and [[Stobaeus]]'s ''Pythagoric Sayings''{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} and his views on nature may have been influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to archetypes.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} The Pythagorean teaching of ''musica universalis'' is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau's ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''[[Walden]]''.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}}

'''Raman Research Institute''' ('''RRI''') is an institute of scientific research located in [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. It was founded by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate [[C. V. Raman]]. Although it began as an institute privately owned by Sir [[C. V. Raman]], it is now funded by the government of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/viral-and-trending/280217/no-raman-effect-how-his-dream-died-a-quiet-death.html|title=No Raman effect: How his dream died a quiet death|last=Srikanth|first=B. R.|date=28 February 2017|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|access-date=1 September 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The main areas of research are:
*[[Astronomy]] and [[Astrophysics]]
*[[Theoretical Physics]]
*Light and Matter Physics
*Soft [[Condensed matter physics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/isro-and-raman-research-institute-to-develop-quantum-technologies-for-isros-satellites-4178401.html|title=SRO and Raman Research Institute to develop quantum technologies for ISRO's satellites|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Much before Raman thought about founding a research institute of his own, he had approached the then Maharaja of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] seeking land to build office and conference premises for the Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS), which was again a brainchild of Raman's. The Maharaja readily acceded to Raman's request and a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot of land in the posh [[Malleshwaram]] suburb of Bangalore was allotted to the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1934. However, the Academy (headed by Raman) made no use of the land for seven years. According to the terms of the allotment, the land could be resumed by the government of Mysore at the end of 1941, if it remained unused. Therefore, in 1941, Raman as President of the IAS held an extraordinary meeting of the academy and proposed that a research institute (to be named after himself) be built on the land. This proposal was sanctioned and a stone was laid on the ground, signifying that the land was now in use. However, it was not until 1948 that the institute could be inaugurated. Raman had planned the institute much before he retired as the head of the Physics Department of the Indian Institute of Science. His idea had been to walk straight into his newly founded institute when he retired from IISc. This happened in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dst.gov.in/autonomousstinstitutions/raman-research-institute-bangalore|title=Raman Research Institute, Bangalore|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dst.gov.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Raman Research Institute began under the umbrella of the Indian Academy of Sciences. During Raman's own time, the presidency of the Indian Academy of Sciences and the directorship of the Raman Research Institute (RRI) were both vested in him and he was the undisputed supreme authority at both places. This highly personal style suited the temperament of the founder.

Another major facet of Raman's temperament was his hatred for writing project reports, or for that matter giving periodic status reports to those who fund projects. For this reason, Raman refused to accept any funds from the Indian government and other sources. "He was of the firm belief that science could not be done that way." says Prof. N. V Madhusudana, Dean of Research at RRI and a leading liquid crystal scientist. As a Nobel laurate, Raman enjoyed a monumental standing in Indian public life and was able to raise funds for the institute through private donations and fund-raisers which did not involve any governmental authority. "Till Raman's death, this was his private research institute. He had a very small group of research students working with him and a very few administrative staff" says Prof. Madhusudana.

Raman was clear that after his death, when the Presidency of the IAS and Director of the RRI could devolve upon different individuals, RRI should not remain subordinate to the IAS but should enjoy autonomy and have a distinct statutory identity of its own. Therefore, just before his death, Raman chartered out a framework for running the institute, separating it completely from the Indian Academy of Sciences and giving it statutory autonomy. The Institute adopted the change immediately after Raman's death in 1971 with the consent of the government, and stepped into a new era as a statutory body, functioning since 1972 on annual grants received from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

==Achievements==
Despite its budgetary and infrastructural constraints, scientists working under Raman did some path-breaking work. For instance, S. Pancharatnam, who joined the institute in 1954, discovered a fundamental quantum optic effect, independent of Raman. This work, according to Jayaraman, was "the most outstanding original piece of research that came out of RRI at that time."

This discovery proved for the first time that geometric phase exists in optics. But this work was not known to the world till similar discovery was made by scientists elsewhere about two decades later. Subsequently, RRI could convincingly prove that Pancharatnam discovered this long ago and today "this phase is called Pancharatnam Phase world over," said Madhusudana. Pancharatnam unfortunately did not live long enough and his brilliant career was cut short when he died in 1969 while in Oxford.

===Collections===
The institute also houses Raman's prized collection of gems, crystals, minerals, and rock specimens from all over the world. Raman, who was fascinated by the colours of the biological kingdom, also had a veritable collection of stuffed birds, beetles, and butterflies in his museum. It is said that Raman used to take a lot of pride in showing off his precious collections to distinguished visitors to the institute. During Raman's time, many celebrated scientists from other countries paid a visit to the institute. Among them were: J. D. Bernal, E. C. Bullard, P. M. S. Blackett, C. G. Darwin, P. A. M. Dirac, G. Gamow, J. B. S. Haldane, Linus Pauling, C. F. Powell, L. Rosenfeld, G. Wentzel and Norbert Wiener.

===Liquid crystals===
One of the current research priority areas of the institute is liquid crystals. This has been an active area of research at the Raman Research Institute for nearly three decades. The research programme covers a broad spectrum of activities ranging from the synthesis of new liquid crystalline materials to display electronics. Discoveries of the columnar phase formed by disc-like molecules and pressure induced mesomorphism are two of the early significant contributions made by the liquid crystal group. "Out of 36 liquid crystal materials discovered world over three were from this institute," said Prof. Madhusudana. Among them are two new liquid crystalline phases, namely the undulating twist grain boundary C phase and the biaxial smectic A phase.

Techniques developed for driving passive matrix liquid crystal displays at the institute are now being widely used. In recent years the liquid crystal group has been working on electrochemical aspects of surface science and on other soft materials like surfactants, polymers, and on the physics of biological systems

===Astronomy and astrophysics===
Astronomy and astrophysics has been another strong area of research for RRI. According to Prof. Madhusudana, this division accounts for the maximum number of faculty and research students of the institute. Over the last 20 years, it has been carrying out observational programmes in radio astronomy, covering almost the entire radio spectrum. Besides having a millimetrewave telescope of 10.4 metre diameter on the campus, RRI has set up the [[Gauribidanur Radio Observatory]], a decametrewave Radio telescope at Gauribidanur, about 80 kilometres away from Bangalore, jointly with the [[Indian Institute of Astrophysics]] (IIA), Bangalore. This is one of the few largest telescopes that operate at the wavelength of 10 metre and is being used by RRI scientists to study radio emission from various types of celestial objects such as the Sun, Jupiter and similar radio sources in Milky Way and other galaxies.

Other radio telescopes that are being used by RRI scientists for observations are the [[Ooty Radio Telescope]], at Ooty, and [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT), near Pune, both set up by the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (TIFR). RRI also played an active role in building the [[Mauritius Radio Telescope]], a low-frequency radio telescope in Mauritius jointly with the [[University of Mauritius]] and IIA.

The major astronomical investigations pursued at the Institute can be broadly classified into the following categories: (i) Neutron Stars and Pulsars; (ii) cosmology; (iii) Diffuse matter in space; and (iv) Radio Sky Surveys.

===Theoretical physics===
The theoretical physics activity in the institute has centred on relativity and gravity, quantum theory, and optics. The current activity in gravitation centres on two themes, gravitational radiation and quantum gravity. Gravitation is known to be the weakest of all known forces of nature, but it dominates all structure and motion on the astronomical scale because of its attractive universality, its long range and the fact that matter on the large scale is essentially neutral. The correct theory of gravitation is now believed to be [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[General Theory of Relativity]]. One of the fundamental predictions of General Theory of Relativity is that of gravitational waves — waves of distortion of spacetime itself - propagating at a finite speed of light. This replaces the Newtonian gravitations forces which was instantaneous. Such waves are expected to be emitted when, for example, two massive inspiralling stars tend to coalesce under their mutual gravitations attraction. Accurate calculation of this gravitational radiation — its waveform — has been one of the major research programmes of the theoretical physics group at the institute. Their work is expected to be a crucial input towards its eventual detection.

Another major activity of the theoretical physics group has been in studying propagation of light waves in certain types of liquid crystals and minerals and their associated polarization phenomenon. RRI has been a pioneer in this field of study which was actually initiated by one of Raman's research students, Pancharatnam.

All living cells produce [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) as a byproduct of metabolism.  ROS are reduced oxygen intermediates that include the [[superoxide]] radical (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and the [[hydroxyl radical]] (OH•), as well as the non-radical species [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  These ROS are important in the normal functioning of cells, playing a role in signal transduction&lt;ref name="Cadenas"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2673022 |year=1989 |last1=Cadenas |first1=E |title=Biochemistry of oxygen toxicity |volume=58 |pages=79–110 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.58.070189.000455 |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridovich_a"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9510531 |year=1998 |last1=Fridovich |first1=I |title=Oxygen toxicity: A radical explanation |volume=201 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=1203–9 |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the expression of transcription factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.279.5357.1718 |title=Activation of the OxyR Transcription Factor by Reversible Disulfide Bond Formation |year=1998 |last1=Zheng |first1=M. |journal=Science |volume=279 |issue=5357 |pages=1718–21 |pmid=9497290 |last2=Aslund |first2=F |last3=Storz |first3=G |bibcode=1998Sci...279.1718Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12115731 |year=2002 |last1=Martindale |first1=JL |last2=Holbrook |first2=NJ |title=Cellular response to oxidative stress: Signaling for suicide and survival |volume=192 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1002/jcp.10119 |journal=Journal of Cellular Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when present in excess, ROS can cause damage to proteins, lipids and DNA by reacting with these biomolecules to modify or destroy their intended function.

== Chemical background ==

In sea water, ROS can be generated through abiotic as well as biotic processes, among which are the radiolysis and photolysis of water molecules and cellular respiration.  According to a model proposed by Fan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marchem.2008.01.005 |title=Photochemical and biochemical controls on reactive oxygen and iron speciation in the pelagic surface ocean |year=2008 |last1=Fan |first1=Song-Miao |journal=Marine Chemistry |volume=109 |pages=152–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the prediction of ROS in surface waters, the biochemistry mediated by phytoplankton may be just as important for the production of ROS as photochemistry.

First, ROS concentrations are generally low (nanomoles) in seawater.  Second, they may react with other hard to identify molecules that occur in low quantities, resulting in unknown products.  Finally, they are (for the most part) transient intermediates, having lifetimes as little as microseconds.&lt;ref name="Blough"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blough |first1=Neil |last2=Zepp |first2=Richard G. |title=Active oxygen in chemistry |year=1995 |publisher=Blackie Acad. &amp; Professional |location=London |isbn=9780751402926 |editor=Christopher S.

===Superoxide production===

According to Blough &amp; Zepp,&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt; superoxide is one of the hardest reactive oxygen species to quantify because it is present in low concentrations: 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; M in the open ocean and up to 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;M in coastal areas.  The main sources of biological superoxide in the ocean come from the reduction of oxygen at the cell surface and metabolites released into the water.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lo.2005.50.4.1172 |title=Extracellular production of superoxide by marine diatoms: Contrasting effects on iron redox chemistry and bioavailability |year=2005 |last1=Kustka |first1=Adam B. |last2=Shaked |first2=Yeala |last3=Milligan |first3=Allen J. |last4=King |first4=D.

M. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=1172–80|bibcode=2005LimOc..50.1172K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In marine systems, superoxide most often acts as a one-electron reductant, but it can also serve as an oxidant and may increase the normally slow oxidation rates of environmental compounds.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;   Superoxide is very unstable, with between 50 and 80% of its concentration of anions spontaneously disproportionating to hydrogen peroxide.  At its peak, this reaction occurs with a rate constant on the order of 2.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; – 4.5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; L mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;  The dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide can also be catalyzed by the antioxidant enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]] with a rate constant on the order of 2×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; L mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.106.082040 |title=Production and Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species in Chloroplasts and Their Functions |year=2006 |last1=Asada |first1=K. |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=391–6 |pmid=16760493 |pmc=1475469}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these fast acting processes, the steady state concentration of superoxide is very small. Since superoxide is also moderately reactive towards trace metals and dissolved organic matter, any remaining superoxide is thought to be removed from the water column through reactions with these species.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt; As a result, the presence of superoxide in surface waters has been known to result in an increase of reduced iron.&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moffett"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es00162a012 |title=Reaction kinetics of hydrogen peroxide with copper and iron in seawater |year=1987 |last1=Moffett |first1=James W. |last2=Zika |first2=Rod G. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=804–810|bibcode=1987EnST...21..804M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, serves to enhance the availability of iron to phytoplankton whose growth is often limited by this key nutrient.  As a charged radical species, superoxide is unlikely to significantly affect an organism's cellular function since it is not able to easily diffuse through the cell membrane.  Instead, its potential toxicity lies in its ability to react with extracellular surface proteins or carbohydrates to inactivate their functions.&lt;ref name="Fridovich"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3010872 |year=1986 |last1=Fridovich |first1=I |title=Biological effects of the superoxide radical |volume=247 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(86)90526-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although its lifetime is fairly short (about 50 microseconds), superoxide has the potential to reach cell surfaces since it has a diffusion distance of about 320&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Cadenas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridovich" /&gt;

===Hydrogen peroxide production===

The reduction product of superoxide is hydrogen peroxide, one of the most studied reactive oxygen species because it occurs in relatively high concentrations, is relatively stable, and is fairly easy to measure.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;  It is thought that algal [[photosynthesis]] is one of the major modes of hydrogen peroxide production, while the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by stressed organisms is a secondary source.&lt;ref name="Palenik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palenik_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt; In marine systems, hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exists at concentrations of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; M in the photic zone,&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt; but has been found in double those concentrations in parts of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0967-0645(01)00026-1 |title=The distribution of hydrogen peroxide in the southern and central Atlantic ocean |year=2001 |last1=Yuan |first1=Jinchun |last2=Shiller |first2=Alan M |journal=Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography |volume=48 |issue=13 |pages=2947–2970|bibcode=2001DSRII..48.2947Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lifetime, ranging from hours to days in coastal waters, can be as long as 15 days in Antarctic seawater.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is important in aquatic environments because it can oxidize dissolved organic matter and affect the redox chemistry of iron, copper, and manganese.&lt;ref name="Moffett" /&gt;  Since hydrogen peroxide, as an uncharged molecule, diffuses easily across biological membranes it can directly damage cellular constituents (DNA and enzymes) by reacting with them and deactivating their functions.&lt;ref name="Fridovich_a" /&gt;  In addition, hydrogen peroxide reduces to the hydroxyl radical, the most reactive radical and the one with the greatest possibility for damage.&lt;ref name="Cadenas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridovich_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;

===Hydroxyl radical production===

Even though the superoxide and the hydrogen peroxide radicals are toxic in their own right, they become potentially more toxic when they interact to form the hydroxyl radical (OH•).  This proceeds through the iron and copper catalyzed [[Haber–Weiss reaction]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klebanoff |first=S.J. |editor=Furth, Ralph van |title=Mononuclear phagocytes: functional aspects |year=1980 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location=Boston |pages=1105–1141 |isbn=9789024722112}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ↔ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

However, because the radical is so reactive, there is likely not enough time for transport to the cell surface (mean diffusion distance of 4.5&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;  Thus, direct effects to organisms of externally generated hydroxyl radicals are expected to be minimal.  Indirectly, the hydroxyl radical can result in significant biogeochemical changes in marine systems by influencing the cycling of dissolved organic matter and trace metal speciation.  Both intracellular and extracellular reactive oxygen species can be removed from the environment by antioxidants produced biologically as a defense mechanism. Many phytoplankton, for instance, have been found to have numerous superoxide-scavenging (superoxide dismutase) and hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzymes (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=K. |first=Asada |author2=Baker, N.R. |author3=Boyer, J.B. |year=1994 |chapter=Mechanisms for scavenging reactive molecules generated in chloroplasts under light stress |title=Photoinhibition of photosynthesis: from molecular mechanisms to the field |publisher=Bios Scientific Publishers |location=Oxford, UK |pages=129–142 |isbn=9781872748030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09670269600651471 |title=Production, scavenging and toxicity of hydrogen peroxide in the green seaweed ''Ulva rigida'' |year=1996 |last1=Collén |first1=Jonas |last2=Pedersén |first2=Marianne |journal=European Journal of Phycology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=265–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14622986 |year=2003 |last1=Barros |first1=MP |last2=Granbom |first2=M |last3=Colepicolo |first3=P |last4=Pedersén |first4=M |title=Temporal mismatch between induction of superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase correlates with high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in seawater from clofibrate-treated red algae ''Kappaphycus alvarezii'' |volume=420 |issue=1 |pages=161–8 |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |doi=10.1016/j.abb.2003.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-0981(03)00042-X |title=Responses of marine macroalgae to hydrogen-peroxide stress |year=2003 |last1=Dummermuth |first1=A.L |last2=Karsten |first2=U |last3=Fisch |first3=K.M |last4=König |first4=G.M |last5=Wiencke |first5=C |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=289 |pages=103–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2003.08.007 |title=Oxidative stress tolerance in the filamentous green algae Cladophora glomerata and Enteromorpha ahlneriana |year=2004 |last1=Choo |first1=Kyung-sil |last2=Snoeijs |first2=Pauli |last3=Pedersén |first3=Marianne |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=298 |pages=111–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The antioxidant superoxide dismutase catalyses the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the superoxide anion through the following reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3315461 |year=1987 |last1=Bannister |first1=JV |last2=Bannister |first2=WH |last3=Rotilio |first3=G |title=Aspects of the structure, function, and applications of superoxide dismutase |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=111–80 |journal=Critical Reviews in Biochemistry |doi=10.3109/10409238709083738}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ↔ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Controls of ROS production in algae==

Many algal species have been shown to not only produce reactive oxygen species under normal conditions but to increase production of these compounds under stressful situations.  In particular, ROS levels have been shown to be influenced by cell size, cell density, growth stage, light intensity, temperature, and nutrient availability.

===Cell size===

Oda ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt; found that differences in the production of ROS were due to the size of the cell.  By comparing four species of flagellates, they showed that the larger species Ichatonella produced the most superoxide and hydrogen peroxide per cell than ''[[Heterosigma akashiwo]]'', ''Olisthodiscus luteus'', and ''Fibrocapsa japonica''.  In a comparison of 37 species of marine microalgae, including dinoflagellates, rhaphidophytes, and chlorophytes, Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt; also found a direct relationship between cell size and the amount of superoxide produced.  The largest cells, ''Chattonella marina'', produced up to 100 times more superoxide than most other marine algae (see figure in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3354/meps09036 |title=Ichthyotoxicity of gymnodinioid dinoflagellates: PUFA and superoxide effects in sheepshead minnow larvae and rainbow trout gill cells |year=2011 |last1=Mooney |first1=BD |last2=Dorantes-Aranda |first2=JJ |last3=Place |first3=AR |last4=Hallegraeff |first4=GM |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=426 |pages=213–224|bibcode=2011MEPS..426..213M }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The authors suggest that since ROS is produced as a byproduct of metabolism, and larger cells are more metabolically active than smaller cells, it follows that larger cells should produce more ROS.  Similarly, since photosynthesis also produces ROS, larger cells likely have a greater volume of chloroplasts and would be expected to produce more ROS than smaller cells.

===Algal density===

The production of ROS has also been shown to be dependent on algal cell density. Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt; found that for ''Chattonella marina'', higher concentrations of cells produced less superoxide per cell than those with a lower density.  This may explain why some raphydophyte blooms are toxic at low concentration and non-toxic in heavy blooms.&lt;ref name="Twiner"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/plankt/22.10.1961 |title=Possible physiological mechanisms for production of hydrogen peroxide by the ichthyotoxic flagellate ''Heterosigma akashiwo'' |year=2000 |last1=Twiner |first1=M. J. |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1961–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tang &amp; Gobler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.hal.2008.10.001 |title=Characterization of the toxicity of ''Cochlodinium polykrikoides'' isolates from Northeast US estuaries to finfish and shellfish |year=2009 |last1=Tang |first1=Ying Zhong |last2=Gobler |first2=Christopher J. |journal=Harmful Algae |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=454–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found that cell density was inversely related to ROS production for the alga Cochlodinium polykrikoides.  They found, in addition, that increases of ROS production were also related to the growth phase of algae.  In particular, algae in exponential growth were more toxic than those in the stationary or late exponential phase.  Many other algal species (''[[Heterosigma akashiwo]]'', ''Chattonella marina'', and ''Chattonella antiqua'') have also been shown to produce the highest amounts of ROS during the exponential phase of growth.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortuneKevin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2010.00906.x |title=Antioxidant Enzyme Response and Reactive Oxygen Species Production in Marine Raphidophytes1 |year=2010 |last1=Portune |first1=Kevin J. |last2=Craig Cary |first2=Stephen |last3=Warner |first3=Mark E. |journal=Journal of Phycology |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1161–1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oda ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt; suggest this is due to actively growing cells having higher photosynthesis and metabolic rates.  Resting stage cells of ''[[Chattonella antiqua]]'' have been shown to generate less superoxide than their motile counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/plankt/16.2.161 |title=Generation of superoxide anion radicals by the marine phytoplankton organism, ''Chattonella antiqua'' |year=1994 |last1=Tanaka |first1=Kazuko |last2=Muto |first2=Yoshinori |last3=Shimada |first3=Masahisa |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=161–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light levels===

Since superoxide is produced through the auto-oxidation of an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis, one would expect a positive relationship between light levels and algal ROS production.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;  This is indeed what has been shown: in the diatom ''[[Thallasia weissflogii]]'', an increase in light intensity caused an increase in the production of both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lom.2009.7.706 |title=Real-time detection of reactive oxygen species generation by marine phytoplankton using flow injection—chemiluminescence |year=2009 |last1=Milne |first1=Angela |last2=Davey |first2=Margaret S. |last3=Worsfold |first3=Paul J. |last4=Achterberg |first4=Eric P. |last5=Taylor |first5=Alison R. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography: Methods |volume=7 |pages=706–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in the flagellates ''[[Chattonella marina]]'', ''Prorocentrum minimum'', and ''Cochlodinium polykrikoides'', decreases in light levels resulted in decreases in superoxide production,&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s002270100614 |title=Possible involvement of the glycocalyx in the ichthyotoxicity of ''Chattonella marina'' (Raphidophyceae): Immunological approach using antiserum against cell surface structures of the flagellate |year=2001 |last1=d(-k.). |first1=Kim |last2=t. |first2=Okamoto |last3=t. |first3=Oda |last4=k. |first4=Tachibana |last5=k.s. |first5=Lee |last6=a. |first6=Ishimatsu |last7=y. |first7=Matsuyama |last8=t. |first8=Honjo |last9=t. |first9=Muramatsu |journal=Marine Biology |volume=139 |issue=4 |pages=625–632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12601-009-0018-z |title=Physiological and biochemical responses of Prorocentrum minimum to high light stress |year=2010 |last1=Park |first1=So Yun |last2=Choi |first2=Eun Seok |last3=Hwang |first3=Jinik |last4=Kim |first4=Donggiun |last5=Ryu |first5=Tae Kwon |last6=Lee |first6=Taek-Kyun |journal=Ocean Science Journal |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=199–204|bibcode=2009OSJ....44..199P }}&lt;/ref&gt; with higher levels produced during the day.  However, because many studies have found ROS production to be relatively high even in the dark, metabolic pathways other than photosynthesis are likely more important for production.&lt;ref name="PortuneKevin" /&gt;  For instance, Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2007.03.007 |title=Effects of nutrients, salinity, pH and light:dark cycle on the production of reactive oxygen species in the alga ''Chattonella marina'' |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Wenhua |last2=Au |first2=Doris W.T. |last3=Anderson |first3=Donald M. |last4=Lam |first4=Paul K.S. |last5=Wu |first5=Rudolf S.S. |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=346 |pages=76–86|url=http://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/1764/1/algal%20ROS%20production%20JEMBE%20revised%206_3_07.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  found that ROS production was regulated by iron concentration and pH.  From this evidence they suggest that ROS production is most likely due to a plasma membrane enzyme system dependent on iron availability.  Similarly, in Heterosigma akashiwo, the depletion of iron and an increase in temperature, not light intensity, resulted in enhanced production of ROS.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;  Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;  found the same relationship with temperature.

==Functions of algal produced ROS==

The active release of reactive oxygen species from cells has a variety of purposes, including a means to deter predators, or a chemical defense for the incapacitation of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1568-9883(02)00048-3 |title=The toxigenic marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense as the probable cause of mortality of caged salmon in Nova Scotia |year=2002 |last1=Cembella |first1=A.D |last2=Quilliam |first2=M.A |last3=Lewis |first3=N.I |last4=Bauder |first4=A.G |last5=Dell'Aversano |first5=C |last6=Thomas |first6=K |last7=Jellett |first7=J |last8=Cusack |first8=R.R |journal=Harmful Algae |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=313–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-42-4-406.1 |title=Allelopathy in phytoplankton - biochemical, ecological and evolutionary aspects |year=2003 |last1=Legrand |first1=Catherine |last2=Rengefors |first2=Karin |last3=Fistarol |first3=Giovana O. |last4=Granéli |first4=Edna |journal=Phycologia |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=406–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graneli"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Granéli |first1=E. |last2=Hansen |first2=P.

===Chemical defense===

It is not surprising that ROS production may be a form of chemical defense against predators, since at low levels it can damage DNA and at high levels lead to cell necrosis.&lt;ref name="Lesser" /&gt;  One of the most common mechanisms of cellular injury is the reaction of ROS with lipids, which can disrupt enzyme activity and ATP production, and lead to apoptosis.&lt;ref name="Halliwell" /&gt;  Reactions of ROS with proteins can modify amino acids, fragment peptide chains, alter electrical charges, and ultimately inactivate an enzyme's function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0968-0004(86)90221-5 |title=Oxidation of proteins by mixed-function oxidation systems: Implication in protein turnover, ageing and neutrophil function |year=1986 |last1=Stadtman |first1=E.R. |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=11 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3036875 |year=1987 |last1=Davies |first1=KJ |title=Protein damage and degradation by oxygen radicals.

Reactive oxygen species produced by phytoplankton have been linked to deaths of fish, shellfish, and protists, as well as shown to reduce the viability and growth of bacteria.&lt;ref name="IshimatsuAtsushi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24176 |year=1978 |last1=Babior |first1=BM |title=Oxygen-dependent microbial killing by phagocytes (first of two parts) |volume=298 |issue=12 |pages=659–68 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197803232981205 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KimDaekyung"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Daekyung |last2=Nakamura |first2=Atsushi |last3=Okamoto |first3=Tarou |last4=Komatsu |first4=Nobukazu |last5=Oda |first5=Tatsuya |last6=Ishimatsu |first6=Atsushi |last7=Muramatsu |first7=Tsuyoshi |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |title=Toxic potential of the raphidophyte Olisthodiscus luteus: mediation by reactive oxygen species |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=1017–27 |year=1999 |issn=0142-7873 |doi=10.1093/plankt/21.6.1017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a study by Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt; showed that four algal species used as bivalve feed produced significantly lower concentrations of superoxide, suggesting that ROS production by other algal species may be a way to decrease grazing by bivalves.  The most direct evidence for ROS as a defense mechanism is the fact that many icthyotoxic algae produce greater concentrations of ROS than nonichthyotoxic strains.&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;

===Enhancement of toxic exudates===

It is possible that ROS may not be the actual toxic substance, but may in fact work to make other exudates more toxic by oxidizing them.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okaichi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okaichi |first1=Tomotoshi |last2=Mark Anderson |first2=Donald |last3=Nemoto |first3=Takahisa |title=Red tides: biology, environmental science, and toxicology |year=1989 |publisher=Elsevier |location=New York |isbn=9780444013439 |pages=145–176 |chapter=Proceedings of the first international symposium on Red tides}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ROS from ''Chattonella marina'' have been shown to enhance the toxic effects of fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on exposed fishes.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okaichi" /&gt;  Similarly, free-fatty acids released from diatom biofilms as products of ROS oxidation of EPA are known to be toxic to zooplankters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.00130.x |title=Liberation of 5,8,11,14,17-Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Other Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids from Lipids As a Grazer Defense Reaction in Epilithic Diatom Biofilms |year=2001 |last1=Juttner |first1=Friedrich |journal=Journal of Phycology |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=744–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Fontana ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17886321 |year=2007 |last1=Fontana |first1=A |last2=d'Ippolito |first2=G |last3=Cutignano |first3=A |last4=Romano |first4=G |last5=Lamari |first5=N |last6=Massa Gallucci |first6=A |last7=Cimino |first7=G |last8=Miralto |first8=A |last9=Ianora |first9=A |title=LOX-induced lipid peroxidation mechanism responsible for the detrimental effect of marine diatoms on zooplankton grazers |volume=8 |issue=15 |pages=1810–8 |doi=10.1002/cbic.200700269 |journal=ChemBioChem}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the interaction of ROS and diatom exudates (such as fatty acid hydroperoxides) are responsible for inhibiting embryonic development and causing larval abnormalities in copepods.  Finally, ROS oxidation of algal polyunsaturated fatty acids have also been shown to deter grazers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ikawa |first=M. |title=Algal polyunsaturated fatty acids and effects on plankton ecology and other organisms |url=http://www.cfb.unh.edu/PDF/2004/UNHCFBR-6-2-2004.pdf |journal=UNH Center for Freshwater Biology Research |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=17–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitive advantage===

In addition to impacting predator-prey interactions, the production of ROS may also help an alga get an advantage in the competition for resources against other algae, be a way to prevent fouling bacteria, and act as a signaling mechanism between cells.&lt;ref name="Graneli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KimDaekyung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oda_a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00356297 |title=Oxygen-radical-mediated toxic effects of the red tide flagellate Chattonella marina on Vibrio alginolyticus |year=1992 |last1=Oda |first1=T. |last2=Ishimatsu |first2=A. |last3=Shimada |first3=M. |last4=Takeshita |first4=S. |last5=Muramatsu |first5=T. |journal=Marine Biology |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=505–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ROS can inhibit photosynthesis in algae&lt;ref name="Lesser" /&gt;  Thus an alga that is more tolerant of ROS than another may produce and release it as a means of decreasing the other species competitive ability.  In addition, ''Chattonella marina'', the most well studied raphydophyte for ROS production, may produce a boundary of ROS that deters other marine microalgae from using nutrients in its vicinity.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;  Similarly, this boundary could also be a way to discourage bacteria fouling, since the production of ROS is known to inhibit growth and bioluminescent ability in the bacteria ''[[Vibrio alginolyticus]]'' and ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name="KimDaekyung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oda_a" /&gt; Lastly, Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; showed that ''Chattonella marina'' cells were able to change their rate of superoxide production in as little as one hour when in different cell densities, increasing the rate from 1.4 to 7.8 times the original. They suggest that this quick response in altering rates of production may be a form of chemical signaling between cells that works to provide information about cell density.

===Reduction of metals===

ROS may be useful in the oxidation or reduction of necessary or toxic metals.  Since iron is necessary for phytoplankton growth, the auto-reduction of reactive oxygen species may be a way for algae to get usable iron from free or organically bound ferric iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0304-4203(95)00035-p |title=Iron uptake and growth limitation in oceanic and coastal phytoplankton |year=1995 |last1=Sunda |first1=William G. |last2=Huntsman |first2=Susan A. |journal=Marine Chemistry |volume=50 |pages=189–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Cakman ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Cakman"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16665677 |year=1987 |last1=Cakmak |first1=I |last2=Van De Wetering |first2=DA |last3=Marschner |first3=H |last4=Bienfait |first4=HF |title=Involvement of superoxide radical in extracellular ferric reduction by iron-deficient bean roots |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=310–4 |pmc=1054247 |journal=Plant Physiology |doi=10.1104/pp.85.1.310}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that ROS may increase the amount of iron available through extracellular ferric reduction.  It is thought that the high reducing power of this reaction is maintained through the electron-rich superoxide ion.&lt;ref name="Cakman" /&gt;  In several studies on the ROS production of ''Heterosigma akashiwo'', hydrogen peroxide production was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of iron available.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lo.2001.46.6.1400 |title=Toxic effects of Heterosigma akashiwo do not appear to be mediated by hydrogen peroxide |year=2001 |last1=Twiner |first1=Michael J. |last2=Dixon |first2=S. Jeffrey |last3=Trick |first3=Charles G. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1400–05|bibcode=2001LimOc..46.1400T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Cornish and Page in 1998 found that phytoplankton produce more ROS when there are lower levels of extracellular iron.  They suggested that when intracellular iron is limiting, the phytoplankton respond by producing more ROS as a way to increase the reducing potential around the cell and thus be better able to reduce that iron to a usable form.  Similarly, lower ROS production would suggest that the intracellular iron is at sufficiently high levels for cellular function.

In [[education]], '''response to intervention'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtinetwork.org/learn/what/whatisrti|title=What is Response to Intervention (RTI)? {{!}} RTI Action Network|last=Gorski|first=Deb|website=www.rtinetwork.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (commonly abbreviated '''RTI''' or '''RtI''') is an approach to academic intervention used in the United States to provide early, systematic, and appropriately intensive assistance to children who are at risk for or already underperforming as compared to appropriate grade- or age-level standards. RTI seeks to promote academic success  through universal screening, early intervention, frequent progress monitoring, and increasingly intensive research-based instruction or interventions for children who continue to have difficulty. RTI is a multileveled approach for aiding students that is adjusted and modified as needed if they are failing.

In terms of identifying students with [[learning disability|specific learning disabilities]] (SLD)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.specialeducationguide.com/disability-profiles/specific-learning-disabilities/|title=A Guide to Specific Learning Disabilities {{!}} Special Education Guide|work=Special Education Guide|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, RTI was proposed as an alternative to the ability–achievement discrepancy model, which requires children to exhibit a significant discrepancy between their ability (often measured by [[Intelligence quotient|IQ testing]]) and academic achievement (as measured by their grades and standardized testing). Methods to identify students with SLD have been controversial for decades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ysseldyke, J., Thurlow, M., Graden, J., Wesson, C., Algozzine, B., &amp; Deno, S. L.|year=1983|title=Generalizations from five years of research on assessment and decision-making:  The University of Minnesota Institute|journal=Exceptional Education Quarterly|volume=4|pages=75–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proponents of RTI claim that the process brings more clarity to the Specific Learning Disability (SLD) category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act]] (IDEA 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/idea/|title=Individuals with Disabilities Education Act {{!}} IDEA|website=sites.ed.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while opponents claim that RTI simply identifies low achieving students rather than students with learning disabilities.

==Description==
RTI is originally a special education term that has broadened into general education framework that involves research-based instruction and interventions, regular monitoring of student progress, and the subsequent use of these data over time to make a variety of educational decisions, including, but not limited to SLD eligibility.&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/handouts/revisedPDFs/rtiprimer.pdf|title=Response to Intervention (RTI): A Primer for Parents|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this broadened conception of RTI, a shift to labeling this as one of the approaches of a Multi-Tier System of Supports (MTSS) occurring in schools and the professional literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gresham, F., Reschly, D., &amp; Shinn, M. R.|year=2010|chapter=RTI as a driving force in educational improvement: Historical legal, research, and practice perspectives|editors=M. R. Shinn &amp; H. M. Walker |title=Interventions for academic achievement problems in a three-tier model, including RTI|pages=47–77|location=Bethesda, MD|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key to the RTI process is the application of scientifically based interventions that have been demonstrated to work in [[randomized controlled trial]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0025811/|title=Randomized Control Trial - National Library of Medicine|last=pmhdev|website=PubMed Health|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A goal of the RTI process is to apply accountability to educational program by focusing on programs that work rather than programs that simply look, sound, or feel good.

RTI follows a number of core assumptions:&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt; 
#The educational system can effectively teach all children
#Early intervention is critical to preventing problems from getting out of control
#The implementation of a multi-tiered service delivery model is necessary
#A problem solving model should be used to make decisions between tiers
#Research based interventions should be implemented to the extent possible
#Progress monitoring must be implemented to inform instruction
#Data should drive decision making

A learning disability is defined as a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive, process, store, and respond to information. They are a group of disorders that can impact many areas of learning, including reading, writing, spelling, math, listening, and oral expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-aamp-language|title=Language &amp; Math|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626065701/http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-aamp-language|archivedate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of identifying learning disabilities, RTI differs from the formerly standard "ability–achievement discrepancy" approach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/evaluations/evaluation-basics/the-discrepancy-model-what-you-need-to-know|title=The Discrepancy Model: What You Need to Know|work=Understood.org|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that decisions are based on outcomes of targeted interventions rather than mathematical discrepancies between scores achieved on standardized assessments.

In the RTI process, service delivery is typically divided into three levels (tiers) of support, with the intensity of interventions increasing with each level.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gresham, F.M.|year=2004|title=Current status and future directions of school-based behavioral interventions|journal=School Psychology Review|volume=33|issue=3|pages=326–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Tier 1''' is focused specifically within the core curriculum, with instruction and interventions targeting all students. Approximately 80% to 85% of the general student body should be able to meet grade level norms without additional assistance beyond the first tier. Students who consistently do not perform within the expected level of performance through Tier 1 instruction are then provided with additional supplementary interventions at '''Tier 2''', which typically involves small group instruction. Approximately 3% to 6% of students will continue to have difficulties after Tier 2 interventions; these students will then receive '''Tier 3''' intervention services, which is the most intense level of intervention (often one-on-one) provided in the regular education environment. As RTI is a regular education initiative, all three tiers of services are intended to be provided as supplements to, not replacements for, the regular education curriculum; there are some, however, who view Tier 3 as [[special education]].&lt;ref name="Special Education 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale (2006) first presented a model that included Standard Protocol Model RTI at Tier 1, Problem-Solving Model RTI at Tier 2, and individualized special education at tier 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===School-wide screening===
The first level of data collected in the RTI process comes from universal school-wide screenings. These screening assessments are typically given to all students within targeted grade levels, and cover basic academic subjects such as reading and mathematics. Most screening measures aim to be practical and efficient to administer, with the goal of identifying students who may require further assessments and interventions.

To evaluate student performance on the screening measures, scores are compared to specific criteria (''criterion referenced'') or to broad norms (''norm referenced''). When specific criteria are used, ''cut scores'' are established to evaluate students against a specific level of proficiency (e.g., achieving a score of 15 or above); in a normative comparison, students' scores are compared against those of a larger group (e.g., scoring above the 25th percentile compared to a national sample of 3rd grade students).

Screenings usually occur three times per year (fall, winter, and spring), and the data from these assessments help to guide instruction through the three tiers of the RTI process. This is important not only for identifying students who are having difficulties, but also for identifying possible areas of improvement in the general classroom instruction in the cases where too many students fall below expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Jenkins, J.R. |date=December 2003|title=Candidate measures for screening at-risk students|conference=NRCLD Responsiveness-to-Intervention Symposium|location=Kansas City, MO|accessdate=April 3, 2006|url=http://www.nrcld.org/symposium2003/jenkins/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because a single universal screening at the beginning of the year can over-identify students who require preventative intervention, the National Research Center on Learning Disabilities recommends that schools also integrate at least five weeks of weekly progress monitoring to identify students who require preventative intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/resources_new/9749|title=National Research Center on Learning Disabilities {{!}} LD OnLine|website=www.ldonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Teaching ===
Core curriculum in the classroom should be research-based and field tested. This means, based on evidence from congregating research, that the core curriculum contains all the fundamentals found necessary to efficiently teach reading and has a recognized record of achievement. Such curriculum is to be delivered by "highly qualified" teachers adequately trained to deliver the selected instruction as intended, that is, with fidelity to design.

===Progress monitoring and tiered service delivery===
Progress monitoring is a set of assessment procedures for determining the extent to which students are benefiting from classroom instruction and for monitoring effectiveness of curriculum.

[[Curriculum-based measurement]] (CBM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deno, S. L.|year=1985|title=Curriculum-based measurement: The emerging alternative|journal=Exceptional Children|volume=52|issue=3|pages=219–232|pmid=2934262}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often used to collect [[data]] on interventions and their effectiveness to determine what works best for an individual student. Additional methods are attempted until students "respond" to the intervention and improve their skills. Students that do not respond, or respond at significantly low rates, may be deemed to have biologically based learning disabilities, rather than simply learning difficulties.

Progress monitoring is the scientifically based practice of assessing students' academic performance on a regular basis for three purposes: 
#To determine whether children are profiting appropriately from the instructional program, including the curriculum
#To build more effective programs for the children who do not benefit
#To estimate rates of student improvement

Three tiers of Scientifically Research-Based Interventions (SRBIs) of increasing intensity incorporate the key components of RTI and help ensure the academic growth and achievement of students.

====Tier 1====
The first tier states that all students receive core classroom instruction that is [[differentiated instruction|differentiated]] and utilizes strategies and materials that are scientifically research-based. Assessment in the classroom should be ongoing and effective in that it clearly identifies the strengths and weaknesses for each learner. Any necessary interventions at this level are within the framework of the general education classroom and can be in the form of differentiated instruction, small group review, or one-on-one remediation of a concept.

Progress monitoring in Tier 1 uses universal screening assessments to show individual student growth over time and to determine whether students are progressing as expected. In this process, data are collected, students are identified using benchmark scores, and measurable goals are set for the next data collection point for those who display difficulties. The team then follows a problem-solving process to determine interventions for at-risk students that will work within whole-class instructions. The classroom teacher implements the interventions, observations are conducted to ensure the fidelity of the classroom instruction, and the problem-solving team periodically reviews the progress of students.

====Tier 2====
In the second tier, supplemental interventions may occur within or outside of the general education classroom, and progress monitoring occurs at more frequent intervals. Core instruction is still delivered by the classroom teacher, but small groups of similar instructional levels may work together under a teacher's instruction and/or guidance. This type of targeted instruction is typically for 30 minutes per day, two to four days per week, for a minimum of nine weeks. This targeted instruction may occur in the general education setting or outside in a smaller group setting with a specialized teacher (such as a Literacy Support teacher for struggling readers).

In Tier 2, the main purpose of progress monitoring is to determine whether interventions are successful in helping students learn at an appropriate rate. Decision rules are created to determine when a student might no longer require extra interventions, when the interventions need to be changed, or when a student might be identified for special education.

Oral language abilities at the onset of reading intervention programs are an excellent predictor of final outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lovett 2008 333–352"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=M. W.|last2=De Palma |first2=M. |last3=Frijters |first3=J. |last4=Steinbach |first4=K. |last5=Temple |first5=M. |last6=Benson |first6=N. |last7=Lacerenza |first7=L.|title=Interventions for reading difficulties: A comparison of response to intervention by ELL and EFL struggling readers.|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|year=2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=333–352|doi=10.1177/0022219408317859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both English as a first language and English-language learners demonstrate that the greater the oral language impairment, the greater the associated growth from RTI.&lt;ref name="Lovett 2008 333–352"/&gt; Phonics-based RTI programs are most effective prior to grade 1, however, after grade 1 comprehension and mixed RTI programs are associated with greater effect sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suggate|first=S. P.|title=Why what we teach depends on when: Grade and reading intervention modality moderate effect size.|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2010|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1556–1579|doi=10.1037/a0020612|pmid=20873927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tier 3====
Tier three is for students who require more intense, explicit and individualized instruction and have not shown sufficient response to Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions. This type of targeted instruction is delivered for a minimum of two 30-minute sessions every week for nine to twelve weeks. The interventions in this tier may be similar to those in Tier 2 except that they are intensified in focus, frequency, and duration. The instruction in Tier 3 is typically delivered outside of the general education classroom. Programs, strategies, and procedures are designed and employed to supplement, enhance, and support Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruction by remediation of the relevant area and development of compensatory strategies. If Tier 3 is not successful, a child is considered for the first time as potentially having a learning disability.

In some cases, Tier 3 is considered to be [[special education]], with instruction being provided to individual students or small groups by special education teachers ''in place of'' general education instruction (rather than as a supplement). Initial goals are established through an [[individualized education program]] (IEP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/iep-overview/|title=The Short-and-Sweet IEP Overview {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=www.parentcenterhub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is guided by the results of a comprehensive evaluation, and ongoing progress monitoring helps to direct the teaching process. Special education instruction likely will be considerably longer than the 10 to 12 weeks of supplemental instruction delivered in Tier 2 and beyond. The frequency of special education instruction depends upon student need, and the criteria to exit special education are specified and monitored so that placement can be flexible.

===RTI implementation===
The number of schools implementing RTI continues to grow and 61% of schools surveyed in 2010 indicated that they had fully implemented or were in the process of implementing RTI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council of Administrators of Special Education|last2=National Association of State Directors of Special Education|last3=American Association of School Administrators|title=Response to Intervention Adoption Survey|date=2010|publisher=Spectrum K-12 School Solutions|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most schools in the survey indicated that the continued to focus on reading interventions at the elementary school. RTI is primarily implemented by grade-level teams or professional learning communities as part of a school-wide problem-solving plan, and previous research found that implementing RTI resulted in several positive outcomes such as reductions in students referred to and placed into special education, more students passing state accountability tests, and increased academic skills among students at-risk for reading failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Matthew|last2=Appleton|first2=James|last3=Stehouwer|first3=Jonathon|title=Meta-analysis of response-to-intervention research: Examining field-based and research-implemented models.|journal=Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment|date=2005|volume=23|pages=381–394|doi=10.1177/073428290502300406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fidelity of implementation===
In an RTI model, fidelity is important at both the school level (e.g., implementation of the process) and the teacher level (e.g., implementation of instruction). Although the concept of fidelity of implementation is supported by research and is generally viewed as common sense, there are practical challenges associated with achieving high levels of fidelity.
Factors that can reduce fidelity when implementing instruction include:&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, E., Mellard, D.F., Fuchs, D., &amp; McKnight, M.A. (2006). Responsiveness to intervention (RTI): How to do it. Lawrence, KS: National Research Center on Learning Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Complexity of the interventions and the time required to implement them
*Inaccessibility of required materials and resources
*Low perceptions/expectations of effectiveness (teachers may not fully commit to an intervention if they believe that it will not be effective, or if it is inconsistent with their teaching style)
*Low numbers, expertise, and motivation of those who deliver the interventions
Factors that can increase fidelity when implementing an RTI model include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Matthew|last2=Gibbons|first2=Kimberly|title=Implementing response to intervention in elementary and secondary schools: Procedures to assure scientific-based practices|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Well-functioning professional learning communities
*Using a universal screener that is brief, aligned with the curriculum, result in reliable data, and is validated for screening decisions
*Using a data-management system that is easily accessible by classroom teachers
*Implementing interventions that address the skill deficit of students
*Identifying and addressing class-wide needs
*Establishing well-defined decision rules
*Clear leadership from the building principal
*Ongoing training and professional development
*Key stakeholders working together in a flexible manner to improve student learning
*Use of standard-protocol interventions for tier 2
*Not making entitlement (i.e., special education disability identification) decisions until the RTI system is in place and well established.

==Classification of RTI==
RTI is a general education process that is used in schools to ensure students receive the supports they need to be successful and excel in school.  In the educational literature, RTI is often referred to as a ''Standard Protocol Approach'',  as a ''Problem Solving Model.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fuchs, D., Mock, D., Morgan, P. L., &amp; Young, C. L.|year=2003|title=Responsiveness-to-Intervention: Definitions, evidence, and implications for the learning disabilities construct|journal=Learning Disabilities Research and Practice|volume=18|issue=3|pages=157–171|url=http://danlane.wiki.westga.edu/file/view/Fuchs+(Responsiveness+to+intervention...).pdf|doi=10.1111/1540-5826.00072}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a hybrid of the two. However, some have challenged a dichotomous view of RTI because both models incorporate problem solving to identify the academic or social-emotional difficulty the student is having and both use a systematic, universal screening procedure during Tier 1 to determine which students are having difficulties meeting age or grade level benchmarks for a specific skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christ|first1=Theodore|last2=Burns|first2=Matthew|last3=Ysseldyke|first3=James|title=Conceptual confusion within response-to-intervention vernacular: Clarifying meaningful differences.|journal=NASP Communique|date=2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=1, 6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, [[Curriculum Based Measurement]] (CBM) or other predictive data are used to flag the students who are not meeting expected levels of performance. In the problem-solving model approach, the teacher typically refers the student to a problem-solving team to ascertain the challenges a student is having within the classroom. Using information collected from the classroom teacher and others, observations, etc., the team determines what additional supports the student might need to address the learning gap. Standard-protocol approaches tend to rely more on grade-level teams and professional learning communities to make intervention decisions, but both approaches use a problem-solving procedure to make decisions, which makes the distinction somewhat meaningless. Many schools rely on grade-level teams to make intervention decision and use a standardized intervention for tier 2, but then rely on a problem-solving team to develop individualized interventions for tier 3.

When a student is identified as having difficulties in school, a team provides interventions of increasing intensity to help the child catch up with the rest of his or her peers. When students continue to struggle, even when appropriate evidence-based practices have been delivered with fidelity, students may be referred for a special education evaluation.  Parents can request a special education evaluation at any time in this process, however.   While the RTI process can be a way to ensure that each student is afforded the opportunity to learn, some opponents feel that it allows school districts to avoid or delay identifying students who need special education services. Proponents would point out that RTI is not the process of identifying students with a learning disability by starting tiered interventions when a disability is suspected, but is the process of examining data that already exist from implementing a tiered intervention model, which should expedite the identification process. The expected outcome of RTI is improved instruction that will result in improved outcomes for all students&lt;ref name="Mary Wagner &amp; Phyllis Levine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro, E., Zigmond, N., Wallace, T., &amp; Marston, D.|title=Models for Implementing Response to Intervention|date=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60918-124-6|pages=377–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support for RTI ==
There are at least four main reasons for implementing RTI: 1) to increase achievement for all students; 2) to reduce racial/ethnic disproportionate representation of minority students in special education; 3) to increase collaboration and integration of general and special education; 4) and to identify students with learning disabilities through a different lens than the IQ-achievement discrepancy model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawyer, Holland, &amp; Detgen|first1=R., D., &amp; A.|title=State policies and procedures and selected local implementation practices in response to intervention in the six southeast region states|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/southeast/pdf/REL_2008063.pdf|website=National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, regional educational laboratory southeast|accessdate=Feb 6, 2015|ref=REL 2008-063}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTI proponents claim that when interventions work, fewer children, particularly minority children, are referred for special education, and that the RTI model acts as a safeguard, ensuring that a child is not given a label of a disability inappropriately. In addition, proponents state that RTI  helps school districts by eliminating unnecessary referrals, which drain time and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=AE Farstrup |year=2007|title=RTI: A vital concern for reading professionals|journal=Reading Today|volume=25|issue=3|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics express concern, however, that in attempting to eliminate unnecessary referrals, RTI may also delay or eliminate necessary referrals.

Proponents feel that response to intervention is the best opportunity for giving all students the additional time and support needed to learn at high levels,&lt;ref&gt;Buffum,A., Mattos, M., &amp; Weber,C. (2010). "The why try behind RTI: Response to Intervention flourishes when educators implement the right practices for the right reasons." Educational Leadership, Oct. 2010, 10–16&lt;/ref&gt; and see great benefit in that it applies to the classroom teachers, paraeducators, counselors, and the administration. The RTI process can help identify students who are at-risk, guide adjustments to instruction, monitor student progress, and then make other recommendations as necessary. The objective is that with minor adjustments or simple interventions, students may respond and achieve at higher levels.

RTI is also very useful when working with students who have severe emotional problems.  The structure and evaluation of RTI will help this particular group of students to be successful in the academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pearce, I.

Reading difficulties is one of the most common reasons students need intervention support.  Reading goals can develop reading self-concept, which influence reading fluency skills and promotes the importance of goal setting in reading intervention programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quirk|first=M.|author2=Schwaneflugel, P. J. |author3=Webb, M. Y. |title=A short-term longitudinal study of the relationship between motivation to read and reading fluency skill in second grade.|journal=Journal of Literacy Research|year=2009|volume=41|pages=196–227|doi=10.1080/10862960902908467|pmc=2838245}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that students monitor these goals and celebrate their progress. Students involved in multiple-component reading intervention programs show significant improvement, and students in different socioeconomic, racial, and intellectual quotient groups make equivalent gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=R.

== Relationship between IDEA and RTI ==
The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was revised and signed into law in 2004 and became effective in July 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/idea/|title=IDEA—the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=www.parentcenterhub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the law, a specific learning disability is a disorder of one or more of the basic psychological processes that adversely affects academic achievement in one or more domains (e.g., reading, writing, math, language). There are three methods of SLD identification under IDEA, as defined in §300.8(c)(10) (OSERS Final Regulations-8/06):
#a discrepancy between "ability" and "achievement"
#failure to respond to scientific research-based  intervention
#alternative research-based procedures for determining whether a child has a specific learning disability
(The "third method" is often considered a "processing strengths and weaknesses" model.)

The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA makes mention of RTI as a method of part of the process of identifying SLD: 
#In diagnosing learning disabilities, schools are no longer required to use the discrepancy model. The act states that, "a local educational agency shall not be required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability[...]"
#Response to intervention is specifically mentioned in the regulations in conjunction with the identification of a specific learning disability. IDEA 2004 states, "a local educational agency may use a process that determines if the child responds to scientific, research-based intervention as a part of the evaluation procedures."
#Early Intervening Services (EIS) are prominently mentioned in IDEA for the first time. These services are directed at interventions for students prior to referral in an attempt to avoid inappropriate classification, which proponents claim an RTI model does. IDEA now authorizes the use of up to 15% of IDEA allocated funds for EIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/,root,dynamic,QaCorner,8,|work=ed.gov|title=Q&amp;A on Response to Intervention and Early Intervening Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTI was included in the regulations due to considerable concerns raised by both the House and Senate Committees regarding proponents of RTI claims about the use of IQ tests to identify learning disabled students. There was also recognition in these committees of a growing body of scientific research supporting methods of pre-referral interventions that resolved learning difficulties short of classification. However, the final regulations also allow a third method of SLD identification, often considered a processing strengths and weaknesses model.

The IDEA Committee Conference Report (CCR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to Intervention in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)|year=2004|url=http://www.reading.org/downloads/resources/IDEA_RTI_report.pdf|access-date=2009-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324040342/http://www.reading.org/downloads/resources/IDEA_RTI_report.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the use of scientifically based early intervention programs, describes a model response-to-intervention program, and recommends the development of the most effective implementation of responsiveness to intervention models. The report describes such a model as an essential service for reducing the need to label children as disabled.

===Evaluating SLD using RTI===

First, it should be noted that whatever procedures are used to evaluate students as eligible for special education in the category of specific learning disabilities (SLD) must conform to the requirements of the IDEA regulations (2006), which indicate that a full and individual evaluation of a student suspected as having an SLD must address four qualifications. First, the evaluation must document that "...the child does not achieve adequately for the child's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the following areas, when provided with learning experiences and instruction appropriate for the child's age or state-approved grade-level standards: oral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, basic reading skill, reading fluency skills, reading comprehension, mathematics calculation, mathematics problem-solving" (§300.309[a][1]). Second, the evaluation must document that "...(t)he child does not make sufficient progress to meet age or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas identified ...when using a process based on the child's response to scientific, research-based intervention; or (t)he child exhibits a pattern of strengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age, State-approved grade-level standards, or intellectual development, that is determined by the group to be relevant to the identification of a specific learning disability, using appropriate assessments (§300.309[a][2). Third, the evaluation must establish that the child's academic deficiencies are not the results of "...visual, hearing, or motor disabilities; mental retardation; emotional disturbance; cultural factors; environmental or economic disadvantage; or Limited English proficiency" (§300.309[a][3]) or of a lack of instruction ((§300.309[a][4]). Notably, a child must demonstrate qualifications under all four of these criteria to be identified with an SLD.

Kovaleski, VanDerHeyden and Shapiro (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kovaleski, J.F.|author2=VanDerHeyden, A.M.|author3=Shapiro, E.S.|title=The RTI approach to evaluating learning disabilities|date=2013|publisher=Guilford|isbn=978-1-4625-1154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; used these IDEA regulations to operationalize how evaluation teams could utilize data collected during the provision of a multi-tier system of support in the evaluation process, particularly those data that inform the second SLD criterion of the child's failure to make sufficient progress in response scientific, research-based intervention (namely, RTI). Although evaluation teams may collect additional data after parents give permission for a full and individual evaluation, there should be ample data collected during three tiers of core instruction and robust intervention that can be analyzed to address all four of the SLD criteria.

In regard to the first SLD criterion, students undergoing multiple tiers of support have typically undergone multiple assessments of their academic skills, including annual state tests, universal screenings of all students that schools typically conduct three times per year, and academic assessments by specialists who deliver increasingly intense academic interventions. To qualify under this first criterion, the preponderance of these data should indicate a significant academic deficiency in at least one of the identified areas.

When using RTI as a component of eligibility decision-making, the school entity (school district, state) establishes a policy that identifies the option of using RTI to address the second SLD criterion (and opts not to select the option to use an assessment of the student's pattern of strengths and weaknesses).  The determination that the student fails to make sufficient progress toward age or grade standards is based on an analysis of the progress-monitoring data that are collected during the provision of intensive intervention, typically at tiers 2 and 3 of a multi-tier system of support. These data consist of the results of short assessments of key academic indicators that are administered as often as once or twice weekly. These data are graphed and rates of improvement calculated so that school teams can determine whether their interventions are working. These data are then compared to the rates of improvement made by typically performing students to determine whether the interventions that are being implemented in general education are sufficient to allow the student to reach grade standards. If not, a need for special education is indicated, and the student meets the second qualification for SLD.

The process for ruling out other disabilities or conditions when using RTI is similar to that employed in other special education evaluations, and consists of procedures to ensure that sensory or intellectual disabilities or environmental disadvantage or cultural/linguistic differences are not the true cause of the student's assessed academic deficiencies. Establishing that the student's deficiencies are not the result of a lack of instruction, however, requires that the evaluation team document that the school has sufficiently provided good core instruction in the basic skills and robust interventions when students have failed to profit from typical instructional practices. The evaluation team must also show evidence that the school personnel conducted repeated assessments of the student's academic problems and communicated the results of those assessments to the student's parents. Schools that use a multi-tier system of support at a high degree of fidelity can typically readily rule out lack of instruction as a cause of the student's academic concerns. On the other hand, in enacting this provision, Congress was demonstrating a concern that students might be identified with a disability (SLD) when the actual cause of their academic failure was ineffective schooling. Identifying students with SLD in failing schools is arguably problematic.

==Response to RTI==
Criticisms point to delays in identifying students needing special education (which was also a concern in a 2010 OSERS Memorandum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.esc13.net/thescoop/special/files/2011/01/RTI-Memo-1-21-111.pdf|title=2010 OSERS Memorandum|access-date=2011-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503092705/http://www5.esc13.net/thescoop/special/files/2011/01/RTI-Memo-1-21-111.pdf|archive-date=2012-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), difficulties in accurately determining the presence of a learning disability,&lt;ref name="Hale et al 2010" /&gt; and the amount of training needed by general education teachers. RTI can require additional work for teachers, and a potentially significant change in expectations represents a great source of resistance toward RTI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richards, C.|displayauthors=etal|title=Response to Intervention: Building the Capacity of Teachers To Serve Students with Learning Difficulties|journal=Teacher Education|volume=16|issue=2|date=Fall 2007|pages=55–64|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ796252.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of RTI is that while its core assumptions include "that the educational system can effectively teach all children," interpretations of the approach often do not account for gifted education. An inverted pyramid showing analogous increasing interventions for gifted children could be added to the model so that all children are addressed. A framework for such an approach has been developed by the Montana Office of Public Instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opi.mt.gov/PDF/Gifted/RtI_GTFramework.pdf|title=Response to Intervention (RtI) and Gifted and Talented Education (GT)|date=Fall 2009|publisher=Montana Office of Public Instruction|access-date=2010-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304091817/http://www.opi.mt.gov/PDF/Gifted/RtI_GTFramework.pdf|archive-date=2010-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns and criticisms of RTI for SLD classification==
Criticisms of the RTI model first surfaced in 2004 when IDEA identified it as a viable method for use in SLD eligibility determination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hale, J.B., Naglieri, J.A., Kaufman, A.S., &amp; Kavale, K.A.|year=2004|title=Specific learning disability classification in the new Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: The danger of good ideas|journal=The School Psychologist|volume=58|issue=1|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feel that RTI is valuable for prevention, but see little empirical support for using RTI to determine learning disabilities, and have concern that it could be used to delay or deny services to children with learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reynolds, C. R., &amp; Shaywitz, S. E.|year=2009|title=Response to intervention: Remediation, perhaps, diagnosis, no|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=3|pages=44–47|issue=1|pmid=20161671|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2008.00075.x|pmc=2819473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that there are many unanswered questions about RTI implementation, and that proponents have tended to gloss over or ignore criticisms of the RTI approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fuchs, D., &amp; Deshler, D. D.|year=2007|title=What we need to know about responsiveness to intervention (and shouldn't be afraid to ask)|journal=Learning Disabilities Research &amp; Practice|volume=22|pages=129–136|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5826.2007.00237.x|url=http://danlane.wiki.westga.edu/file/view/Fuchs+(What+we+need+to+know+about...).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major research efforts have supported these contentions through findings suggesting that RTI does not produce reliable sets of responders and non-responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Barth, A.

==Technology application to RTI==
Technology is becoming increasingly important in improving instructional practices and student achievement. Tools that educators can utilize within their classrooms include [[weblog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[RSS]] [[News aggregator|aggregators]], [[social bookmarking]], online photo galleries, [[webcasting|audio/visual casting]], [[Twitter]], and [[social networking]] sites.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Will|title=Blogs, wikis, podcasts, and other powerful web tools for classrooms|year=2010|publisher=Corwin|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these tools can be used for team-based learning and in facilitating students' use of higher forms of thinking such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2009" /&gt;

Properly integrated technology can increase student learning in areas such as motivation, collaborative learning, critical thinking, and problem solving.&lt;ref name="Schacter 1999" /&gt; Some techniques that have been found to work in education include: identifying similarities and differences; summarizing and note taking; reinforcing effort and providing recognition; assigning homework and practice; utilizing graphic representations of concepts; cooperative learning; providing objectives and feedback; generating and testing hypotheses; providing cues and questions; and using advanced organizers.&lt;ref name="Marzano 1998" /&gt; Technology-rich environments can also be effective for at-risk students, and can motivate students to stay in school and hopefully lessen the achievement gap.&lt;ref name="Collins 2009" /&gt;

Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/computer-assisted-instruction-and-reading|title=Computer-Assisted Instruction and Reading|date=2013-04-24|work=Reading Rockets|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has been studied for its effects on lower achieving students. The effectiveness has been attributed to it being non-judgmental and motivational, while giving immediate and frequent feedback, individualizing learning to meet the students' needs, allowing for more student autonomy, and providing multi-sensory components (Barley ''et al.'', 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;97).&lt;ref name="Barley 2002" /&gt; A review of 17 different studies found that CAI positively affected scores in mathematics and literacy for all grade levels and significantly improving scores for students labeled "at-risk" (Barley ''et al.'', 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;105).&lt;ref name="Barley 2002" /&gt;

Technology can also effectively help teach basic literacy skills such as phonemic awareness, alphabetic principle, word recognition, alliteration, and comprehension. Today the use of specialized educational software applications can help support and enhance students' literacy skills. Presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] can be used to enhance young children learning experience. The use of pictures, colors, sounds, animation, slide designs, or slide transitions can be easily implemented into a literacy lesson, and such software has been used, for example, to help students with autism learn and respond to activity schedules.&lt;ref name="Grabe 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabe|title=Using Animation in Microsoft PowerPoint to Enhance Engagement and Learning in Young Learners with Developmental Delay|year=2007|journal=[[Teaching Exceptional Children]]|pages=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For young learners, the use of animation directs their attention to important features and prompts them to help ensure correct responses. Teachers can create literacy lessons with attention-grabbing elements such as moving graphic images. For example, a teacher might focus on the initial /d/ sound in the word "dog" as an instructional goal; a presentation slide for this would show a picture of a dog, and the teacher would select three possible letters to represent the initial sound in dog, such as /b/, /c/, and /d/. After showing the picture of the dog, and then displaying each of the three letter choices one-by-one, the teacher would ask the student what letter he or she thinks "dog" starts with.&lt;ref name="Parette 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Article|last=Parette|first=H|author2=Blum, C. |author3=Hourcade, J.J |date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of presentation software for literacy instruction, such as [[Photo Story]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://download.cnet.com/Photo-Story-3-for-Windows/3000-12511_4-10339154.html|title=Photo Story 3 for Windows|website=Download.com|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, can allow teachers to add a variety of special effects, soundtracks, captions, and their own voice narration to the photo stories.

'''Retiming''' is the technique of moving the structural location of [[Latch (electronic)|latches]] or registers in a [[digital circuit]] to improve its performance, area, and/or [[power optimization (EDA)|power]] characteristics in such a way that preserves its functional behavior at its outputs.  Retiming was first described by [[Charles E. Leiserson]] and [[James B. Saxe]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/96547/0&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique uses a [[directed graph]] where the vertices represent asynchronous combinational blocks and the directed edges represent a series of registers or latches (the number of registers or latches can be zero). Each vertex has a value corresponding to the delay through the combinational circuit it represents. After doing this, one can attempt to optimize the circuit by pushing registers from output to input and vice versa - much like [[bubble pushing]].  Two operations can be used - deleting a register from each input of a vertex while adding a register to all outputs, and conversely adding a register to each input of vertex and deleting a register from all outputs. In all cases, if the rules are followed, the circuit will have the same functional behavior as it did before retiming.

==Formal description==

The initial formulation of the retiming problem as described by Leiserson and Saxe is as follows. Given a [[directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;G:=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; whose vertices represent [[logic gates]] or combinational delay elements in a circuit, assume there is a directed edge &lt;math&gt;e:=(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; between two elements that are connected directly or through one or more registers.  Let the ''weight'' of each edge &lt;math&gt;w(e)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of registers present along edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; in the initial circuit.  Let &lt;math&gt;d(v)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[propagation delay]] through vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  The goal in retiming is to compute an integer ''lag'' value &lt;math&gt;r(v)&lt;/math&gt; for each vertex such that the retimed weight &lt;math&gt;w_r(e):=w(e)+r(v)-r(u)&lt;/math&gt; of every edge is non-negative. There is a proof that this preserves the output functionality.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;C. E. Leiserson, J. B. Saxe, "Retiming Synchronous Circuitry," Algorithmica, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 5-35, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimizing the clock period with network flow===

The most common use of retiming is to minimize the [[clock period]].  A simple technique to optimize the clock period is to search for the minimum feasible period (e.g. using [[binary search]]).

The feasibility of a clock period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be checked in one of several ways.  The [[linear program]] below is feasible if and only if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a feasible clock period.  Let &lt;math&gt;W(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; be the minimum number of registers along any path from &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (if such a path exists), and &lt;math&gt;D(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum delay along any path from &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with W(u,v) registers.  The dual of this program is a [[minimum cost circulation problem]], which can be solved efficiently as a network problem.  The limitations of this approach arise from the enumeration and size of the &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; matrices.

{| 
| Given 
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;w(e), W(u,v), D(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and a target clock period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Find 
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;r(v):V \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Such that
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;r(u) - r(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le w(e)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;r(u) - r(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le W(u,v) - 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;D(u,v) &gt; T&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Minimizing the clock period with MILP===

Alternatively, feasibility of a clock period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a mixed-integer [[linear program]] (MILP).  A solution will exist and a valid lag function &lt;math&gt;r(v)&lt;/math&gt; will be returned if and only if the period is feasible.

{| 
| Given 
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;w(e), d(v)&lt;/math&gt; and a target clock period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Find 
| colspan="2" | &lt;math&gt;r(v):V \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R(v):V \to \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Such that
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;r(v) - R(V)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le -d(v)/T&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;R(v) - r(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;r(u) - r(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le w(e)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;R(u) - R(v)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\le w(e) - d(v)/T&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Other formulations and extensions===

Alternate formulations allow the minimization of the register count and the minimization of the register count under a delay constraint.  The initial paper includes extensions that allow the consideration of fan-out sharing and a more general delay model.  Subsequent work has addressed the inclusion of register delays,&lt;ref name="two"&gt;K. N. Lalgudi, M. C. Papaefthymiou, {{doi-inline|10.1109/43.664222|Retiming edge-triggered circuits under general delay models}}, [[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems]], vol.16, no.12, pp.1393-1408, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; load-dependent delay models,&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; and hold constraints.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;M. C. Papaefthymiou, {{doi-inline|10.1145/288548.289060|Asymptotically efficient retiming under setup and hold constraints}}, IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==

Retiming has found industrial use, albeit sporadic.  Its primary drawback is that the state encoding of the circuit is destroyed, making debugging, testing, and verification substantially more difficult.  Some retimings may also require complicated initialization logic to have the circuit start in an identical initial state.  Finally, the changes in the circuit's topology have consequences in other logical and physical synthesis steps that make [[design closure]] difficult.

==Alternatives==

Clock skew scheduling is a related technique for optimizing sequential circuits.  Whereas retiming relocates the structural position of the registers, clock skew scheduling moves their temporal position by scheduling the arrival time of the clock signals.  The lower bound of the achievable minimum clock period of both techniques is the maximum mean cycle time (i.e. the total combinational delay along any path divided by the number of registers along it).

The '''Royal Pioneer Corps''' was a [[British Army]] combatant corps used for light engineering tasks. It was formed in 1939 and amalgamated into the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] in 1993. Pioneer units performed a wide variety of tasks in all theatres of war, including stretcher-bearing, handling all types of stores, laying prefabricated track on beaches, and effecting various logistical operations. Under [[Royal Engineers]] supervision, they constructed airfields and roads and erected bridges; they constructed the [[Mulberry Harbour]] and laid the [[Operation Pluto|Pipe Line Under the Ocean]] (PLUTO).

==History==
The first record of [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]s in a British army goes back to 1346 at [[Pale of Calais|Calais]] where the pay and muster rolls of the English Garrison show pay records for pioneers.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main1.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=1|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, there was a designated pioneer for each [[Company (military unit)|company]] in a [[regiment]], when, about 1750, it was proposed that a Corps of Pioneers be formed. Nothing came of this for nearly one hundred years, until the '''Army Works Corps''' was established during the [[Crimean War]] in 1854.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The '''Labour Corps''' was formed in 1917 during [[World War I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|title=The Labour Corps of 1917-1918|url=http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-labour-corps-of-1917-1918/|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employed 325,000 British troops, 98,000 Chinese, 10,000 Africans and at least 300,000 other labourers.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In September 1939, a number of infantry and cavalry reservists were formed into Works Labour Companies, which were soon made the '''Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps''' (AMPC); a Labour Directorate was created to control all labour force matters. A large number of Pioneers served in France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (WWII)|British Expeditionary Force]]. During the [[Battle of France]], an infantry [[brigade]] was improvised from several AMPC Companies under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel J. B. H. Diggle. Known as "Digforce", the brigade became part of [[Beauman Division]] and fought in defence of the [[Andelle]] and [[Béthune (river)|Béthune]] rivers on 8 June 1940 against the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th]] and [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]]s. Digforce brigade and thousands of other BEF Pioneers were evacuated to England in [[Operation Ariel]].&lt;ref&gt;*Ellis, L. F.

London p.280-282&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown number of AMPC troops were killed when the [[HMT Lancastria|HMT ''Lancastria'']] was sunk off [[St Nazaire]] on 17 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_lancastria.htm|title=The Pioneer: The Lancastria Story|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 1940, the name AMPC was changed to '''Pioneer Corps'''.&lt;ref name=history2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main2.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=2|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1941, [[James Scully (GC)|James Scully]] became the only member of the Pioneer Corps to be awarded the [[George Cross]]. Corps members have won some 13 [[George Medal]]s and many other lesser awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_awards.htm|title=The Pioneer: Honours and awards|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 23 pioneer companies took part in the [[Normandy landings]].&lt;ref name=history3&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalpioneercorps.co.uk/rpc/history_main3.htm|title=The Pioneer: History|page=3|publisher=Royal Pioneer Corps Association|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Alexander Baron]] served in one of these Beach Groups and later included some of his experiences in his novels ''From the City From the Plough'' and ''The Human Kind''. He also wrote a radio play about the experience of being stranded on a craft attempting to land supplies on the beaches of [[Normandy]]. Nos. 85 and 149 Companies, Pioneer Corps served with the [[6th Beach Group]] assisting the units landing on [[Sword Beach]] on D Day, 6 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/invisible-ink-no-83--alexander-baron-2302756.html|title=Invisible Ink: No 83 - Alexander Baron|publisher=The Independent|date=26 June 2011|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 1946, in recognition of their performance during the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[King George VI]] decreed that the Pioneer Corps should have the distinction "Royal" added to its title.&lt;ref name=history3/&gt;

In April 1993, following the [[Options for Change]] review, the Royal Pioneer Corps was joined with the [[Royal Corps of Transport]], the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], the [[Army Catering Corps]], and the Postal and Courier Service of the [[Royal Engineers]] to form the [[Royal Logistic Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Royal Logistic Corps and Forming Corps|url=http://www.rlcmuseum.co.uk/docs/history.html|publisher=[[The Royal Logistic Corps Museum]]|accessdate=13 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814155505/http://rlcmuseum.co.uk/docs/history.html|archivedate=14 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
In the early part of World War II, the Pioneer Corps was apparently the only British military unit in which [[enemy alien]]s could serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1941/jul/22/aliens-in-the-pioneer-corps|title=House of Lords Questions - Aliens in the Pioneer Corps|website=Hansard|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=22 July 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of German and Austrian nationals joined the Pioneer Corps to assist Allied war efforts and the liberation of their home countries. They typically were Jews and political opponents of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Regime]] who had fled to Britain, including film production designer [[Ken Adam]], writer [[George Clare (writer)|George Clare]], and publisher [[Robert Maxwell]].

Later, some members of Pioneer Corps—often dubbed "The King's Most Loyal Enemy Aliens"—transferred to serve in various fighting units. Some were recruited by the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) to serve as secret agents and were parachuted behind enemy lines.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Colin MacGregor Stevens with Major George Bryant (aka George Breuer)&lt;/ref&gt;

Serving as a German or Austrian national in the British forces was especially dangerous because, in case of being taken captive, there was a high probability of being executed as a traitor by the Germans. Still, the number of German-born Jews joining the British forces was exceptionally high; by the end of the war, one in seven Jewish refugees from Germany had joined the British forces. Their knowledge of the German language and customs proved particularly useful; many served in the administration of the British occupation army in Germany and Austria after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natgeotv.com/ca/churchills-german-army National Geographic documentary ''Churchill's German Army'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It has wrongly been claimed at various times and in various places that British [[conscientious objector]]s were sometimes ordered into the Pioneer Corps by Conscientious Objection Tribunals in the [[Second World War]]; the error may have arisen from a misunderstanding of a misleadingly drafted question in the House of Lords on 22 July 1941 and a reply by Lord Croft, Joint Under-Secretary of State for War, that was not expressed with the clarity that might have been expected. The War Office was asked about "British conscientious objectors who have been ordered by the Tribunals to undertake service with the Pioneer Corps", whereas the Tribunals had no power to make such an order; the only power they had relating to conscientious objectors in the armed forces was to order non-combatant military service, meaning call-up in most cases to the [[Non-Combatant Corps]], or occasionally to the Royal Army Medical Corps; the Pioneer Corps, as a combatant unit, was by definition excluded. In his reply, Lord Croft referred to "conscientious objectors ordered for attachment to the Pioneer Corps", only obliquely correcting the language of the question. To spell it out in full, what Lord Croft meant was "conscientious objectors ordered by the Tribunals to serve in the Non-Combatant Corps and then, as members of the NCC, attached at certain times and for certain purposes to the Pioneer Corps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Lords question: conscientious objectors|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1941/jul/22/conscientious-objectors|website=Hansard|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=22 July 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salem State University''' is a 4-year public University located in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Salem State University, established in 1854 as '''Salem Normal School''', is located approximately 15 miles north of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1932 the institution was renamed Salem Teachers College, and from 1968 to 2010 it was known as Salem State College. {{As of|2013}}, Salem State enrolled 7,664 undergraduate and 1,637 graduate, full- and part-time students, from 27 states and 57 foreign countries. The university offers [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] and  [[Masters Degree]]s in the Arts and Sciences, [[Masters of Business Administration]], and Post Masters Certificates in more than 40 academic disciplines.  In addition, the university also offers [[Continuing Education]] courses for credit and non-credit.

==History==
Salem State University was founded in 1854 as the Salem Normal School under the guidance of [[Horace Mann]]. The Salem Normal School holds the distinction of being the fourth [[normal school]] to open in Massachusetts, and only the tenth to open in the United States. Initially, the school was a 2-year, post-secondary educational institution reserved for women. In 1898, the school became co-educational by enrolling its first group of male students that September.

In 1896 the school relocated to its current location in South Salem (to the building known today as the Sullivan Building). A few years later the Horace Mann Laboratory School was opened. With the construction of a more formal campus, the school was able to lengthen its curriculum to a 4-year study program in 1921. The first bachelor's degree program was in commercial education. In 1932, the school was renamed Salem Teachers College.

In 1960, the school was renamed State Teachers' College at Salem, and shortly thereafter in 1968 the school was renamed to Salem State College. Under the leadership of President Frederick Meier, the physical campus developed quite rapidly during the 1960s, with the construction of new academic buildings, the institution's first residence halls, and a student union. Throughout the 1970s, the school continued to expand its physical campus by constructing a new library, the O’Keefe Athletic Center, and by purchasing the land for what is today known as South Campus.

In the mid-1990s, the college moved forward with purchasing a 37.5-acre industrial site on Loring Avenue. The site was formerly home to a lightbulb plant owned by the [[GTE|General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation]], formerly [[Sylvania Electric Products]]. When GTE decided to exit the electrical equipment market, they sold off their former factory to Salem State. That site, is today known as Central Campus. It houses the Bertolon School of Business and three residence complexes: Viking Hall, Marsh Hall and Atlantic Hall.

On July 26, 2010, Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]] signed into law a bill that changed the name of institution to Salem State University. The name change became official on October 26, 2010.

==Campus==
[[Image:Salem State University.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Sullivan Building at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue.]]
Salem State University is divided into six unique campuses totaling a land-mass of 115 acres with approximately thirty-three buildings.&lt;ref name=ff/&gt; The main campus (North Campus) is located about a mile south of downtown Salem at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue. Within short walking distance from north campus is central campus, south campus, the School of Social Work, and the Richard O'Keefe Athletic Center. The university also operates a maritime facility at Cat Cove on the Salem harbor; located a mile north of the main campus.

'''North Campus'''

North campus is the largest of the five campuses. The majority of the university's arts and science programs are housed within the two academic buildings on north campus; the Edward Sullivan Building and Frederick Meier Hall. A focal point of north campus is the George H. Ellison Campus Center which houses the career and counseling centers as well as a number of student organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salemstate.edu/3531.php|title=Campus Center|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshman resident students are housed on north campus in two identical freshman residence halls. Other facilities on north campus include the university's main dining complex, the Mainstage Auditorium, the Horace Mann Laboratory School.  

'''Central Campus'''

Central campus is the second largest of the five campuses. The Bertolon School of Business, the music department, and the communications department are all housed in the one academic building on central campus; the Classroom Building. Freshmen, sophomores and transfer students reside in Marsh Hall, Sophomores and juniors reside in Viking Hall and junior and senior students reside in Atlantic Hall. A focal point of central campus is the university's Enterprise Center (small business center). Other facilities on central campus included the campus bookstore, the admissions center, the recital hall, and the university's baseball field and tennis courts.

'''South Campus'''

South campus houses the university's College of Health and Human Services. The School of Nursing, the School of Social Work, and the criminal justice department are housed in the two academic buildings on south campus; the [[Kevin B. Harrington]] Building and the Academic Building. Junior and senior resident students are housed on south campus in the Bates Residence Complex. Other facilities on south campus included the Alumni House and the Center for International Education.

'''School of Social Work'''

The Salem State School of Social Work is located at 297 Lafayette St., just a short walk from North Campus. It is a former synagogue purchased by the University in 2014, and houses many of the classes for the School of Social Work.

'''Richard O'Keefe Athletic Center'''

The O'Keefe Center houses the university's athletic department. Facilities include Twohig Gymnasium, Rockett Ice Arena, Alumni Field, the Gassett Fitness Center and two swimming pools.

'''Cat Cove Maritime Facility'''

Salem State operates a maritime facility at Cat Cove on the Salem harbor. The facility is used to provide interactive, hands-on educational experience for students majoring in marine biology. In the past, Cat Cove has been used to study local shellfish.

[[File:Sharks outside cage.jpg|thumb|People shark cage diving, the biggest form of shark tourism]]
'''Shark tourism''' is a form of [[eco-tourism]] rooted in having communities appreciate that local [[shark]] species are more valuable alive than dead.  Instead of opting for a one time economic benefit of harvesting sharks for their body parts, communities are made to assist interested tourists who may want to see live sharks. Many divers and people are involved in interest groups such as the late iDive Sharks Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Inglorious End of iDive Sharks?|url=http://sharkdivers.blogspot.com/2011/07/inglorious-end-of-idive-sharks.html|website=Shark Diver|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aim to celebrate and promote safe and responsible shark diving activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zenato|first1=Christina|title=Shark Diving, Shark Feeding, and Common Sense|url=http://www.sharksavers.org/en/blogs-news/community-voice/shark-diving-shark-feeding-and-common-sense/|website=sharksavers.org|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great white shark==
[[File:White shark.jpg|left|thumb|[[Great white shark]] at Isla Guadalupe, Mexico, August 2006. Shot with Nikon D70s in Ikelite housing, in natural light. Animal estimated at 11-12 feet (3.3 to 3.6 m) in length, age unknown]]

Great White Shark viewing is available at the [[Neptune Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shark cage diving|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/marineparks/enjoy/shark-cage-diving|publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[South Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Isla Guadalupe]] in [[Mexico]], and [[New Zealand]]  - where Great White sharks are viewed using shark cages to keep the diver safe. Except for Isla Guadalupe where because of the exceptional visibility underwater more outside the cage diving is done than anywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Terry|title=Diving with the Great White Sharks of Guadalupe Island|url=http://news.travel.aol.com/2013/08/05/great-white-shark-diving-guadalupe/|website=AOL Travel|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great White industry was founded in the 1970s by pioneer Australian diver and Great White attack survivor [[Rodney Fox]] in South Australia. He was the sole world-wide operator until the South African industry was founded in early 1989 by Pieter van der Walt. He was joined shortly thereafter by pioneer diver and underwater photographer George Askew who handled promotions and put South African cage diving "on the map" with the publicity he got - until they split in Jan 1992, after they, together with famous Australian divers, [[Ron and Valerie Taylor]], did the world's first dive amongst Great White sharks without a cage and completely unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=David Seifert|first1=Douglas|title=A tribute to Ron Taylor|url=http://www.sharksavers.org/en/blogs-news/community-voice/a-tribute-to-ron-taylor/|website=sharksavers.org|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This  'Frontier Pushing' dive was directly responsible for the upsurge in Shark Tourism – esp free-diving (i.e. Out of cage) swimming with big sharks. When would be operators around the world became aware of these four mad people who proved that the Great White was quite approachable and not likely to attack – thought that then maybe all the other 'Bad Boy' sharks like Tigers, Bulls and Oceanic's were safe to swim with too. This proved to be the case and shark tourism has become a multi-million-dollar a year industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecotourism: Dollars and Sense|url=http://www.sharksavers.org/en/education/the-value-of-sharks/sharks-and-ecotourism/|website=sharksavers.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiger, bull and oceanic white tip==
The [[Bahamas]] is a favorite region for Category 2 sharks.   
Whilst divers in the Bahamas experience [[Caribbean reef shark|Reef Shark]]s and [[Tiger shark|Tiger Sharks]] while they are hand-fed. Isla Guadalupe located in [[Mexico]] has been named a Bio-Sphere Reserve in an effort to control the shark diving activities there. Although the practice of shark diving proves to be controversial, it has been proven very effective in attracting tourists. [[Whale shark|Whale Sharks]], while not traditionally harvested for their fins but are sometimes harvested for their meat, have also benefited from Shark Tourism because of [[snorkeler]]s getting into the water with the gentle giants. In the [[Philippines]] snorkelers must maintain a distance of four feet from the sharks and there is a fine and possible jail time for anyone who touches the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cannon|first1=Marisa|title=Swimming with whale sharks in the Philippines|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/05/travel/whale-shark-oslob/index.html|website=cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All manner of Reef Shark species are prevalent at the many shark feeding dives within the Pacific Region. Grey Reef sharks are the main diners in places such as the [[Great Barrier Reef]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Tahiti]]. Silvertips and Black Tips Reef Sharks tend to be more seen around the PNG coastlines. Bull Sharks are around Mexico, [[Playa del Carmen]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Der Haar|first1=Nils|title=Why not to Bull Shark Dive in Play Del Carmen|url=http://scubadiverlife.com/2013/03/22/why-not-to-bull-shark-dive-in-play-del-carmen/|website=Scuba Diver Life|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation benefits==
Passive and active forms of shark tourism are believed to conserve the species by generating commercial value to their lives in the natural world. In [[North Carolina]] wreck divers regularly visit the [[World War II]] [[shipwrecks]] to dive with the [[Sand Tiger]] sharks that make the wrecks their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Robert|title=Ghosts in the Graveyard: N.C.

==Feeding==
Tourism providers often [[Do not feed the animals|provide food]] to attract sharks to areas where they can be more easily viewed, although this is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Higham|first1=James|last2=Lück|first2=Michael |title=Marine Wildlife and Tourism Management: Insights from the Natural and Social Sciences|year=2008|publisher=CAB International|isbn=978-1-84593-345-6|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsRZW0dU-6MC&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia's [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] and the states of Hawaii and Florida shark feeding is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kurrawa.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/sotr/sharks_rays/response.html |title=Environmental Status: Sharks and rays: Response: tourism |author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411143054/http://kurrawa.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/sotr/sharks_rays/response.html |archivedate=2011-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii had several issues with the banning of shark feeding. The initial law that prohibited it was passed in 2002, but many locals realized the tour companies were not following this law and pushed for stricter enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/530173/Hawaii-s-shark-tours-persist-despite-laws-against-feeding.html?nav=5031|title=Hawaii’s shark tours persist despite laws against feeding - Mauinews.com {{!}} News, Sports, Jobs, Visitor's Information - The Maui News|website=mauinews.com|access-date=2016-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602095044/http://mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/530173/Hawaii-s-shark-tours-persist-despite-laws-against-feeding.html?nav=5031|archivedate=2016-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shark tourism in Hawaii ==
[[File:Linving in a shark-eat-shark world 150617-M-RT812-001.jpg|thumb|A sign at Pyramid Rock Beach in [[Hawaii]] warning about a shark sighting, 2015]]
[[Shark]]s, or "mano" as they are called by the local Hawaiians, are viewed as sacred. Early Hawaiians worshiped and protected the sharks which they saw as family gods or "aumaka".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Sep/28/il/il06a.html.|title=The Honolulu Advertiser - Island Life|website=the.honoluluadvertiser.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, shark cage diving has become a very profitable tourist attraction in the state. [[Native Hawaiians]] were not pleased with this at first due to the fact that the companies were luring in the sharks using bait; they viewed these animals as sacred and feeding them for entertainment was said to be unjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKwBKmwy7EEC|title=Sharks of Hawaii: Their Biology and Cultural Significance|last=Taylor|first=Leighton R.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824815622|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also speculations that by feeding them, the sharks would begin to associate the boats and humans with food. For this reason, a bill was passed in [[Hawaii]] in 2002 that banned the feeding of sharks in state waters, which is about 3 miles off shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://policy.mofcom.gov.cn/GlobalLaw/english/flaw!fetch.action?id=b4c36fac-1f55-4cb8-910e-c6d11dc60f8b&amp;pager.pageNo=1#hawaii-volume-03-title-12-chapter-188-hrs-0188-0040-0006-htm.|title=Global Law and Regulation|website=policy.mofcom.gov.cn|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ningaloo Marine Park==
[[Ningaloo Marine Park (state waters)|Ningaloo Marine Park]] in [[Western Australia]] is the site of an annual whale shark aggregation. This site is a very popular tourist site, as whale sharks are incredibly gentle creatures that pose very little threat to humans. Introduced in 1997 and revised to its current version in 2013, the [[Department of Parks and Wildlife (Western Australia)|Department of Parks and Wildlife]] is responsible for a whale shark management program designed to protect the whale shark species and regulate human interaction with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/images/documents/conservation-management/marine/20130277_Whale_Shark_management_-_Ningaloo_FINAL_small.pdf|title=Whale shark management with particular  reference to Ningaloo Marine Park|last=Parks and Wildlife|first=Department of|date=October 2013|website=www.dpaw.wa.gov.au|access-date=August 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Licensing ===
The shark tourism industry is meant to educate and increase awareness of the natural environment as well as generate profits for the local people. The whale shark management program of Ningaloo Marine Park relies on the ''Conservation and Land Management Act of 1984'' (CALM Act) and the ''Wildlife Conservation Act of 1950''. The CALM Act requires tour operators to obtain a commercial tourist activity licence, and the Wildlife Conservation Act requires a wildlife interaction licence for each protected species a tour may come in contact with. This includes the whale sharks but is not limited to whales, other shark species, and [[dugong]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Techera, Erika J., and Natalie Klein. “The Role of Law in Shark-Based Eco-Tourism: Lessons from Australia.” ''Marine Policy'', vol. 39, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these laws, the Western Australian government is able to regulate how tourists interact with whale sharks and to what extent. A maximum of 15 operators are allowed to obtain licences at a given time. In addition, only one tour vessel is allowed to travel to the whale sharks while the rest must stay 250 metres away. Only ten swimmers are allowed in the water at a time, which controls the crowding of the area, and tourists are prohibited from feeding or touching the whale sharks.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Derrin. “Whale Shark Tourism in Ningaloo Marine Park, Australia.” ''Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of The Interactions of People &amp; Animals'', vol. 11, no. 1, Jan. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation ===
Whale sharks are considered a vulnerable species and have been targeted by fishermen for many years. In Ningaloo Marine Park, they are entirely protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://support.iucnredlist.org/species/whale-shark|title=Discover the Whale Shark!|date=2014-07-23|work=IUCN Red List 50|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whale sharks in the area are considered highly valuable in the ecotourism industry, as the industry provides numerous jobs to local people and brings in $12 million USD annually. Tourist interest in wildlife tourism continues to grow, and the whale shark tourism industry is expected to increase through the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259434808_Global_economic_value_of_shark_ecotourism_Implications_for_conservation|title=Global economic value of shark ecotourism: Implications for conservation (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">A '''signomial''' is an algebraic [[function (mathematics)|function]] of one or more independent variables.  It is perhaps most easily thought of as an algebraic extension of multi-dimensional [[polynomial]]s—an extension that permits exponents to be arbitrary real numbers (rather than just non-negative integers) while requiring the independent variables to be strictly positive (so that division by zero and other inappropriate algebraic operations are not encountered).

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a vector of real, positive numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;X = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n)^T&lt;/math&gt;

Then a signomial function has the form

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^M \left(c_i \prod_{j=1}^n x_j^{a_{ij}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; and the exponents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers.  Signomials are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scaling.

If we restrict all &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; to be positive, then the function f is a [[posynomial]]. Consequently, each signomial is either a posynomial, the negative of a posynomial, or the difference of two posynomials.  If, in addition, all exponents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are  non-negative integers, then the signomial becomes a [[polynomial]] whose domain is the positive [[orthant]].

For example, 

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2.7 x_1^2x_2^{-1/3}x_3^{0.7} - 2x_1^{-4}x_3^{2/5}&lt;/math&gt;

is a signomial. 

The term "signomial" was introduced by Richard J. Duffin and Elmor L. Peterson in their seminal joint work on general algebraic optimization—published in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  A recent introductory exposition involves [[optimization problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Maranas and C. Floudas, ''Global optimization in generalized geometric programming'', pp. 351–370, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[nonlinear optimization]] problems with [[constrained optimization|constraints]] and/or [[objective function|objectives]] defined by signomials are normally harder to solve than those defined by only posynomials (because, unlike posynomials, signomials are not guaranteed to be [[convex set|globally convex]]), signomial  optimization problems often provide a much more accurate mathematical representation of real-world nonlinear optimization problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">'''Social software engineering''' ('''SSE''') is a branch of [[software engineering]] that is concerned with the social aspects of software development and the developed software.

SSE focuses on the socialness of both software engineering and developed software. On the one hand, the consideration of social factors in software engineering activities, processes and CASE tools is deemed to be useful to improve the quality of both development process and produced software. Examples include the role of situational awareness and multi-cultural factors in collaborative software development. On the other hand, the dynamicity of the social contexts in which software could operate (e.g., in a cloud environment) calls for engineering social adaptability as a runtime iterative activity. Examples include approaches which enable software to gather users' quality feedback and use it to adapt autonomously or semi-autonomously.

SSE studies and builds socially-oriented tools to support collaboration and knowledge sharing in software engineering. SSE also investigates the adaptability of software to the dynamic social contexts in which it could operate and the involvement of clients and end-users in shaping software adaptation decisions at runtime. Social context includes norms, culture, roles and responsibilities, stakeholder's goals and interdependencies, end-users perception of the quality and appropriateness of each software behaviour, etc.

The participants of the 1st International Workshop on Social Software Engineering and Applications (SoSEA 2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.tut.fi/sosea08/ 1st International Workshop on Social Software Engineering and Applications (SoSEA 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the following characterization:
* [[Community]]-centered: Software is produced and consumed by and/or for a community rather than focusing on individuals
* [[Collaboration]]/collectiveness: Exploiting the collaborative and collective capacity of human beings
* [[Companionship]]/relationship: Making explicit the various associations among people
* Human/social activities: Software is designed consciously to support human activities and to address [[social problems]]
* [[Social inclusion]]: Software should enable social inclusion enforcing links and trust in communities

Thus, SSE can be defined as "the application of processes, methods, and tools to enable community-driven creation, management, deployment, and use of software in online environments".&lt;ref&gt;Imed Hammouda, [[Jan Bosch]], Mehdi Jazayeri, Tommi Mikkonen: First International Workshop on Social Software Engineering and Applications (SoSEA 2008). In: Proceedings of the 23rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE
2008). IEEE, 2008, pp. 531-532.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main observations in the field of SSE is that the concepts, principles, and technologies made for [[social software]] applications are applicable to software development itself as software engineering is inherently a social activity. SSE is not limited to specific activities of software development. Accordingly, tools have been proposed supporting different parts of SSE, for instance, social system design or social [[requirements engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;

Consequently [[vertical market software]], such as software development tools, engineering tools, marketing tools or software that helps users in a decision making process can profit from social components.&lt;ref&gt;Technische Universität München, sebis:

'''Sociology of leisure''' or '''leisure sociology''' is the study of how humans organize their [[leisure|free time]]. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as [[sport]], [[tourism]], and the playing of [[game]]s. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the [[sociology of work]], as each explores a different side of the work-leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and [[culture]].

Studies of leisure have determined that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. The type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's situation (presence or lack of family, age, and other factors).

==Theory==
Sociology of leisure is a fairly recent [[subfields of sociology|subfield of sociology]], compared to more traditional subfields such as [[sociology of work]], [[sociology of the family]], and [[sociology of education]]: it saw most of its development in the second half of the 20th century.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}&lt;ref name=parker&gt;Stanley Parker, "The Sociology of Leisure: Progress and Problems," ''The British Journal of Sociology'', vol. 26, no. 1, March 1975, pp. 91-101.

[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-leisuresociologicalstudsf.html Online]. Last accessed on 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of [[society]].&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; Leisure is now recognized as a major [[social institution]], deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Frey, David R. Dickens, "Leisure as a Primary Institution," ''Sociological Inquiry.'' vol. 60, no. 3, 1990, pp. 264-73, ON: 1475-682X, {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-682X.1990.tb00144.x}}. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-682X.1990.tb00144.x]&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[John Wilson (sociologist)|John Wilson]] and others have noted, it is difficult to define [[leisure]].&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;John Wilson, "The Sociology of Leisure," ''Annual Review of Sociology'', vol. 6, August 1980, pp. 21-40. [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.so.06.080180.000321 Online], [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2946003 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; [[Joffre Dumazedier]] distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to [[self-fulfillment]]. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

There are some unresolved questions concerning the definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as [[Homemaking|housework]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals may or may not classify such activities as leisure).&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure.&lt;ref name=parker2&gt;S.R. Parker, "Sociology of Leisure," ''Sociology'', 10 (1), 1976, Oxford (0038-0385), p. 166. [http://soc.sagepub.com+166.pdf Online]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, among some [[occupational community|occupational communities]], such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Apart from a definition of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, the study of the sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national [[tatistical survey|surveys]] such as the [[General Household Survey]] in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on [[qualitative research|qualitative methods]] of research ([[interviews]]).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

==Research==
Over time, emphasis in studies of leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and [[culture]].&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; [[Marshall Gordon]] noted that there are two approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The formal approach focuses on [[empirical]] questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the [[sociology of sport]]).&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and [[social change]], often from [[structural functionalist|structural-functionalist]] and [[neo-Marxist]] perspectives.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; [[Sheila Scraton]] provided a different analysis, comparing [[North America]]n and [[Great Britain|British]] studies.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; The British approaches focus on input from [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], [[critical Marxism]], and [[feminism]]; the American approaches concentrate on the [[social psychology|social-psychological]] tradition.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

==Findings==
Many sociologists have assumed that a given type of leisure activity is most easily explained by [[socioeconomic]] variables such as [[income]], [[Employment|occupation]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; This has yielded fewer results than expected; income is associated with total money spent on such activities, but otherwise only determines what type of activities are affordable.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Occupation has a similar effect, because most occupations heavily influence a person's income (for example, membership in a prestigious occupation and "[[country club|country-club]]" activities such as golf or sailing are significantly [[correlation|correlated]]—but so is membership in those occupations and high income, and those activities with high cost).&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Education is correlated with having a wide range of leisure activities, and with higher dedication to them.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; As Kelly noted, "Predicting a person's leisure behavior on the basis of his socioeconomic position is all but impossible."&lt;ref&gt;J. Kelly, "Socialization toward Leisure: a Developmental Approach," ''Journal of Leisure Research'', vol. 6, 1974, pp. 181-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's immediate situation—whether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Specific findings in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by [[John Robinson (sociologist)|John Robinson]]'s late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have four hours of leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;John Robinson, ''How Americans Use Their Time: A Social-Psychological Analysis of Everyday Behavior'', New York, Praeger, 1977, pp. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; During the second half of the twentieth century, watching [[television]] became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;J. Robinson and P. Converse, "Social Change Reflected in the Use of Time," in A. Campbell and P. Converse, eds., ''The Human Meaning of Social Change'', New York, Russell Sage, 1972, pp. 17-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

==Notes==
'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} There were few sociological studies of leisure before the second half of the 20th century. One of the earliest and most celebrated was [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' (1899).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

'''Sudan University of Science and Technology''' (abbreviated '''SUST''') is the largest public [[university]] in [[Sudan]], with ten (10) campuses in the [[Khartoum (state)|state of Khartoum]]. The main campus is located in Mogren area ([[:ar:المقرن (الخرطوم)|المقرن]]  the confluence of the White [[White Nile]] and the Blue [[Blue Nile]]). SUST founded in '''1902''' as Khartoum Technical School and School of Commerce. 

==History==
The school began as the Khartoum Technical School and School of Commerce in 1902. The School of Radiology (1932) and School of Arts (1946),  are then merged to Khartoum Technical School and School of Commerce to form Khartoum Technical Institute (KTI) in 1950. then the [[Shambat (city)|Shambat]] Institute of Agriculture (1954), Khartoum Senior Trade School (1962), Institute of Music and Drama and the Higher Institute of Physical Education (1969) are merged with KTI and renamed as Khartoum Polytechnic Institute (KP) in 1975. KP is accredited in 1990 as Sudan University of Science and Technology.

The field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of “[[sustainability]]” a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it "brings together scholarship and practice, global and local perspectives from north and south, and disciplines across the natural and social sciences, engineering, and medicine".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.C., &amp; Dickson, N. M. 2003. Sustainability science: The emerging research program. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA'' 100(14): 8059-8061.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist [[William C. Clark]] proposes that it can be usefully thought of as "neither 'basic' nor 'applied' research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs" and that it "serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.C. 2007. "Sustainability Science: A room of its own". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of  Science'' 104: 1737-1738; published online on February 6, 2007, 10.1073/pnas.0611291104&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, [[biodiversity loss]], pollution and land and water degradation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/?page_id=73 Sustainability Science]". ''Task Force on Conceptual Foundations''. [[Earth System Governance Project]]. earthsystemgovernance.net. Retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability science, like [[sustainability]] itself, derives some impetus from the concepts of [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental science]].&lt;ref name="ensci.iastate.edu"&gt;[http://www.ensci.iastate.edu Environmental Science: Iowa State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability&lt;ref&gt;Komiyama, H., Takeuchi, K. 2006. Sustainability science: building a new discipline. Sustainability Science 1:1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[sustainability measurement]] provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of "sustainability" or "sustainable development". In an overview presented on its website in 2008 the Sustainability Science Program at [[Harvard University]] described the field in the following way, stressing its [[interdisciplinarity]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Sustainability science' is problem-driven, interdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to facilitate the design, implementation, and evaluation of effective interventions that foster shared prosperity and reduced poverty while protecting the environment. It is defined by the problems it addresses rather than the disciplines it employs. It thus draws as needed from multiple disciplines of the natural, social, medical and engineering sciences, from the professions, and from the knowledge of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cid.harvard.edu./sustsci/overview.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119091925/http://www.cid.harvard.edu./sustsci/overview.html|archive-date=November 19, 2008 |title=Overview |work=Sustainable Science Program |publisher=Harvard University |access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Susan Kieffer|Susan W. Kieffer]] and colleagues, in 2003, suggested, more specifically, that sustainability science is: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the cultivation, integration, and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences (such as geology, ecology, climatology, oceanography) coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities, in order to evaluate, mitigate, and minimize the consequences, regionally and worldwide, of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future&amp;nbsp;– that is, in order that humans can be knowledgeable Earth stewards.&lt;ref&gt;Kieffer, S.W., Barton, P., Palmer, A.R., Reitan, P.H., &amp; Zen, E. 2003. "Megascale events: Natural disasters and human behavior". Geological Society of America Abstracts with programs: 432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been noted that the new paradigm &lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;must encompass different magnitudes of scales (of time, space, and function), multiple balances (dynamics), multiple actors (interests) and multiple failures (systemic faults).&lt;ref&gt;Reitan, P. 2005. Sustainability science – and what’s needed beyond science. Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy 1(1):77-80.

Others take a much broader view of sustainability science, emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system, such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancing society's well-being. In a 2012 article entitled "Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption," published in Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Halina Brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society, the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices, as well as in solving the problems they create, the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being, and others.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012 20–25"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Halina Szejnwald|title=Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|date=24 January 2012|volume=54|issue=1|pages=20–25|doi=10.1080/00139157.2012.639598|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2012/January-February%202012/science-needs_Full.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broad objectives==
The case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s, promoted by the Brundtland Commission's report ''[[Our Common Future]]'' in 1987, and noted in the ''[[Agenda 21]]'' plan that emerged from the ''[[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]'' in 1992 and further developed at the ''[[World Summit on Sustainable Development]]'', held in Johannesburg in 2002.

The topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffmann, Joanne 2009. Advancing sustainability science: report on the International Conference on Sustainability Science (ICSS) 2009. ''Sustainability Science'' '''4''': 233-242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published as ''Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology'', edited by [[Robert Kates]], with a preface by William Clark.&lt;ref name="hks.harvard.edu"&gt;Kates, Robert W., ed. (2010). ''Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology''. CID Working Paper No. 213. Center for International Development, Harvard University. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, December 2010. [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/publications/faculty-working-papers/cid-working-paper-no.-213 Abstract] and [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/69257/1249838/version/1/.../213.pdf PDF file] available on the Harvard Kennedy School website; retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Commentary by Halina Brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012 20–25"/&gt; This is work in progress. The 2012 Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, R. (2012). Encyclopedia of sustainability science and technology. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge structuring of issues===
Knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected. This is needed as a response to the requirements of academia, industry and government.

===Coordination of data===
The key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines, topics and organisations. A major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an “overview” of what is known. Sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed.

===Interdisciplinary approaches===
The attempt, by sustainability science, to understand the integrated “whole” of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific, social and economic disciplines, public and private sectors, academia and government. In short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination.

{{Conservation status}}
'''Threatened species''' are any species (including [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], etc.) which are vulnerable to [[Species endangerment|endangerment]] in the near future.  Species that are threatened are sometimes characterised by the [[population dynamics]] measure of ''[[critical depensation]]'', a mathematical measure of [[biomass]] related to [[population growth rate]]. This quantitative metric is one method of evaluating the degree of endangerment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liermann|first=Martin|year=2001|title=Depensation: evidence, models and implications|url=http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/LiermannM_2001_FishFish.pdf|journal=Fish and Fisheries|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==IUCN definition==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) is the foremost authority on threatened species, and treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories, depending on the degree to which they are threatened:

*[[Vulnerable species]]
*[[Endangered species]]
*[[Critically endangered species]]

Less-than-threatened categories are [[near threatened]], [[least concern]], and the no longer assigned category of [[conservation dependent]]. Species which have not been evaluated (NE), or do not have sufficient data ([[data deficient]]) also are not considered "threatened" by the IUCN.

[[File:Status iucn3.1 threatened.svg|thumb|left|The three categories of the threatened species [[IUCN Red List]].]]

Although ''threatened'' and ''vulnerable'' may be used interchangeably when discussing IUCN categories, the term ''threatened'' is generally used to refer to the three categories (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable), while ''vulnerable'' is used to refer to the least at risk of those three categories. They may be used interchangeably in most contexts however, as all vulnerable species are threatened species (''vulnerable'' is a category of ''threatened species''); and, as the more at-risk categories of threatened species (namely ''endangered'' and ''critically endangered'') must, by definition, also qualify as vulnerable species, all threatened species may also be considered vulnerable.

Threatened species are also referred to as a [[red-listed]] species, as they are listed in the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].

[[Subspecies]], populations and stocks may also be classified as threatened.

==United States definition==
[[File:Status ESA LT.svg|left|thumb|"Threatened" in relation to "endangered" under the [[Endangered Species Act|ESA]].]]

Under the [[Endangered Species Act]] in the United States, "threatened" is defined as "any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|title=Endangered Species Program - Laws &amp; Policies - Endangered Species Act - Section 3 Definitions|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species|last=Program|date=|website=www.fws.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429155642/https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-3.html|archivedate=29 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the less protected of the two protected categories. The [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha bayensis'') is an example of a threatened subspecies protected under the ESA.

Within the U.S., state wildlife agencies have the authority under the ESA to manage species which are considered endangered or threatened within their state but not within all states, and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species.  For example, the [[trumpeter swan]] (''Cygnus buccinator'') is threatened in the state of [[Minnesota]], while large populations still remain in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|title=Minnesota Endangered &amp; Threatened Species List|author=|date=|website=state.mn.us|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114000/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf|archivedate=19 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

==Australian definition==
The Commonwealth of Australia has legislation for categorising and protecting endangered species, namely the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]], which is known in short as the EPBC Act.  This act has six categories;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html#categories Threatened species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221072705/http://environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species.html |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, and conservation dependent, defined in Section 179 of the act, and could be summarised as;
*"Extinct" - "no reasonable doubt that the last member of the species has died",
*"Extinct in the wild" - "known only to survive in cultivation" and "despite exhaustive surveys" has not been seen in the wild,
*"Critically endangered" - "extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future",
*"Endangered" - "very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future",
*"Vulnerable" - "high risk of extinction in the wild in medium-term future", and
*"Conservation dependent" - "focus of a specific conservation program" without which the species would enter one of the above categories.

The EPBC Act also recognises and protects threatened ecosystems such as plant communities, and [[Ramsar Convention]] wetlands used by migratory birds.

Individual states and territories of Australia are bound under the EPBC Act, but may also have legislation which gives further protection to certain species, for example Western Australia's [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950]].  Some species, such as [[Lewin's rail]] (''Lewinia pectoralis''), are not listed as threatened species under the EPBC Act, but they may be recognised as threatened by individual states or territories.
===NSW Definition===
====Threatening Processes====
Pests and weeds, climate change and habitat loss are some of the key threatening processes facing native plants and animals [http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/threatened-species/about-threatened-species/key-threatening-processes listed by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9558">In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language theory]], a '''tree transducer''' (TT) is an [[abstract machine]] taking as input a [[tree (automata theory)|tree]], and generating output – generally other trees, but models producing [[Formal language#Words over an alphabet|words]] or other structures exist. Roughly speaking, tree transducers extend [[tree automata]] in the same way that [[finite-state transducer|word transducer]]s extend [[finite-state automata|word automata]].

Manipulating tree structures instead of words enable TT to model syntax-directed transformations of formal or natural languages. However, TT are not as well-behaved as their word counterparts in terms of [[Computational complexity theory|algorithmic complexity]], [[closure (mathematics)|closure properties]], etcetera. In particular, most of the main classes are not closed under [[function composition|composition]].

The main classes of tree transducers are:

==Top-Down Tree Transducers (TOP)==

A TOP ''T'' is a tuple (''Q'', Σ, Γ, ''I'', δ) such that:

* ''Q'' is a [[finite set]], the set of ''states'';
* Σ is a finite [[ranked alphabet]], called the ''input alphabet'';
* Γ is a finite ranked alphabet, called the ''output alphabet'';
* ''I'' is a [[subset]] of ''Q'', the set of ''initial states''; and
* &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;  is a set of ''rules'' of the form &lt;math&gt;q(f(x_1,\dots,x_n)) \to u&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f'' is a symbol of Σ, ''n'' is the arity of ''f'', ''q'' is a state, and ''u'' is a tree on Γ and &lt;math&gt;Q\times 1..n&lt;/math&gt;, such pairs being [[nullary]].

=== Examples of rules and intuitions on semantics ===
For instance, 
:&lt;math&gt;q(f(x_1,\dots,x_3)) \to g(a,q'(x_1),h(q''(x_3)))&lt;/math&gt; 
is a rule – one customarily writes &lt;math&gt;q(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; instead of the pair &lt;math&gt;(q,x_i)&lt;/math&gt; – and its intuitive semantics is that, under the action of ''q'', a tree with ''f'' at the root and three children is transformed into 
:&lt;math&gt;g(a,q'(x_1),h(q''(x_3)))&lt;/math&gt; 
where, recursively, &lt;math&gt;q'(x_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q''(x_3)&lt;/math&gt; are replaced, respectively, with the application of &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; on the first child and 
with the application of &lt;math&gt;q''&lt;/math&gt; on the third.

=== Semantics as [[Term rewriting system|term rewriting]] ===
The [[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]] of each state of the transducer ''T'', and of ''T'' itself, is a [[binary relation]] between input trees (on Σ) and output trees (on Γ).

A way of defining the semantics formally is to see &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; as a [[term rewriting system]], provided that in the right-hand sides the calls are written in the form &lt;math&gt;q(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where states ''q'' are unary symbols. Then the semantics &lt;math&gt;[\![q]\!]&lt;/math&gt; of a state ''q'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;[\![q]\!] = \{ u \mapsto v \mid u \text{ is a tree on } \Sigma,\ v\text{ is a tree on } \Gamma \text{, and } q(u) \to_{\delta}^* v \} . &lt;/math&gt;
The semantics of ''T'' is then defined as the union of the semantics of its initial states:
:&lt;math&gt;[\![T]\!] = \bigcup_{q\in I} [\![q]\!].&lt;/math&gt;

===Determinism and domain===
As with tree automata, a TOP is said to be '''deterministic''' (abbreviated '''DTOP''') if no two rules of δ share the same left-hand side, and there is at most one initial state. In that case, the semantics of the DTOP is a [[partial function]] from input trees (on Σ) to output trees (on Γ), as are the semantics of each of the DTOP's states.

The '''domain''' of a transducer is the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of its semantics. Likewise, the '''image''' of a transducer is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of its semantics.

===Properties of DTOP===

* DTOP are not closed under [[union (mathematics)|union]]: this is already the case for deterministic word transducers.
* The domain of a DTOP is a [[regular tree language]]. Furthermore, the domain is recognisable by a deterministic top-down tree automaton (DTTA) of size at most exponential in that of the initial DTOP.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, B.S.: Composition of top-down and bottom-up tree transductions. Inf. Control 41(2), 186–213 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;
::That the domain is DTTA-recognizable is not surprising, considering that the left-hand sides of DTOP rules are the same as for DTTA. As for the reason for the exponential explosion in the worst case (that does not exist in the word case), consider the rule &lt;math&gt;q(f(x_1,x_2)) \to g(p_1(x_1),p_2(x_1),p_3(x_2))&lt;/math&gt;. In order for the computation to succeed, it must succeed for both children.  That means that the right child must be in the domain of &lt;math&gt;p_3&lt;/math&gt;. As for the left child, it must be in the domain of ''both'' &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;. Generally, since subtrees can be copied, a single subtree can be evaluated by multiple states during a run, despite the determinism, and unlike DTTA. Thus the construction of the DTTA recognising the domain of a DTOP must account for ''sets'' of states and compute the intersections of their domains, hence the exponential. In the special case of '''linear''' DTOP, that is to say DTOP where each &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; appears at most once in the right-hand side of each rule, the construction is linear in time and space.

* The image of a DTOP is not a regular tree language.
::Consider the transducer coding the transformation &lt;math&gt;f(x)\to g(x,x)&lt;/math&gt;; that is, duplicate the child of the input. This is easily done by a rule &lt;math&gt;q(f(x_1)) \to g(p(x_1),p(x_1))&lt;/math&gt;, where ''p'' encodes the [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]. Then, absent any restrictions on the first child of the input, the image is a classical non-regular tree language.

* However, the domain of a DTOP cannot be ''restricted'' to a regular tree language. That is to say, given a DTOP ''T'' and a language ''L'', one cannot in general build a DTOP &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; such that the semantics of &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is that of ''T'', [[restriction (mathematics)|restricted]] to ''L''.
::This property is linked to the reason deterministic top-down tree automata are less expressive than bottom-up automata: once you go down a given path, information from other paths is inaccessible. Consider the transducer coding the transformation &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)\to y&lt;/math&gt;; that is, output the right child of the input. This is easily done by a rule &lt;math&gt;q(f(x_1,x_2)) \to p(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''p'' encodes the identity. Now let's say we want to restrict this transducer to the finite (and thus, in particular, regular) domain &lt;math&gt;\{ f(c,a),\ f(c,b) \}&lt;/math&gt;. We must use the rules &lt;math&gt;q(f(x_1,x_2)) \to p(x_2),\ p(a) \to a,\ p(b)\to b&lt;/math&gt;. But in the first rule, &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; does not appear at all, since nothing is produced from the left child. Thus, it is not possible to test that the left child is ''c''. In contrast, since we produce from the right child, we can test that it is ''a'' or ''b''. In general, the criterion is that DTOP cannot test properties of subtrees from which they do not produce output.

* DTOP are not closed under composition. However this problem can be solved by the addition of a [[Lookahead (tree transducer)|lookahead]]: a tree automaton coupled to the transducer, which can perform tests on the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] which the transducer is incapable of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maneth|first1=Sebastian|title=A Survey on Decidable Equivalence Problems for Tree Transducers|journal=International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science|date=December 2015|volume=26|issue=08|pages=1069–1100|doi=10.1142/S0129054115400134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::This follows from the point about domain restriction: composing the DTOP encoding identity on &lt;math&gt;\{ f(c,a),\ f(c,b) \}&lt;/math&gt; with the one encoding &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)\to y&lt;/math&gt; must yield a transducer with the semantics &lt;math&gt;\{ f(c,a) \mapsto a,\ f(c,b)  \mapsto b \}&lt;/math&gt;, which we know is not expressible by a DTOP.

* The [[typechecking]] problem—testing whether the image of a regular tree language is included in another regular tree language—is decidable.
* The [[equivalence problem]]—testing whether two DTOP define the same functions—is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Decidability results concerning tree transducers I|journal=www.inf.u-szeged.hu|url=http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/actacybernetica/edb/vol05n1/Esik_1980_ActaCybernetica.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottom-Up Tree Transducers (BOT)==

As in the simpler case of tree automata, bottom-up tree transducers are defined similarly to their top-down counterparts, but proceed from the leaves of the tree to the root, instead of from the root to the leaves. Thus the main difference is in the form of the rules, which are of the form &lt;math&gt;f(q_1(x_1),\dots,q_n(x_n))) \to q(u)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Coa_Illustration_Cross_Triquetra.svg|right|thumb|Interlaced triquetra which is a [[trefoil knot]]]]
'''Triquetra''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|aɪ|ˈ|k|w|ɛ|t|r|ə}}; from the Latin adjective ''triquetrus'', three-cornered) denotes a particular complicated shape formed of three ''[[Vesica piscis|vesicae piscis]]'' (the leaf-like shape in between two equal diameter circles each centered on the circumference of the other), sometimes with an added circle in or around the three lobes. Also known as a "trinity knot" when parallel doubled-lines are in the graph, the design is used as a religious symbol adapted from ancient Pagan Celtic images by Christianity. It is similar to Odin's symbol, the [[valknut]].

==Ancient usage==

===Celtic art===
The triquetra is often found in [[insular art]], most notably metal work and in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the ''[[Book of Kells]]''. It is also found in similar artwork on Celtic crosses and slabs from the early Christian period. The fact that the triquetra rarely stood alone in medieval Celtic art has cast reasonable doubt on its use as a primary symbol of belief. In manuscripts it is used primarily as a space filler or ornament in much more complex compositions, and in knotwork panels it is a design motif integrated with other design elements.  This widely recognised knot has been used as a singular symbol for the past two centuries by Celtic Christians, pagans and agnostics as a sign of special things and people that are threefold.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Stephen (2001). "[http://www.celtarts.com/in_search_of_meaning.htm In Search of Meaning]", ''Dalriada Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese use===
The triquetra has been a known symbol in Japan called ''Musubi Mitsugashiwa''. Being one of the forms of the [[Aryan]] [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Iakšaku dynasty]] signs, it reached Japan with the dynasty's [[Kāśyapīya]] spreading technology and [[Buddhism]] via [[Kingdom of Khotan]], after which the Japanese sword [[katana]] is called, [[Chinese Buddhism|China]] and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Germanic paganism===
The triquetra has been found on [[runestone]]s in Northern Europe and on early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] coins. It presumably had [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] religious meaning and it bears a resemblance to the ''[[valknut]]'', a symbol associated with [[Odin]].

===Christian use===
The symbol has been used in [[Christian Church|Christian]] tradition as a sign of the [[Trinity]] ([[God the Father|Father]], [[Jesus Christ|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]]), especially since the Celtic revival of the 19th century. When modern designers began to display the triquetra as a stand-alone design, it recalled the three-leafed shamrock which was similarly offered as a Trinity symbol by Saint Patrick{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. 
It has also been suggested that the triquetra has a similarity to the Christian [[Ichthys|Ιχθυς]] symbol. The triquetra has been used extensively on Christian sculpture, vestments, book arts and stained glass. It has been used on the title page and binding of some editions of the [[New King James Version]]{{examples|date=November 2014}}.

A very common representation of the symbol is with a circle that goes through the three interconnected loops of the triquetra. The circle emphasises the unity of the whole combination of three forces. It is also said to symbolise [[God]]'s love around the Holy Trinity.

==Modern use==
In contemporary Ireland, it is traditional for lovers to exchange jewelry such as a necklace or rings signifying their affection. The triquetra, also known as a "trinity knot", is often found as a design element is popular Irish jewelry such as [[Claddagh ring|claddaghs]] and other wedding or engagement rings.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Seán (1999). ''Story of the Claddagh Ring''. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|9781856351898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page missing|date=October 2018}}

===Neopaganism===
It is difficult to date the exact origin of the Irish triquetra, and whether it was first used in a Christian or [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] context; the distinctive interlace/knotwork artistic style did not fully develop until ca. the 7th century AD, but the triquetra is the [[trefoil knot|simplest possible knot]]. [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic pagans]], or even [[Neopaganism|neopagans]] who are not of a Celtic cultural orientation, may use the triquetra to symbolise a variety of concepts and mythological figures.

Due to its presence in insular Celtic art, [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionists]] use the triquetra either to represent one of the various triplicities in their cosmology and theology (such as the tripartite division of the world into the realms of Land, Sea and Sky),&lt;ref name="Mac Mathúna"&gt;Mac Mathúna, Liam (1999) [http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c23/c23-174.pdf "Irish Perceptions of the Cosmos"] ''Celtica'' vol. 23 (1999), pp.174–187&lt;/ref&gt; or as a symbol of one of the specific Celtic [[Triple deity|triple goddesses]], for example the battle goddess, [[The Morrígan]].

[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] groups who use the triquetra to symbolise their faith generally believe it is originally of Norse and Germanic origins.

The symbol is also sometimes used by wiccans and some [[new age]]rs to symbolise the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], or as a protective symbol.&lt;ref name="scott-cunningham"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cunningham |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Cunningham |title=Wicca: A Guide to the Solitary Practitioner |year=2004 |origyear=1988 |publisher=Llewellyn |location=Woodbury, MN, U.S.A. |isbn=978-0-87542-118-6 |page=191 |chapter=Rune Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
&lt;!-- Do not add more pop culture mentions here unless they are 1. sourced and 2.vplay a significant role in the symbology or identification of the referenced subject. Other additions will be deleted as spam. --&gt;

The triquetra is often used artistically as a design element when [[Celtic knotwork]] is used. Many who identify as [[modern Celts]] may use the symbol to display an identification with [[Celtic Europe|Celtic culture]], whether they live in the [[Celtic Nations]] or the [[diaspora]].

====In literature and publications====
*The double triquetra is used to represent the Holy Trinity on the ''New King James Version'' [[Bibles]], published by Thomas Nelson, Inc

====In television====
*[[Michonne]]'s [[katana]] in the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' features a triquetra on the inner [[crossguard]]. Custom-designed for the character, propmaster John Sanders intentionally chose the triquetra for its meaning as a triple goddess symbol.&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/walking-dead-14-props-and-stories-behind-em/670478_michonnes-katana | title=Michonne's Katana | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=30 October 2016 | author=Ross, Dalton |author2=Snetiker, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/10/08/walkers-weapons-bees-at-amc-the-walking-dead/16886945/ | title=&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;The Walking Dead,' up close and personal | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=12 October 2014 | accessdate=30 October 2016 | last=Keveney | first=Bill | quote=We put a trinity on there – mind, body, soul.

==Geometry==
Topologically, the interlaced form of the plain triquetra is a [[trefoil knot]].
