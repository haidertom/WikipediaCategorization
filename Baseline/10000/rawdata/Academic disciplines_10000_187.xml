      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2663">'''Austal2000''' is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It was developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke&lt;ref name="Janicke"&gt;[http://www.janicke.de/htm/e_home.htm Web site of Ingenieurbüro Janicke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812134159/http://www.janicke.de/htm/e_home.htm |date=August 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Dunum, Germany under contract to the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.  

Although not named in the TA Luft, it is the reference dispersion model accepted as being in compliance with the requirements of Annex 3 of the TA Luft and the pertinent VDI Guidelines.

==Description==

It simulates the dispersion of air pollutants by utilizing a [[random walk]] process ([[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian simulation model]]) and it has capabilities for [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|building effects]], complex terrain, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollutant plume]] depletion by [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet or dry deposition]], and first order chemical reactions. It is available for download on the Internet free of cost.&lt;ref name="AustalDownload"&gt;[http://www.austal2000.de/ Austal2000 download web site (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austal2000G is a similar model for simulating the dispersion of odours and it was also developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke. The development of Austal 2000G was financed by three German states: Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen and Baden-Württemberg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2131">The '''Assimitron''' was a Japanese device uses to measure fluctuating CO2 levels at crop canopies. Led by E. Inoue at the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences in [[Tsukuba]], [[Japan]], the device itself was an offshoot of an earlier Australian invention, the Evapotron that first found mention in a 1958 article in the journal ''Nature.'' The Evaporimeter, as it was first called, was used to measure the evaporations from natural surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Taylor &amp; A.J. Dyer, An Instrument for Measuring Evaporation from Natural Surfaces, Nature 181 (Feb 8, 1958): 408-409.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Assimitron, it “instantaneously” performed “the necessary calculations for determining water vapour flux by correlation of humidity fluctuations with vertical wind fluctuations.”.&lt;ref&gt;E. Inoue, Z. Uchijima, T. Saito, S. Isobe, and K. Uemura, ‘The “Assimitron”, a Newly Devised Instrument for Measuring CO2 flux in the Surface Air Layer,’ Journal of Agricultural Meteorology, Tokyo 25 (1969): 165-171, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Such calculations required the use of a complex centralized computer to process the enormous quantities of data. Part of this stemmed from the need to perform two different equations to deal with turbulent and low flows, depending on whether it was a windy or sunny day.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Uchijima, “Carbon dioxide environment and flux within a corn crop canopy,” in Prediction and Measurement of Photosynthetic Productivity (Wageningen: Centre for Agricultural Publishing and Documentation, 1970): 179-196, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bokuseki''''' (墨跡) is a Japanese term meaning "ink trace", and refers to a form of Japanese calligraphy  ([[Shodo]]) and more specifically a style of [[Zenga]] developed by [[Zen]] monks. Bokuseki is often characterized by bold, assertive, and often abstract brush strokes meant to demonstrate the calligrapher’s pure state of mind (see [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|Samadhi]]). The aim in making Bokuseki is  to represent ones single-moment awareness by brushing each word or passage with a single breath, ultimately realizing Zen and manifesting ones [[Zazen]] practice into physical and artistic action. Fundamentally Bokuseki is a reflection of one's spontaneous action (see: [[Buddha-nature]], [[Katsu (Zen)|katsu]]) free from one’s superficial or [[Rationality|rationally]] oriented mind.

A '''building code''' (also '''building control''' or '''building regulations''') is a set of rules that specify the standards for constructed objects such as [[building]]s and [[nonbuilding structure]]s. Buildings must conform to the code to obtain [[planning permission]], usually from a local council. The main purpose of building codes is to protect [[public health]], safety and general welfare as they relate to the construction and occupancy of buildings and structures.  The building code becomes [[law]] of a particular jurisdiction when formally [[enactment of a bill|enacted]] by the appropriate governmental or private authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=danQCwAAQBAJ|title=Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to Understanding the 2015 International Building Code|last=Ching|first=Francis D.

Building codes are generally intended to be applied by [[architect]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[interior designer]]s, constructors and [[regulatory agency|regulators]] but are also used for various purposes by [[fire safety inspector|safety inspectors]], [[environmental scientist]]s, [[real estate developer]]s, subcontractors, manufacturers of building products and materials, [[insurance]] companies, facility managers, [[leasehold estate|tenants]], and others. Codes regulate the design and construction of structures where adopted into law.

Examples of building codes began in ancient times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm |title=Hammurabi's Code of Laws |date= |publisher= |accessdate=2008-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509192326/http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA the main codes are the [[International Building Code|International Commercial or Residential Code [ICC/IRC]]], electrical codes and plumbing, mechanical codes.

The practice of developing, approving, and enforcing building codes varies considerably among nations.  In some countries building codes are developed by the government agencies or quasi-governmental [[standards organizations]] and then enforced across the country by the [[central government]]. Such codes are known as the '''national building codes''' (in a sense they enjoy a mandatory nationwide application).

In other countries, where the power of regulating construction and fire [[safety]] is vested in [[local authorities]], a system of [[model building code]]s is used. Model building codes have no legal status unless adopted or adapted by an authority having jurisdiction. The developers of model codes urge public authorities to reference model codes in their laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative orders. When referenced in any of these legal instruments, a particular model code becomes law. This practice is known as ''adoption by reference''. When an adopting authority decides to delete, add, or revise any portions of the [[model building code|model code]] adopted, it is usually required by the [[model building code|model code]] developer to follow a formal adoption procedure in which those modifications can be documented for legal purposes.

There are instances when some [[local authorities|local jurisdictions]] choose to develop their own building codes. At some point in time all major cities in the [[United States]] had their own building codes. However, due to ever increasing complexity and cost of developing building regulations, virtually all municipalities in the country have chosen to adopt [[model building code|model codes]] instead. For example, in 2008 New York City abandoned its proprietary ''1968 New York City Building Code'' in favor of a customized version of the [[International Building Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/model/model.shtml NYC Construction Codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702014751/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/model/model.shtml |date=July 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanguardnewyork.com/building-code/|title=Building Code|last=|first=|date=|website=Vanguard New York|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of [[Chicago]] remains the only [[municipality]] in America that continues to use a building code the city developed on its own as part of the ''[[Municipal Code of Chicago]]''.

In Europe, the [[Eurocode]] is a pan-European building code that has superseded the older national building codes.  Each country now has National Annexes to localize the contents of the Eurocode.

Similarly, in [[India]], each municipality and urban development authority has its own building code, which is mandatory for all construction within their jurisdiction. All these local building codes are variants of a [http://www.bis.org.in/sf/nbc.htm National Building Code], which serves as model code proving guidelines for regulating building construction activity.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

Building codes have a long history. The earliest known written building code is included in the [[Code of Hammurabi]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which dates from circa 1772 BC.

The book of [[Deuteronomy]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] stipulated that [[parapet]]s must be constructed on all houses to prevent people from falling off.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===

After the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, which had been able to spread so rapidly through the densely built timber housing of the city, the [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666|Rebuilding of London Act]] was passed in the same year as the first significant building regulation.&lt;ref&gt;'Charles II, 1666: An Act for rebuilding the City of London.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628–80 (1819), pp. 603–12. URL: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47390 british-history.ac.uk], date accessed: 08 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawn up by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]], the Act regulated the rebuilding of the city, required housing to have some fire resistance capacity and authorised the [[City of London Corporation]] to reopen and widen roads.&lt;ref&gt;'Book 1, Ch. 15: From the Fire to the death of Charles II', A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark (1773), pp. 230–55. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46732. Date accessed: 07 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laws of the Indies]] were passed in the 1680s by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]] to regulate the urban planning for colonies throughout Spain's worldwide imperial possessions.

The first systematic national building standard was established with the London Building Act of 1844. Among the provisions, builders were required to give the district surveyor two days' notice before building, regulations regarding the thickness of walls, height of rooms, the materials used in repairs, the dividing of existing buildings and the placing and design of [[chimney]]s, [[fireplace]]s and [[Drain (plumbing)|drains]] were to be enforced and streets had to be built to minimum requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npt.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=478|title=A Brief History of Building Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Buildings Office]] was formed to regulate the construction and use of buildings throughout London. Surveyors were empowered to enforce building regulations, which sought to improve the standard of houses and business premises, and to regulate activities that might threaten public health. In 1855 the assets, powers and responsibilities of the office passed to the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]].

The City of [[Baltimore]] passed its first building code in 1859. The [[Great Baltimore Fire]] occurred in February, 1904. Subsequent changes were made that matched other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore: The Building of an American City, Sherry H. Olson, Published 1997, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (Md.), {{ISBN|0-8018-5640-X}}, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, a Handbook of the Baltimore City Building Laws was published. It served as the building code for four years. Very soon, a formal building code was drafted and eventually adopted in 1908.

In Paris, under the reconstruction of much of the city under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire (1852–70)]], great blocks of apartments were erected&lt;ref name="New International Encyclopedia"&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the height of buildings was limited by law to five or six stories at most.

== Scope ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The purpose of building codes is to provide minimum standards for safety, health, and general welfare including structural integrity, mechanical integrity (including sanitation, water supply, light, and ventilation), means of egress, fire prevention and control, and energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Hageman, Jack M., and Brian E. P. Beeston. ''Contractor's guide to the building code''. 6th ed. Carlsbad, CA: Craftsman Book Co., 2008. 10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Harry J., and Richard Peck. ''Housing and local government: a research guide for policy makers and planners''. Lexington, Mass. u.a.: Lexington Books, 1974. 53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Building codes generally include:
* Standards for structure, placement, size, usage, wall assemblies, fenestration size/locations, egress rules, size/location of rooms, foundations, floor assemblies, roof structures/assemblies, energy efficiency, stairs and halls, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, site drainage &amp; storage, appliance, lighting, fixtures standards, occupancy rules, and swimming pool regulations.
* Rules regarding [[parking]] and [[traffic]] impact
* [[Fire code]] rules to minimize the risk of a fire and to ensure safe evacuation in the event of such an emergency[citation needed]
* Requirements for [[earthquake]] ([[seismic code]]), [[hurricane]], [[flood]], and [[tsunami]] resistance, especially in disaster prone areas or for very large buildings where a failure would be catastrophic{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* Requirements for specific building uses (for example, storage of flammable substances, or housing a large number of people)
* Energy provisions and consumption
* [[Grandfathering]] provisions: Unless the building is being renovated, the building code usually does not apply to existing buildings.
* [[Specification]]s on components
* Allowable installation methodologies
* Minimum and maximum room and exit sizes and location
* Qualification of individuals or corporations doing the work
* For high structures, anti-collision markers for the benefit of aircraft

Building codes are generally separate from [[zoning]] ordinances, but exterior restrictions (such as setbacks) may fall into either category.

Designers use building code standards out of substantial reference books during design. Building departments review plans submitted to them before construction, issue permits [or not] and inspectors verify compliance to these standards at the site during construction.

There are often additional codes or sections of the same building code that have more specific requirements that apply to [[dwelling]]s or places of business and special construction objects such as canopies, signs, [[pedestrian]] walkways, [[parking lot]]s, and radio and [[television antenna]]s.

== Current Codes ==
===Energy codes in the United States===

The energy codes of the United States are adopted at the state and municipal levels and are based on the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC). Previously, they were based on the Model Energy Code (MEC).

As of March 2017, the following residential codes have been partially or fully adopted by states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcapcodes.org/code-status/residential/|title=Residential Code Status {{!}} The Building Codes Assistance Project|website=bcapcodes.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2015 IECC or equivalent (California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Washington)
* 2012 IECC or equivalent (Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas)
* 2009 IECC or equivalent (Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin)
* 2006 IECC or equivalent (Utah)
* &lt;2006 IECC or no statewide code (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming)

'''Cabinets of curiosities''' (also known in [[German language|German]] loanwords as '''Kunstkabinett''', '''Kunstkammer''' or '''Wunderkammer'''; also '''Cabinets of Wonder''', and '''wonder-rooms''') were encyclopedic collections of objects the categorical boundaries of which were, in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], yet to be defined. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to [[natural history]] (sometimes faked), [[geology]], [[ethnography]], [[archaeology]], religious or historical [[relic]]s, works of art (including  [[cabinet painting]]s), and [[antiquities]]. "The Kunstkammer was regarded as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Francesaco Fiorani, reviewing Bredecamp 1995 in ''Renaissance Quarterly'' '''51'''.1  (Spring 1998:268-270) p 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Charles I of England]]'s collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, "The ''Kunstkabinett'' itself was a form of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, "Charles I of England: The tragedy of Absolutism", A.G. Dickens, ed. ''The Courts of Europe'' (London) 1977:201.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the most famous, best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of [[science]] in [[Europe]] formed collections that were precursors to [[museum]]s.

The term ''[[Cabinet (architecture)|cabinet]]'' originally described a room rather than a [[Cabinet (furniture)|piece of furniture]]. The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. The Kunstkammer of [[Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (ruled 1576–1612), housed in the [[Hradschin]] at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided a solace and retreat for contemplation&lt;ref&gt;This is the secretive aspect emphasised by R.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;W. Evans, ''Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II and His World: A Study in Intellectual History'' (Oxford) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, "Remarks on the Collections of Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II: The Kunstkammer as a Form of Representatio",&lt;!--Representatio is correct--&gt; ''Art Journal'' '''38'''.1 (Autumn 1978:22–28).&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf's uncle, [[Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II, Archduke of Austria]], also had a collection, with a special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the [[Chamber of Art and Curiosities]] at [[Ambras Castle]] in Austria.

==History==
[[Image:RitrattoMuseoFerranteImperato.jpg|thumb|left|Fold-out engraving from [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599), the earliest illustration of a natural history cabinet]]
[[Image:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|A corner of a cabinet, painted by [[Frans II Francken]] in 1636 reveals the range of connoisseurship a Baroque-era ''[[virtuoso]]'' might evince]]
The earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599) (''illustration, left''). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in showing his open bookcases at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his [[herbarium]]. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a ''studiolo''&lt;ref&gt;''Studiolo'': the small retreats in the palaces of Urbino and Gubbio were inlaid with [[intarsia]] that figured just such fitted cabinets with feigned lattice doors and shelves filled with scientific instruments, books and small sculptures in ''trompe-l'oeil'' perspective. The Gubbio ''studiolo'' has been reassembled at the [[Metropolitan Museum]]; the Urbino ''studiolo'' remains in situ.&lt;/ref&gt; with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Sixteenth-century cabinet-makers serving the luxury trades of [[Florence]] and [[Antwerp]] were beginning to produce moveable cabinets with similar architectural interior fittings, which could be set upon a carpet-covered table or on a purpose-built stand.&lt;/ref&gt; Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.

In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised [[Christian&amp;nbsp;I of Saxony]] that three types of item were indispensable in forming a "Kunstkammer" or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly "curious items from home or abroad"; and thirdly "antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals".&lt;ref&gt;B. Gutfleish and J. Menzhausen, "How a Kunstkammer Should Be Formed", ''Journal of the History of Collections'', 1989 Vol I: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Albrecht Dürer]] visited the [[Netherlands]] in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to [[Nuremberg]] various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 48.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly characteristic range of interests represented in  [[Frans II Francken]]'s painting of 1636 (''illustration, left'') shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'') intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely [[amber]], which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing ''Libera'', a Roman fertility goddess)&lt;ref&gt;Her base is inscribed LIBER[A]&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand and modern and religious (''Christ at the Column''&lt;ref&gt;It appears to represent a reduction of a well-known sculpture by [[Alessandro Algardi]].&lt;/ref&gt;) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): [[portrait miniature]]s, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia [[Chiaroscuro|chiaroscuro woodcuts]] or drawings, and a small [[still-life]] painting&lt;ref&gt;Still life was considered a [[hierarchy of genres|lesser genre]] than even portraits or landscapes.&lt;/ref&gt; leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.

Two of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of [[Ole Worm]], known as Olaus Wormius (1588–1654) (''illustration, above right''), and [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork [[automaton|automata]]; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently [[mythology|mythical]] creatures. Worm's collection contained, for example, what he thought was a [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Scythian Lamb]], a woolly [[fern]] thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the [[narwhal]]'s tusk as coming from a whale rather than a [[unicorn]], as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages.

In the second half of the 18th century, [[Belsazar Hacquet]] (c. 1735–1815) operated in [[Ljubljana]], then the capital of [[Carniola]], a natural history cabinet ({{lang-de|Naturalienkabinet}}) that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Russian grand duke [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]] and [[Pope Pius VI]], as well as by famous naturalists, such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesco Griselini|it}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Benedikt Hermann|de|3=Franz Benedikt Hermann (Geologe)}}. It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the [[Idrija mercury mine|Idrija mine]], a ''[[herbarium vivum]]'' with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an [[anatomical theatre]].&lt;ref name=Jezernik&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-IARZL5AU |title=Ljubljanske »knjige sveta« od Auerspergov do Hacqueta |first=Božidar |last=Jezernik |year=2009 |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Ljubljana's "Books of the World" – from the Auerspergs to Hacquet |journal=Etnolog |id={{COBISS|ID=1242502}} |volume=19=70 |pages=23–33 |issn=0354-0316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the ''Museum Wormianum'' (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more.

Cabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many [[monarch]]s, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the [[Studiolo of Francesco&amp;nbsp;I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. [[Frederick&amp;nbsp;III of Denmark]], who added Worm's collection to his own after Worm's death, was another such monarch. A third example is the [[Kunstkamera]] founded by [[Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from [[Albertus Seba]] and [[Frederik Ruysch]]. The fabulous [[Habsburg]] Imperial collection included important [[Aztec]] artifacts, including the [[Montezuma's headdress|feather head-dress]] or crown of [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] now in the [[Vienna Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]]. 
[[File:Berlin Naturkundemuseum Korallen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An early eighteenth-century German  ''Schrank'' with a traditional display of [[coral]]s (Naturkundenmuseum Berlin)]]

Similar collections on a smaller scale were the complex ''Kunstschränke'' produced in the early seventeenth century by the [[Augsburg]] merchant, diplomat and collector [[Philipp Hainhofer]]. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] in 1632, which is kept in the [[Gustavianum|Museum Gustavianum]] in [[Uppsala]]. The [[curio cabinet]], as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples.

The juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp's analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality.

A late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the [[Grünes Gewölbe]], the "Green Vaults" formed by [[Augustus the Strong]] in [[Dresden]] to display his chamber of wonders.  The "Enlightenment Gallery" in the [[British Museum]], installed in the former "Kings Library" room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/themes/room_1_enlightenment.aspx |title=Enlightenment Gallery at the British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a ''cabinet'' came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly objects of ''[[virtù]]'' or curiosities, such as a ''[[virtuoso]]'' would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, [[Michael Bernhard Valentini]] published an early [[Museology|museological]] work, ''Museum Museorum'', an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents.

Some strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial [[freak show]]s and [[sideshows]].

[[Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753) was an English physician, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]], and the founder of the [[British Museum]] in London. He began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the [[Duke of Albemarle]] offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, ''Natural History of Jamaica'', published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; Clark, Jack A. " Sir Hans Sloane and Abbé Jean Paul Bignon: Notes on Collection Building in the Eighteenth Century," in ''The Library Quarterly'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (October 1980), 475–482; de Beer, G.&amp;nbsp;R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; and [[Kay Dian Kriz|Kriz, Kay Dian]]. "Curiosities, Commodities, and Transplanted Bodies in Hans Sloane's "Natural History of Jamaica", in ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 57, No. 1 (January 2000), 35–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. [[Herman Boerhaave]] gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave's gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased [[Leonard Plukenet]]'s collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715)]], left him a twelve-volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend [[Adam Buddle]] gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Englebert Kaempfer's volume of Japanese plants and [[James Petiver]]'s virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. [[Mark Catesby]] gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. [[Philip Miller]] gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; de Beer, G. R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; Gray, Basil. "Sloane and the Kaempfer Collection," in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 20–23; and "The Sloane Collection of Manuscripts" in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Eskimos, South America, the Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica.
"These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain [[James Cook]] in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the [[British Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for £20,000. In 1759, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s royal library was added to Sloane’s collection to form the foundation of the British Museum.

[[John Tradescant the elder]] (circa 1570s–1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, [[John Tradescant the younger]] (1608–1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to [[Powhatan]], father of [[Pocahontas]]. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;the [[dodo]] from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;a mermaid's hand, a dragon's egg, two feathers of a phoenix's tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant's Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr"&gt;Ivins, Jr., William M. "The Tradescant Collection", in ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Vol. 20, No. 8 (August 1925), 194–197; Josten, C.H. ''Elias Ashmole (1617–1692): His Autobiographical and Historical Notes, His Correspondence, and Other Contemporary Sources Relating to His Life and Work: Texts, 1661–1672'', (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967); Leith-Ross, Prudence. ''The John Tradescants: Gardeners to the Rose and Lily Queen'', (London: Peter Owen, 2006); MacGregor, Arthur. ''Tradescant's Rarities: Essays on the Foundation of the Ashmolean Museum 1683; with a Catalogue of the Surviving Early Collections'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983); Potter, Jennifer. ''Strange Blooms: The Curious Lives and Adventures of the John Tradescants'', (London: Atlantic, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elias Ashmole]] (1617–1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, [[Freemason]], and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of ''Musaeum Tradescantianum'', a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the [[University of Oxford]], provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection.

Cabinets of Curiosities can now be found at [[Snowshill Manor]] and [[Wallington Hall]].

====Social function====
[[File:17th-Century Cabinet of Curiosities.jpg|thumb|left|Italian Baroque-era cabinet of curiosities, circa 1635.]]
Cabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular curiosities of their curators but as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be "the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic," or the less grandiose, "the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes." Evans goes on to explain that "no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Impey, MacGregor|first1=Oliver, Arthur|title=The Origins of Museums: The Cabinet of Curiosities in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the [[Royal Society]], whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, it is important to note that the Fellows in this period supported the idea of “learned entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/detail.action?docID=10677039&amp;p00=cabinet+curiosities|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions.

Places of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was “a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the [[English Civil War]] and Interregum [sic].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/reader.action?docID=10677039|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which “[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.”&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt; A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as “something much more like a gentleman’s club,&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;” an idea supported by [[John Evelyn]], who depicts the Royal Society as “an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty’s Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;”

===United States===
Thomas Dent Mütter (1811–1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the [[American College of Physicians]] in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The [[Mütter Museum]] began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including [[Benjamin Rush]]'s medical chest and [[Florence Nightingale]]'s sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, [[Joseph Hyrtl]] (1810–1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the "soap lady"; the conjoined liver and death cast of [[Chang and Eng Bunker]], the Siamese twins; and in 1893, [[Grover Cleveland]]'s jaw tumor. The Mütter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304022221/http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundieart.com/cabinet/ |title=James G.

[[P.&amp;nbsp;T. Barnum]] took over [[Barnum's American Museum]] on five floors in New York, "perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs—Barnum's famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, "THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!" at the exit door".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324407504578185622576715416?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_Life%26Culture "Catalog of Curiosities"] by BARRYMORE LAURENCE SCHERER Wall Street Journal. January 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, New York businessmen formed the [[Hobby Club]], a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their "cabinets of wonder" and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and [[incunable]]; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.&lt;ref&gt;According to its constitution, "This Club shall be called THE HOBBY CLUB. The object of the Club shall be to encourage the collection of literary, artistic and scientific works; to aid in the development of literary, artistic and scientific matters; to promote social and literary intercourse among its members, and the discussion and consideration of various literary and economic subjects."[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101060744370 Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912–1920].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
[[Image:My Cabinet o'Curiosities1.jpg|thumb|right|upright||Modern interpretation of a Wunderkammer]]

The Houston Museum of Natural Science houses a hands-on Cabinet of Curiosities, complete with taxidermied crocodile embedded in the ceiling a la Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale. In [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the modern-day [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused.&lt;ref&gt;The American writer Lawrence Weschler, wrote an entire book about the museum: ''Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as [[House on the Rock]], can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], [[Musée Patamécanique]] is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by [['Pataphysics|Pataphysics]]. The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association Wunderkamern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderkammern.net// Wunderkammern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325091444/http://www.wunderkammern.net/ |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how "amazement" is manifested within today's artistic discourse. The May of 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called "Wunder Kammer", the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120918075929/http://www.wunder-kammer.com/ wunder-kamer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several internet bloggers describe their sites as a wunderkammern either because they are primarily made up of links to things that are interesting, or because they inspire wonder in a similar manner to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). The researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as [[YouTube]] as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions "just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehl|first=Robert W.|title=Youtube As Archive: Who Will Curate This Digital Wunderkammer?|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|year=2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=43–60|doi=10.1177/1367877908098854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chromosome microdissection''' is a technique that physically removes a large section of [[DNA]] from a complete [[chromosome]]. The smallest portion of DNA that can be isolated using this method comprises 10 million [[base pair]]s - hundreds or thousands of individual [[gene]]s.

Scientists who study chromosomes are known as [[cytogeneticist]]s. They are able to identify each chromosome based on its unique pattern of dark and light bands. Certain abnormalities, however, cause chromosomes to have unusual banding patterns. For example, one chromosome may have a piece of another chromosome inserted within it, creating extra bands. Or, a portion of a chromosome may be repeated over and over again, resulting in an unusually wide, dark band (known as a [[homogeneously staining region]]). Some chromosomal aberrations have been linked to [[cancer]] and inherited genetic disorders, and the chromosomes of many tumor cells exhibit irregular bands. To understand more about what causes these conditions, scientists hope to determine which genes and DNA sequences are located near these unusual bands. Chromosome microdissection is a specialized way of isolating these regions by removing the DNA from the band and making that DNA available for further study.

To prepare cells for chromosome microdissection, a scientist first treats them with a chemical that forces them into [[metaphase]]: a phase of the cell's life-cycle where the chromosomes are tightly coiled and highly visible. Next, the cells are dropped onto a [[microscope slide]] so that the nucleus, which holds all of the genetic material together, breaks apart and releases the chromosomes onto the slide. Then, under a microscope, the scientist locates the specific band of interest, and, using a very fine needle, tears that band away from the rest of the chromosome. The researcher next produces multiple copies of the isolated DNA using a procedure called [[PCR]] (polymerase chain reaction). The scientist uses these copies to study the DNA from the unusual region of the chromosome in question.

'''Computer-supported collaboration''' ('''CSC''') research focuses on technology that affects groups, organizations, communities and societies, e.g., [[voice mail]] and [[text chat]]. It grew from '''cooperative work''' study of supporting people's work activities and working relationships. As net technology increasingly supported a wide range of recreational and social activities, consumer markets expanded the user base, enabling more and more people to connect online to create what researchers have called a [[CSCW|computer supported cooperative work]], which includes "all contexts in which technology is used to mediate human activities such as communication, coordination, cooperation, competition, entertainment, games, art, and music" (from CSCW 2004).

==Scope of the field==

===Focused on output===
The subfield [[computer-mediated communication]] deals specifically with how humans use "computers" (or [[digital media]]) to form, support and maintain relationships with others (social uses), regulate information flow (instructional uses), and make decisions (including major financial and political ones). It does not focus on common work products or other "[[collaboration]]" but rather on "meeting" itself, and on [[Trust (sociology)|trust]]. By contrast, CSC is focused on the output from, rather than the character or emotional consequences of, meetings or relationships, reflecting the difference between "communication" and "collaboration".

===Focused on contracts and rendezvous===
Unlike communication research, which focuses on trust, or [[computer science]], which focuses on [[truth]] and [[logic]], CSC focuses on [[cooperation]] and [[collaboration]] and [[decision making]] theory, which are more concerned with [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[contract]]. For instance, [[auction]]s and [[market system]]s, which rely on [[bid and ask]] relationships, are studied as part of CSC but not usually as part of communication.

The term CSC emerged in the 1990s to replace the following terms:
* '''workgroup computing''', which emphasizes technology over the work being supported and seems to restrict inquiry to small organizational units.
* '''[[groupware]]''', which became a commercial [[buzzword]] and was used to describe popular commercial products such as Lotus Notes. Check [http://www.enolagaia.com/UMUArchive/CSCWLitGuide.html#CoreLit here] for a comprehensive literature review.
* '''computer supported cooperative work''', which is the name of a conference and which seems only to address research into experimental systems and the nature of workplaces and organizations doing "work", as opposed, say, to play or war.

===Collaboration is not a software===
Two different types of software are sometimes differentiated:
* [[social software]], which produces social ties as its primary output, e.g., a [[social network service]]
* [[collaborative software]], which produces a collaborative deliverable, e.g., an online collaborative encyclopedia like [[Wikipedia]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Base technologies such as [[netnews]], [[email]], [[Online chat|chat]] and [[wiki]]s could be described as "social", "collaborative" or both or neither. Those who say "social" seem to focus on so-called "[[virtual community]]" while those who say "collaborative" seem to be more concerned with [[content management]] and the actual output. While software may be designed to achieve closer social ties or specific deliverables, it is hard to support collaboration without also enabling relationships to form, and hard to support a social interaction without some kind of shared co-authored works. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===May include games===
Accordingly, the differentiation between social and collaborative software may also be stated as that between "play" and "work". Some theorists hold that a play ethic should apply, and that work must become more game-like or play-like in order to make using computers a more comfortable experience.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The study of [[MUD]]s and [[MMRPG]]s in the 1980s and 1990s led many to this conclusion, which is now not controversial. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

True multi-player [[computer game]]s can be considered a simple form of collaboration, but only a few theorists include this as part of CSC.

=== Not just about "computing" ===
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2007}}

The relatively new areas of evolutionary computing, massively parallel algorithms, and even "artificial life" explore the solution of problems by the evolving interaction of large numbers of small actors, or agents, or decision-makers who interact in a largely unconstrained fashion. The "side effect" of the interaction may be a solution of interest, such as a new sorting algorithm; or there may be a permanent residual of the interaction, such as the setting of weights in a neural network that has now been "tuned" or "trained" to repeatedly solve a specific problem, such as making a decision about granting credit to a person, or distinguishing a diseased plant from a healthy one. Connectionism is a study of systems in which the learning is stored in the linkages, or connections, not in what is normally thought of as content.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

This larger definition of "computing", in which not just the data, or the metadata, or the context of the data, but the computer itself is being "processed", makes the term "social computing" have a whole different meaning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Requires protocols===
Communication essential to the collaboration, or disruptive of it, is studied in CSC proper.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} It is somehow hard to find or draw a line between a well-defined process and general human communications.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Reflecting desired [[organization protocol]]s and [[business process]]es and [[governance]] norms directly, so that regulated communication (the collaboration) can be told apart from free-form interactions, is important to collaboration research, if only to know where to stop the study of work and start the study of people. ''The subfield CMC or [[computer-mediated communication]] deals with human relationships.''{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Basic tasks==
Tasks undertaken in this field resemble those of any social science, but with a special focus on [[systems integration]] and [[Group (sociology)|groups]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.acm.org/cscw2004/prog_tutorials.html CSCW 2004 tutorials] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103151319/http://www1.acm.org/cscw2004/prog_tutorials.html |date=November 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less ambitiously, specific CSC fields are often studied under their own names with no reference to the more general field of study, focusing instead on the technology with only minimal attention to the collaboration implied, e.g. [[video game]]s, [[videoconference]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Since some specialized devices exist for games or conferences that do not include all of the usual [[boot image]] capabilities of a true "computer", studying these separately may be justified. There is also separate study of [[e-learning]], [[e-government]], [[e-democracy]] and [[telemedicine]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The subfield [[telework]] also often stands alone.

==History==

===Early research===
The development of this field reaches back to the late 1960s and the visionary assertions of [[Ted Nelson]], [[Douglas Engelbart]], [[Alan Kay]], [[Glenn Gould]], [[Nicholas Negroponte]] and others who saw a potential for [[digital media]] to ultimately redefine how we work. A very early thinker, [[Vannevar Bush]], even suggested in 1945 ''[[As We May Think]].''

====Numbers====
The inventor of the computer "mouse", [[Douglas Engelbart]], studied [[collaborative software]] (especially [[revision control]] in [[computer-aided software engineering]] and the way a [[graphic user interface]] could enable interpersonal communication) in the 1960s. [[Alan Kay]] worked on [[Smalltalk]], which embodied these principles, in the 1970s, and by the 1980s it was well regarded and considered to represent the future of user interfaces.

However, at this time, collaboration capabilities were limited. As few computers had even [[local area network]]s, and processors were slow and expensive, the idea of using them simply to accelerate and "augment" human communication was eccentric in many situations. Computers processed numbers, not text, and the collaboration was in general devoted only to better and more accurate handling of numbers.

====Text====
This began to change in the 1980s with the rise of [[personal computer]]s, [[modem]]s and more general use of the [[Internet]] for non-academic purposes. People were clearly collaborating online with all sorts of motives, but using a small suite of tools ([[LISTSERV]], [[netnews]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[MUD]]) to support all of those motives. Research at this time focused on textual communication, as there was little or no exchange of audio and video representations. Some researchers, such as [[Brenda Laurel]], emphasized how similar online [[dialogue]] was to a [[Play (theatre)|play]], and applied [[Aristotle]]'s model of [[drama]] to their analysis of computers for collaboration.

Another major focus was [[hypertext]]&amp;mdash;in its pre-[[HTML]], pre-[[WWW]] form, focused more on links and [[semantic web]] applications than on graphics. Such systems as [[Superbook]], [[NoteCards]], [[Knowledge Management System|KMS]] and the much simpler [[HyperTies]] and [[HyperCard]] were early examples of [[collaborative software]] used for [[e-learning]].

====Audio====
In the 1990s, the rise of [[broadband]] networks and the [[dotcom boom]] presented the internet as mass media to a whole generation. By the late 1990s, [[VoIP]] and [[net phone]]s and chat had emerged. For the first time, people used computers ''primarily'' as communications, not "computing" devices. This, however, had long been anticipated, predicted, and studied by experts in the field.

Video collaboration is not usually studied. Online videoconferencing and [[webcam]]s have been studied in small scale use for decades but since people simply do not have built-in facilities to create video together directly, they are properly a communication, not collaboration, concern.

===Pioneers===
Other pioneers in the field included [[Ted Nelson]], [[Austin Henderson]], [[Kjeld Schmidt]], [[Lucy Suchman]], [[Sara Bly]], [[Randy Farmer]], and many "[[economics|economist]]s, [[social psychology|social psychologist]]s, [[anthropology|anthropologist]]s, [[organization theory|organizational theorist]]s, [[education|educator]]s, and anyone else who can shed light on group activity." - Grudin.

===Politics and business===
In this century, the focus has shifted to [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[management science]] and other [[business]] disciplines. This reflects the use of the net in politics and business and even other high-stakes collaboration situations, such as war.

===War===
Though it is not studied at the ACM conferences, military use of [[collaborative software]] has been a very major impetus of work on [[map]]s and [[data fusion]], used in [[military intelligence]]. A number of conferences and journals are concerned primarily with the military use of digital media and the security implications thereof.

==Current research==
Current research in computer-supported collaboration includes:

===Speech recognition===
{{see also|Speech recognition}}
Early researchers, such as [[Bill Buxton]], had focused on non-voice gestures (like [[humming]] or [[whistling]]) as a way to communicate with the machine while not interfering too directly with speech directed at a person. Some researchers believed [[voice command device|voice as command]] interfaces were bad for this reason, because they encouraged speaking as if to a "slave".

===Link semantics===

HTML supports simple link types with the REL tag and REV tag. Some standards for using these on the [[WWW]] were proposed, most notably in 1994, by people very familiar with earlier work in [[SGML]]. However, no such scheme has ever been adopted by a large number of web users, and the "[[semantic web]]" remains unrealized. Attempts such as [[crit.org]] have sometimes collapsed totally.

===Identity and privacy===
Who am I, online? Can an account be assumed to be the same as a person's real-life identity? Should I have rights to continue any relationship I start through a service, even if I'm not using it any longer? Who owns information about the user? What about others (not the user) who are affected by information revealed or learned by me?

[[Digital identity|Online identity]] and [[privacy]] concerns, especially [[identity theft]], have grown to dominate the CSCW agenda in more recent years. The separate [[Computers, Freedom and Privacy]] conferences deal with larger social questions, but basic concerns that apply to systems and work process design tend still to be discussed as part of CSC research.

===Online decision making===
Where decisions are made based exclusively or mostly on information received or exchanged online, how do people rendezvous to signal their trust in it, and willingness to make major decisions on it?

Team [[consensus decision making]] in [[software engineering]], and the role of [[revision control]], [[Reversion (software development)|revert]], [[reputation]] and other functions, has always been a major focus of CSC: There is no software without someone writing it. Presumably, those who do write it must understand something about collaboration in their own team. This design and code, however, is only one form of collaborative content.

===Collaborative content===
What are the most efficient and effective ways to share information? Can creative networks form through online meeting/work systems? Can people have [[equal power relationship]]s in building content?

By the late 1990s, with the rise of [[wiki]]s (a simple repository and [[data dictionary]] that was easy for the public to use), the way [[consensus]] applied to joint editing, meeting agendas and so on had become a major concern. Different wikis adopted different social and pseudopolitical structures to combat the problems caused by conflicting points of view and differing opinions on content.]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===[[Workflow]]===
How can work be made simpler, less prone to error, easier to learn? What role do diagrams and notations play in improving work output? What words do workers come to work already understanding, what do they misunderstand, and how can we get them using the same words to mean the same thing?

Study of [[content management]], [[enterprise taxonomy]] and the other core [[instructional capital]] of the [[learning organization]] has become increasingly important due to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards and the use of [[continuous improvement]] methods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}
Natural language and application commands tend to converge over time, becoming reflexive user interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Telework and human capital management===
Where are the workers? Do we care? How do we coordinate them? How do we hire them, fire them, help them find the right thing to do next?

The role of [[social network analysis]] and [[outsourcing]] services like e-lance, especially when combined in services like [[LinkedIn]], is of particular concern in [[human capital]] management&amp;mdash;again, especially in the software industry, where it is becoming more and more normal to run 24x7 globally distributed shops.

From a pure engineering perspective there is no difference between designing a regular sewage system and a condominial one. However, bureaucratically a condominial system includes the participation of the individuals and owners who will be served and can often result in lower costs due to shorter runs of piping.&lt;ref name="Caesb-DF" /&gt; This is achieved by local concentration of sewage from a single "housing block". Thus a number of dwellings are grouped into a "block" known as a condominium. The condominium may share no other aspects of ownership or relation except geographic proximity. In addition, individuals and owners may share a role in the maintenance of the sewers at the block level.&lt;ref name=TheHindu/&gt;

A '''conjectural portrait''' is a [[portrait]] made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.  The depiction, then, may be variously informed by [[primary source|written accounts]] of [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]], conjecture based on the subject's culture and background, and/or the artist's conception of the subject's [[Moral character|inner essence]].

==Iconic portraits==
Certain conjectural portraits have become [[iconography|iconic]] of their subjects, and are widely recognizable as such, with few being aware that they are not authentic portraits.  For example, portraits of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Joan of Arc]] are widely recognized.

A '''defoliant''' is any [[Herbicide|herbicidal]] chemical sprayed or dusted on plants to cause their [[Leaf|leaves]] to fall off. Defoliants are widely used for the selective removal of weeds in managing croplands and lawns. Worldwide use of defoliants, along with the development of other herbicides and [[Pesticide|pesticides]], allowed for the [[Green Revolution]], an increase in agricultural production in mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invention of Ecocide|last=Zierler|first=David|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2011|isbn=9786613110404|location=Athens, Georgia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoliants have also been used in warfare as a means to deprive an enemy of food crops and/or hiding cover, most notably by the [[United States]] [[Agent Orange|in the Vietnam War]].

== Use and application ==
A primary application of defoliants is the selective killing of plants. Two of the oldest chemical [[Herbicide|herbicides]] used as defoliants are [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T). 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are absorbed by broad-leafed plants, killing them by causing excessive hormonal growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These [[Phenoxy herbicide|phenoxy herbicides]] were designed to selectively kill weeds and unwanted plants in croplands. They were first introduced at the beginning of [[World War II]] and became widespread in use in agriculture following the end of the War.

Defoliants have a practical use in the harvesting of certain crops, particularly [[cotton]], in the [[United States]] as well as a number of other cotton-producing countries. The use of defoliants aids in the effective harvesting of cotton and finer lint quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snipes|first=Charles E.|last2=Cathey|first2=George W.|date=1992|title=Evaluation of defoliant mixtures in cotton|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378429092900185|journal=Field Crops Research|volume=28|issue=4|pages=327–334|doi=10.1016/0378-4290(92)90018-5|issn=0378-4290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of defoliant use in cotton harvesting depends on the type of defoliant(s) used, the number of applications, the amount applied, and environmental variables. Common harvest-aiding chemical defoliants include tribufos, dimethipin, and [[thidiazuron]]. According to a 1998 report by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] (NASS), tribufos and thidiazuron accounted for 60% of crop area that was treated by defoliants during that crop year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Thomas L.|last2=Marti|first2=Luz|last3=Belflower|first3=Sally|last4=Truman|first4=Clint C.|date=2000|title=Multiresidue Analysis of Cotton Defoliant, Herbicide, and Insecticide Residues in Water by Solid-Phase Extraction and GC−NPD, GC−MS, and HPLC−Diode Array Detection|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf9909104|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=4103–4108|doi=10.1021/jf9909104|issn=0021-8561|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASS (1999). ''Agricultural Chemical Usage 1998 Field Crops Summary''. Washington, D.C.: U. S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics and Economic Research Service. pg 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health and environmental effects ==
In 1998, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (U.S. EPA) concluded that the use of agricultural defoliants led to increased risks of water contamination and dangers to freshwater and [[marine life]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; High doses of tribufos were labeled as a possible [[carcinogen]] and a toxin to freshwater and marine [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]]. Dimethipin has also been labeled as a possible human carcinogen.

A published study in the ''Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry'' reported that through successive [[surface runoff]] events in defoliated cotton fields, defoliant concentrations decreased exponentially within the test area and could negatively affect marine life in the runoff zones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Image:Amazon-river-delta-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|The [[Amazon river]] delta showing no clouds above river waters because water is not a diathermanous fluid.]]
'''Diathermancy''' (from "dia" ''through'' and "thermē" ''heat'') is the property of some fluids that allows rays of light through them without itself being heated. A diathermanous fluid is thus "[[Permeation|permeable]]" by heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?diathermanous]&lt;/ref&gt;). Diathermancy was first described by German physicist and chemist [[Heinrich Magnus]] in the 1800s (&lt;ref&gt;Magnus wrote initially four papers on Diathermancy [http://www.archive.org/stream/catalogueofscien04roya#page/184/mode/1up])&lt;/ref&gt;). Atmospheric air ''is'' diathermanous; therefore, air is not heated by sunshine, but by long wave heat reflected by soil, and especially, by water on the Earth's surface. Water, on the contrary, ''is not'' diathermanous, and it is heated directly by sunshine.
==Atmospheric heating from oceanic waters==
[[File:Nepac sst oper0-Temp-sup-Oc-Pacífico-16-sep-2013.png|thumb|left|350 px|Northeastern Pacific Ocean Surface Water Temperature]]
Atmospheric heat comes from long wave radiation from the soil and, mostly, from the water surface (oceans, lakes, rivers), since water is a not diathermanous body and covers three quarters of Earth's surface. Diathermancy cause [[Subsidence (atmosphere)|subsidence]] on damp or water surfaces. That is because these areas tend to absorb heat radiation directly from the Sun but very slowly and also emits this radiation to the atmosphere very slowly. Therefore, cold ocean currents have very clear skies, without clouds, because subsidence from cold and heavy air avoids or limits [[convection]] since they are opposite processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60541">{{short description|Hypothesis that living organisms interact with their surroundings in a self-regulating system}}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|The study of planetary habitability is partly based upon extrapolation from knowledge of the [[Earth]]'s conditions, as the Earth is the only planet currently known to harbour life.]]

The '''Gaia hypothesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|ˈ|ʌ}}), also known as the '''Gaia theory''' or the '''Gaia principle''', proposes that living [[organism]]s interact with their [[inorganic]] surroundings on [[Earth]] to form a [[synergistic]] and [[Homeostasis|self-regulating]], [[complex system]] that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for [[life]] on the planet.

The hypothesis was formulated by the chemist [[James Lovelock]]&lt;ref name="J1972" /&gt; and co-developed by the microbiologist [[Lynn Margulis]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lovelock1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovelock|first1=J.E.|last2=Margulis|first2=L.|title=Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the Gaia hypothesis|journal=Tellus|date=1974|volume=26|series=Series A|issue=1–2|pages=2–10|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x|url=http://tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/9731|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=International Meteorological Institute|location=Stockholm|issn=1600-0870|ref=harv|bibcode=1974Tell...26....2L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock named the idea after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the primordial goddess who personified the Earth in [[Greek mythology]]. In 2006, the [[Geological Society of London]] awarded Lovelock the [[Wollaston Medal]] in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wollaston Award Lovelock|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/About/History/Awards-Citations-Replies-2001-Onwards/2006-Awards-Citations-Replies|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics related to the hypothesis include how the [[biosphere]] and the [[evolution]] of organisms affect the stability of [[global temperature]], [[salinity]] of [[seawater]], [[atmospheric oxygen]] levels, the maintenance of a [[hydrosphere]] of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the [[habitability of Earth]].

The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being [[teleological]] and against the principles of [[natural selection]], but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as [[Earth system science]], [[biogeochemistry]] and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartzman2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartzman, David |title=Life, Temperature, and the Earth: The Self-Organizing Biosphere |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2002 |isbn=0-231-10213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, John (1990), "Hothouse earth: The greenhouse effect and Gaia" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock also once described the "geophysiology" of the Earth.&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"&gt;Lovelock, James, (1995) "The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth" (W.W.Norton &amp; Co)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=December 2017}} Even so, the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism, and today some scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by, or at odds with, the available evidence.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Kirchner |first = James W. |title =Toward a future for Gaia theory |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |volume = 52 |pages = 391–408 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014237331082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Volk |first = Tyler |title =The Gaia hypothesis: fact, theory, and wishful thinking |journal = Climatic Change |volume = 52 |pages = 423–430 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014218227825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beerling2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Gaian hypotheses suggest that organisms [[Co-evolution|co-evolve]] with their environment: that is, they "influence their [[abiotic]] environment, and that environment in turn influences the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] by [[Darwinism|Darwinian process]]". Lovelock (1995) gave evidence of this in his second book, showing the evolution from the world of the early [[Bacteria|thermo-acido-philic]] and [[methanogenic bacteria]] towards the oxygen-enriched [[atmosphere]] today that supports more [[Phanerozoic|complex life]].

A reduced version of the hypothesis has been called "influential Gaia"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapenis|first=Andrei G.|year=2002|title=Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?|url=|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=54 |issue=3|pages=379–391|via=[Peer Reviewed Journal]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in "Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?" by Andrei G. Lapenis, which states the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. [[temperature]] and atmosphere.  This is not the work of an individual but a collective of Russian scientific research that was combined into this peer reviewed publication. It states the coevolution of life and the environment through “micro-forces”&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and biogeochemical processes. An example is how the activity of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bacteria during Precambrian times have completely modified the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth atmosphere]] to turn it aerobic, and as such supporting evolution of life (in particular [[eukaryotic]] life).

Since barriers existed throughout the Twentieth Century between Russia and the rest of the world, it is only relatively recently that the early Russian scientists who introduced concepts overlapping the Gaia hypothesis have become better known to the Western scientific community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These scientists include:
# [[Piotr Kropotkin|Piotr Alekseevich Kropotkin]] (1842–1921)
# Rafail Vasil’evich Rizpolozhensky (1847–1918)
# [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] (1863–1945)
# Vladimir Alexandrovich Kostitzin (1886–1963)

Biologists and Earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected [[emergent property]] or [[entelechy]] of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions may have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes reference examples of events that resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a [[reducing environment]] to an [[oxygen]]-rich one at the end of the [[Archean|Archaean]] and the beginning of the [[Proterozoic]] periods.

Less accepted versions of the hypothesis claim that changes in the biosphere are brought about through the [[Superorganism|coordination of living organisms]] and maintain those conditions through [[homeostasis]]. In some versions of [[Gaia philosophy]], all lifeforms are considered part of one single living planetary being called ''Gaia''. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the [[Coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The Gaia hypothesis was an influence on the [[deep ecology]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth is a self-regulating [[complex system]] involving the [[biosphere]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]]s and the [[pedosphere]], tightly coupled as an evolving system. The hypothesis contends that this system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 255. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia evolves through a [[Cybernetic#In biology|cybernetic]] [[feedback]] system operated unconsciously by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability in a full homeostasis. Many processes in the Earth's surface essential for the conditions of life depend on the interaction of living forms, especially [[microorganisms]], with inorganic elements. These processes establish a global control system that regulates Earth's [[Sea surface temperature|surface temperature]], [[atmosphere composition]] and [[ocean]] [[salinity]], powered by the global thermodynamic disequilibrium state of the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;Kleidon, Axel. ''How does the earth system generate and maintain thermodynamic disequilibrium and what does it imply for the future of the planet?''. Article submitted to the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' on Thu, 10 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Article submitted to Royal Society is not a valid reference. This must be replaced by actual article citation if accepted, or an alternative reference --&gt;

The existence of a planetary homeostasis influenced by living forms had been observed previously in the field of [[biogeochemistry]], and it is being investigated also in other fields like [[Earth system science]]. The originality of the Gaia hypothesis relies on the assessment that such homeostatic balance is actively pursued with the goal of keeping the optimal conditions for life, even when terrestrial or external events menace them.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 179. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of global surface temperature===
[[File:All palaeotemps.png|thumb|Rob Rohde's palaeotemperature graphs]]
{{See also|Paleoclimatology}}
Since life started on Earth, the energy provided by the [[Sun]] has increased by 25% to 30%;&lt;ref name="Owen1979"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owen, T. | author2 = Cess, R.D. | author3 = Ramanathan, V. | date = 1979 | title = Earth: An enhanced carbon dioxide greenhouse to compensate for reduced solar luminosity | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 277 | pages = 640–2 | doi = 10.1038/277640a0 | issue=5698 | bibcode = 1979Natur.277..640O | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the surface temperature of the planet has remained within the levels of habitability, reaching quite regular low and high margins.  Lovelock has also hypothesised that methanogens produced elevated levels of methane in the early atmosphere, giving a view similar to that found in petrochemical smog, similar in some respects to the atmosphere on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"/&gt; This, he suggests tended to screen out ultraviolet until the formation of the ozone screen, maintaining a degree of homeostasis.  However, the [[Snowball Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, P.F. 2001. [http://www.snowballearth.org ''Snowball Earth theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; research has suggested that "oxygen shocks" and reduced methane levels led, during the [[Huronian]], [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]]/[[Cryogenian|Varanger]] Ice Ages, to a world that very nearly became a solid "snowball". These epochs are evidence against the ability of the pre [[Phanerozoic]] biosphere to fully self-regulate.

Processing of the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, explained below, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the Earth temperature within the limits of habitability.

The [[CLAW hypothesis]], inspired by the Gaia hypothesis, proposes a [[feedback|feedback loop]] that operates between [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]]s and the [[Earth]]'s [[climate]].&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R. J.]], [[James Lovelock|Lovelock, J. E]], Andreae, M. O. and Warren, S.

Currently the increase in human population and the environmental impact of their activities, such as the multiplication of [[greenhouse gases]] may cause [[negative feedback]]s in the environment to become [[positive feedback]]. Lovelock has stated that this could bring an [[James Lovelock#The revenge of Gaia|extremely accelerated global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he has since stated the effects will likely occur more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock J., NBC News.

====Daisyworld simulations====
[[File:StandardDaisyWorldRun2color.gif|thumb|Plots from a standard black &amp; white [[Daisyworld]] simulation]]
{{Main|Daisyworld}}
James Lovelock and [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] developed the mathematical model [[Daisyworld]], in which temperature regulation arises from a simple ecosystem consisting of two species whose activity varies in response to the planet's environment. The model demonstrates that beneficial feedback mechanisms can emerge in this "toy world" containing only self-interested organisms rather than through classic [[group selection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisyworld examines the [[Earth's energy budget|energy budget]] of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies. The colour of the daisies influences the [[albedo]] of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. As the model runs the output of the "sun" increases, meaning that the surface temperature of an uninhabited "gray" planet will steadily rise. In contrast, on Daisyworld competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a shifting balance of daisy populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.

It has been suggested that the results were predictable because Lovelock and Watson selected examples that produced the responses they desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023494111532 | date = 2003 | last1 = Kirchner | first1 = James W. | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 58 |issue=1–2| pages = 21–45 |title=The Gaia Hypothesis: Conjectures and Refutations | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of oceanic salinity===

The constant ocean salinity was a long-standing mystery, because no process counterbalancing the salt influx from rivers was known.

However, the composition of seawater is far from equilibrium, and it is difficult to explain this fact without the influence of organic processes. One suggested explanation lies in the formation of salt plains throughout Earth's history. It is hypothesized that these are created by bacterial colonies that fix ions and heavy metals during their life processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the biogeochemical processes of the earth, sources and sinks are the movement of elements. The composition of salt ions within our oceans and seas are: sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), chlorine (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), Magnesium (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  The elements that comprise salinity do not readily change and are a conservative property of seawater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are many mechanisms that change salinity from a particulate form to a dissolved form and back. The known sources of sodium i.e. salts is when weathering, erosion, and dissolution of rocks transport into rivers and deposit into the oceans.

The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth's [[Atmospheric chemistry#Atmospheric composition|atmospheric composition]] is kept at a dynamically steady state by the presence of life.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 163. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheric composition provides the conditions that contemporary life has adapted to. All the atmospheric gases other than [[noble gas]]es present in the atmosphere are either made by organisms or processed by them.

The stability of the atmosphere in Earth is not a consequence of [[chemical equilibrium]]. [[Oxygen]] is a reactive compound, and should eventually combine with gases and minerals of the Earth's atmosphere and crust.  Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=Anabar2007&gt;{{Cite journal| last4 = Arnold| last6 = Creaser| last3 = Lyons| first1 = A. | first2 = Y.| last9 = Scott| last2 = Duan | first3 = T. | first4 = G.| last8 = Gordon | first5 = B. | first10 = J. | first6 = R.| last10 = Garvin | first7 = A.| last11 = Buick | first8 = G. | first11 = R. | first9 = C.| title = A whiff of oxygen before the great oxidation event?| journal = Science| volume = 317| issue = 5846| year = 2007| last7 = Kaufman| pages = 1903–1906| last5 = Kendall| pmid = 17901330| last1 = Anbar | doi = 10.1126/science.1140325|bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1903A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of the [[Cambrian]] period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume.&lt;ref name=Berner1999&gt;{{Cite journal

===Processing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{See also|Carbon cycle}}
Gaia scientists see the participation of living organisms in the [[carbon cycle]] as one of the complex processes that maintain conditions suitable for life. The only significant natural source of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]] ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is [[volcanic activity]], while the only significant removal is through the precipitation of [[carbonate rocks]].&lt;ref name="Karhu1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karhu, J.A. | author2 = Holland, H.D. | date = 1 October 1996 | title = Carbon isotopes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen | journal = [[Geology (journal)|Geology]] | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 867–870 | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/10/867 | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0867:CIATRO&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1996Geo....24..867K | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon precipitation, solution and [[Carbon fixation|fixation]] are influenced by the [[bacteria]] and plant roots in soils, where they improve gaseous circulation, or in coral reefs, where calcium carbonate is deposited as a solid on the sea floor. Calcium carbonate is used by living organisms to manufacture carbonaceous tests and shells. Once dead, the living organisms' shells fall to the bottom of the oceans where they generate deposits of chalk and limestone.

One of these organisms is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'', an abundant [[coccolithophore]] [[algae]] which also has a role in the formation of [[cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excess is compensated by an increase of coccolithophoride life, increasing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; locked in the ocean floor. Coccolithophorides increase the cloud cover, hence control the surface temperature, help cool the whole planet and favor precipitations necessary for terrestrial plants.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Lately the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration has increased and there is some evidence that concentrations of ocean [[algal bloom]]s are also increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date = 12 September 2007 | title = Interagency Report Says Harmful Algal Blooms Increasing | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209234239/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | archivedate = 9 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lichen]] and other organisms accelerate the [[weathering]] of rocks in the surface, while the decomposition of rocks also happens faster in the soil, thanks to the activity of roots, fungi, bacteria and subterranean animals. The flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the soil is therefore regulated with the help of living beings. When CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels rise in the atmosphere the temperature increases and plants grow. This growth brings higher consumption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the plants, who process it into the soil, removing it from the atmosphere.

==History==

===Precedents===
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'' taken from [[Apollo 8]] on December 24, 1968]]
The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The [[Gaia (mythology)|mythical Gaia]] was the primal Greek goddess personifying the [[Earth]], the Greek version of "[[Mother Nature]]" (from Ge = Earth, and Aia = 
[[PIE]] grandmother), or the [[Earth Mother]]. James Lovelock gave this name to his hypothesis after a suggestion from the novelist [[William Golding]], who was living in the same village as Lovelock at the time ([[Bowerchalke]], [[Wiltshire]], UK). Golding's advice was based on Gea, an alternative spelling for the name of the Greek goddess, which is used as prefix in geology, geophysics and geochemistry.&lt;ref name=vanish09 /&gt; Golding later made reference to Gaia in his [[Nobel prize]] acceptance speech.

In the eighteenth century, as [[geology]] consolidated as a modern science, [[James Hutton]] maintained that geological and biological processes are interlinked.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |title=The web of life: a new scientific understanding of living systems |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y |date=1996 |page=23|isbn=0-385-47675-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[naturalist]] and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] recognized the coevolution of living organisms, climate, and Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb /&gt; In the twentieth century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] formulated a theory of Earth's development that is now one of the foundations of ecology. Vernadsky was a Ukrainian [[geochemist]] and was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planet as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was a pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.&lt;ref&gt;S.R. Weart, 2003, ''The Discovery of Global Warming'', Cambridge, Harvard Press&lt;/ref&gt; His visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West, and some decades later the Gaia hypothesis received the same type of initial resistance from the scientific community.

Also in the turn to the 20th century [[Aldo Leopold]], pioneer in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for [[wilderness]] conservation, suggested a living Earth in his biocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.

{{quotation|It is at least not impossible to regard the earth's parts—soil, mountains, rivers, atmosphere etc,—as organs or parts of organs of a coordinated whole, each part with its definite function. And if we could see this whole, as a whole, through a great period of time, we might perceive not only organs with coordinated functions, but possibly also that process of consumption as replacement which in biology we call metabolism, or growth. In such case we would have all the visible attributes of a living thing, which we do not realize to be such because it is too big, and its life processes too slow.| Aldo Leopold | ''Animate Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Stephan.

Another influence for the Gaia hypothesis and the [[environmental movement]] in general came as a side effect of the [[Space Race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. During the 1960s, the first humans in space could see how the Earth looked as a whole. The photograph ''[[Earthrise]]'' taken by astronaut [[William Anders]] in 1968 during the [[Apollo 8]] mission became, through the [[Overview Effect]] an early symbol for the global ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm11.html 100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation of the hypothesis===
[[File:James Lovelock in 2005.jpg|thumb|[[James Lovelock]], 2005]]
Lovelock started defining the idea of a self-regulating Earth controlled by the community of living organisms in September 1965, while working at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in California on methods of detecting [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovelock, J.E. | date = 1965 | title = A physical basis for life detection experiments | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 207 | issue = 7 | pages = 568–570 | doi = 10.1038/207568a0 | pmid=5883628|bibcode = 1965Natur.207..568L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameslovelock.org/page4.html Geophysiology]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first paper to mention it was ''Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other Changes Associated with the Presence of Life'', co-authored with C.E. Giffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Lovelock, J.E. | author2 = Giffin, C.E. | date = 1969 | title = Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other changes associated with the presence of Life | journal = Advances in the Astronautical Sciences | volume = 25 | pages = 179–193 | isbn = 0-87703-028-6 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main concept was that life could be detected in a planetary scale by the chemical composition of the atmosphere. According to the data gathered by the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Pic du Midi observatory]], planets like Mars or Venus had atmospheres in [[chemical equilibrium]]. This difference with the Earth atmosphere was considered to be a proof that there was no life in these planets.

Lovelock formulated the ''Gaia Hypothesis'' in journal articles in 1972&lt;ref name="J1972"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Gaia as seen through the atmosphere | date = 1972 | journal = [[Atmospheric Environment]] | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 579–580 | doi = 10.1016/0004-6981(72)90076-5 | ref = harv|bibcode = 1972AtmEn...6..579L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974,&lt;ref name="lovelock1974" /&gt; followed by a popularizing 1979 book ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth''. An article in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' of February 6, 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, John and Sidney Epton, (February 8, 1975). "The quest for Gaia". [https://books.google.com/books?id=pnV6UYEkU4YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false New Scientist], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; and a popular book length version of the hypothesis, published in 1979 as ''The Quest for Gaia'', began to attract scientific and critical attention.

Lovelock called it first the Earth feedback hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"&gt;{{harvnb|Lovelock, James|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a way to explain the fact that combinations of chemicals including [[oxygen]] and [[methane]] persist in stable concentrations in the atmosphere of the Earth. Lovelock suggested detecting such combinations in other planets' atmospheres as a relatively reliable and cheap way to detect life.

[[File:Lynn Margulis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lynn Margulis]]]]

Later, other relationships such as sea creatures producing sulfur and iodine in approximately the same quantities as required by land creatures emerged and helped bolster the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=W.D. | last1=Hamilton | first2=T.M. | last2=Lenton | title=Spora and Gaia: how microbes fly with their clouds | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=10 | pages=1–16 | date=1998 | issue=1 | url=http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | format=PDF | doi=10.1080/08927014.1998.9522867 | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055017/http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | archivedate=2011-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[microbiologist]] Dr. [[Lynn Margulis]] joined Lovelock in the effort of fleshing out the initial hypothesis into scientifically proven concepts, contributing her knowledge about how microbes affect the atmosphere and the different layers in the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Turney, Jon |title=Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life |publisher=Icon Books |location=UK |date=2003 |isbn=1-84046-458-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American biologist had also awakened criticism from the scientific community with her theory on the origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[organelle]]s and her contributions to the [[endosymbiotic theory]], nowadays accepted. Margulis dedicated the last of eight chapters in her book, ''The Symbiotic Planet'', to Gaia. However, she objected to the widespread personification of Gaia and stressed that Gaia is "not an organism", but "an emergent property of interaction among organisms". She defined Gaia as "the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the Earth's surface. Period". The book's most memorable "slogan" was actually quipped by a student of Margulis': "Gaia is just symbiosis as seen from space".

James Lovelock called his first proposal the ''Gaia hypothesis'' but has also used the term ''Gaia theory''. Lovelock states that the initial formulation was based on observation, but still lacked a scientific explanation. The Gaia hypothesis has since been supported by a number of scientific experiments&lt;ref name="J1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Hands up for the Gaia hypothesis | date = 1990 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 344 | issue = 6262 | pages = 100–2 | doi = 10.1038/344100a0|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..100L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a number of useful predictions.&lt;ref name="Volk2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Volk, Tyler |title=Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |date=2003 |isbn=0-262-72042-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wider research proved the original hypothesis wrong, in the sense that it is not life alone but the whole Earth system that does the regulating.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"/&gt;

===First Gaia conference===
In 1985, the first public symposium on the Gaia hypothesis, ''Is The Earth A Living Organism?'' was held at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], August 1–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joseph |first=Lawrence E. |title=Britain's Whole Earth Guru |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=November 23, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/23/magazine/britain-s-whole-earth-guru.html |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal sponsor was the [[National Audubon Society]]. Speakers included James Lovelock, [[George Wald]], [[Mary Catherine Bateson]], [[Lewis Thomas]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Donald Michael, [[Christopher Bird]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[David Abram]], [[Michael A. Cohen|Michael Cohen]], and William Fields. Some 500 people attended.&lt;ref&gt;Bunyard, Peter (1996), "Gaia in Action: Science of the Living Earth" (Floris Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Gaia conference===
In 1988, [[climatology|climatologist]] [[Stephen Schneider]] organised a conference of the [[American Geophysical Union]]. The first Chapman Conference on Gaia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; was held in San Diego, California on March 7, 1988.

During the "philosophical foundations" session of the conference, [[David Abram]] spoke on the influence of metaphor in science, and of the Gaia hypothesis as offering a new and potentially game-changing metaphorics, while [[James Kirchner]] criticised the Gaia hypothesis for its imprecision. Kirchner claimed that Lovelock and Margulis had not presented one Gaia hypothesis, but four -

* [[Coevolution|CoEvolutionary]] Gaia: that life and the environment had evolved in a coupled way. Kirchner claimed that this was already accepted scientifically and was not new.
* [[Homeostatic]] Gaia: that life maintained the stability of the natural environment, and that this stability enabled life to continue to exist.
* [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] Gaia: that the Gaia hypothesis generated interest in geophysical cycles and therefore led to interesting new research in terrestrial geophysical dynamics.
* Optimising Gaia: that Gaia shaped the planet in a way that made it an optimal environment for life as a whole. Kirchner claimed that this was not testable and therefore was not scientific.

Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner recognised two alternatives. "Weak Gaia" asserted that life tends to make the environment stable for the flourishing of all life. "Strong Gaia" according to Kirchner, asserted that life tends to make the environment stable, ''to enable'' the flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1989RvGeo..27..223K | doi = 10.1029/RG027i002p00223 | title=The Gaia hypothesis: Can it be tested? | date=1989 | last1=Kirchner | first1=James W. | journal=Reviews of Geophysics | volume=27 | issue=2 | pages=223 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock and other Gaia-supporting scientists, however, did attempt to disprove the claim that the hypothesis is not scientific because it is impossible to test it by controlled experiment. For example, against the charge that Gaia was teleological, Lovelock and Andrew Watson offered the [[Daisyworld]] Model (and its modifications, above) as evidence against most of these criticisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"/&gt;  Lovelock said that the Daisyworld model "demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10968941 | date=2000 | last1=Lenton | first1=TM | last2=Lovelock | first2=JE | title=Daisyworld is Darwinian: Constraints on adaptation are important for planetary self-regulation | volume=206 | issue=1 | pages=109–14 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2105 | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock was careful to present a version of the Gaia hypothesis that had no claim that Gaia intentionally or consciously maintained the complex balance in her environment that life needed to survive. It would appear that the claim that Gaia acts "intentionally" was a metaphoric statement in his popular initial book and was not meant to be taken literally. This new statement of the Gaia hypothesis was more acceptable to the scientific community. Most accusations of [[teleology|teleologism]] ceased, following this conference.

===Third Gaia conference===
By the time of the 2nd Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis, held at Valencia, Spain, on 23 June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simón|first=Federico|title=GEOLOGÍA Enfoque multidisciplinar La hipótesis Gaia madura en Valencia con los últimos avances científicos|journal=El País|date=21 June 2000|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2000/06/21/futuro/961538404_850215.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the situation had changed significantly. Rather than a discussion of the Gaian teleological views, or "types" of Gaia hypotheses, the focus was upon the specific mechanisms by which basic short term homeostasis was maintained within a framework of significant evolutionary long term structural change.

The major questions were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis University of Valencia Valencia, Spain June 19-23, 2000 (Monday through Friday) |url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/chapman/chapman_archive/cc00bcall.html |work=AGU Meetings |accessdate=7 January 2017 |author=American Geophysical Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "How has the global biogeochemical/climate system called Gaia changed in time? What is its history? Can Gaia maintain stability of the system at one time scale but still undergo vectorial change at longer time scales? How can the geologic record be used to examine these questions?"
# "What is the structure of Gaia? Are the feedbacks sufficiently strong to influence the evolution of climate? Are there parts of the system determined pragmatically by whatever disciplinary study is being undertaken at any given time or are there a set of parts that should be taken as most true for understanding Gaia as containing evolving organisms over time? What are the feedbacks among these different parts of the Gaian system, and what does the near closure of matter mean for the structure of Gaia as a global ecosystem and for the productivity of life?"
# "How do models of Gaian processes and phenomena relate to reality and how do they help address and understand Gaia? How do results from Daisyworld transfer to the real world? What are the main candidates for "daisies"? Does it matter for Gaia theory whether we find daisies or not? How should we be searching for daisies, and should we intensify the search? How can Gaian mechanisms be investigated using process models or global models of the climate system that include the biota and allow for chemical cycling?"

In 1997, Tyler Volk argued that a Gaian system is almost inevitably produced as a result of an evolution towards far-from-equilibrium homeostatic states that maximise [[entropy]] production, and Kleidon (2004) agreed stating: "...homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo"; "...the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis". Staley (2002) has similarly proposed "...an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles... In [this] new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics, not Darwinian selection. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions".

===Fourth Gaia conference===
A fourth international conference on the Gaia hypothesis, sponsored by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and others, was held in October 2006 at the Arlington, VA campus of George Mason University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaia Theory Conference at George Mason University Law School|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/Communications/PressReleases/page7530.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2013|author=Official Site of Arlington County Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ogle, Chief Naturalist, for NVRPA, and long-time Gaia hypothesis proponent, organized the event.  Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and long-time advocate of the Gaia hypothesis, was a keynote speaker. Among many other speakers: Tyler Volk, Co-director of the Program in Earth and Environmental Science at New York University; Dr. Donald Aitken, Principal of Donald Aitken Associates; Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, President of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; Robert Correll, Senior Fellow, Atmospheric Policy Program, American Meteorological Society and noted environmental ethicist, J. Baird Callicott.

This conference approached the Gaia hypothesis as both science and metaphor as a means of understanding how we might begin addressing 21st century issues such as climate change and ongoing environmental destruction.

==Criticism==
After initially being largely ignored by most scientists (from 1969 until 1977), thereafter for a period the initial Gaia hypothesis was criticized by a number of scientists, such as [[Ford Doolittle]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=W. F.|year=1981|title=Is Nature Really Motherly|url=|journal=The Coevolution Quarterly|volume=Spring|pages=58–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: the Long Reach of the Gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-286088-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Turney, Jon. "Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life" (Revolutions in Science)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock has said that because his hypothesis is named after a Greek goddess, and championed by many non-scientists,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"/&gt; the Gaia hypothesis was interpreted as a [[neo-Pagan]] [[religion]]. Many scientists in particular also criticised the approach taken in his popular book ''Gaia, a New Look at Life on Earth'' for being [[teleology|teleological]]—a belief that things are purposeful and aimed towards a goal. Responding to this critique in 1990, Lovelock stated, "Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]]".

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticised Gaia as being "a metaphor, not a mechanism."&lt;ref name="Gould 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould S.J. |title=Kropotkin was no crackpot |journal=Natural History |volume=106 |pages=12–21 |date=June 1997  |url=http://libcom.org/library/kropotkin-was-no-crackpot |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to know the actual mechanisms by which self-regulating homeostasis was achieved. In his defense of Gaia, David Abram argues that Gould overlooked the fact that "mechanism", itself, is a metaphor — albeit an exceedingly common and often unrecognized metaphor — one which leads us to consider natural and living systems as though they were machines organized and built from outside (rather than as [[autopoiesis|autopoietic]] or self-organizing phenomena). Mechanical metaphors, according to Abram, lead us to overlook the active or agential quality of living entities, while the organismic metaphorics of the Gaia hypothesis accentuate the active agency of both the biota and the biosphere as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, D. (1988) "The Mechanical and the Organic: On the Impact of Metaphor in Science" in Scientists on Gaia, edited by Stephen Schneider and Penelope Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |title=The Mechanical and the Organic |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165936/http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |archivedate=February 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to causality in Gaia, Lovelock argues that no single mechanism is responsible, that the connections between the various known mechanisms may never be known, that this is accepted in other fields of biology and ecology as a matter of course, and that specific hostility is reserved for his own hypothesis for other reasons.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"&gt;Lovelock, James (2001), ''Homage to Gaia: The Life of an Independent Scientist'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from clarifying his language and understanding of what is meant by a life form, Lovelock himself ascribes most of the criticism to a lack of understanding of non-linear mathematics by his critics, and a linearizing form of [[greedy reductionism]] in which all events have to be immediately ascribed to specific causes before the fact. He also states that most of his critics are biologists but that his hypothesis includes experiments in fields outside biology, and that some self-regulating phenomena may not be mathematically explainable.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"/&gt;

===Natural selection and evolution===
Lovelock has suggested that global biological feedback mechanisms could evolve by [[natural selection]], stating that organisms that improve their environment for their survival do better than those that damage their environment. However, in the early 1980s, [[Ford Doolittle|W. Ford Doolittle]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] separately argued against Gaia. Doolittle argued that nothing in the [[genome]] of individual organisms could provide the feedback mechanisms proposed by Lovelock, and therefore the Gaia hypothesis proposed no plausible mechanism and was unscientific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dawkins meanwhile stated that for organisms to act in concert would require foresight and planning, which is contrary to the current scientific understanding of evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like Doolittle, he also rejected the possibility that feedback loops could stabilize the system.

[[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist who collaborated with Lovelock in supporting the Gaia hypothesis, argued in 1999, that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s grand vision was not wrong, only incomplete. In accentuating the direct competition between individuals for resources as the primary selection mechanism, Darwin (and especially his followers) created the impression that the environment was simply a static arena". She wrote that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around "set points" as in [[homeostasis]], but those set points change with time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margulis, Lynn. Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution. Houston: Basic Book 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] called the concept of Gaia [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]], adding that it would take another [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] to explain how Gaian self-regulation takes place through Darwinian [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=vanish09&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, pp. 195-197. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2012|reason=it should be possible to find the original place where Hamilton said this}}

===Criticism in the 21st century===
The Gaia hypothesis continues to be broadly skeptically received by the scientific community. For instance, arguments both for and against it were laid out in the journal ''Climatic Change'' in 2002 and 2003. A significant argument raised against it are the many examples where life has had a detrimental or destabilising effect on the environment rather than acting to regulate it.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"/&gt; Several recent books have criticised the Gaia hypothesis, expressing views ranging from "... the Gaia hypothesis lacks unambiguous observational support and has significant theoretical difficulties"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "Suspended uncomfortably between tainted metaphor, fact, and false science, I prefer to leave Gaia firmly in the background"&lt;ref name="beerling2007"/&gt; to "The Gaia hypothesis is supported neither by evolutionary theory nor by the empirical evidence of the geological record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CLAW hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="CLAW87" /&gt; initially suggested as a potential example of direct Gaian feedback, has subsequently been found to be less credible as understanding of [[cloud condensation nuclei]] has improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Quinn |first1=P.K. |last2= Bates |first2=T.S. |title =The case against climate regulation via oceanic phytoplankton sulphur emissions |journal =Nature |volume=480 |pages =51–56 |date = 2011 |doi=10.1038/nature10580|bibcode = 2011Natur.480...51Q |pmid=22129724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Medea hypothesis]] was proposed: that life has highly detrimental (biocidal) impacts on planetary conditions, in direct opposition to the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward (2009), ''The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?'', {{ISBN|0-691-13075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book-length evaluation of the Gaia hypothesis considering modern evidence from across the various relevant disciplines the author, Toby Tyrrell, concluded that: "I believe Gaia is a dead end. Its study has, however, generated many new and thought provoking questions. While rejecting Gaia, we can at the same time appreciate Lovelock's originality and breadth of vision, and recognise that his audacious concept has helped to stimulate many new ideas about the Earth, and to champion a holistic approach to studying it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he presents his conclusion "The Gaia hypothesis is not an accurate picture of how our world works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement needs to be understood as referring to the "strong" and "moderate" forms of Gaia—that the biota obeys a principle that works to make Earth optimal (strength 5) or favourable for life (strength 4) or that it works as a homeostatic mechanism (strength 3). The latter is the "weakest" form of Gaia that Lovelock has advocated. Tyrrell rejects it. However, he finds that the two weaker forms of Gaia—Coeveolutionary Gaia and Influential Gaia, which assert that there are close links between the evolution of life and the environment and that biology affects the physical and chemical environment—are both credible, but that it is not useful to use the term "Gaia" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=208 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Good agricultural practice''' ('''GAP''') are specific methods which, when applied to [[agriculture]], create food for consumers or further processing that is safe and wholesome. While there are numerous competing definitions of what methods constitute good agricultural practice there are several broadly accepted schemes that producers can adhere to.

==Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations GAP==
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) uses good agricultural practice as a collection of principles to apply for on-farm production and post-production processes, resulting in safe and healthy [[food]] and non-food agricultural products, while taking into account economical, social and environmental [[sustainable agriculture|sustainability]].

GAPs may be applied to a wide range of [[farming system]]s and at different scales. They are applied through sustainable agricultural methods, 
* Economically and efficiently produce sufficient ([[food security]]), safe ([[food safety]]) and nutritious food ([[food quality]]);{{cite book

 }}

GAPs require maintaining a common [[database]] on integrated production techniques for each of the major agro-ecological area (see [[ecoregion]]), thus to collect, analyze and disseminate information of good practices in relevant geographical contexts.

==United States Department of Agriculture GAP/GHP Program==
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] Agricultural Marketing Service currently operates an audit/certification program to verify that farms use good agricultural practice and/or good handling practice. This is a voluntary program typically utilized by growers and packers to satisfy contractual requirements with retail and food service buyers. The program was implemented in 2002 after the New Jersey Department of Agriculture petitioned USDA-AMS to implement an audit based program to verify conformance to the 1998 [[Food &amp; Drug Administration]] publication entitled, "Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables."

The program has been updated several times since 2002, and includes additional certification programs such as commodity specific audit programs for mushrooms, tomatoes, leafy greens, and cantaloupes.  In 2009, USDA-AMS participated in the GAPs Harmonization Initiative which "harmonized" 14 of the major North American GAP audit standards, which in 2011 resulted in the release and implementation of the Produce GAPs Harmonized Food Safety Standard.

==Smallholder productivity==
Demand for agricultural crops is expected to double as the world's population reaches 9.1 billion by 2050.  Increasing the quantity and quality of food in response to growing demand will require increased agricultural
.  Good agricultural practices, often in combination with effective input use, are one of the best ways to increase smallholder productivity.  Many agribusinesses are building sustainable supply chains to increase production and improve quality.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Finance Corporation]].  Working with Smallholders: A Handbook for Firms Building Sustainable Supply Chains.  http://www.farms2firms.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020932/http://www.farms2firms.org/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil==
{{further|Compost|Mulch|Potting soil|Organic fertilizer|Soil borne infectious diseases}}
* Reducing [[erosion]] by wind and water through hedging and ditching
* Application of [[fertilizer]]s at appropriate moments and in adequate doses (i.e., when the plant needs the fertilizer), to avoid run-off (see [[nitrogen balance method]]).
* Maintaining or restoring soil organic content, by [[manure]] application, use of [[grazing]], [[crop rotation]]
* Reduce soil compaction issues (by avoiding using heavy mechanical devices)
* Maintain soil structure, by limiting heavy tillage practices [http://www.fao.org/prods/GAP/home/principles_1_en.htm FAO : GAP : FAO GAP Principles : Soil]
* ''In situ'' green manuring by growing pulse crops like [[cowpea]], [[horse gram]], [[sunn hemp]] etc.

==Water==
* Practice scheduled [[irrigation]], with monitoring of plant needs, and soil water reserve status to avoid water loss by drainage
* Prevent soil [[Soil salinity|salinization]] by limiting water input to needs, and recycling water whenever possible
* Avoid crops with high water requirements in a low availability region
* Avoid drainage and fertilizer run-off
* Maintain permanent soil covering, in particular in winter to avoid nitrogen run-off
* Manage carefully water table, by limiting heavy output of water
* Restore or maintain wetlands (see [[marshlands]])
* Provide good water points for livestock ([http://www.fao.org/prods/GAP/home/principles_2_en.htm FAO : GAP : FAO GAP Principles : Water])
* Harvest water ''in situ'' by digging catch pits, crescent bunds across slope

==Animal production, health and welfare==
* Respect of animal well-being (freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury or disease; freedom to express normal behavior; and freedom from fear and distress)
* Avoid nontherapeutic mutilations, surgical or invasive procedures, such as tail [[docking (animal)|docking]] and debeaking;
* Avoid negative impacts on landscape, environment and life: contamination of land for grazing, food, [[water]] and [[air]]
* Check stocks and flows, maintain structure of [[system]]s
* Prevent chemical and medical residues from entering the [[food chain]]
* Minimize non-therapeutic use of [[antibiotic]]s or [[hormone]]s
* Avoid feeding animals with animal wastes or animal matter (reducing the risk of alien viral or transgenic genes, or prions such as mad cow disease),
* Minimize transport of live animals (by foot, rail or road) (reducing the risk of [[epidemics]], e.g., [[foot and mouth disease]])
* Prevent waste run-off (e.g. nitrate contamination of water tables from pigs), nutrient loss and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions ([[methane]] from cows)
* Prefer [[safety]] measures standards in manipulation of equipment
* Apply [[traceability]] processes on the whole production chain (breeding, feed, medical treatment...) for [[consumer]] security and feedback possibility in case of a food crisis (e.g., [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]).[http://www.fao.org/prods/GAP/home/principles_6_en.htm FAO : GAP : FAO GAP Principles : Animal Health and Welfare]

[[File:Heckler2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A heckler in Washington, D.C. leans across a police line toward a demonstration of [[Iran]]ians during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], August 1980]]

A '''heckler''' is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heckler |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heckler |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hecklers are often known to shout disparaging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers and/or participants.

==Origin==
Although the word ''heckler'', which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, the sense "person who harasses" was from 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heckler|title=heckler {{!}} Origin and history of heckler by Online Etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''heckle'' was to tease or comb out [[flax]] or [[hemp]] fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.&lt;ref name=McKie&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/28/broadcasting.comment |title=Unplotted ripostes |last1=McKie |first1=David |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckling was a major part of the [[vaudeville]] theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler &amp; Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.

==Politics==
{{See also|Heckler's veto}}
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)
with sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each "incident" so as to put them all in context.
--&gt;
Politicians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:

:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?
:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.
:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!
:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout "Tell them about the dream, Martin". &lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16th April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones talks to WSJ's Monika Vosough about how Martin Luther King's favorite gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped create the "I Have a Dream" speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetJournal&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.

During a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped "Aw, shut up!" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.

In 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of "dying of ambition to be president"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, "[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 maart 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTQZnC-6a4 |title=Clinton's Angry Response to Heckler |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audience control ===
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: possible use for subheader here, distinguishing the use of "audience screening" as a means of discouraging political heckling.
NOTE: 'astroturfing' and 'audience screening' are arguably distinct, changed to a 'see also'
--&gt;
&lt;!-- What? --&gt;
One modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a "tame" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, ''[[astroturfing]]''). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to [[Tony Blair]] during a [[photo op]] visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2690549.stm "Blair's heckler states his case"], BBC, 24 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, American Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted ("Four more years", "Go Bush!"), Patterson uttered  "No, no, no, no" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/02/09/coverstory.html |title=Woman utters No |publisher=Eugeneweekly.com |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, "Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney." Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking.&lt;ref&gt;June Deery: ''Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment''.  MacMillan, 2012.  Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator [[Patrick Leahy|Patrick Joseph Leahy]], Vermont, he said "fuck yourself" on the floor of the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheney Dismisses Critic With Obscenity|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2005, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |title=Iran denies troop attack links |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513220441/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |archivedate=13 May 2007 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference...  During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted "Fascists" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience."

Since 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in [[Switzerland]].  Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. 

On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: "President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture."&lt;!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html "No breakthrough in US, China talks"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush later apologised to his guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-SC) shouted "You lie!" at President [[Barack Obama]] after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|speech]] he was making to a joint session of Congress.  Wilson later apologized for his outburst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/09/wilson-apologizes-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me/ "Wilson apologizes: 'I let my emotions get the best of me'"]. Retrieved September 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203164254/http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said "If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so." "But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition," he continued. "And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/immigrationdebate/ci_24598028/obama-san-francisco-calls-immigration-reform|title=Obama’s immigration speech in deep-blue San Francisco interrupted by anti-deportation hecklers|author=|date=25 November 2013|website=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/heckler-obama-steals-attention-presidents-speech-21008837|title=Video: Heckler Disrupts Obama's Speech With Minute-Long Rant|first=ABC|last=News|date=|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126145922/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |archivedate=26 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/|title=Obama addresses heckler during speech on immigration|author=|date=|website=daytondailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144614/http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Hecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savićević]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: "You're a piece of shit!"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.

In English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.

Australian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.

The sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].

At the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.

Tennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.

In 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex Ríos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled "The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph." Rios then replied with "Who gives a fuck", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.

==Music==
{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}
One of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, "Judas!" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by "going electric". Dylan replied: "I don't believe you, you're a liar!" before telling his band to "Play it fucking loud!" They play an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.

==Comedy==
Heckling often occurs during [[stand up comedy]] performances, particularly at [[Renegade_show|open stage]] performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, [[Billy Connolly]] said that "I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone."&lt;ref&gt;BBC Imagine: The Art of Stand Up, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as "squelches") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Andrew. [http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT "You're Ugly, Your Dick Is Small, and Everybody Fucks Your Mother—The Stand-Up Comedian's Response to the Heckler"]. ''[[Maledicta]]'' Vol. 11, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The comedy TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' featured a pair of hecklers named [[Statler and Waldorf]]. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, [[Fozzie Bear]], acted as their usual [[Double act|foil]], although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.

Another notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as [[Rifftrax]] and [[Cinematic Titanic]].

In one of [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s plays "The School Master", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting "Here!" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying "I have a detention book..."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

'''The heroic theory of invention and scientific development''' is the [[hypothesis]] that the principal authors of [[invention]]s and [[scientific discoveries]] are unique [[hero]]ic individuals{{spaced ndash}} "great scientists" or "geniuses."  A competing hypothesis ("[[multiple discovery]]") is that most inventions and scientific discoveries are made independently and simultaneously by multiple inventors and scientists.

The multiple discovery hypothesis might be especially relevant in the development of mathematics since mathematical knowledge is highly unified and any advances that happen need to be built from previously established results through a process of deduction, as a general rule.  For instance, the development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] into a systematic discipline did not occur until the development of [[analytic geometry]], the former being credited to both [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and the latter to both [[René Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]].

The '''history of Canadian animation''' involves a considerable element of the realities of a country neighbouring the [[United States]] and both competitiveness and co-operation cross-border.

== History ==

===1910s-1950s===
Canadians contributed greatly to the technologies and practices used to create animated television shows, movies and special effects. Starting in 1912, Canadian cartoonist and painter [[Raoul Barre]] introduced standard perforations in the drawing paper and "peg bars" to hold them in place which eliminated jerkiness when going from one image to the next. He also introduced the slash system, a method of drawing the background only once (instead of with each frame as had been done previously) on a separate sheet, leaving blank spaces for character movement. In 1913, Barre organized a systematic method of producing animated cartoons in an assembly line fashion. The assembly line method is essentially how all commercial animations (television, film etc.) are created to this day.

Prior to 1939, [[animation]] production was a very low scale with small production that were often discouraged by theatre chains like [[Famous Players]]. Such companies did not want Canadian competition to their parent companies' product. However, independent animators such as Jack (J.A). Norling in Winnipeg, Jean Arsin and Charles Lambly in Montreal, and Harold Peberdy, Bert Cob, Walter H. Swaffield and Bryant Fryer in Toronto, were able to produce short animations, primarily for advertising and educational purposes&lt;ref&gt;[https://governmentcheese.ca/~governme/writings/13-before-mclaren-canadian-animation-in-the-silent-film-era-1910-1927 Before McLaren: Canadian Animation in the Silent Film Era (1910 - 1927)]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

1939 saw the establishment of the [[National Film Board of Canada]], which provided a strong government supported organization for the creation of distinctively Canadian work.  Animation was essentially an afterthought, but an initial and short-lived period of co-production with the [[Walt Disney Company]] in the making of animated [[propaganda film]]s helped establish a core of animators who continued production after Disney withdrew.

Initially, the artistic focus of the crew was to explore types of animation apart from regular [[cel animation]] since it was decided competing with the American companies in this field was counterproductive.  With that approach, luminaries like [[Norman McLaren]] made their mark with innovative work in forms like [[drawn on film]] animation.  In addition, the agency eventually gained the confidence to produce cel animation as well.

===1960s===
Apart from the National Film Board, Canadian production in the commercial sphere was largely as limited as before.  The biggest contribution in the 1960s and much of the 1970s was in the field of [[voice acting]] with many major television productions like ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' sporting Canadian [[voice actors]] like [[Paul Soles]] and [[Paul Kligman]]. Some of the animation for these features were sub-contracted by such Canadian studios as [[Crawley Films]] in [[Ottawa]] and [[The Guest Group]] in [[Toronto]], a group of creative companies owned and run by [[Al Guest]].

The situation began to change in the late 1960s with ''[[Rocket Robin Hood]]'', which was produced by [[Al Guest]].

===1970s===
In the 1970s, independent companies were formed to produce low budget children's programming.  Some examples are ''[[The Undersea Adventures of Captain Nemo]]'', and ''[[The Toothbrush Family]]'' as well as ''[[Ukaliq]]'' and ''[[The Sunrunners]]'' all written, produced and directed by [[Al Guest]] and his partner [[Jean Mathieson]] at their Toronto company [[Rainbow Animation]].

Longer term successes began with the founding of [[Nelvana]] Animation in 1971. Nelvana took advantage of the new [[Canadian content]] broadcast rules to produce a successful series of acclaimed [[TV special]]s. They also had some success in the United States, working on productions like the animated segment of ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' in 1978.  However, the confidence arising from this success led to the company into an ill-advised and troubled production of a [[feature film]], ''[[Rock and Rule]]'' which proved a crippling box office failure (though it later became a cult classic).  The company turned to [[television animation]] work which proved successful [[List of Nelvana programs|with series]] like ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' and ''[[Care Bears]]''. The company eventually became a prime supplier of animation work into the American network TV market.

Two new players suddenly appeared in Ottawa, with [[Atkinson Film-Arts]] producing TV specials based on the [[Jean De Brunhoff]] ''[[Babar the Elephant|Babar]]'' books and the [[Lynn Johnston]] comic strip ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', as well as the series ''[[The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis The Menace]]'', and animation for the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' and the specials and subsequent series of Kevin Gillis' popular ''[[The Raccoons]]''. Disputes between Atkinson management and the ''Raccoons'' producers led Gillis' ''Raccoons'' production partner Sheldon Wiseman to form a new Ottawa studio, Hinton Animation Studios. Hinton took over animation for ''[[The Raccoons]]'', and produced animation for projects under Wiseman's own [[Lacewood Productions]]. When the studio's feature film ''[[The Nutcracker Prince]]'' performed poorly at the box office, Hinton found itself unable to pay off the money it borrowed to finance the feature; the situation was further exacerbated by creative tensions between Gillis and Wiseman. Due to these problems, Hinton dissolved in 1990, bringing an end to ''The Raccoons'' and Gillis and Wiseman's partnership. Wiseman subsequently reorganized the Hinton animation staff as Lacewood Studios, which produced a new series of ''For Better or For Worse'' specials, and co-produced several television series with producers in the United States and France.

===1980s===
In the 1980s the animation department of the French division of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] in [[Montreal]] took centre stage by winning two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]s for its animation shorts:  ''[[Crac]]'' in 1981 and ''[[The Man Who Planted Trees (film)|The Man Who Planted Trees]]'' in 1987. Both were produced by Frédéric Back. In about the same period private and public colleges started offering complete animation programs.  In 1984 [[Sheridan College]] of [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] won an Oscar for ''[[Charade (1984 film)|Charade]]'', by one of its graduating students, [[Jon Minnis]].

===1990s===
With the renaissance of animation in the 1990s, Canadian animation further prospered with conventional fare from companies like Nelvana and [[Cinar]] while innovative work from [[Mainframe Entertainment]] such the first [[computer animated]] series, ''[[ReBoot]]'' drew considerable success on its own. The demand for animators during this time (and also during the slow period of the 1980s) caused a global search for excellent and skilled animators causing many talented Canadians to wander the globe to fill the demand. Many Canadians can be found worldwide in prominent positions in animation companies throughout the world. From [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] directing animation on ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' in the late 1980s in England to others directing creating and supervising animation in television and commercial studios around the world including many prominent video games such as ''[[Halo 2]]'', ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''.

In 1997, [[Teletoon]] (along with its French-language counterpart [[Télétoon]]) was established as Canada's first dedicated animation television channel whose broadcast license agreement stipulated [[List of programs broadcast by Teletoon|at least one original animated television series a season]].

===2000s===
Companies such as Montreal's [[Toon Boom]] and Toronto's [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias Research]]/[[Wavefront Technologies]] and [[Side Effects Software]] have not only helped to define international technical standards, but have assumed a leadership role within the computer software industry. Toon Boom's "[[Harmony (software)|Harmony]]", Alias/Wavefront's "[[Maya (software)|Maya]]"  and Side Effects Software's "[[Houdini (software)|Houdini]]" are leading animation software packages used in many animated features and special effects. From shows as simple as ''[[Simpsons]]'' (Harmony), ''[[South Park]]'' (Maya) and ''[[Angela Anaconda]]'' (Houdini) to special effects as fantastic and complex as those seen in the [[Harry Potter films]] (both software packages) and more.

Also, animated [[Flash cartoons]] originally started as web programs began making their way to television such as ''[[Chilly Beach]]'' (2003-2006), on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], and ''[[Odd Job Jack]]'' (2003-2007), on the [[Comedy Network]]. The former franchise was also expanded two include two [[The World Is Hot Enough|full films]]. In a similar vein, the CGI animated science fiction comedy show ''[[Tripping the Rift]]'' aired between 2004 and 2007. This also signalled the adoption of animation more [[Adult animation|aimed at adults]] pioneered in the [[United States]] by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and speciality blocks such as [[Adult Swim]]. [[Teletoon (Canada)|Teletoon]] entered this market in September 2002 with its [[Teletoon at Night]] programming block and [[Teletoon at Night#Original series|original programming]], most notably with its adult sitcom ''[[Fugget About It]]'' (2012–2016). [[G4 (Canada)|G4]] also launched its own [[Adult Digital Distraction]] on June 9, 2009, before being shut down by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] in late 2011 for violating the station's mandate; the block returned again in 2012. [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] later came to Canada itself on July 4, 2012. The [[Late night television|late-night]] [[Bionix]] block aired on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] from September 10, 2004 to February 7, 2010, airing content aimed at an older audience than usual, [[YTV (TV channel)#Anime|including]] Japanese [[anime]].

Further experimentation and exploration in the art of animation which began with the [[National Film Board of Canada]] and the works of [[Norman Mclaren]] has continued through the decades through the techniques and films of other NFB animators such as [[Jacques Drouin]], [[Christopher Hinton (animator)|Chris Hinton]], [[Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis]], [[Cordell Barker]] and many others. A few Independent organizations such as the [[Toronto Animated Image Society]] in Toronto and especially the [[Quickdraw Animation Society]] in Calgary have also formed and continue to contribute, explore the art of animation and produce new works by emerging and established Canadian animators and artists. This exploration and blending of assorted and unusual techniques can be seen in the many boutique animation companies and independent animators that have sprung up throughout Canada and has continued to propel Canada's reputation of interesting and innovative animation techniques.

The [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] which takes place every fall in Ottawa Ontario is one of the largest and most respected animation festivals for drawing professional, commercial, independent and amateur animators and animation enthusiasts alike from all over the world.  It is sponsored by the [[Association internationale du film d'animation]], better known as [[ASIFA]] with chapters throughout the world.

===2010s===
In August 2011, NFB Animation Studio executive producer [[David Verrall]] retired, after more than 34 years at the NFB including 14 years as head of its English-language animation unit. Verrall produced or executive produced 240 NFB animated films, with ''[[Bob's Birthday]]'', ''[[Ryan (film)|Ryan]]'' and ''[[The Danish Poet]]'' winning [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]]. He was succeeded by [[Roddy McManus]].&lt;ref name=Verrall&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Brendan|title=Sad to go, but not left reeling|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/left+reeling/5254797/story.html#ixzz1V6mrPKNS|accessdate=15 August 2011|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Canadian animation studio [[ToonBox Entertainment]] created the Canadian-South Korean co-production ''[[The Nut Job]]'', directed by [[Peter Lepeniotis]] and starring [[Will Arnett]]. While it garnered [[The Nut Job#Reception|mixed reviews]], it was one of the highest-budgeted and highest-grossing Canadian films of all time, with a cost of $42 million and a worldwide gross of $107 million as of September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nutjob.htm |title=The Nut Job (2014) - Box Office Mojo |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 27, 2014 |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 13-episode animated series based on the hit live action Canadian sitcom ''[[Corner Gas]]'' (2004-2009)  was announced on December 19, 2016. The series features the voices of many of the original series' cast members, except for [[Janet Wright]] who died in 2016. It was scheduled to début in 2017 on the [[Comedy Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3136435/canadian-sitcom-smash-corner-gas-to-be-rebooted-as-animated-series|title=Canadian sitcom smash ‘Corner Gas’ to be rebooted as animated series|work=CTV|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was ultimately delayed until April 2, 2018 under the official title of ''[[Corner Gas Animated]]''. Its first episode, "Dry Bones", was the highest rated première in the history of the Comedy Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornergas.com/corner-gas-animated-becomes-watched-series-premiere-history-comedy-network/|title=CORNER GAS ANIMATED Becomes the Most-Watched Series Premiere in the History of The Comedy Network|date=April 9, 2018|publisher=CornerGas.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International School of Information Management (ISiM)''' is the first Indian [[List of I-Schools|i-School]] and is an autonomous constituent institute of the [[University of Mysore]], located in [[Mysore]] in [[Karnataka]] State, Southern [[India]]. ISiM was conceptualised and established in 2005, in collaboration with the leading information schools in the U.S – namely the School of Information at the [[University of Michigan]], the School of Information Sciences at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the School of Information Studies at [[Syracuse University]], [[International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore|International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Bangalore]], and [[Dalhousie University]] of Canada. ISiM was established with munificent{{clarify|date=April 2012}} grants from the [[Ford Foundation]] and Bangalore based Informatics India Pvt. Ltd.

==Introduction==
[[File:ISiM building.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|ISiM campus at Manasagangothri, University of Mysore, Mysore]]
Each new era and society demands a new breed of professionals. Just as the industrial age heralded management sciences, the information age is engendering the domain of information sciences. With this belief and the concept of an institution focusing exclusively on information studies and research in India, ISiM was established. ISiM was conceptualized and established in 2005, by the University of Mysore, with seed grants from the Ford Foundation and Bangalore based Informatics India Pvt. Ltd., and in partnership with some of the leading information schools in the U.S, namely the School of Information at the University of Michigan, the School of Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh, and the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. To strengthen its academic linkages, ISiM signed memorandum of understanding with School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, USA, University of Michigan, USA and Dalhousie University of Canada in 2006.&lt;ref name="ISiMpartners"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isim.ac.in/html/partners.htm |title=Partners |publisher= International School of Information Management (ISiM), University of Mysore |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SomMittal1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Dr. [[Som Mittal]], the then Director of HP and the current President of [[NASSCOM]], launching ISiM at InfoVision 2005]][[File:SRU at InfoVision2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Dr. Shalini R. Urs, the Executive Director of ISiM, speaking at the launch of ISiM at InfoVision 2005]]
Being a new age school for the knowledge economy, ISiM also defines a new educational model – '''''[[Inverse of Distance Learning]]'''''&lt;ref name="knowISiM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isim.ac.in/html/know%20ISiM.htm |title=Know ISiM |publisher= International School of Information Management (ISiM), University of Mysore |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in which, the students and the school are in Mysore, but, the faculty and mentors are a distributed network of excellence drawn from ISiM’s partners and other institutions.

ISiM is directed by an independent Governing Board, chaired by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mysore, with eminent academics and industry stalwarts as members. ISiM is managed today with some of the finest minds from Academia, Industry and the Government and has on its governing board personalities like [[N. R. Narayana Murthy]], Chairman and Mentor [[Infosys]] Technologies and others like Prof. M. Anandakrishnan, Chairman-IIT Kanpur, Dr.N. Seshagiri, Former Director General, [[National Informatics Centre]], [[New Delhi]], Dr. [[S. Sadagopan]], Founder Director- IIIT, Bangalore, Mr. M. N. Vidyashankar, Principal Secretary, Department of E-Governance, [[Government of Karnataka]], Mr. [[Prasad Ram]], Director and Center Head, [[Google]] India, among others.&lt;ref name="ISiMmanagement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isim.ac.in/html/management.htm |title=Management |publisher= International School of Information Management (ISiM), University of Mysore |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{peacock|date=April 2012}}
With redefining the academia-industry interaction through a process of continuous engagement of students and the industry mentors in open community projects being one of the main visions of ISiM, it envisions to be an innovative institution, shaping and defining the multidisciplinary domain of information, while innovating new institutional models and focusing on preparing information professionals who can help solve the [[information asymmetry]].

ISiM recognizes the multidisciplinary nature of information, and envisions being a ground breaking higher education institution, addressing the challenges of defining this domain. The challenges of the information age require educational institutions to continuously evolve, and ISiM has special focus towards innovating new institutional models. With emphasis on redefining the academia—industry interaction, ISiM encourages continuous engagement of students and industry mentors in Open Community Projects, and by doing so, aims to be a world class institution of higher learning, which prepares professionals who can build information systems to help solve the information asymmetry.&lt;ref name="knowISiM" /&gt;

ISiM graduates find career opportunities as Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Information System Developers, Content Managers, Management Information Analysts, Information Marketers, Knowledge Portal Managers, Knowledge Management leads, Web / Online Content Analysts, Data Analytics / Business Intelligence Specialists, Data Warehousing Professionals, MIS Officers, Archivists, Librarians etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isim.ac.in/html/placements.htm |title=Placements |publisher= International School of Information Management (ISiM), University of Mysore |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of ISiM==
The seed of ISiM was sown during a discussion among like minded peers in the academia and some more members from the industry, and dozens of brainstorming sessions later during the annual Knowledge Summit [http://www.infovision.org.in/ "'''''INFOVISION'''''"] in September 2005, Dr. Som Mittal, the then Director of [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and the current President of [[NASSCOM]] officially launched ISiM. From 2005, ISiM has evolved from being a mere concept to reality, and has defined a new educational model in this process - '''''[[Inverse of Distance Learning]]'''''.

=== Graduation Day 2011===

ISiM celebrated its Graduation Day on Monday, 11 April 2011.  In her Welcome Address, Prof. Shalini Urs, Executive Director of ISiM, drew attention to the objective and tradition of celebrating graduation days. She said, a  graduation day is an academic cultural tradition and is a rite of passage essentially  symbolizing "Inculcation, transformation" and "Return to Society in a changed status."  The purpose of ISiM Graduation Day Celebrations program is to build a sense of  new roles as ISiMians and solidarity.

Dr. P. Anandan, Managing Director, Microsoft Research India, Bangalore, giving the commencement speech, outlined various kinds of aspirations that we, Indians, have seen over the ages, taking examples from Indian PURANAS and history. He said  the only reason why we keep innovating, is that we don't stop aspiring. He stressed upon the fact that we should always aspire towards reaching greater heights, and work hard towards achieving them.  He gave the Ten Commandments for Success that included: being brave; believe in "no boundaries’; failures as learning opportunities; not being limited by success.

Also speaking on the occasion was the chief guest for the ceremony, Shri M. N. Vidyashankar, IAS, Principal Secretary, e-Governance, IT, BT and ST, Government of Karnataka. He underscored the importance of  innovation and said that is the only way for organizations to compete in the current global scenario. He also said that one of the main hurdles in the path of constant innovation was the non-acceptance of technology by members of the general public. Shri Vidyashankar highlighted with an example each for the success of using technology at their department and for the failure of an innovative education system due to the non-acceptance of technology. He also threw light on the fact that though Indians have significantly contributed to the research and innovation successes at Silicon Valley (California), they have not played such a major role in research activities in the Indus Valley (India), and advised the students to work towards a career of innovation.

Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mysore, Prof. V. G. Talawar, in his presidential address stressed on the three Ds: Desire; Determination; Dedication.

The dignitaries distributed the degree certificates to the graduates. On the occasion, two graduates, Mr. Nabhajit Ray (M.Tech Class of 2009) and [https://about.me/nikeshnarayanan Mr. Nikesh Narayanan] (M.Tech Class of 2010), were awarded the "Parvathamma Subbaraya Gold Medal", instituted with munificent grants from Dr. Chudamani, an alumnus of the University of Mysore and currently, the Deputy Librarian at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

The '''International Social Survey Programme''' ('''ISSP''') is a collaboration between different nations conducting surveys covering topics which are useful for social science research. The ISSP researchers develop questions which are meaningful and relevant to all countries which can be expressed in an equal manner in different languages. The results of the surveys provide a cross-national and cross-cultural perspective to individual national studies. Through 2015 58 countries have participated in the ISSP.&lt;ref&gt;ISSP official Statement "About Us" http://issp.org/about-issp/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISSP was founded in 1984&lt;ref&gt;ISSP Official Website http://issp.org/about-issp/history/&lt;/ref&gt; by research organizations from four countries:
* Zentrum für Umfragen, Methoden, und Analysen (ZUMA), [[Mannheim]], Germany. now [[GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]]
* [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC), [[University of Chicago]], [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States.
* Social and Community Planning Research (SCPR), [[London]], United Kingdom. now [http://natcen.ac.uk/ National Centre for Social Research, NatCen]
* Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS), [[Australian National University]], now [http://demography.anu.edu.au/ School of Demography] [[Canberra]], Australia.

Four different Social Surveys included a common module each year:
* The [[British Social Attitudes Survey]] (BSA) in the UK
* The [[General Social Survey]] (GSS) in the USA
* The [[ALLBUS]] or [[German General Social Survey]] (GGSS) in Germany and 
* The Surveys by the Research School of Social Sciences

Ever since social science institutions from 58 different countries included a 15 minute supplement to their national surveys. The membership to the ISSP is institutional and by country. One or more than one institute in a country can co-operate on ISSP research (cf. France and Spain). The common module surveyed by the member institutions also contains an extensive common core of background varibales. The modules focus on one specific topic each year and were planned to be repeated more or less every five to ten years. When it comes to the researchers choice of topics, the relevance of the area of social sciences in the year of the survey is taken into account.
Given this, the ISSP deliveres data sets helpful for both [[Cross-sectional studies]] and [[Time series analysis]].
Over time the set of modules has grown towards more diverse topics. The latest additions were Leisure and Sports in 2007 as well as Health and Health Care in 2011.

== Organisation ==
The ISSP is a self-funding organisation with an emphasis on democratic decision making stated in its working principles. To accomplish this principle it has set up several groups and committees. These groups either consist of member organizations as a whole or include some particualr social scientists. There are:
* The ISSP secretariat (2015-2018): GESIS-Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany
* The ISSP archive (collaboration between Spain and Germany)
* Methodology research groups
* The ISSP sub-groups drawn up within the ISSP
* Drafting groups for modules
* The ISSP Standing Committee
Most of the members of these groups are elected democratically at the '''General Assembly.''' These meetings of delegates from every member state of the ISSP are held in May or June in changing locations all around the world. The General Assemblies also serve the function of discussing modules, which are to be completed the same year or begun and surveyed the upcoming one. The delegates also discuss the topics of upcoming modules.

The ISSP also gives importance to the way member organisation implement their surveys. The organisation´s principles are published in its [http://issp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Rules_and_regulations/ethical_statement_issp.pdf ethical statement] and its [http://issp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Rules_and_regulations/ISSP_WP_FINAL_2018.pdf working principles].

== Methodology ==
The methodological work in the ISSP is coordinated by a '''Methodology Committee''', consisting of seven members elected at the '''General Meeting'''. It co-ordinates the work of six groups addressing different areas of '''cross-cultural methods''', all concerned with issues of equivalence: demography, non-response, weighting, mode effects, questionnaire design and translation.

== Modules by Year &lt;ref&gt;GESIS ISSP Modules by Year http://www.gesis.org/issp/modules/issp-modules-by-year/&lt;/ref&gt;==
The datasets from the different modules conducted by participating ISSP member states can be downloaded at the GESIS Archive page.&lt;ref&gt;GESIS Archive http://www.gesis.org/issp/modules/&lt;/ref&gt; All these links lead to the official [[GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] homepage, where the data is provided openly for research purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3150">{{Refimprove|date=December 2015}}The '''iron catastrophe''' was a postulated major geological event early in the [[history of Earth]]. The original [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of the [[Earth]]'s material into a spherical mass is thought to have resulted in a relatively uniform composition.  While residual heat from the collision of the material that formed the Earth was significant, heating from [[radioactive]] materials in this mass gradually increased the temperature until a critical condition was reached. As material became molten enough to allow movement, the denser [[iron]] and [[nickel]], evenly distributed throughout the mass, began to migrate to the center of the planet to form the core. The gravitational potential energy released by the sinking of the dense [[NiFe]] globules, along with any cooler, denser solid material, is thought to have been a runaway process, increasing the temperature of the protoplanet above the melting point of most components, resulting in the rapid formation of a molten iron core covered by a deep global silicate [[magma]]. This event, an important process of [[planetary differentiation]], occurred at about 500&amp;nbsp;million years into the formation of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Frankel, 1996, ''Volcanoes of the Solar System,'' Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;7–8, {{ISBN|0-521-47770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of Earth's magnetosphere==
This large spinning mass of super-hot metal is responsible for the creation of the [[Earth's magnetic field]], the [[magnetosphere]], which protects the Earth from [[solar wind]] and the most harmful components of [[solar radiation]] coming from our [[Sun]]. The magnetosphere protects both [[Earth's atmosphere]] and [[life]] to the present day and distinguishes the planet from its close celestial neighbour, [[Mars]], which no longer has a significant magnetic field nor comparable atmosphere.  The term ''catastrophe'' is, here, in the mathematical sense of "a large, sudden change or discontinuity", as contrasted with "a disaster", because this event was necessary for life to emerge and evolve on Earth: without it, Earth's atmosphere would have been, as on Mars, stripped away by solar wind long before the present epoch.

Another theory, however, suggests Mars did once experience its own iron catastrophe and was once shielded by a magnetosphere.  By this theory Mars has simply cooled faster than the Earth, gradually solidifying its dynamic iron center, hence shutting down its magnetosphere. The finding of signs of liquid water once existing on Mars suggests that it once had its own magnetic shield to keep the water in the atmosphere of the planet from being blown into space by solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3111_origins.html|title=Origins: Series Overview — NOVA - PBS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political anthropology}}
{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}

'''Legal anthropology''', also known as the '''anthropology of laws''', is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] which specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenhouse, Carol J. |title=Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell UP |year=1986 |pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The questions that Legal Anthropologists seek to answer concern how is [[law]] present in cultures? How does it manifest? How may anthropologists contribute to understandings of law?

Earlier legal anthropological research focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation.  [[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s 1926 work, ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'', explored law, order, crime, and punishment among the [[Trobriand Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw 1985[1926] Crime and Custom in Savage Society. Totowa, New Jersey:  Rowman &amp; Allanheld.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English lawyer Sir [[Henry Maine]] is often credited with founding the study of Legal Anthropology through his book ''[[Ancient Law]]'' (1861), and although his evolutionary stance has been widely discredited within the discipline, his questions raised have shaped the subsequent discourse of the study. This ethno-centric evolutionary perspective was pre-eminent in early Anthropological discourse on law, evident through terms applied such as ‘pre-law’ or ‘proto-law’ and applied by so-called armchair anthropologists. However, a turning point was presented in the 1926 publication of ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'' by [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] based upon his time with the Trobriand Islanders. Through emphasizing the order present in acephelous societies, Malinowski proposed the cross-cultural examining of law through its established functions as opposed to a discrete entity. This has led to multiple researchers and ethnographies examining such aspects as order, dispute, conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation, in addition (and often antagonistically) to law-centred studies, with small-societal studies leading to insightful self-reflections and better understanding of the founding concept of law.

Legal anthropology remains a lively discipline with modern and recent applications including issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]], [[Islamophobia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=John R. |title=A New Anthropology of Islam |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world |year=2006 |publisher=Fordham University Press |location=New York |editor=Hent de Vries and Lawrence E. Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

==What is law?==
{{see also|Philosophy of law}}
Legal Anthropology provides a definition of law which differs from that found within modern legal systems. Hoebel (1954) offered the following definition of law: ''“A social norm is legal if its neglect or infraction is regularly met, in threat or in fact, by the application of physical force by an individual or group possessing the socially recognized privilege of so acting”''

Maine argued that human societies passing through three basic stages of legal development, from a group presided over by a senior agnate, through stages of territorial development and culminating in an elite forming normative laws of society, stating that ''“what the juristical oligarchy now claims is to monopolize the knowledge of the laws, to have the exclusive possession of the principles by which quarrels are decided”''

This [[evolutionary approach]], as has been stated, was subsequently replaced within the anthropological discourse by the need to examine the manifestations of law’s societal function. As according to [[Hoebel]], law has four functions:

1)	to identify socially acceptable lines of behaviour for inclusion in the culture. 
2)	To allocate authority and who may legitimately apply force.
3)	To settle trouble cases.
4)	To redefine relationships as the concepts of life change.

Legal theorist H. L. A. Hart, however, stated that law is a body of rules, and is a union of two sets of rules: 
# rules on conduct ("primary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
# rules about recognizing, changing, applying, and adjudicating on rules on conduct ("secondary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within modern English Theory, law is a discrete and specialized topic. Predominantly positivist in character, it is closely linked to notions of a rule-making body, the judiciary and enforcement agencies. The centralized state organisation and isolates are essentials to the attributes of rules, courts and sanctions. To learn more on this view, see Hobbes. 1651 Leviathan, part 2, chapter 26  or Salmond, J. 1902 Jurisprudence.

However, this view of law is not applicable everywhere. There are many acephelous societies around the world where the above control mechanisms are absent. There are no conceptualized and isolated set of normative rules – these are instead embodied in everyday life. Even when there may be a discrete set of legal norms, these are not treated similarly to the English Legal System’s unequivocal power and unchallenged pre-eminence. Shamans, fighting and supernatural means are all mechanisms of superimposing rules within other societies. For example, within [[Rasmussen]]’s work of Across Arctic America (1927) he recounts [[Eskimo]] nith-songs being used as a public reprimand by expressing the wrongdoing of someone guilty.

Thus, instead of focusing upon the explicit manifestations of law, legal anthropologists have taken to examining the functions of law and how it is expressed. A view expressed by Leopold Pospisil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pospisil, Leopold |title=The Anthropology of Laws: A Comparative Theory  |year=1974|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encapsulated by Bronislaw Malinowski:

''“In such primitive communities I personally believe that law ought to be defined by function and not by form, that is we ought to see what are the arrangements, the sociological realities, the cultural mechanisms which act for the enforcement of law”''&lt;ref&gt;(1934: Introduction to Hogbin, Law and Order in Polynesia).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, law has been studied in ways that may be categorized by as:

1) prescriptive rules
2) observable regularities
3) Instances of dispute.

==Processual paradigm: order and conflict==

Order and regulatory behaviour are required if social life is to be maintained. The scale and shade of this behaviour depends on the values and beliefs held by a society deriving from implicit understandings of the norm developed through socialization. There are socially constructed norms with varying degrees of explicitness and levels of order. Conflict may not be interpreted as an extreme pathological event but as a regulatory acting force.

This processual understanding of conflict and dispute became apparent and subsequently heavily theorized upon by the anthropological discipline within the latter half of the nineteenth century as a gateway to the law and order of a society. Disputes have become to be recognised as necessary and constructive over pathological whilst the stated rules of law only explain some aspects of control and compliance. The context and interactions of a dispute are more informative about a culture than the rules.

Classic studies deriving theories of order from disputes include Evans-Pritchard work Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande which focused upon functional disputes surrounding sorcery and witchcraft practices, or Comaroff and Roberts (1981) work among the Tswana which examine the hierarchy of disputes, the patterns of contact and the effect norms affect the course of dispute as norms important to dispute are rarely ''“especially organised for jural purpose”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1957:58).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:

[[Edmund Leach|Leach]], 1954. Political Systems of Highland Burma.
[[Fredrik Barth|Barth]], 1959. Political Leadership among Swat Pathans.

==Case study approach==

Within the history of Legal Anthropology there have been various methods of data gathering adopted; ranging from literature review of traveller/missionary accounts, consulting informants and lengthy participant observation.

Furthermore, when evaluating any research it is appropriate to have a robust methodology capable of scientifically analysing the topic at hand.

The broad method of study by legal anthropologists prevails upon the Case Study Approach first developed by Llewellyn and Hoebel in The Cheyenne Way (1941) not as ''“a philosophy but a technology”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Pospisil, 1973: 541).&lt;/ref&gt;

This methodology is applied to situations of cross-cultural conflict and the correlating resolution, which can have sets of legal notions and jural regularities extracted from them &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1965: pp. 41; Pospisil, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

This method may be safe-guarded against accusations of imposing western ideological structures as it is often an emic sentiment: for example,

''“The Tiv drove me to the case method…what they were interested in. They put a lot of time and effort into cases”''
&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1989: vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues of terminology and ethnology==

Regarding law, in Anthropology’s characteristically self-conscious manner, the comparative analysis inherent to Legal Anthropology has been speculated upon and most famously debated by [[Paul Bohannan]] and [[Max Gluckman]]. The discourse highlights one of the primary differences between British and American Anthropology regarding fieldwork approaches and concerns the imposition of Western terminology as ethnological categories of differing societies.&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each author’s uses the Case Study Approach, however, the data’s presentation in terms of achieving comparativeness is a point of contention between them.

Paul Bohannan promotes the use of native terminology presented with ethnographic meaning as opposed to any Universal categories, which act as barriers to understanding the true nature of a culture’s legal system.

Advocating that it is better to appreciate native terms in their own medium, Bohannan critiques Gluckman’s work for its inherent [[bias]].

Gluckman has argued that Bohannan’s excessive use of native terminology creates barriers when attempting to achieve comparative analysis. He in turn has suggested that in order to further the cross-cultural comparative study of law, we should use English terms and concepts of law which will aid in the refinement of dispute facts and interrelations &lt;ref&gt;(Gluckman, 1965: 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all native terms should be described and translated into an Anglo-American conceptual equivalent for the purpose of comparison.

==Processes==

As disputes and order began to be recognised as categories worthy of study, interest in the inherent aspects of conflicts emerged within legal anthropology. The processes and actors involved within the events became an object of study for ethnographers as they embraced conflict as a data-rich source.

One example of such an interest is expressed by [[Philip Gulliver]], 1963, Social Control in an African Society in which the intimate relations between disputes are postulated as being important. He examines the patterns of alliance between actors of a dispute and the strategies that develop as a result, the roles of mediators and the typologies for intervention.

==Key questions in legal anthropology==

*'''Issues of Legal Pluralism'''.
See ''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15129292 Lyon, 2002] Local arbitration and conflict deferment in Punjab, Pakistan'' or ''Engel, D. 1980. Legal pluralism in an American community: perspectives on a civil trial court.''

*'''The legitimacy of Universal Human Rights'''.
Political anthropologists have had much to say about the UDHR(Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Original critiques, most notably by the AAA(American Anthropological Association), argued that cultural ideas of rights and entitlement differ between societies. They warned that any attempt to endorse one set of values above all others amounted to a new western imperialism, and would be counter to ideas of cultural relativism. Most anthropologists now agree that universal human rights have a useful place in today's world. Zechenter (1997) argues there are practices, such as Indian 'sati' (the burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) that can be said to be wrong, despite justifications of tradition. This is because such practices are about much more than a culturally established world view, and frequently develop or revive as a result of socio-economic conditions and the balance of power within a community. As culture is not bounded and unchanging, there are multiple discourses and moral viewpoints within any community and among the various actors in such events (Merry 2003). Cultural relativists risk supporting the most powerfully asserted position at the expense of those who are subjugated under it.

More recent contributions to the question of universal human rights include analysis of their use in practice, and how global discourses are translated into local contexts (Merry 2003). Anthropologists such as Merry (2006) note how the legal framework of the UNDHR is not static but is actively used by communities around the globe to construct meaning. As much as the document is a product of western Enlightenment thinking, communities have the capacity to shape its meaning to suit their own agendas, incorporating its principles in ways that empower them to tackle their own local and national discontents.

Female genital cutting (FGC), also known as female circumcision or female genital mutilation remains a hotly debated, controversial issue contested particularly among legal anthropologists and human rights activists. Through her ethnography (1989) on the practice of pharonic circumcision among the Hofriyat of Sudan (1989) Boddy maintains that understanding local cultural norms is of crucial importance when considering intervention to prevent the practice. Human rights activists attempting to eradicate FGC using the legal framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR) as their justification, run the risk of imposing a set of ideological principles, alien to the culture attempting to be helped, potentially facing hostile reactions. Moreover, the UNDHR as a legal document, is contested by some as being restrictive in its prescription of what is and is not deemed a violation of a human right (Ross 2003) and  overlooks local customary justifications which operate outside of an international legalistic framework (Ross 2003). Increasingly (FGC) is becoming a global issue due to increased mobility. What was once deemed a largely African practice has seen a steady increase in European countries such as Britain. Although made illegal in 1985 there have as yet been no convictions and girls as old as nine continue to have the procedure. Legislation has now also been passed in Sweden, the United States and France where there have been convictions. Black, J. A. and Debelle, G. D. (1995) "Female Genital Mutilation in Britain" ''British Medical Journal''.

==Further information==
There are a number of useful introductions to the field of legal anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Moore, Sally Falk, ''Law and Anthropology: A Reader'', (edited), Blackwell, 2004, pp. 20-25, {{ISBN|1-4051-0228-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Falk Moore]], a leading legal anthropologist, held both a law degree and a PhD in anthropology. An increasing number of legal anthropologists hold both [[juris doctor|JD]]s and advanced degrees in anthropology, and some teach in [[law school]]s while maintaining scholarly connections within the field of legal anthropology; examples include Rebecca French, John Conley, [[Elizabeth Mertz]], and [[Annelise Riles]]. Such combined expertise has also been turned to more [[applied anthropology|applied anthropological]] pursuits such as tribal advocacy and [[forensic anthropology|forensic ethnography]] by practitioners. There is a growing interest in the intersection of legal and [[linguistic anthropology]].

'''Limit load''' is the maximum load that a structure can safely carry. It's the load at which the structure is in a state of incipient [[plastic deformation|plastic]] collapse. As the load on the structure increases, the displacements increases linearly in the elastic range until the load attains the yield value. Beyond this, the load-displacement response becomes non-linear and the plastic or irreversible part of the displacement increases steadily with the applied load. [[Plasticity (physics)|Plasticity]] spreads throughout the solid and at the limit load, the plastic zone becomes very large and the displacements become unbounded and the component is said to have collapsed.

Any load above the limit load will lead to the formation of [[plastic hinge]] in the structure. [[Engineer]]s use limit states to define and check a structure's performance.

'''Bounding Theorems of Plastic-Limit Load Analysis''':
These theorems provide a way to calculate limit loads without having to solve the [[boundary value problem]] in [[continuum mechanics]]. [[Finite element]] analysis provides an alternative way to estimate limit loads. They are:
*  The Upper Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem&lt;ref name="Bower"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bower|first1=Allan F.|title=Analytical techniques and solutions for plastic solids|url=http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter6_2/Chapter6_2.htm|website=Applied Mechanics of Solids|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Lower Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem&lt;ref name="Bower" /&gt;
* The Lower Bound Shakedown Theorem&lt;ref name="Bower" /&gt;
* The Upper Bound Shakedown Theorem&lt;ref name="Bower" /&gt;

The Upper Bound Plastic Collapse Theorem states that an upper bound to the collapse loads can be obtained by postulating a [[collapse mechanism]] and computing the ratio of its [[plastic dissipation]] to the work done by the applied loads.

'''Maestà''' {{IPA-it|maeˈsta|}}, the Italian word for "majesty", designates an [[Iconography|iconic formula]] of the enthroned [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with the [[child Jesus]], whether or not accompanied with [[angel]]s and [[saint]]s. The ''Maestà'' is an extension of the "[[Seat of Wisdom]]" theme of the seated "Mary [[Theotokos]]", "Mary Mother of God", which is a counterpart to the earlier icon of [[Christ in Majesty]], the enthroned Christ that is familiar in Byzantine [[Mosaics]]. '''''Maria Regina''''' is an art historians' synonym for the [[icon]]ic image of Mary enthroned, with or without the Child.&lt;ref&gt;See M. Lawrence's discussion of this image, "Maria Regina", ''Art Bulletin'' '''7''' (1924–1925:150-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the image seems to have developed, based perhaps on Byzantine precedents such as the coin of Constantine's Empress [[Fausta]], crowned and with their sons on her lap&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Lawrence 1924:&lt;/ref&gt; and on literary examples, such as [[Flavius Cresconius Corippus]]'s celebration of [[Justin II]]'s coronation in 565.&lt;ref&gt;In Corippus' poem, Sophia (Wisdom) prays "''Virgo, creatoris genetrix sanctissima mundi, excelsi regina poli...''". (''Corippus'', A. Cameron, ed., ''In laudem Justini augusti minoris'' (London) 1976, vol. II:52f. The more familiar ''In laudem Mariae'', praising Mary as [[Regina Coeli|Queen of Heaven]], is a late sixth century poem, perhaps by [[Venantius Fortunatus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings depicting the ''Maestà'' came into the mainstream artistic repertory, especially in Rome, in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Several rare examples in fresco and mosaic, including the lost apse mosaic in the first church in Rome dedicated to Mary, the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]], are listed by John L. Osborne, "Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche", ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981:299–310) p. 304f.&lt;/ref&gt; with an increased emphasis on the veneration of Mary. The ''Maestà'' was often executed in [[fresco]] technique directly on plastered walls or as paintings on gessoed wooden [[altar]] [[panel painting|panels]].

A more domestic representation, suitable to private devotion, is the iconographic theme of [[Madonna and Child]].

==Examples of ''Maestà'' in painting==
{{main|Maestà (Duccio)}} 
The most famous example of the ''Maestà'' is the ''Maestà with Twenty Angels and Nineteen Saints'', an [[altarpiece]] comprising many individual paintings commissioned by the city of [[Siena]] in 1308 from the artist [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]]. The painting was installed in the [[Siena Cathedral|city's cathedral]] on June 9, 1311. Although it took a generation for its effect truly to be felt, Duccio's ''Maestà'' set Italian painting on a course leading away from the hieratic representations of Byzantine art towards more direct presentations of reality.

Creating this altarpiece assembled from many wood panels bonded together before painting was an arduous undertaking. The work was not only large, the central panel was 7 by 13 feet, but it had to be painted on both sides since it could be seen from all directions when installed on the main altar at the centre of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the ''Maesta'' were episodes from the life of Christ, focusing on his Passion. Sacred narrative unfolds in elegant episodes enacted by graceful figures who seem to dance their way through these stories while still conveying emotional content.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the ''Maesta'' was dismantled in 1771, its power and beauty can only be imagined from scattered parts, some still in Siena, Italy, but others elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Other noted examples of the ''Maestà'' are [[Simone Martini]]'s ''Maestà'' in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], Siena, or [[Cimabue]]'s fresco in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]].

'''Management of dyslexia''' depends on a multiple of variables; there is no one specific strategy or set of strategies which will work for all who have dyslexia. 

Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.&lt;ref name=Henry1998&gt;{{cite journal

Several [[special education]] approaches have been developed for students with dyslexia. [[Adaptive technology]], such as specialized computer software, has resulted in recent innovations helpful to many people with dyslexia.

One factor that characterises the field of dyslexia remediation is the stream of [[alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities]]. These controversial treatments include nutritional supplements, special diets, [[homeopathy]], and [[osteopathy]]/[[chiropractic]] manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Int J Lang Commun Disord |year=2008 |title= Survey of complementary and alternative therapies used by children with specific learning difficulties (dyslexia) |volume= 44 |author= Bull L |doi=10.1080/13682820802015643 |issue= 2 |pmid=18608596 |pages= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems and orthography==
[[File:Visual-dyslexia.jpg|thumb|290px|Corrective glasses are used to cure visual dyslexia]]
{{details|topic=Orthography|Orthographies and dyslexia}}
A [[writing system]] is a type of [[symbolic system]] used to represent elements or statements expressible in [[language]].
The [[orthography]] of a [[language]] specifies the correct way of using a specific [[writing system]] to write the language. Where more than one writing system is used for a language, for example for [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], there can be more than one orthography.

===Alphabetic orthography===
Most teaching is geared to remediating specific areas of weakness, such as addressing difficulties with phonetic decoding by providing phonics-based tutoring.  Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.&lt;ref name=Henry1998&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite claims of some programs to be "research based", there is very little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular approach to reading instruction as compared to another when used with dyslexic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sed.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/3/171 |title=Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham Based Reading Instruction: A Review of the Literature -- Ritchey and Goeke 40 (3): 171 -- The Journal of Special Education |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor2007&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torgesen (2004) emphasized the importance of explicit instruction for remediation as well as the need for intensity that is completely different from regular classroom instruction.  To make gains in reading, students need highly structured, sequential interactive activities and close monitoring, directly connecting the known with the new, with sufficient time for practice of new skills to build automaticity and fluency. The size of the instructional group is also important, ideally between 1:1 and 1:3.&lt;ref&gt;Birsh, Judith R. (2005).  Research and reading disability. In Judith R. Birsh (Ed), "Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills" (pp. 16-17). Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co. Baltimore, Maryland. {{ISBN|978-1-55766-676-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interventions in a Latin alphabet writing system==

There is little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular program for reading instruction when used with dyslexic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sed.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/3/171 |title=Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham Based Reading Instruction: A Review of the Literature -- Ritchey and Goeke 40 (3): 171 -- The Journal of Special Education |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor2007/&gt;

In 2007 the researchers Joseph Torgesen and Richard Wagner have shown that, when teaching children with reading disabilities, programs including systematic and explicit instruction in phoneme awareness and grapheme-phoneme correspondence are far more successful than programs that do not.

==Academic remediations==
With appropriate instruction, dyslexics can become skilled readers. Appropriate remedial instruction includes using:

* Direct, explicit and comprehensive instruction in the structure of language
* A systematic sequence for teaching individual skills
* Structured information from the simple to the complex
* Simultaneous multisensory approaches, including combinations of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic modalities
* Interaction between student and teacher during instruction of new skills
* Reinforcement throughout the day of newly learned skills
* Integrated spelling and handwriting instruction sequence with reading instruction, so that they are mutually reinforcing
* Extended practice for each skill until the student overlearns the skill (see [[Overlearning]] and [[Automaticity]])
* Ongoing review of previously learned skills
* Careful pacing to avoid information overload
* Intensive instruction until reading, spelling and writing skills are at grade level.
* Repeated reading to help develop fluency and reading rate&lt;ref name="uhry"&gt;Uhry, Joanna Kellogg and Diana Brewster Clark (2004). Dyslexia: theory and practice of instruction. Pro-ed publishers. pp. 88-89. {{ISBN|1-4164-0115-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paired reading to help develop fluency and enhance comprehension.

==Classroom accommodations==
Although there are no treatments or quick cures for dyslexia there are many techniques that can be used to assist dyslexic students in the classroom while reading skills are being remediated. These include such things as:
* Oral testing
* Untimed tests
* Audiobooks
* Eliminate or reduce spelling tests
* Minimizing the need to read out loud &lt;ref&gt;Reid, Gavin. Dyslexia 2nd edition. New York: Continuum International.(2007).Pages 41-95&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allow students to record the Teacher explaining homework (for example on a Dictaphone) to ensure an accurate account of the homework is made.
* Accept dictated homework
* Reduce homework load
* Grade on content, not spelling nor handwriting
* Reduce copying tasks
* Avoid or reduce essay tests
* Providing teacher handouts to supplement the notes taken
* Using materials that are not visually overcrowded
* To increase motivation, giving assignments in areas in which the student has a strong interest, for example, sports stories, biographies of inventors or rock musicians, or fiction about teenage issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allkindsofminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use an appropriate layout, including a larger font size, larger line spacing (1.5) and a clear font - sans-serif fonts are usually recommended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html Dyslexia Style guide from the British Dyslexia Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224433/http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Some dyslexic people are sensitive to the colour of the paper and may find off-white, pale green or pale purple paper can make reading easier. 
* Using appropriate font type and size.  It is suggested{{by whom|date=July 2011}} that [[Sassoon (typeface)|Sassoon]] and [[Comic Sans]] may be the easiest to read; [[Times New Roman]] may be one of the most difficult to read. The font should not be too small. There are several fonts and typefaces designed for dyslexia including ''Gill Dyslexic'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ Gill Dyslexic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924215435/http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ |date=2011-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Read Regular'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readregular.com/english/regular.html Read Regular] typeface&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexia Readable]],  ''Sylexiad'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robsfonts.com/sylexhome.html Sylexiad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709074857/http://www.robsfonts.com/sylexhome.html |date=2013-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenDyslexic]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendyslexic.org/ OpenDyslexic]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cadman'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://pjmiller.deviantart.com/art/Cadman-732272890 Cadman] &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dyslexie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664561/dyslexie-a-typeface-designed-to-help-dyslexics-read Dyslexie] font&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin writing system only). However, although dyslexics may prefer some of these special fonts, there is no evidence that any of the fonts nominally designed for dyslexics helps them read more easily or better,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s-e-o.org/which-font-is-best-for-dyslexic-users-the-science-reviewed/|title=Which Font is Best For Dyslexic Users?

==Recent developments==
[[Accessible publishing]] works to make reading easier for all who struggle with the standard one-size-fits-all method of book publishing. Accessible publishing works with publishers and  [[Print on Demand]] technology which allows the reader to choose how the books will be published. Available format variations include choosing the font size (from 11 point font  through to 28 point font), whether the font is bold, italic or regular, and choosing the amount of line spacing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Format/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a variety of special fonts being developed for dyslexia, eye tracking problems and other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/making-reading-easier/ | work=The New York Times | title=Making Reading Easier | first=Dwight | last=Garner | date=2008-05-20 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some individuals with dyslexia report improved ease of reading with different fonts, these reports are anecdotal; there is little empirical evidence to support the use of "dyslexia fonts". 
Accessible publishers, such as ReadHowYouWant, also work to make books available in [[Braille]], [[e-books]], [[audiobook]]s and [[DAISY]].

New formats such as streamline text&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streamlinetext.com/WhatIsStreamlineTxt.aspx What is streamline text?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233331/http://www.streamlinetext.com/WhatIsStreamlineTxt.aspx |date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed that help dyslexic people to track (move from one line to the next) more fluently. These work by adding 'sign-posts' into the text to show where to go next.

Teachers are also using audiobooks as a way of teaching textbooks in an engaging way to those with dyslexia. In the UK, one of the biggest charities is [[Listening Books]], which offers members a streaming service over the internet. An Australian company, ReadHowYouWant is working to make all published books available in [[audiobook]] form.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Technology/overview.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the nonprofit [[Learning Ally]] offers the world's largest library of human-narrated audio textbooks, and a second organization,  [[Bookshare]], offers a wide selection of synthetic-read audiobooks. These audiobooks work well for individuals who have word reading accuracy and fluency difficulties (i.e. dyslexics).

Individuals with dyslexia require more practice to master skills in their areas of deficit. In the circumstances where typically developing children need 30 to 60 hours training, the number of hours that has resulted in optimistic conclusions concerning the remediation of dyslexia is between 80 and 100 hours, or less if the intervention is started sufficiently early. Only approximately 20% of adults with early reading difficulties have acquired fluent reading skills in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Lyytinen&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lyytinen, Heikki, Erskine, Jane, Aro, Mikko, Richardson, Ulla | contribution = Reading and reading disorders | editor-last = Hoff | editor-first = Erika | title = Blackwell Handbook of Language Development | pages = 454–474 | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4051-3253-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fmri|Functional MRI]] ([[fMRI]]) studies have shown neurological changes in dyslexic children and adults who have used phonological interventions, with improved performance on tests of phonemic awareness and text decoding.&lt;ref name=ClinicalTrial&gt;{{cite journal | title=Neural Changes following Remediation in Adult Developmental Dyslexia (Clinical Study) | journal=Neuron | date=2004-10-28 | first1=Guinevere | last1=Eden |first2=Karen M. |last2=Jones |first3=Katherine |last3=Cappell |first4=Lynn |last4=Gareau |first5=Frank B. |last5=Wood |first6=Thomas A. |last6=Zeffiro |first7=Nicole A.E. |last7=Dietz |first8=John A. |last8=Agnew |first9=D.

[[fMRI]] studies have also shown changes in the brain and spelling improvement of dyslexic children taught [[spelling]] phonetically in an [[orthography|orthographic]] manner.&lt;ref name=Dahms2006&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dahms, Joel. | year = 2006| title = Spelling Out Dyslexia | journal = Northwest Science &amp; Technology |url = https://depts.washington.edu/nwst/issues/index.php?issueID=fall_2006&amp;storyID=800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study has shown that the usage of an FM system drives neural plasticity in children with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hornickel J, Zecker S, Bradlow A, Kraus N |title=Assistive listening devices drive neuroplasticity in children with dyslexia|journal=[PNAS] |year=2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1206628109|pmc=3478599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A FM system is a personal assistive listening device, consisting of a wireless microphone worn by the teacher, and a wireless receiver similar to a Bluetooth receiver worn on the ears by the pupil. Measurements of the brain’s response to speech sounds showed that the children who wore the device for one year responded more consistently to the very soft and rapidly changing elements of sounds that help distinguish one consonant from another (cat, bat, pat etc.). That improved stability was linked with reading improvement based on standardized measures of readability – which, as a long-term benefit, points to brain plasticity.

==National statutory provision and support structures==
{{details|topic=National statutory provision and support structures|:Category:Dyslexia support by country}}
Each country has adopted and developed a [[writing system]] of choice.
Each country has their own Statutes relating to the [[:Category:Education by country|provision of Education]], and special educational needs. The statutory provision framework of support in each country is usually complemented by many independent and voluntary support agencies providing more specialised information and support.

In his metaphysical writings, René Guénon has stated precise definitions concerning key terms in [[metaphysics]]. This article summarizes some of them. Guénon's writings make use of words and terms, of fundamental signification, which receive a precise definition throughout his books. These terms and words, although receiving a usual meaning and being used in many branches of human sciences, have, according to René Guénon, lost substantially their original signification (e.g. words such as "metaphysics", "initiation", "mysticism", "personality", "form", "matter").&lt;ref&gt;c.f. for instance ''The Eastern Metaphysics'' and ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' w.r.t. the meaning of the word "metaphysics", the first chapter of ''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times'' on the meanings of the words "form" and "matter", the chapter "Kundalini-Yoga" in his ''Studies on Hinduism'' about the translation of Sanskrit word  ''samâdhi'' as "ecstasy", ''Man and his Becoming according to Vedânta" on the word "personality", ''Theosophism: History of a Pseudo-Religion" on the word "theosophy" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; This article provides the definition given by René Guénon to some of the words used extensively in his works.

|'''Metaphysics'''
|
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="It may now be stated that metaphysics [...] is essentially the knowledge of the Universal, or, if preferred, the knowledge of the principles belonging to the universal order, which moreover alone can validly lay claim to the name of principles; but in making this statement, we are not really trying to propose a definition of metaphysics, for such a thing is a sheer impossibility by reason of that very universality which we look upon as the foremost of its characteristics, the one from which all the other are derived. In reality, only something that is limited is capable of definition, whereas by definition metaphysics is on the contrary by its very nature absolutely unlimited, and this plainly does not allow our enclosing it in a more or less narrow formula [...]."|source=''[[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'', part II, « The general characteristics of eastern thought », chapter V: « Essential characters of metaphysics », p. 70.
}}
|-
|'''Identity of the knowing and being'''
|
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="Metaphysics affirms the fundamental identity of knowing and being [...] and since this identity is essentially implied of the very nature of intellectual intuition, it not merely affirms it but realizes it as well."|source=''Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines'', p. 155.
}}
|-
|'''[[Initiation]] and mysticism'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="Today the esoteric or initiatic domain and the mystical domain&amp;nbsp;– or, if one prefers, their respective points of view&amp;nbsp;– are often confused [...]. it is currently the fashion so to speak among those with limited horizons to construe all Eastern doctrines as 'mystical', including those that lack even a semblance of the outward aspects that could justify such an attribution [...]. [...] in everything pertaining to initiation there is really nothing vague or nebulous, for on the contrary it is as precise and 'positive' as can be, so that initiation by its very nature is in fact incompatible with mysticism."|source=''Perspectives on initiation'', chapter 1: « The initiatic and mystical paths », p. 8.
}}
|-
|'''[[Initiation]]'''
|
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] initiation is essentially the transmission of a spiritual influence, a transmission that can only take place through a regular, traditional organization, so that one cannot speak of initiation outside of an affiliation with an organization of this kind. We have explained that 'regularity' must be understood to exclude all pseudo-initiatic organizations, which, regardless of pretention and outward appearance, in no way possess any spiritual influence and thus are incapable of transmitting anything."|source=''Perspectives on initiation'', chapter 8: « Initiatic transmission », p. 48.
}}
|-
|The '''Self'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The 'Self' is the transcendent and permanent principle of which the manifested being, the human being, for example, is only a transient and contingent modification, a modification which, moreover, can in no way affect the principle [...] The 'Self', as such, is never individualized and cannot become so, for since it must always be considered under the aspect of the eternity and immutability which are the necessary attributes of pure Being, it is obviously not susceptible of any particularization, which would cause it to be 'other that itself'. Immutable in its own nature, it develops the indefinite possibilities which it contains within itself, by a relative passing from potency to act through an indefinite series of degrees. Its essential permanence is not thereby affected, precisely because this process is only relative, and because this development is, strictly speaking, not a development at all, except from the point of view of manifestation, outside of which there is no question of succession, but only of perfect simultaneity, so that even what is virtual under one aspect, is found nevertheless to be realized in the 'eternal present'."|source=''[[Man and his Becoming according to the Vedanta]]'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 23.
}}
|-
|'''[[Paramatman|Paramâtmâ]], individuality, personality'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] Previously, on the contrary [i.e. prior to the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosphists]]], even in the West, whenever any distinction has been made between these two terms ['individuality' or 'ego' and 'personality'] the personality has always been regarded as superior to individuality [...] The 'Self' [...] considered in relation to a being, is properly speaking the personality; it is true that one might restrict the use of this latter word to the 'Self' as principle of the manifested states, just as the 'Divine Personality', '''[[Ishvara|Ishwara]]''', is the Principle of universal Manifestation; but one can also extend it analogically to the 'Self' as principle of all states of the being, both manifested and unmanifested. The personality is an immediate determination, primordial and non-particularized, of the principle which in Sanskrit is called '''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atmâ]]''' or '''[[Paramatman|Paramâtmâ]]''', and which, in default of a better term, we may call the 'Universal Spirit', on the clear understanding, however, that in this use of the word 'spirit', nothing is implied that might recall Western philosophical conceptions, and, in particular, that is not turned into a correlative of 'matter', as the modern mind is inclined to do, being subject in this respect, even though unconsciously, to the influence of Cartesian dualism."|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 24.
}}
|-
|'''Universal and individual'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The 'Self', in relation to any being whatsoever, is in reality identical with Atmâ, since it is essentially beyond all distinction and all particularization; and that is why, in Sanskrit, the same word âtman, in cases other than the nominative, replaces the reflexive pronoun 'itself'. The 'Self is not therefore really distinct from Atmâ, except when one considers it [...] in relation to a certain definite state of being, such as the human state [...]. In this case, moreover, the 'Self' does not really become distinct from Atmâ in any way, since [...] it [...] cannot be affected by the point of view from which we regard it [...]. What should be noted is that to the extent that we make this distinction, we are departing from the direct consideration of the 'Self' in order to consider its reflection in human individuality [...]. The reflection in question determines what may be called the center of this individuality; but if isolated from its principle, that is, from the 'Self', it can only enjoy a purely illusory existence, for it is from that principle that it derives all its reality, and it effectually possesses this reality only through participation in the nature of the 'Self', that is, insofar as it is identified therewith by universalization. &lt;br /&gt;
The personality [...] belongs essentially to the order of principles in the strictest sense of the word, that is, to the universal order [...]. [The] following table [...] sets forth the essential distinctions in this connection [...]:"&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:R Guenon Universal.png]]|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », pp. 26-27.
}}
|-
|'''Manifestation and non-manifestation'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] the Universal will [not only] consist solely of the unmanifested, but will also extend to the formless, comprising both the unmanifested and the supra-individual states of manifestation. As for the individual, it includes all degrees of formal manifestation, that is, all states in which beings are invested with forms, for what properly characterizes individuality and essentially constitutes it as such is precisely the presence of form among the limitative conditions which define and determine a given state of existence. We can now sum up these further considerations in the following table:"&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:R Guenon Manifestation.png]]|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 27.
}}
&lt;br/&gt;Note: in another text, René Guénon will identify what is called here '''formless manifestation''', or '''formless states of being''', with certain ''angelic states'', as they are called in religious (exoteric) formulations.
|-
|'''The human state of being'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The "gross state" in fact is nothing else than the corporeal existence itself, to which [...] human individuality belongs by one of its modalities only, and not in its integral development. As to the "subtle state", it includes, in the first place, the extra-corporeal modalities of the human being, or of every other being situated in the same state of existence, and also, in the second place, all other individual states [...] It may be said, therefore, that the human being, considered in its integrality, comprises a certain sum of possibilities which constitute its corporeal or gross modality, and in addition, a multitude of other possibilities, which, extending in different directions beyond the corporeal modality, constitute its subtle modalities; but all these possibilities together represent, nonetheless, one and the same degree of universal Existence. It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] this that human individuality is at once much more and much less than Westerners generally suppose it to be: much more, because they recognize in it scarcely anything except the corporeal modality, which includes but the smallest fraction of its possibilities; much less, however, because this individuality, far from really constituting the whole being, is but one state of that being among an indefinite multitude of other states. Moreover the sum of all these states is still nothing at all in relation to the personality, which alone is the true being, because it alone represents its permanent and unconditioned state, and because there is nothing else which can be considered as absolutely real."|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 28.
}}
|-
|'''Samâdhi and ecstasy'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] let us also point out the impropriety of translating samâdhi as "ecstasy", this latter being all the more irksome as it is normally used in Western languages to designate mystical states, that is to say something of an altogether different order, with which it must not be confused; its etymological signification moreover is "to go out of oneself" (which suits very well the case of mystical states), whereas what the term samâdhi designates is quite to the contrary a "return" of the being into its own Self."|source=''Studies in Hinduism'', chapter 3: « Kundalinî Yoga », note 3, pp. 17-18.
}}
|-
|'''Form, matter, essence and substance'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="Understood [...] with reference to particular beings, essence and substance are in effect the same as the "form and "matter" of the scholastic philosophers; but it is better to avoid the use of these latter terms because, doubtless owing to an imperfection of the Latin language in this connection, they only convey rather inaccurately the ideas they ought to express [...]"|source=''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of Times'', chapter 1: « Quality and Quantity », p. 12.
}}
|-
|'''Matter and the principle of individuation'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] the individuals of any one species all participate in a common nature, which is that of the species itself, and is in all of them equally; how then does it come about that, in spite of this community of nature, these individuals are distinct beings, or even that they are in any way distinguishable one from another ? [...] the question could [...] be formulated in this way: of what order is the determination which is added to specific nature so that individuals may become separate beings while remaining within the species ?It is this determination that the scholastics relate to "matter", that is to say ultimately to quantity [...] and thus "matter" or quantity appears distinctly as a principle of "separativity"."|source=''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of Times'', chapter 6: « The Principle of Individuation », p. 47.

'''Northeast Forestry University''' ('''NEFU'''; {{zh|s=东北林业大学|t=東北林業大學|p=Dōngběi Línyè Dàxué}}), located in [[Harbin]], [[Heilongjiang Province]], is an institution of higher education and research under jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]], serve as the largest forestry university in China and a key university within the scope of national "[[211 Project]]". It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Gate of NEFU.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The main entrance of NEFU, the school gate since established]]
Founded in 1952, Northeast Forestry University (NEFU) was formed by the combination of both [[Zhejiang University]] and Forestry Department of [[Northeast Agricultural University|Northeast Agricultural College]], and one of the three oldest institutions for forestry education and research all over the country.

==Location==
Northeast Forestry University is located in the city of [[Harbin]], the center of the region with China's largest state-owned forests. Its campus covers more than 136 [[hectares]] with teaching buildings, scientific research laboratories and practice sites. In addition, there are several practice centers which include the Maoershan Experimental Forestry Center (Maoershan National Forest Park) and the Liangshui Experimental Forestry Center (Liangshui National Nature Reserve) etc. Therefore,the university has a total area of 33,000 hectares.

The campus covers 136 hectares, there are 15 dormitories, and only one dining hall. As a university which has more than 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled, the population density is larger than other universities in China.

==Academics &amp; Research==
[[Image:The main building.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Main Building]]

NEFU is presently a multidisciplinary university with forestry as its leading field and offers a unique specialization in forestry engineering. NEFU has also specializes in forestry-related aspects of agriculture, science, engineering, economy, management, liberal arts and law. The university at present is composed of sixteen schools and two departments．There are five post-doctoral scientific research programs, four first-level and thirty-two second-level doctoral degree programs. In addition, there are also ten first-level, seventy-five second-level master's degree programs, three types of special discipline master's degree programs in nine fields and fifty-seven undergraduate programs. NEFU has two national first-level key disciplines, two national second-level key disciplines, six key disciplines authorized by the State Forestry Administration, two key discipline groups authorized by Heilongjiang Province, four Heilongjiang Provincial first-level key disciplines, and fifteen Heilongjiang Provincial subordinate key disciplines. With the approval of National Planning Commission and Ministry of Education, NEFU runs the national training centers of life science and technology. In addition, NEFU operates the teaching and research centers of basic sciences particularly in biology, which are also approved by the Ministry of Education.

NEFU has excellent facilities for teaching, research and practice, with one national scientific observation key station (Maoershan forestry ecological system location station), three key laboratories of Ministry of Education, four key laboratories of the State Forestry Administration, and forty-nine research institutions. There are also nine practice sites within the school, including the Maoershan Experimental Forestry Center and Liangshui Experimental Forestry Center and 180 bases outside the school.

[[File:Blutkreislauf.png|thumbnail|right|Blood circulation: Red = oxygenated (arteries), Blue = deoxygenated (veins)]]

'''Oxygen saturation''' is the fraction of [[oxygen]]-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the [[blood]]. The human body requires and regulates a very precise and specific balance of oxygen in the blood.  Normal '''blood oxygen levels''' in humans are considered 95–100 percent. If the level is below 90 percent, it is considered low resulting in [[hypoxemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hypoxemia/MY00219|work=Mayo Clinic|publisher=mayoclinic.com|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood oxygen levels below 80 percent may compromise organ function, such as the brain and heart, and should be promptly addressed. Continued low oxygen levels may lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest. [[Oxygen therapy]] may be used to assist in raising blood oxygen levels. Oxygenation occurs when [[Allotropes of oxygen#Dioxygen|oxygen]] molecules ({{chem|O|2}}) enter the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the body. For example, [[blood]] is oxygenated in the [[lung]]s, where oxygen molecules travel from the air and into the blood. Oxygenation is commonly used to refer to medical oxygen saturation.

==Definition==
[[File:Oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve.png|thumb|Haemoglobin saturation curve.]]
In [[medicine]], '''oxygen saturation''', commonly referred to as "sats", measures the percentage of [[hemoglobin]] binding sites in the bloodstream occupied by oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3PJVLH1NmQAC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=definition+of+oxygen+saturation+so2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi42bWkksPKAhVHrD4KHfZcC0QQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20oxygen%20saturation%20so2&amp;f=false|title=Clinical Laboratory Medicine|author=Kenneth D. McClatchey|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|location=[[Philadelphia]]|year=2002|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low partial pressures of oxygen, most hemoglobin is deoxygenated. At around 90% (the value varies according to the clinical context) oxygen saturation increases according to an [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve]] and approaches 100% at partial oxygen pressures of &gt;10 kPa. A [[pulse oximeter]] relies on the light absorption characteristics of saturated hemoglobin to give an indication of oxygen saturation.

== Physiology==
The body maintains a stable level of oxygen saturation for the most part by chemical processes of [[aerobic metabolism]] associated with [[breathing]]. Using the [[respiratory system]], red blood cells, specifically the [[hemoglobin]], gather oxygen in the lungs and distribute it to the rest of the body. The needs of the body's blood oxygen may fluctuate such as during exercise when more oxygen is required &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Blood Oxygen Levels at Rest|url=http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/cardio/understanding-blood-oxygen-levels-at-rest.html#b|work=fitday.com|publisher=fitday.com|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when living at higher altitudes. A blood cell is said to be "saturated" when carrying a normal amount of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellison|first=Bronwyn|title=NORMAL RANGE OF BLOOD OXYGEN LEVEL|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/124374-normal-range-blood-oxygen-level/|work=Livestrong.com|publisher=Livestrong.com|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both too high and too low levels can have adverse effects on the body. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=Need citation for adverse effects of high oxygen saturation}}

==Measurement==
An SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (arterial oxygen saturation, as determined by an [[arterial blood gas test]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://incenter.medical.philips.com/doclib/enc/fetch/586262/586457/Understanding_Pulse_Oximetry.pdf%3Fnodeid%3D586458%26vernum%3D2|title=Understanding Pulse Oximetry: SpO2 Concepts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Philips Medical Systems|access-date=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) value below 60% causes [[hypoxemia]] (which can also be caused by [[anemia]]). Hypoxemia due to low SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is indicated by [[cyanosis]]. Oxygen saturation can be measured in different tissues:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Venous oxygen saturation (SvO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured to see how much oxygen the body consumes. Under clinical treatment, a SvO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; below 90% indicates that the body is in lack of oxygen, and [[ischemic]] diseases occur. This measurement is often used under treatment with a heart-lung machine (extracorporeal circulation), and can give the perfusionist an idea of how much flow the patient needs to stay healthy.
* Tissue oxygen saturation (StO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be measured by [[near infrared spectroscopy]]. Although the measurements are still widely discussed, they give an idea of tissue oxygenation in various conditions.
* Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an estimation of the oxygen saturation level usually measured with a [[pulse oximeter]] device. It can be calculated with [[pulse oximetry]] according to the following formula:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

:&lt;math chem&gt;S_\ce{pO2}=\frac\ce{HbO2}\ce{{HbO2}+Hb}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

where HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is oxygenated haemoglobin and Hb is deoxygenated haemoglobin

==Pulse oximetry==
{{Main article|Pulse oximetry}}
[[File:Wrist-oximeter.jpg|thumbnail|right|Example pulse oximeter]] Pulse oximetry is a method used to estimate the percentage of oxygen bound to [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name=Aguilar&gt;E. Aguilar Pelaez et al., "LED power reduction trade-offs for ambulatory pulse oximetry," 2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Lyon, 2007, pp. 2296-2299.
doi: 10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352784, URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4352784&amp;isnumber=4352185&lt;/ref&gt; This approximation to SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is designated SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (peripheral oxygen saturation). The pulse oximeter consists of a small device that clips to the body (typically a finger, earlobe or an infant's foot) and transfers its readings to a reading meter by wire or wirelessly. The device uses light-emitting diodes in conjunction with a light-sensitive sensor to measure the absorption of red and infrared light in the extremity. The difference in absorption between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin makes the calculation possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Healthy individuals at sea level usually exhibit oxygen saturation values between 96% and 99%, and should be above 94%. At 1,600 meters' altitude (about one [[mile]] high) oxygen saturation should be above 92%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Normal oxygen level | work = National Jewish Health | publisher = [[MedHelp]]  | date = February 23, 2009 | url = http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Respiratory-Disorders/Normal-oxygen-level/show/760829 | accessdate = 2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (arterial oxygen saturation) value below 90% causes [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (which can also be caused by [[anemia]]). Hypoxia due to low SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is indicated by [[cyanosis]], but oxygen saturation does not directly reflect tissue oxygenation. The affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen may impair or enhance oxygen release at the tissue level. Oxygen is more readily released to the tissues (i.e., [[hemoglobin]] has a lower affinity for oxygen) when pH is decreased, body temperature is increased, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is increased, and 2,3-DPG levels (a byproduct of glucose metabolism also found in stored blood products) are increased. When the hemoglobin has greater affinity for oxygen, less is available to the tissues. Conditions such as increased pH, decreased temperature, decreased PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and decreased 2,3-DPG will increase oxygen binding to the hemoglobin and limit its release to the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacn.org/WD/Practice/Docs/ch_14_PO.pdf|title=Oxygen Saturation Monitoring by Pulse Oximetry|last=Schutz|first=|date=2001|website=American Association of Critical Care Nurses|format=PDF|dead-url=yes|access-date=September 10, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131222646/http://www.aacn.org/WD/Practice/Docs/ch_14_PO.pdf|archivedate=January 31, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|posse comitatus}}
The '''''posse comitatus''''', in [[common law]], is the group of people mobilized by the conservator of peace – usually the sheriff – to suppress lawlessness or defend the county. The posse comitatus originated in [[ninth century]] [[England]] simultaneous with the creation of the office of sheriff. Though generally obsolete throughout the world, it remains theoretically, and sometimes practically, part of the United States legal system.

==Etymology==
The term derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:posse#Latin|posse]] [[:wikt:comitatus|comitātūs]],'' "power" or "force of the county", in English use from the late 16th century, shortened to posse from the mid 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "posse ''n''. 2, ''posse comitatus.''&lt;/ref&gt;
While the original meaning refers to a group of citizens assembled by the authorities to deal with an emergency (such as suppressing a riot or pursuing felons), the term is also used for any force or band, especially with hostile intent, often also figuratively or humorously.&lt;ref&gt;
"All the Posse of Hell, cannot violently eject me." T. Fuller, ''Good Thoughts in Bad Times'' (1645) I. xv. 39.
"A whole posse of the young lady's kindred – brothers, cousins and uncles – stood ready at the street door to usher me upstairs." W. Beckford Portuguese Jrnl. 10 June 1787, p. 72.  (cited after [[OED]]).
&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th-century usage, ''posse comitatus'' also acquires the generalized or figurative meaning.&lt;ref&gt;"I can lick the whole posser-commertatus of yer. Come on, yer cowards!" ''Harper's'' Magazine July 1862, 184/1 (cited after [[OED]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

===English Civil War===
{{cns|date=November 2018|In 1642, during the early stages of the [[First English Civil War#Overview|English Civil War]], local forces were employed everywhere by all sides that could. The powers responsible produced valid written authority, inducing the locals to assemble. The two most common authorities used were the ''[[Militia Ordinance]]'' on the side of the [[Roundheads|Parliament]] and that of the king, the old-fashioned ''[[Commissions of Array]]''. But the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] leader in [[Cornwall]], Sir [[Ralph Hopton]], [[indict]]ed the enemy before the [[grand jury]] of the county as disturbers of the peace, and had the ''posse comitatus'' called out to expel them.}}

===In law===
The powers of sheriffs in England and Wales for ''posse comitatus'' were codified by section 8 of the [[Sheriffs Act 1887]], the first subsection of which stated that:

{{quote|Every person in a [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] shall be ready and apparelled at the command of the sheriff and at the cry of the country to arrest a felon whether within a franchise or without, and in default shall on conviction be liable to a fine, and if default be found in the lord of the franchise he shall forfeit the franchise to the Queen, and if in the bailiff he shall be liable besides the fine to imprisonment for not more than one year, or if he have not whereof to pay the fine, than two years.|[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1887/pdf/ukpga_18870055_en.pdf section 8, Sheriffs Act 1887 (as passed)]}}

This permitted the [[High sheriff|(high) sheriff]] of each county to call every citizen to his assistance to catch a person who had committed a [[felony]]—that is, a serious crime. It provided for fines for those who did not comply. The provisions for ''posse comitatus'' were repealed by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1186125&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1186169 Schedule 3, Part III, Criminal Law Act 1967]&lt;/ref&gt; The second subsection provided for the sheriff to take "the power of the county" if he faced resistance whilst executing a [[writ]], and provided for the arrest of resisters.&lt;ref name="S8 SA 1887"&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1887/pdf/ukpga_18870055_en.pdf section 8, Sheriffs Act 1887 (as passed)]&lt;/ref&gt; This subsection is still in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1060203&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1060216 section 8, Sheriffs Act 1887 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The ''posse comitatus'' power continues to exist in those common law [[U.S. state|states]] that have not expressly repealed it by [[statute]]. As an example, it is codified in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] under OCGA 17-4-24: {{quote|Every law enforcement officer is bound to execute the penal warrants given to him to execute. He may summon to his assistance, either in writing or orally, any of the citizens of the neighborhood or county to assist in the execution of such warrants. The acts of the citizens formed as a posse by such officer shall be subject to the same protection and consequences as official acts.}}

{{cns|date=November 2018|Resorting to the ''posse comitatus'' figures often{{whom?|date=November 2018}} in the [[plot device|plots]] of [[Western movie]]s, where the body of men recruited is frequently referred to as a ''posse.'' Based on this usage, the word ''"posse"'' has come to be used [[colloquialism|colloquially]] to refer to various teams, cliques, or gangs, often in pursuit of a crime suspect (on horseback in the [[western (genre)|western]]s), sometimes without legal authority.}}

In a number of states, especially in the [[Western United States]], sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies have called their civilian auxiliary groups "posses." The [[Lattimer Massacre]] of 1897 illustrated the danger of such groups, and thus ended their use in situations of [[civil unrest]]. Posse comitatus in America became not an instrument of royal prerogative, but an institution of local self-governance.  The posse functioned through, rather than upon, the local popular will.&lt;ref name="foo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7539&amp;context=jclc |title=The Posse Comitatus And The Office Of Sheriff: Armed Citizens Summoned To The Aid Of Law Enforcement  |last=Kopel |first=David B. |work=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Volume 104, Issue 4; Symposium On Guns In America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1850 to 1878, the federal government had expanded its power over individuals.  This was done to safeguard national property rights for slaveholders, emancipate millions of enslaved African Americans, and enforce the doctrine of formal equality.  The rise of the federal state, like the marketplace before it, had created contradictory but congruous forces of liberation and compulsion upon individuals.&lt;ref name="Comitatus"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-history-review/article/federal-posse-comitatus-doctrine-slavery-compulsion-and-statecraft-in-midnineteenthcentury-america/0CEB8331A196539D1AE2246D48D6D0D2 |title= The Federal Posse Comitatus Doctrine: Slavery, Compulsion, and Statecraft in Mid-Nineteenth-Century America |last=Gautham |first=Rao|date=2005 |work=Law and History Review, Volume 26, Issue 1; Spring 2005, pp. 1–56. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt;

In the early decades of the republic, before slavery became a major conflict, federal use of posse comitatus in the states was rare and sporadic.&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt; But the federal posse comitatus, quite literally, had compelled all of America to accept the legitimacy of slavery.&lt;ref name="Comitatus" /&gt;  In an exhaustive study of lynching in Colorado, historian Stephen Leonard defines lynching very broadly; he includes the people's courts and even posses (which by definition were led by sheriffs).&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Leonard, Stephen J."&gt;“Lynching in Colorado, 1859–1919” (University Press Colorado, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Indisputably, historical records link violent lawlessness, and even lynchings, to posse comitatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://siouxlandobserver.blogspot.com/2018/04/hate-normalized-posse-comitatus.html |title=Hate Normalized: Posse Comitatus?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a federal statute known as the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], enacted in 1878, forbade the use of the [[United States Army]], and through it, its offspring, the [[United States Air Force]], as a ''posse comitatus'' or for law enforcement purposes without the approval of Congress. {{citation needed span|date=October 2018|While the act does not explicitly mention the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]], the [[Department of the Navy]] has prescribed regulations that are generally construed to give the act force with respect to those services as well.}}

In 2013, a directive &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northcom.mil/Newsroom/Fact-Sheets/Article-View/Article/563993/the-posse-comitatus-act/ |title=Department of Defense Directive 5525.5  |work=The Posse Comitatus Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] directly addresses this issue: it prohibits the use of the [[United States Army]], the [[United States Navy]], the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]] for law enforcement.

The limitation also does not apply to the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] when activated by a state's governor and operating in accordance with [[Title 32 of the United States Code|Title 32 of the U.S. Code]] (for example, National Guardsmen were used extensively by state governors during [[Hurricane Katrina]] response actions). Conversely, the limitation would apply to the National Guard when activated by the President and operating in accordance with [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10 of the U.S. Code]].&lt;ref&gt;U.

===Notable posses===

====Pierce County, 1856====
In response to the dispatch of militia by the Governor of [[Washington Territory]] [[Isaac Stevens]] to arrest [[Francis A. Chenoweth]], the chief justice of the territory's Supreme Court who was holding court in the Pierce County Courthouse, the sheriff of [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] deputized 50 to 60 citizens for the defense of the court. The standoff between the posse and the militia was ultimately resolved by negotiation and the latter withdrew.&lt;ref name="kaylor"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Floyd |first1=Kaylor |title=Washington, West of the Cascades: Historical and Descriptive; the Explorers, the Indians, the Pioneers, the Modern, Volume 1 |date=1917 |publisher=S. J. Clarke Publishing Company |pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Luzerne County, 1897====
Marking the last "significant" use of a posse, in 1897 the sheriff of [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]] deputized 100 citizens to supplement 50 deputy sheriffs in confronting 400 striking mine workers at the Latimer Mines. Ensuing violence left 19 strikers dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Wilbur R. |title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia |date=2012 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=1483305937 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vs9wCQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinsdale County, 1994====
In 1994, after violent bank robbers fled from [[Mineral County, Colorado]] into remote [[Hinsdale County, Colorado]] - which, at the time, had three full-time law enforcement officers for its 500 residents – the county's sheriff summoned the power of the county; more than 100 deputized citizens were directed in house to house searches for the fugitives. The robbers were killed as the posse closed on their location.&lt;ref name="kopt"/&gt;

===Legal status===

====Case law====
Following the [[Baltimore riot of 1968]], 1500 lawsuits were filed against the city of [[Baltimore]] seeking compensation for damages sustained due to the failure of the police to suppress the unrest. The city sought declaratory judgment arguing that it could not be liable for any failures of the Baltimore municipal police, as it was an agency of the [[State of Maryland]] and the city had no law enforcement authority. In rejecting the argument, the Maryland Court of Appeals observed that Baltimore, as an [[independent city]] and – therefore – a county equivalent, was still in possession of the ability to summon the power of the county as that right had not explicitly been repealed by statute and, therefore, remained part of the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City of Baltimore v. Silver, 283 A.2d 788 (Md. 1972) |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2317452/city-of-baltimore-v-silver/ |website=courtlistener.com |publisher=Court Listener |accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted:

{{quote|We are therefore of the opinion that the powers associated with that of a conservator of the peace and the power to form a "posse comitatus," which is included in the powers of a conservator of the peace, were powers available for employment by the City, through the Mayor, should the exercise of reasonable diligence have dictated that they be used.}}

====Statute law====

=====State provisions=====
Writing in the ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', David Kopel observed that almost all U.S. states provide statutory authority for sheriffs, or other local officials, to summon the power of the county. In many cases, civil and criminal penalties are prescribed for members of the public who shirk posse duty when summoned; [[South Carolina]] provides that "any person refusing to assist as one of the posse . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction shall be fined not less than thirty nor more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned for thirty days" while in [[New Hampshire]] a fine of "not more than $20" has been set.&lt;ref name="kopt"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kopel |first1=David |title=The Posse Comitatus And The Office Of Sheriff: Armed Citizens Summoned To The Aid Of Law Enforcement |journal=The Posse Comitatus And The Office Of Sheriff: Armed Citizens Summoned To The Aid Of Law Enforcement |date=Fall 2015 |volume=104 |issue=4 |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7539&amp;context=jclc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Federal provisions=====
Title 42 of the [[United States Code]] extends the authority to summon the power of the county to [[United States magistrate judge]]s when necessary to enforce their orders:

{{quote|... persons so appointed shall have authority to summon and call to their aid the bystanders or ''posse comitatus'' of the proper county, or such portion of the land or naval forces of the United States, or of the militia, as may be necessary to the performance of the duty with which they are charged ...}}

{{wiktionary|pounce}}
[[Image:PounceSprinkler.JPG|thumb|220px|A ''Pounce pot'' (or sprinkler) at the [[London Science Museum]]]]
'''Pounce''' is a fine powder, most often made from powdered [[cuttlefish bone]], that was used both to dry ink and to sprinkle on a rough writing surface to make it smooth enough for writing. This last was certainly needed if the paper came "[[Sizing|unsized]]", that is, lacking the thin gelatinous material used to fill the surface of the paper and make it smooth enough for writing with a [[quill]] or a [[nib (pen)|steel nib]]. It was also used to prepare the surface when [[Technical drawing|drafting]] with [[Technical pen|Rapidiograph pens]] on mylar, a common drafting medium in the late twentieth century. 

Although some people claim that pounce was never added afterwards to dry ink, this probably represents confusion between the two processes of preparing paper and drying the ink after writing. Experiment shows that using pounce does indeed smooth "unsized" paper but then does little or nothing to dry the ink after you have written on that prepared paper, and it is clearly the case that pouncing or sanding continued long after properly "sized" writing paper came into general use during the nineteenth century. 

The pounce or sand is gently sprinkled all over the writing on the paper. When using a quill or a steel nib, and with inks that are made up to match those typically in use during the 18th or 19th centuries, and provided the pen has been used with the fine strokes typical of handwriting of that period, the handwriting will be sufficiently dry within 10 seconds to allow the paper to be folded without blotting. Gently vibrating the paper whilst the pounce or sand is on it ensures that little or no pounce or sand sticks to the handwriting and excess sand or pounce is shaken off before folding the paper. 

In the 19th century the pounce pots or sanders often had a shallow dish round the top so that pounce or sand could be returned to the pot and reused. The process is very effective for quickly drying ink, and although [[blotting paper]] has been available since Tudor times, pounce or sand continued to be used throughout the nineteenth century because it was often cheaper.

[[Image:Salix scouleriana.seed.jpg|thumb|right|250px|seed of Scouler's willow (''Salix scouleriana'')]]
In [[botany]], the '''radicle''' is the first part of a [[seedling]] (a growing plant [[embryo]]) to emerge from the [[seed]] during the process of [[germination]]. The ''radicle'' is the embryonic [[root]] of the plant, and grows downward in the soil (the shoot emerges from the [[plumule]]). Above the radicle is the embryonic [[Plant stem|stem]] or '''''[[hypocotyl]]''''', supporting the [[cotyledon]](s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/radicle|title=radicle {{!}} plant anatomy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is the embryonic root inside the seed. It is the first thing to emerge from a seed and down into the ground to allow the seed to suck up water and send out its leaves so that it can start photosynthesizing.

The radicle emerges from a seed through the '''''[[wikt:micropyle|micropyle]]. '''''Radicles in seedlings are classified into two main types.  Those pointing away from the seed coat scar or '''''[[Hilum (biology)|hilum]]''''' are classified as '''''antitropous''''', and those pointing towards the ''hilum'' are '''''syntropous'''''.

If the radicle begins to decay, the seedling undergoes preemergence damping-off.  This disease appears on the radicle as darkened spots.  Eventually, it causes death of the seedling.

The plumule is the baby shoot. It grows after the radicle.

In 1880 [[Charles Darwin]] published a book about plants he had studied, [[The Power of Movement in Plants]], where he mentions the radicle.
{{quote|
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle thus endowed [..] acts like the brain of one of the lower animals; the brain being situated within the anterior end of the body, receiving impressions from the sense-organs, and directing the several movements.}}

== Philosophical problems ==
Some of the problems considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] are the following:

*Explain the effectiveness of mathematics in the study of the physical world: "At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated inquiring minds. How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" —[[Albert Einstein]], in ''Geometry and Experience'' (1921).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]], [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Einstein_geometry.html Geometry and Experience].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clearly delineate mathematics and physics: For some results or discoveries, it is difficult to say to which area they belong: to the mathematics or to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bergé, [https://books.google.com/books?id=umFTtQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Des+rythmes+au+chaos%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=65aEU7LAKeHL8AHc74HwBg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Des rythmes au chaos].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Primary and secondary cotton roots.jpg|thumb|right|Primary and secondary roots in a cotton plant]]

'''Root pressure''' is the transverse osmotic pressure within the cells of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Structure and Function of Roots: Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Structure and Function of Roots, June 20–26, 1993 |volume= 58 |editor1= F. Baluska|editor2=Milada Ciamporová|editor3=Otília Gasparíková|editor4=Peter W. Barlow |edition= illustrated |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year= 2013 |isbn= 9789401731010 |page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Root pressure occurs in the [[xylem]] of some [[vascular plant]]s when the soil moisture level is high either at night or when [[transpiration]] is low during the day. When transpiration is high, xylem sap is usually under tension, rather than under pressure, due to [[transpirational pull]]. At night in some plants, root pressure causes [[guttation]] or exudation of drops of xylem sap from the tips or edges of leaves. Root pressure is studied by removing the shoot of a plant near the soil level. Xylem sap will exude from the cut [[Plant stem|stem]] for hours or days due to root pressure. If a pressure gauge is attached to the cut stem, the root pressure can be measured.

Root pressure is caused by active distribution of mineral nutrient ions into the [[root]] xylem. Without transpiration to carry the ions up the stem, they accumulate in the root xylem and lower the [[water potential]]. Water then diffuses from the soil into the root xylem due to [[osmosis]]. Root pressure is caused by this accumulation of water in the xylem pushing on the rigid cells. Root pressure provides a force, which pushes water up the stem, but it is not enough to account for the movement of water to leaves at the top of the tallest [[tree]]s. The maximum root pressure measured in some plants can raise water only to 6.87 meters, and the tallest trees are over 100 meters tall.

==Role of endodermis==
The [[endodermis]] in the root is important in the development of root pressure. The endodermis is a single layer of cells between the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] and the [[pericycle]]. These cells allow water movement until it reaches the [[Casparian strip]], made of [[suberin]], a waterproof substance. The Casparian strip prevents mineral nutrient ions from moving passively through the endodermal cell walls. Water and ions move in these cell walls via the [[apoplast pathway]]. Ions outside the endodermis must be [[active transport|actively transported]] across an endodermal cell membrane to enter or exit the endodermis. Once inside the endodermis, the ions are in the symplast pathway. They cannot diffuse back out again but can move from cell to cell via [[plasmodesmata]] or be actively transported into the xylem. Once in the xylem vessels or tracheids, ions are again in the apoplast pathway. Xylem vessels and tracheids transport water up the plant but lack cell membranes. The Casparian strip substitutes for their lack of cell membranes and prevents accumulated ions from diffusing passively in apoplast pathway out of the endodermis. The ions accumulating interior to the endodermis in the xylem create a water potential gradient and by osmosis, water diffuses from the moist soil, across the cortex, through the endodermis and into the xylem.

==Importance==
Root pressure can transport water and dissolved mineral nutrients from roots through the xylem to the tops of relatively short plants when transpiration is low or zero. The maximum root pressure measured is about 0.6 [[Pascal (unit)|megapascals]] but some species never generate any root pressure. The main contributor to the movement of water and mineral nutrients upward in vascular plants is considered to be the [[transpirational pull]]. However, sunflower plants grown in 100% relative humidity grew normally and accumulated the same amount of mineral nutrients as plants in normal humidity, which had a transpiration rate 10 to 15 times the plants in 100% humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanner|first1=W.|last2=Beevers|first2=H.|title=Transpiration, a prerequisite for long-distance transport of minerals in plants?|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=31 July 2001|volume=98|issue=16|pages=9443–9447|doi=10.1073/pnas.161279898|pmid=11481499|pmc=55440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transpiration may not be as important in upward mineral nutrient transport in relatively short plants as often assumed.

Xylem vessels sometimes empty over winter. Root pressure may be important in refilling the xylem vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperry|first1=J. S.|last2=Holbrook|first2=N. M.|last3=Zimmermann|first3=M. H.|last4=Tyree|first4=M. T.|title=Spring Filling of Xylem Vessels in Wild Grapevine|journal=Plant Physiology|date=February 1987|volume=83|issue=2|pages=414–417|doi=10.1104/pp.83.2.414|pmc=1056371}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some species vessels refill without root pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tibbetts|first1=T. J.|last2=Ewers|first2=F. W.|title=Root pressure and specific conductivity in temperate lianas: exotic Celastrus orbiculatus (Celastraceae) vs. native Vitis riparia (Vitaceae).|journal=American Journal of Botany|date=September 2000|volume=87|issue=9|pages=1272–1278|pmid=10991898|doi=10.2307/2656720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Root pressure is often high in some deciduous trees before they leaf out. Transpiration is minimal without leaves, and organic solutes are being mobilized so decrease the xylem water potential. [[Sugar maple]] accumulates high concentrations of sugars in its xylem early in the spring, which is the source of maple sugar. Some trees "bleed" xylem sap profusely when their stems are pruned in late winter or early spring, e.g. [[maple]] and [[elm]]. Such bleeding is similar to root pressure only sugars, rather than ions, may lower the xylem water potential. In the unique case of maple trees, sap bleeding is caused by changes in stem pressure and not root pressure [http://blog.lib.umn.edu/efans/ygnews/2009/04/the_mystery_of_maple_sap_flow.html].

It is very likely that all grasses produce root pressure. In bamboos, root pressure is correlated with maximum height of a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Kun-Fang|last2=Yang|first2=Shi-Jian|last3=Zhang|first3=Yong-Jiang|last4=Brodribb|first4=T.J.|title=Maximum height of grasses is determined by roots|journal=Ecology Letters|date=July 2012|volume=15|issue=7|pages=666-672|pmid=22489611|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01783.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sanchi Stupa''', also written '''Sanci''', is a Buddhist complex, famous for its Great Stupa, on a hilltop at [[Sanchi Town]] in [[Raisen District]] of the [[States and territories of India|State]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. It is located in {{convert|46|km}} north-east of [[Bhopal]], capital of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The Great [[Stupa]] at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an important monument of [[Indian Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art] Frontline Magazine May 13–26, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally commissioned by the emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. It was crowned by the ''chatra'', a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby [[Vidisha]]. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved [[torana]]s (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th century.

Sanchi is the center of a region with a number of stupas, all within a few miles of Sanchi, including [[Satdhara]] (9&amp;nbsp;km to the W of Sanchi, 40 stupas, the [[Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana]], now enshrined in the new Vihara, were unearthed there), [[Bhojpur Stupas|Bhojpur]] (also called Morel Khurd, a fortified hilltop with 60 stupas) and [[Andher Stupas|Andher]] (respectively 11&amp;nbsp;km and 17&amp;nbsp;km SE of Sanchi), as well as [[Sonari Stupa|Sonari]] (10&amp;nbsp;km SW of Sanchi).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IUbUDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=buddhist+landscape&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl2aqogdrSAhWHyoMKHYD9AoMQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20landscape&amp;f=false Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c.

== Maurya Period==
[[File:Sanchi pillar of Ashoka.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Ashoka pillar at Sanchi.]]
The "Great Stupa" (or "Stupa No1") at Sanchi is the oldest structure and was originally commissioned by the emperor [[Ashoka]] the Great of the [[Maurya Empire]] in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref name="Alī Jāvīd p.50"&gt;World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Volume 1 p.50 by Alī Jāvīd, Tabassum Javeed, Algora Publishing, New York [https://books.google.com/books?id=fg-lGID3WpQC&amp;pg=PA50]&lt;/ref&gt; Its nucleus was a hemispherical brick structure built over the [[relics]] of the [[Buddha]],&lt;ref name="Alī Jāvīd p.50" /&gt; with a raised terrace encompassing its base, and a railing and stone umbrella on the summit, the [[Chatra (umbrella)|chatra]], a parasol-like structure symbolizing high rank.&lt;ref name="Marshall 31"&gt;Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Butkara Stupa]] is an example of such an hemispherical stupa structure from the Maurya period, that was extensively documented through archaeological work&lt;/ref&gt;  The original Stupa only had about half the diameter of today's stupa, which is the result of enlargement by the [[Sungas]]. It was covered in brick, in contrast to the stones that now cover it.&lt;ref name="Marshall 31" /&gt;

According to one version of the [[Mahavamsa]], the Buddhist chronicle of [[Sri Lanka]], Ashoka was closely connected to the region of Sanchi. When he was heir-apparent and was journeying as Viceroy to [[Ujjain]], he is said to have halted at [[Vidisha]] (10 kilometers from Sanchi), and there married the daughter of a local banker. She was called [[Devi (wife of Ashoka)|Devi]] and later gave Ashoka two sons, Ujjeniya and [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahendra]], and a daughter [[Sanghamitta]]. After Ashoka's accession, Mahendra headed a Buddhist mission, sent probably under the auspices of the Emperor, to Sri Lanka, and that before setting out to the island he visited his mother at Chetiyagiri near Vidisa, thought to be Sanchi. He was lodged there in a sumptuous vihdra or monastery, which she herself is said to have had erected.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.8ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Pillars of Ashoka}}
A pillar of finely polished sandstone, one of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], was also erected on the side of the main [[Torana]] gateway. The bottom part of the pillar still stands. The upper parts of the pillar are at the nearby [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]]. The capital consists in four lions, which probably supported a [[Wheel of Law]],&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture
by Huu Phuoc Le [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA155 p.155]&lt;/ref&gt; as also suggested [[:File:Carving of Ashokan pillar at Sanchi.jpg|by later illustrations among the Sanchi reliefs]]. The pillar has an Ashokan inscription ([[List of Edicts of Ashoka|Schism Edict]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA155 Buddhist Architecture by Huu Phuoc Le, 2010,  p.155]&lt;/ref&gt; and an inscription in the ornamental [[Sankha Lipi]] from the Gupta period.&lt;ref name="Alī Jāvīd p.50" /&gt; The Ashokan inscription is engraved in early [[Brahmi]] characters. It is unfortunately much damaged, but the commands it contains appear to be the same as those recorded in the [[Sarnath]] and [[Kausambi]] edicts, which together form the three known instances of Ashoka's "Schism Edict". It relates to the penalties for schism in the Buddhist sangha:

{{quote|". . . path is prescribed both for the monks and for the nuns. As long as (my) sons and great-grandsons (shall reign ; and) as long as the Moon and the Sun (shall endure), the monk or nun who shall cause divisions in the [[Sangha]], shall be compelled to put on white robes and to reside apart. For what is my desire ? That the Sangha may be united and may long endure."|Edict of [[Ashoka]] on the Sanchi pillar.&lt;ref&gt;John Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.93] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The pillar, when intact, was about 42 feet in height and consisted of a round and slightly tapering monolithic shaft, with bell-shaped capital surmounted by an [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] and a crowning ornament of four lions, set back to back, the whole finely finished and polished to a remarkable luster from top to bottom. The abacus is adorned with four [[flame palmette]] designs separated one from the other by pairs of [[geese]], symbolical perhaps of the flock of the Buddha's disciples. The lions from the summit, though now quite disfigured, still testify to the skills of the sculptors.&lt;ref name="Marshall 90"&gt;Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.90ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sandstone]] out of which the pillar is carved came from the quarries of [[Chunar]] several hundred miles away, implying that the builders were able to transport a block of stone over forty feet in length and weighing almost as many tons over such a distance. They probably used water transport, using rafts during the rainy season up the Ganges, Jumna and Betwa rivers.&lt;ref name="Marshall 90" /&gt;

An inscription even suggests it might have been established by [[Bindusara]], the father of Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=The Idea of Ancient India: Essays on Religion, Politics, and Archaeology |date=2016 |publisher=SAGE Publications India |isbn=9789351506454 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmAlDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67 |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original 3rd century BCE temple was built on a high rectangular stone platform, 26.52x14x3.35 metres, with two flights of stairs to the east and the west. It was an [[apsidal]] hall, probably made of timber. It was burnt down sometime in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abram |first1=David |last2=(Firm) |first2=Rough Guides |title=The Rough Guide to India |date=2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=9781843530893 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAMik_6LbwUC&amp;pg=PA393 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide to Sanchi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=John |title=Guide to Sanchi |date=1955 |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.gov.ignca.4365/4365#page/n153/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, the platform was enlarged to 41.76x27.74 metres and re-used to erect a pillared hall with fifty columns (5x10) of which stumps remain. Some of these pillars have inscriptions of the 2nd century BCE. In the 7th or 8th century a small shrine was established in one corner of the platform, re-using some of the pillars and putting them in their present position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chakrabarty |first1=Dilip K. |title=India: An Archaeological History: Palaeolithic Beginnings to Early Historic Foundations |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199088140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPQtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT424 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide to Sanchi"/&gt;

== Shunga period ==
On the basis of [[Ashokavadana]], it is presumed that the stupa may have been vandalized at one point sometime in the 2nd century BCE, an event some have related to the rise of the Shunga emperor [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] who overtook the Mauryan Empire as an army general. It has been suggested that Pushyamitra may have destroyed the original stupa, and his son [[Agnimitra]] rebuilt it.&lt;ref&gt;"Who was responsible for the wanton destruction of the original brick stupa of [[Ashoka]] and when precisely the great work of reconstruction was carried out is not known, but it seems probable that the author of the former was [[Pushyamitra Shunga|Pushyamitra]], the first of the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] kings (184-148 BC), who was notorious for his hostility to Buddhism, and that the restoration was affected by [[Agnimitra]] or his immediate successor." in John Marshall, ''A Guide to Sanchi,'' p. 38. Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918).&lt;/ref&gt; The original brick stupa was covered with stone during the Shunga period.

Given the rather decentralized and fragmentary nature of the Shunga state, with many cities actually issuing their own coinage, as well as the relative dislike of the Shungas for Buddhism, some authors argue that the constructions of that period in Sanchi cannot really be called "Shunga". They were not the result of royal sponsorship, in contrast with what happened during the Mauryas, and most of the dedications at Sanchi were private or collective, rather than the result of royal patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD Julia Shaw, Routledge, 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUbUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR58 p.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the Shunga period decorations at Sanchi bear a close similarity to those of [[Bharhut]], as well as the peripheral balustrades at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]].

[[File:Sanchi Great Stupa under the Sungas.jpg|thumb|300px|The Great Stupa under the [[Sungas]]. The Sungas nearly doubled the diameter of the initial stupa, encasing it in stone, and built a [[balustrade]] and a [[guard rail|railing]] around it.]]

=== Great Stupa (No 1) ===

During the later rule of the Shunga, the stupa was expanded with stone slabs to almost twice its original size. The dome was flattened near the top and crowned by three superimposed parasols within a square railing. With its many tiers it was a symbol of the [[dharma]], the Wheel of the Law. The dome was set on a high circular drum meant for [[circumambulation]], which could be accessed via a double staircase. A second stone pathway at ground level was enclosed by a stone balustrade. The railings around Stupa 1 do not have artistic reliefs. These are only slabs, with some dedicatory inscriptions. These elements are dated to circa 150 BCE,&lt;ref name="Shaw 88" /&gt; or 175-125 BCE.&lt;ref name="HP 149" /&gt; Although the railings are made up of stone, they are copied from a wooden prototype, and as John Marshall has observed the joints between the coping stones have been cut at a slant, as wood is naturally cut, and not vertically as stone should be cut. Besides the short records of the donors written on the railings in Brahmi script, there are two later inscriptions on the railings added during the time of the Gupta Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=A guide to Sanchi|date=1936|publisher=Eastern Book House|location=Patna|isbn=81-85204-32-2|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reliefs are visible on the stairway balustrade, but they are probably slightly later than those at Stupa No2,&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt; and are dated to 125-100 BCE.&lt;ref name="HP 149"&gt;Buddhist Architecture Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA149 p.149]&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors consider that these reliefs, rather crude and without obvious Buddhist connotations, are the oldest reliefs of all Sanchi, slightly older even than the reliefs of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]].&lt;ref name="HP 149" /&gt;

The stupas which seem to have been commissioned during the rule of the Shungas are the Second and then the Third [[stupa]]s (but not the highly decorated gateways, which are from the following [[Satavahana]] period, as known from inscriptions), following the ground balustrade and stone casing of the Great Stupa (Stupa No 1).

=== Stupa No. 3 ===

Stupa No.3 was built during the time of the Shungas, who also built the railing around it as well as the staircase. The [[Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana]], the disciples of the Buddha are said to have been placed in Stupa No 3, and relics boxes were excavated tending to confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.81]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliefs on the railings are said to be slightly later than those of Stupa No.2&lt;ref name="HP 149" /&gt;

The single torana gateway oriented to the south is not Shunga, and was built later under the [[Satavahanas]], probably circa 50 BCE.&lt;ref name="HP 149" /&gt;

=== Sunga Pillar ===
[[File:Sanchi pillar 25 with own capital.jpg|thumb|125px|Sunga pillar No25 with own capital on the side.]]
Pillar 25 at Sanchi is also attributed to the Sungas, in the 2nd-1st century BCE, and is considered as similar in design to the [[Heliodorus pillar]], locally called ''Kham Baba'' pillar, dedicated by [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]], the ambassador to the [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Antialkidas]], in nearby [[Vidisha]] circa 100 BCE.&lt;ref name="Marshall 95"&gt;Marhall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.95 Pillar 25]. Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt; That it belongs to about the period of the Sunga, is clear alike from its design and from the character of the surface dressing.

The height of the pillar, including the capital, is 15&amp;nbsp;ft, its diameter at the base 1&amp;nbsp;ft. 4 in. Up to a height of 4&amp;nbsp;ft. 6 in. the shaft is [[octagonal]]; above that, sixteen-sided. In the octagonal portion all the facets are flat, but in the upper section the alternate facets are fluted, the eight other sides being produced by a concave chamfering of the [[arris]]es of the [[octagon]]. This method of finishing off the arris at the point of transition between the two sections are features characteristic of the second and first centuries BCE. The west side of the shaft is split off, but the tenon at the top, to which the capital was mortised, is still preserved. The capital is of the usual bell-shaped [[Persepolitan]] type, with [[lotus flower|lotus]] leaves falling over the shoulder of the bell. Above this is a circular cable necking, then a second circular necking relieved by a [[bead]] and lozenge pattern, and, finally, a deep square [[abacus]] adorned with a [[Guard rail|railing]] in relief. The crowning feature, probably a lion, has disappeared.&lt;ref name="Marshall 95" /&gt;

From the 1st century BCE, the highly decorated gateways were built, the work being apparently commissioned by the [[Satavahana]]. The balustrade and the gateways were also colored.&lt;ref name="Alī Jāvīd p.50" /&gt; The gateways/toranas are generally dated to the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

The ''[[:File:Siri-Satakani inscription Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gateway Rear of top architrave.jpg|Siri-Satakani inscription]]'' in the [[Brahmi script]] records the gift of one of the top [[architrave]]s of the Southern Gateway by the artisans of the Satavahana king [[Satakarni]]:

There are some uncertainties about the date and the identity of the [[Satakarni]] in question, as a king Satakarni is mentioned in the [[Hathigumpha inscription]] which is sometimes dated to the 2nd century BCE. Also, several Satavahana kings used the name "Satakarni", which complicates the matter. Usual dates given for the gateways range from 50 BCE to the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt; Another early Satavahana monument is known, [[:File:Nasik cave 19.jpg|Cave No.19]] of king [[Kanha (Satavahana dynasty)|Kanha]] (100-70 BCE) at the [[Nasik caves]], which is much less developed artistically than the Sanchi toranas.

Although made of stone, the [[torana]] gateways were carved and constructed in the manner of wood and the gateways were covered with narrative sculptures. It has also been suggested that the stone reliefs were made by ivory carvers from nearby [[Vidisha]], and an inscription on the Southern Gateway of the Great Stupa ("''[[:File:Worship of the Bodhisattva's hair Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gateway.jpg|The Worship of the Bodhisattva's hair]]''") was dedicated by the Guild of Ivory Carvers of [[Vidisha]].&lt;ref name="p.51"&gt;World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Volume 1 by Alī Jāvīd, Tabassum Javeed, Algora Publishing, 2008 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fg-lGID3WpQC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Realm of Gods and Kings by Andrew Topsfield, Philip Wilson Publishers, 2014  [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEBcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250 p.250]&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription reads: ''"[[:File:Vidisha ivory carvers inscription in Sanchi.jpg|Vedisakehi damtakārehi rupakammam katam]]"'' meaning "The ivory-workers from Vidisha have done the carving".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Indian and Foreign Review – Volume 23 – Page 58, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vogel |first1=Jean Ph |title=India antiqua |date=1947 |publisher=Brill Archive |page=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GckUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[Begram ivories]] or the "[[Pompeii Lakshmi]]" give an indication of the kind of ivory works that could have influenced the carvings at Sanchi.

The reliefs show scenes from the life of the Buddha integrated with everyday events that would be familiar to the onlookers and so make it easier for them to understand the Buddhist creed as relevant to their lives. At Sanchi and most other stupas the local population donated money for the embellishment of the stupa to attain spiritual merit. There was no direct royal patronage. Devotees, both men and women, who donated money towards a sculpture would often choose their favourite scene from the life of the Buddha and then have their names inscribed on it. This accounts for the random repetition of particular episodes on the stupa (Dehejia 1992).

On these stone carvings the Buddha was never depicted as a human figure, due to [[aniconism in Buddhism]]. Instead the artists chose to represent him by certain attributes, such as the horse on which he left his father’s home, his footprints, or a canopy under the [[bodhi tree]] at the point of his enlightenment. The human body was thought to be too confining for the Buddha.

Similarites have been found in the designs of the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of various areas of northern India from the time of [[Ashoka]] to the time of the [[Satavahanas]] at Sanchi: particularly between the [[Pataliputra capital]] at the [[Mauryan Empire]] capital of [[Pataliputra]] (3rd century BCE), the pillar capitals at the [[Sunga Empire]] Buddhist complex of [[Bharhut]] (2nd century BCE), and the pillar capitals of the Satavahanas at Sanchi (1st centuries BCE/CE).&lt;ref name="Tadgell" /&gt;

The earliest known example in India, the [[Pataliputra capital]] (3rd century BCE) is decorated with rows of repeating [[rosette (design)|rosettes]], [[ovolo]]s and [[bead and reel]] mouldings, [[Meander (art)|wave-like]] [[Scroll (art)|scrolls]] and side [[volute]]s with central [[Rosette (decoration)|rosettes]], around a prominent central [[flame palmette]], which is the main motif. These are quite similar to [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] designs, and the capital has been described as quasi-[[Ionic order|Ionic]].&lt;ref&gt;A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture by Deborah S. Hutton, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015, p.438 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7DX-CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA438]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA44 "Buddhist Architecture" by Huu Phuoc Le Grafikol, 2010, p.44]&lt;/ref&gt; Greek influence,&lt;ref&gt;the "pilaster capitals with Greek florals and a form which is of Greek origin (though generally described as Persian) go back to [[Archaic Greece|Late Archaic]]."in "The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity" John Boardman, Princeton University Press, 1993, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid influence]] have been suggested.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;"The Archaeology of South Asia: From the Indus to Asoka, c.6500 BCE-200 CE" Robin Coningham, Ruth Young Cambridge University Press, 31 aout 2015,  p.414 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hB5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA414]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[:File:Lion pillar capital at Sanchi Joseph Beglar 1875.jpg|Sanchi Pillar of Ashoka]], of roughly the same period, also has a central [[flame palmette]] design on a square-section central pillar, but this time, surrounded by lions, in the same way as many of the other [[Pillars of Ashoka]].

The pillar capital in Bharhut, dated to the 2nd century BCE during the [[Sunga Empire]] period, also incorporates many of these characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;Early Buddhist Narrative Art by Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky [https://books.google.com/books?id=9LjmXHFXju4C&amp;pg=PR16 p.16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Early Byzantine Churches in Macedonia &amp; Southern Serbia by R.F. Hoddinott [https://books.google.com/books?id=WoSuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 p.17]&lt;/ref&gt; with a central [[anta capital]] with many [[rosette (design)|rosettes]], [[bead and reel|beads-and-reels]], as well as a central [[palmette]] design.&lt;ref name="Tadgell"&gt;The East: Buddhists, Hindus and the Sons of Heaven, Architecture in context II, Routledge, 2015, by Christopher Tadgell [https://books.google.com/books?id=DaTbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 p.24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;India Archaeological Report, Cunningham, p185-196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Age of the Nandas and Mauryas by Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta Sastri [https://books.google.com/books?id=YoAwor58utYC&amp;pg=PA376 p.376 sq]&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, recumbent animals (lions, symbols of Buddhism) were added, in the style of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]].

The Sanchi pillar capital is keeping the general design, seen at Bharhut a century earlier, of recumbent lions grouped around a central square-section post, with the central design of a [[flame palmette]], which started with the Pataliputra capital. However the design of the central post is now simpler, with the flame palmette taking all the available room.&lt;ref&gt;A Comprehensive History Of Ancient India (3 Vol. Set), Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd, 2003 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gE7udqBkACwC&amp;pg=PA87 p.87]&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were later used to adorn the pillar capitals (still with the central palmette design), and lastly, [[Yakshas]] (here the palmette design disappears).

=== Main themes of the reliefs ===
[[File:Sanchi3.jpg|thumb|300px|The Great Stupa at the time of the [[Satavahanas]].]]

==== Jatakas ====
{{see also|Jataka tales}}
Various Jatakas are illustrated. These are Buddhist moral tales relating edifying events of the former lives of the Buddha as he was still a [[Bodhisattva]]. Among the Jatakas being depicted are the [[Syama Jataka]] and the [[Mahakapi Jataka]].

==== Miracles ====
Numerous miracles made by the Buddha are recorded. Among them:
* [[:File:Miracle of the Buddha walking on a River - East Face - South Pillar - East Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi.jpg|The miracle of the Buddha walking on water]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.65]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[:File:Miracle of fire and wood Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|The miracle of fire and wood]]

==== Temptation of the Buddha ====
Numerous scene refer to the temptation of the Buddha, when he was confronted with the seductive daughters of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] and with his army of demons. Having resisted the temptations of Mara, the Buddha finds enlightenement.
Other similar scenes on the same subject:
* [[:File:Temptation of the Buddha with Mara's army fleeing.jpg|Temptation of the Buddha]] with Mara's army fleeing.
* [[:File:Temptation and enlightenment of the Buddha.jpg|Enlightenment of the Buddha]] with Mara's army fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== War over the Buddha's Relics ====
{{See also|Śarīra|Relics associated with Buddha}}
The southern gate of Stupa No1, thought to be oldest and main entrance to the stupa,&lt;ref&gt;[A Guide To Sanchi, Marshall, John, 1918 https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.35740 p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; has several depictions of the story of the Buddha's relics, starting with the War over the Relics.

After the death of the Buddha, the [[Mallas]] of [[Kushinagar]] wanted to keep his ashes, but the other kingdoms also wanting their part went to war and besieged the city of Kushinagar. Finally, an agreement was reached, and the Buddha's cremation relics were divided among 8 royal families and his disciples.&lt;ref name="Lopez Jr"&gt;{{cite web | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83105/Buddha/230773/The-Buddhas-relics | first =Donald S | last = Lopez Jr.| title = The Buddha's relics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Strong|2007|pp= 136–37}} This famous view shows warfare techniques at the time of the Satavahanas, as well as a view of the city of [[Kushinagar]] of the [[Mallas]], which has been relied on for the understanding of ancient Indian cities.

Other narrative panels related to the War over the Buddha's Relics at Sanchi are:
* "''[[:File:King of the Mallas bringing the relics of the Buddha to Kushinagara.jpg|The King of the Mallas bringing the relics of the Buddha to Kushinagara]]''", right after the death of the Buddha, before the War itself. In this relief, the king is seen seated on an elephant, holds the relics on his head.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.68-69]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''[[:File:Siege of Kushinagara by the seven kings.jpg|The siege of Kushinagara by the seven kings]]''", another relief on the same subject.

Hackin [https://books.google.com/books?id=HAZrFhvqnTkC&amp;pg=PA83 p.83ff]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==== Removal of the relics by Ashoka ====
According to Buddhist legend, a few centuries later, the relics would be removed from the eight guardian kingdoms by [[King Ashoka]], and enshrined into 84,000 stupas.&lt;ref name="Lopez Jr"/&gt;{{sfn |Strong|2007|pp= 136–37}}&lt;ref&gt;Asoka and the Buddha-Relics, T.W. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, pp. 397-410 [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/rhy1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka obtained the ashes from seven of the guardian kingdoms, but failed to take the ashes from the [[Nāga|Nagas]] at [[Ramagrama]] who were too powerful, and were able to keep them. This scene is depicted in one of the transversal portions of the southern gateway of Stupa No1 at Sanchi. Ashoka is shown on the right in his charriot and his army, the stupa with the relics is in the center, and the Naga kings with their serpent hoods at the extreme left under the trees.&lt;ref&gt;Asiatic Mythology by J.

[[File:Bodhi tree temple depicted in Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern gateway.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Bodhi tree temple depicted in Sanchi, Stupa 1, Southern gateway.]]
Ashoka went to [[Bodh Gaya]] to visit the [[Bodhi Tree]] under which the Buddha had his enlightenment, as described his [[Major Rock Edict|Major Rock Edict No.8]]. However Ashoka was profoundly grieved when he discovered that the sacred [[pipal tree]] was not properly being taken care of and dying out due to the neglect of Queen Tiṣyarakṣitā.&lt;ref name="Lahiri"&gt;Ashoka in Ancient India Nayanjot Lahiri, Harvard University Press, 2015 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bJ_XCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296 p.296]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, Ashoka endeavoured to take care of the Bodhi Tree, and built a temple around it. This temple became the center of [[Bodh Gaya]]. A sculpture at Sanchi, southern gateway of Stupa No1, shows Ashoka in grief being supported by his two Queens. Then the relief above shows the Bodhi Tree prospering inside its new temple. Numerous other sculptures at Sanchi show scenes of devotion towards the Bodhi Tree, and the Bodhi Tree inside its temple at Bodh Gaya.&lt;ref name="Lahiri" /&gt;

Other versions of the relief depicting the temple for the Bodhi Tree are visible at Sanchi, such as the [[:File:Pipal tree temple of Bodh Gaya depicted in Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|Temple for the Bodhi Tree (Eastern Gateway).]]

==== Foreign devotees ====
[[File:Foreigners at Sanchi Stupa I North Gateway.jpg|thumb|350px|Foreign devotees and musicians on the Northern Gateway of Stupa I.]]
Some of the friezes of Sanchi also show devotees in Greek attire.&lt;ref&gt;"Sculptures showing Greeks or the Greek type of human figures are not lacking in ancient India. Apart from the proverbial Gandhara, Sanchi and Mathura have also yielded many sculptures that betray a close observation of the Greeks." in Graeco-Indica, India's cultural contacts, by [[Udai Prakash Arora]], published by Ramanand Vidya Bhawan, 1991, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These "Greek-looking foreigners" are also described in Susan Huntington, "The art of ancient India", p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The official notice at Sanchi describes "[[:File:Scene Index - North Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi Hill 2013-02-21 4272.JPG|Foreigners worshiping Stupa]]". The men are depicted with short curly hair, often held together with a [[headband]] of the type commonly seen on [[Greek coins]]. The clothing too is Greek, complete with [[tunic]]s, capes and sandals, typical of the [[:File:Greek travelling costume.jpg|Greek travelling costume]].&lt;ref name="Manjari Ukil Originals 2006, p.162"&gt;"The Greeks evidently introduced the himation and the chiton seen in the terracottas from Taxila and the short kilt worn by the soldier on the Sanchi relief." in Foreign influence on Indian culture: from c. 600 B.C. to 320 A.D., Manjari Ukil Originals, 2006, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; The musical instruments are also quite characteristic, such as the double flute called [[aulos]]. Also visible are [[carnyx]]-like [[Cornu (horn)|horns]].&lt;ref&gt;"The scene shows musicians playing a variety of instruments, some of them quite extraordinary such as the Greek double flute and wind instruments with dragon head from West Asia" in The Archaeology of Seafaring in Ancient South Asia, Himanshu Prabha Ray, Cambridge University Press, 2003 [https://books.google.com/books?id=iHHzP4uVpn4C&amp;pg=PA255 p.255]&lt;/ref&gt;

In all these scenes, the Buddha is never represented, being absent altogether even from scenes of his life where he is playing a central role: in the ''[[:File:Miracle of the Buddha walking on a River - East Face - South Pillar - East Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi.jpg|Miracle of the Buddha walking on the river Nairanjana]]'' he is just represented by his path on the water;&lt;ref name="p.64"&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.64]&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[:File:Procession of king Suddhodana from Kapilavastu in full Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|Procession of king Suddhodana from Kapilavastu]]'', he walks in the air at the end of the procession, but his presence is only suggested by people turning their heads upward toward the symbol of his path.&lt;ref name="p.64"/&gt;

In one of the reliefs of the ''[[:File:Miracle at Kapilavastu Suddhodana praying as his son the Buddha rises in the air with only path visible Sanchi Stupa 1 Northern Gateway.jpg|Miracle at Kapilavastu]]'', King [[Suddhodana]] is seen praying as his son the [[Buddha]] rises in the air.

Otherwise, the presence of the Buddha is symbolized by an empty throne, as in the scene of ''[[:File:Bimbisara with his royal cortege issuing from the city of Rajagriha to visit the Buddha.jpg|Bimbisara with his royal cortege issuing from the city of Rajagriha to visit the Buddha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Sanchi, Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.65]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar scenes would later appear in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], but this time with representations of the Buddha. [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] detailed every panel in his seminal work "A Guide to Sanchi".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 A Guide to Sanchi, John Marshall]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gateways or Toranas ===
The gateways depict various scenes of the life of the Buddha, as well as events after his death, in particular the War of the Relics and the efforts of emperor [[Ashoka]] to spread the Buddhist faith.

==== Stupa 1 Southern Gateway ====
The Southern Gateway of Stupa No1 is thought to be oldest and main entrance to the stupa.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide To Sanchi, Marshall, John, 1918 [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.35740 p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative friezes of this gateway put great emphasis on the relics of the Buddha, and on the role of [[Ashoka]] in spreading the Buddhist faith. This gateway is one of the two which were reconstructed by Major Cole in 1882–83. The whole of the right jamb and half of the left are new and blank, as well as the west end of the lowest architrave, the cast end of the middle architrave, and the box vertical uprights between the architraves.&lt;ref name="Marshall 46" /&gt;

|'''The Southern Gateway of Stupa 1'''. The Southern Gateway of Stupa 1 is one of the four richly carved gateways or [[torana]]s, surrounding Stupa 1, the "Great Stupa". It is the main one as it was erected in front of the steps by which the terrace was ascended. The Southern Gateway was also the first to be erected. Then followed, in chronological order, the Northern, the Eastern and the Western, their succession in each case being demonstrated by the style of their carvings. It is probable, however, that not more than three or four decades intervened between the building of the Southern and Western gateways.

A few of the surfaces of the Southern Gateway are undecorated or lost. Like the other gateways, the Southern Gateway is composed of two square pillars surmounted by capitals, which in their turn support a superstructure of three architraves with volute ends.&lt;ref name="Marshall 37"&gt;John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, 1918 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.37ff] (Public Domain text)&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''King [[Ashoka]] visits [[Ramagrama]]'''. King [[Ashoka]] visited [[Ramagrama]], to take relics of the Buddha from the [[Nāga|Nagas]], but he failed, the Nagas being too powerful.&lt;br /&gt;
After the death of the [[Buddha]], his relics were originally divided into eight portions, and shared between eight princes. Each of the princes constructed a [[stupa]] at or near his capital city, within which the respective portion of the ashes was enshrined.&lt;ref name=Shrestha1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrestha|first=SS|title=Ramagrama excavation|journal=Ancient Nepal: Journal of the Department of Archaeology|volume=142|pages=1–12|year=1999|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ancientnepal/pdf/ancient_nepal_142_01.pdf|accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These eight stupas were erected at [[Rajagriha]], [[Vaisali]], [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]], [[Allakappa]], [[Ramagrama]], [[Vothadvipa]], [[Pava]] and [[Kusinara]].&lt;ref name="Marshall 50" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
About two centuries later, in order to spread the Buddhist faith, [[Asoka]] endeavored to gather the eight shares of the relics to divide them up, and distribute them among 84,000 stupas, which he himself erected. He only obtained seven of these portions: he failed to secure the relics of Ramagrama in the [[Nepal]] [[Tarai]], in face of the resolute opposition of their devoted guardians, the [[Nāga|Nagas]].&lt;ref name="Marshall 46" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here, in the centre of the architrave, is depicted the stupa of Ramagrama. Above the stupa are heavenly figures bearing garlands in their hands. To the right, the Emperor Asoka is approaching in his chariot, accompanied by a retinue of elephants, horsemen and footmen; and to the left, the Nagas and Nagis, in human form with serpent hoods, worshiping at the stupa, bringing offerings, or emerging from the waters of a lotus-pond.&lt;ref name="Marshall 46"&gt;John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, 1918 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.46ff] (Public Domain text)&lt;/ref&gt;

To what particular incident this relief refers, is not known.&lt;ref name="Marshall 46" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An inscription on the dome of the stupa records that the architrave was the gift of one Balamitra, pupil of "Ayachuda (Arya-Kshudra), the preacher of the Law".

Six Buddhas of the past and Gautama Buddha, with his [[Bodhi Tree]] at the extreme right.In the central section are three stupas alternating with four trees with thrones in front of them, adored by figures both human and divine. These represent the six Buddhas of the past (namely : [[Vipassī Buddha|Vipassi]], [[Sikhī Buddha|Sikhi]], [[Vessabhū Buddha|Vessabhu]], [[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]], [[Koṇāgamana Buddha|Konagamana]] and [[Kassapa Buddha|Kaasapa]]) and [[Gautama Buddha]]. Three are symbolized by their stupas, and four by the trees under which each respectively attained enlightenment. The tree on the extreme right is the [[pipal tree]] of Gautama Buddha and the one next to it is the [[banyan tree]] of [[Kasyapa]] Buddha. The identification of the others is less certain.
[[File:Siri-Satakani inscription Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gateway Rear of top architrave.jpg|thumb|120px|The [[Satakarni|Siri-Satakani]] inscription]]

Human and celestial beings are adoring it. The figure to the left of it is perhaps [[Gautama Buddha#Awakening|Sujata]], bringing the meal which she prepared for Gautama before he began his last meditation prior to his enlightenment. Near the middle of the panel is Mara, seated on a throne with attendants around, and advancing from him towards the throne are his daughters, who sought by their blandishments to seduce Gautama from his purpose. On his other side, i.e., in the right half of the panel, are the hosts of Mara's demons, personifying the vices, the passions and the fears of mankind. The vigor and humor with which these fantastic beings are portrayed is very striking, and far more forceful than anything of the kind produced by the artists of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.55ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

|'''Miracle at [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]]'''. [[Suddhodana]] praying as his son the [[Buddha]] rises in the air, praised by celestial beings (only his path is visible). This panel is to be interpreted in conjunction with the corresponding panel adjoining it on the front face of the same pillar. When Buddha returned to his native city of Kapilavastu, his father Suddhodana came forth with a royal retinue to meet him, and a question of etiquette arose as to which should salute the other first: the father, who was king, or the son, who had become the Buddha. Thereupon the Buddha solved the difficulty by walking miraculously in mid-air. Here, in the panel on the inner face, we see a [[banyan tree]], and, in front of it, the throne symbolizing the Buddha; while suspended in the air above it is the chahkrama or promenade on which the Buddha used to take his exercise and which here symbolises that he is walking in the air. Above it are celestial beings ([[gandharva]]s) with garlands in their hands. To the right of the tree is King [[Suddhodana]] with attendants, one of whom is holding the royal umbrella. The reason for the banyan tree ([[Ficus Indica]], Skr : nyagrodha) is that King Suddhodana presented a park of banyan trees to his son on his return, and the tree, therefore, helps to localize the incident. In the corresponding scene on the front face the Buddha is probably represented in this park with disciples (but invisible due to [[aniconism]]) and followers around him.&lt;ref name="Marshall 57" /&gt;

At the top is portrayed the dream of [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]], the mother of the Buddha, otherwise called the conception of the [[Bodhisattva]]. Maya, the queen, is
seen lying in a pavilion of the palace, and on her is descending the Bodhisattva in the form of a white elephant. This scene, which was well known to all Buddhists, serves to identify the city here represented as [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].&lt;br /&gt;
Below it is a royal procession threading its way through the streets of the city and issuing forth from the gate. This is the procession of King Suddhodana, when he went forth to meet his son on his return to Kapilavastu. Then, at the bottom of the panel, is portrayed the miracle which Buddha performed on this occasion by walking in mid-air; and, in the extreme
left hand bottom corner, is a [[banyan tree]] (nyagrodha) to signify the park of banyans which Suddhodana presented to his son. The Buddha walking in mid-air is represented, as on the Northern Gateway, by his promenade (chankrama); and suggested by the upturned faces of the king and his retinue as they gaze wonderingly on the miracle.&lt;ref name="Marshall 60" /&gt;

|'''The six inferior heavens of the Gods'''. The six inferior heavens of the gods ([[Devaloka]]s ) or "Kamavachara heavens", in which the passions are still unsubdued, an integral part of [[Buddhist cosmology]]. Starting from the base they are as follows: (1) The heaven of the Four Great Kings: the Regents of the Four Quarters ([[Lokapala]]; [[Chaturmaharajika]]); (2) The heaven of the Thirty-three gods ([[Trayastrimisa]]) over whom [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakra]] presides; (3) The heaven over which [[Yama]], the God of Death, reigns, where there is no change of day or night; (4) The Tushita heaven, where the [[Bodhisattvas]] are born before they appear on earth as the saviors of mankind, and where Maitreya now resides; (5) The heaven of the [[Nirmanarati]], who create their own pleasures; (6) The heaven of the [[Parinirmita]]-[[Vasavartin]] gods, who indulge in pleasures created for them by others and over whom [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] is king.&lt;br /&gt;
Each of these six heavens or devalokas is represented by a storey of a palace, the front of which is divided by pillars into three bays, the pillars in the alternate storeys being
either plain or provided with elaborate Persepolitan capitals. In the central bay there sits a god, like an Indian king, holding a thunderbolt ([[vajra]]) in his right hand and a flask containing nectar ([[amrita]]) in his left. Behind him are his women attendants holding the royal umbrella ([[Muttra]]) and flywhisk ([[chauri]]). In the bay to his right, seated on a slightly lower seat, is his viceroy (uparaja); and to his left are the court musicians and dancers. With slight variations the same figures are repeated in each of the six heavens.
Nothing, perhaps, could give a better idea of the monotony of pleasure in the Buddhist heavens than the sameness of these reiterations.&lt;br /&gt;
The topmost panel of all, with two figures seated on a terrace and attendants behind, is treated quite differently from the Devalokas below and appears to represent the lowest of the Brahmaloka, which according to the Buddhist ideas rise above the inferior heavens.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Sanchi, Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.62ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''The Western Gateway of Stupa 1'''. The Western Gateway of Stupa 1 is one of the four richly carved gateways or [[torana]]s, surrounding Stupa 1, the "Great Stupa". It is the last of the four gateway to have been constructed.
Like the other gateways, the Western Gateway is composed of two square pillars surmounted by capitals, which in their turn support a superstructure of three architraves with volute ends.&lt;ref name="Marshall 37"/&gt;

The tree behind the throne in front of the city gate appears to be a [[Shala tree]] ( shorea robusta ), and to refer to the fact that Buddha's [[parinirvana]] took place in a grove of those trees. The two groups of figures carrying banners and offerings, which occupy the ends of this architrave, are probably connected with the central scene, serving to indicate the rejoicing of the Mallas over the possession of the relics.&lt;ref name="Marshall 68" /&gt;

One day, Syama goes to draw water at the river and is shot with an arrow by the King of [[Benares]], who is out hunting. Owing to the king's penitence and his parents' sorrow [[Indra]] intervenes and allows Syama to be healed and his parents' sight to be restored.

Then, to the left, we see the figure of the King thrice repeated, first shooting the lad in the water, then with bow in hand, then standing penitent with bow and arrow discarded; and in the left top corner are the father, mother and son restored to health, and by their side the god Indra and the king.

The deva with the giant head, riding either on the elephant or on the lion to the right of the panel, is probably meant to be [[Indra]] or [[Brahma]]. The interpretation of the three sorrowing figures standing on three sides of the throne in the foreground is problematical. In the Mahabhinishkramana scene on the East Gateway we have already seen that the artist inserted a [[jambul|jambu]] tree in the middle of the panel, to remind the spectator of the first meditation of the Bodhisattva and the path on which it led him. So, here, these three figures, which are strikingly similar to the three sorrowing Yakshas in the Mahdbhinishkramana scene and were probably executed by the same hand, may be a reminder of the Great Renunciation which led to the attainment of Buddhahood, the gateway behind being also a reminder of the gateway of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].&lt;ref name="Marshall 68"&gt;Marshall "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.68ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See also: [[s:The Life of Buddha/Part One/20.

|'''[[Mahakapi Jataka]]'''. The story runs that the [[Bodhisattva]] was born as a monkey, ruler over 80,000 monkeys. They lived at a spot near the [[Ganges]] and ate of the fruit of a great [[mango tree]]. King [[Brahmadatta]] of [[Benares]], desiring to possess the mangoes, surrounded the tree with his soldiers, in order to kill the animals, but the Bodhisattva formed a bridge over the stream with his own body and by this means enabled the whole tribe to escape into safety.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Mahakapi Jataka in Bharhut.jpg|120px|thumb|The Mahakapi Jataka in [[Bharhut]].]]
[[Devadatta]], the jealous and wicked cousin of the Buddha, was in that life one of the monkeys and, thinking it a good chance to destroy his enemy, jumped on the Bodhisattva's back and broke his heart. The king, seeing the good deed of the Bodhisattva and repenting of his own attempt to kill him, tended him with great care when he was dying and
afterwards gave him royal obsequies.&lt;br /&gt;

|Uncharacteristically, the rear panel of the left pillar of the gateway is fully decorated, down to its bottom. This can be explained by the fact that the stupa is not surrounded by a railing as in the Great Stupa, therefore rendering this rear space free. The right pillar of the gateway however does not have decoration on the back. The top panel is the [[Dharmacakra]] on a Pillar.

== Later periods ==

[[File:Sanchi map.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Sanchi monuments.]]
Further stupas and other religious Buddhist structures were added over the centuries until the 12th century CE.

===Western Satraps===
The rule of the Satavahanas in the area Sanchi during the 1st centuries BCE/CE is well attested by the finds of Satavahana copper coins in [[Vidisha]], [[Ujjain]] and [[Eran]] in the name of [[Satakarni]], as well as the Satakarni inscription on the Southern Gateway of Stupa No.1.&lt;ref name="Shaw 58" /&gt;

Soon after, however, the region fell to the [[Indo-Scythians|Scythian]] [[Western Satraps]], possibly under [[Nahapana]] (120 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Indian Numismatic Studies by K. D. Bajpai [https://books.google.com/books?id=chGrJUMarHoC&amp;pg=PA100 p.100]&lt;/ref&gt; and then certainly under [[Rudradaman I]] (130-150 CE), as shown by his inscriptions in [[Junagadh]].&lt;ref name="Shaw 58" /&gt; The Satavahanas probably regained the region for some time, but were again replaced by the Western Satraps in the mid-3rd century CE, during the rule of [[Rudrasena II (Western Satrap)|Rudrasena II]] (255-278 CE). The Western Satraps remained well into the 4th century as shown by the nearby [[Kanakerha inscription]] mentioning the construction of a well by the Saka chief and "righteous conqueror" Sridharavarman.&lt;ref name="Shaw 58"&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD, Julia Shaw, Routledge, 2016 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=IUbUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR58 p58-59]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it seems that the [[Kushan Empire]] did not extend to the Sanchi area, and the few Kushan works of art found in Sanchi appear to have come from [[Mathura]].&lt;ref name="Shaw 58" /&gt;

===Guptas===
The next rulers of the area were the Guptas.&lt;ref name="Shaw 58" /&gt; Inscriptions of a victorious [[Chandragupta II]] in the year 412-423 CE can be found on the railing near the Eastern Gateway of the Great Stupa.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, The Monuments of India [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.532798 p.388]&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple 17 is an early Buddhist stand-alone [[temple]] (following the great cave temples of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]), as it dates to the early [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (5th century CE). It consists of a flat roofed square sanctum with a portico and four pillars. The interior and three sides of the exterior are plain and undecorated but the front and the pillars are elegantly carved, giving the temple an almost ‘classical’ appearance,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; not unlike the 2nd century rock-cut cave temples of the [[Nasik caves]].

Near the Northwern Gateway also used to stand a [[Vajrapani]] pillar. Another pillar of [[Padmapani]] used to stand, and [[:File:WLA vanda The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.jpg|the statue]] is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[London]].

=== Lion pillar No 26 ===
[[File:Sanchi Gupta lion capital.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pillar 26: one the two four-lions [[stambha]] capitals at Sanchi, with lions, central [[flame palmette]] and [[Wheel of Law]] (axis, stubs of the spokes and part of the circumference only), initially located at the Northern Gateway of the Great Stupa. [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]].]]
Pillar No26 stands a little to the north of the Sunga pillar No25. It belongs to the early Gupta age. Apart from its design, it is distinguished
from the other pillars on the site by the unusual quality and colour of its stone, which is harder than that ordinarily quarried in the [[Udayagiri Caves|Udayagiri hill]], and of a pale
buff hue splashed and streaked with amethyst. At Sanchi this particular variety of stone was used only in monuments of the Gupta period. This pillar was approximately 22&amp;nbsp;ft. 6 in. in height and was composed of two pieces only, one comprising the circular shaft and square base, the other the bell-capital, necking, lions and crowning [[chakra]]. On the northwest side of the lowest section, which is still in situ, is a short mutilated inscription in Gupta characters recording the gift of the pillar by a ''viharasvamin'' (master of a monastery), the son of Gotaisimhabala.&lt;ref name="Marshall 96" /&gt;

[[File:Sanchi pillar capital wheel reconstitution.jpg|thumb|upright|Pillar 26: lion pillar capital at time of discovery, with [[Dharmachakra]] wheel (reconstitution). Northern Gateway.]]
As was usual with pillars of the Gupta age, the square base projected above the ground level, the projection in this case being 1&amp;nbsp;ft. 2 in., and was enclosed by a small square platform. The lion capital of this pillar is a feeble imitation of the one which surmounted the pillar of Asoka, with the addition of a wheel at the summit and with certain other variations of detail. For example, the cable necking above the bell-capital, is composed of a series of strands bound together with a riband. Also, the reliefs on the circular [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]], consist of birds and lotuses of unequal sizes disposed in irregular fashion, not with the symmetrical precision of earlier Indian art. Finally, these lions, like those on the pillars of the Southern Gateway, are provided with five claws on each foot, and their modelling exhibits little regard for truth and little artistry.&lt;ref name="Marshall 96"&gt;Marshall "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.96 Pillar 26]. Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much confusion about the dating of this pillars, since it was often presented from the beginning as a pillar of Ashoka. Marshall himself describes the pillar as early [[Gupta Empire]] in convincing terms, either from the points of view of material, technique or artistry.&lt;ref name="Marshall 96" /&gt; The Government of India Photo Division describes it in [[:File:Sanchi Ashoka pillar and capital cropped.jpg|this image]] as "An Asoka pillar and its broken lion capital near the south gateway of the Great Stupa." [http://photodivision.gov.in/IntroPhotodetails.asp?thisPage=972]. The British Library Online also describes it as 3rd century BCE Mauryan, although probably pasting the original text from the 19th century [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/p/019pho000001003u01359000.html]. Sachim Kumar Tiwary in ''Monolithic Pillars of The Gupta Period'', affirms a Gupta date.&lt;ref&gt;Sachim Kumar Tiwary in ''Monolithic Pillars of The Gupta Period''  B.R.

=== Pillar 35 ===
[[File:Vajrapani Pillar - Pillar 35 - Buddhist Monuments - Sanchi Hill 2013-02-21 4288.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Pillar 35 column stump, and [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]], positionned upside down.]]
[[File:Sanchi Pillar 35 Vajrapani statue.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vajrapani]] statue of pillar 35, 5th c. CE. [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]].]]
The massive pillar near the North Gateway, numbered 35 in the plan, was erected during the Gupta period. Every feature, whether structural, stylistic or technical, is typical of
Gupta workmanship. Most of the shaft has been destroyed, but the stump still remains in situ, and the foundations are intact. The form, too, of the platform around its base is sufficiently clear, and the capital and statue which it is said to have supported, are both relatively well-preserved. What remains of the shaft is 9&amp;nbsp;ft. in length, 3&amp;nbsp;ft. 10 in. of which, measured from the top, are circular and smooth, and the remainder, constituting the base, square and rough-dressed. In the Gupta age, it was the common practice to keep the
bases of such monolithic columns square, whereas those of the Maurya age were invariably circular. The columns of the Maurya period are distinguished by its exquisite dressing and highly polished surface; but in this case the dressing of the stone is characterized by no such lustrous finish.&lt;ref name="Marshall 97"&gt;Marshall "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.97 Pillar 35]. Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Persepolitan]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]] and square [[abacus]] ornamented with a balustrade in relief are cut entire from a single block of stone. So, too, is the statue
which was found lying alongside the capital and which is believed to have belonged to the same pillar. This statue represents a man clad in a [[dhoti]] and adorned with bracelets, earrings, bejewelled necklace and headdress. The hair falls in curls over the shoulders and back, and beneath it at the back fall the ends of two ribbons.&lt;ref name="Marshall 97" /&gt; It is thought that the statue represents [[Vajrapani]]. The attribution to Vajrapani is indicated by the stub of a [[vajra]] thunderbold in the right hand and a halo of 24 rays.&lt;ref&gt;Great Monuments of India, DK [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXa60HtlNOYC&amp;pg=PA41 p.41]&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication of the Vajrapani pillar is also mentioned in a 5th-century inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Malwa Through The Ages, by Kailash Chand Jain [https://books.google.com/books?id=_3O7q7cU7k0C&amp;pg=PA277 p.277]&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting feature of the image is the halo which is pierced with twelve small holes evenly disposed around its edge. Manifestly the halo, is too small in proportion to the size of the statue, and these holes were no doubt intended for the attachment of the outer rays, which were probably fashioned out of copper gilt, the rest of the statue itself being possibly painted or gilded. This statue stood on the summit of the pillar, and is a work of the Gupta period.&lt;ref name="Marshall 97" /&gt; The statue is currently in the [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]] and is attributed to the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;"Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD", Julia Shaw, Routledge, 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUbUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP20 p.20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the destruction of the Guptas by the [[Alchon Huns]], and with the [[decline of Buddhism in India]], Buddhist artistic creation at Sanchi slowed down.

[[File:Temple 18, Sanchi.jpg|thumb|Temple 18 at Sanchi, an [[apsidal]] hall with [[Maurya]] foundations, rebuilt at the time of [[Harsha]] (7th century CE).]]
[[:File:Sanchi (Ruins of Gupta Temple).JPG|Temple 45]] was the last Buddhist temple built during the mid to late 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orca.cf.ac.uk/54362/1/U584463.pdf Reconstructing a Latina Temple Spire: Temple 45, Sanchi, Dissertation submitted to Cardiff University, Fiona Buckee, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Another point to be noted is that at that time the monuments were enclosed within a wall.

With the decline of [[Buddhism]] in India, the monuments of Sanchi went out of use and fell into a state of disrepair. In 1818, General Taylor of the Bengal Cavalry recorded a visit to Sanchi. At that time the monuments were left in a relatively good condition. Although the jungle had overgrown the complex, several of the Gateways were still standing, and Sanchi, being situated on a hill, had escaped the onslaught of the [[Muslim]] conquerors who had destroyed the nearby city of [[Vidisha]] ([[Bhilsa]]) only 5 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Ornament in Indian Architecture, Margaret Prosser Allen, University of Delaware Press, 1991 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vyXxEX5PQH8C&amp;pg=PA18 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sanchi and the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara ==
Although the initial craftsmen for stone reliefs in Sanchi seem to have come from [[Gandhara]], with the first reliefs being carved at [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] circa 115 BCE,&lt;ref name="AG" /&gt; the art of Sanchi thereafter developed considerably in the 1st century BCE/CE and is thought to predate the blooming of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], which went on to flourish until around the 4th century CE. The art of Sanchi is thus considered as the ancestor of the didactic forms of [[Buddhist art]] that would follow, such as the art of Gandhara.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Didactic Narration: Jataka Iconography in Dunhuang with a Catalogue of Jataka Representations in China, Alexander Peter Bell, LIT Verlag Münster, 2000 [https://books.google.com/books?id=77hHrXX4COgC&amp;pg=PA31 p.31ff]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also, with [[Bharhut]], the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;Asoka, Mookerji Radhakumud, Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1962 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uXyftdtE1ygC&amp;pg=PA204 p.204]&lt;/ref&gt;

As didactic Buddhist reliefs were adopted by Gandhara, the content evolved somewhat together with the emergence of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], a more theistic understanding of Buddhism. First, although many of the artistic themes remained the same (such as Maya's dream, The Great Departure, Mara's attacks...), many of the stories of the previous lives of the Buddha were replaced by the even more numerous stories about the [[Bodhisattvas]] of the Mahayana [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]].&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt; Second, another important difference is the treatment of the image of the Buddha: whereas the art of Sanchi, however detailed and sophisticated, is [[aniconic]],&lt;ref&gt;The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA26 p.26]&lt;/ref&gt; the art of Gandhara added illustrations of the Buddha as a man wearing Greek-style clothing to play a central role in its didactic reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA1 p.1ff]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Grandeur of Gandhara: The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys Rafi-us Samad, Algora Publishing, 2011 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMEd8Cqh-YQC&amp;pg=PA23 p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Greeks at or near Sanchi at the time is known ([[Indo-Greek]] ambassador [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]] at [[Vidisha]] circa 100 BCE, the Greek-like [[:File:Foreigners at Sanchi Stupa I North Gateway.jpg|foreigners illustrated at Sanchi worshiping the Great Stupa]], or the Greek "Yavana" devotees who had dedicatory inscriptions made at Sanchi&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt;), but more precise details about exchanges or possible routes of transmission are elusive.

== Western rediscovery ==
[[File:Ruins at Stupa 1 Sanchi Joseph Beglar 1875.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of the Southern Gateway, Sanchi in 1875.]]
[[File:A Gate to the Stupa of Sanchi 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|A Gate to the Stupa of Sanchi 1932]]
General Henry Taylor (1784–1876) who was a British officer in 1818 in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War|Third Maratha War]] of 1817–1819, was the first known Western historian to document (in English) the existence of Sanchi Stupa. The site was in a total state of abandon. Amateur [[archaeologists]] and treasure hunters ravaged the site until 1881, when proper restoration work was initiated. Between 1912 and 1919 the structures were restored to their present condition under the supervision of [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/docs/archaeology/primarydocs/Sanchi/HistArt.htm John Marshall, "An Historical and Artistic Description of Sanchi", from ''A Guide to Sanchi,'' Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918). Pp. 7-29 on line, Project South Asia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210033559/http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/docs/archaeology/primarydocs/Sanchi/HistArt.htm |date=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Sanchi remained mostly intact however, only few artifacts of Sanchi can be found in Western Museum: for example, [[:File:WLA vanda The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.jpg|the Gupta statue of Padmapani]] is at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], and [[:File:SanchiBracketFigure.jpg|one of the Yashinis]] can be seen at the [[British Museum]].

Today, around fifty monuments remain on the hill of Sanchi, including three main stupas and several temples. The monuments have been listed among other famous monuments in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] since 1989.

The reliefs of Sanchi, especially those depicting Indian cities, have been important in trying to imagine what ancient Indian cities look like. Many modern simulations are based on the urban illustrations of Sanchi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.54756 Percy Brown, Indian Architecture, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chetiyagiri Vihara and the Sacred Relics ==
[[File:Chetiyagiri Vihar 02.jpg|thumb|Chetiyagiri Vihara]]
The bone relics (asthi avashesh) of Buddhist Masters along with the reliquaries, obtained by Maisey and Cunningham were divided and taken by them to England as personal trophies.&lt;ref&gt;Brekke, Torkel, Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology, Numen, Volume 54, Number 3, 2007, pp. 270-303(34)&lt;/ref&gt; Maisey's family sold the objects to [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] where they stayed for a long time. The Buddhists in England, Sri Lanka and India, led by the [[Mahabodhi Society]] demanded that they be returned. Some of the relics of [[Sariputta]] and [[Moggallana]] were sent back to Sri Lanka, where they were publicly displayed in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Ceylon Allowed To Keep Sanchi Relics Till May 8, Indian Express – Apr 28, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; It was such a grand event where the entire population of Sri Lanka came to visit them. However, they were later returned to India. But a new temple Chetiyagiri Vihara was constructed to house the relics, in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;BUDDHA DISCIPLES WILL BE REBURIED; Relics of Followers of Ancient Leader to Be Reinterred at Rites in India Saturday, THE NEW YORK TIMES, November 25, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; In a nationalistic sense, this marked the formal reestablishment of the Buddhist tradition in India.

Sanchi, especially Stupa 1, has a large number of [[Brahmi]] inscriptions. Although most of them are small and mention donations, they are of great historical significance. [[James Prinsep]] in 1837, noted that most of them ended with the same two Brahmi characters. Princep took them as "danam" (donation), which permitted the decipherment of the Brahmi script,.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Epigraphy : A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages, Richard Salomon, [[Oxford University Press]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ashoka: The Search for India's Lost Emperor'', [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], Little, Brown Book Group Limited, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the donation records&lt;ref&gt;A study of inscribed reliefs within the context of donative inscriptions at Sanchi, Author: Milligan, Matthew David, Thesis, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; shows that while a large fraction of the donors were local (with no town specified), a number of them were from [[Ujjain]], [[Vidisha]], Kurara, Nadinagar, Mahisati, Kurghara, Bhogavadhan and Kamdagigam. Three inscriptions are known from [[Yavana]] ([[Indo-Greek]])&lt;ref name="IAS"/&gt; donors at Sanchi, the clearest of which reads "''Setapathiyasa Yonasa danam''" ("Gift of the [[Yona]] of Setapatha"), Setapatha being an uncertain city.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1892">'''Schizocoely''' (adjective forms: '''schizocoelous''' or '''schizocoelic''') is a process by which some animal [[embryonic development|embryos develop]]. [[Animal]]s which develop through schizocoely are known as '''schizocoelomates'''. Schizocoely occurs when a [[coelom]] (body cavity) is formed by splitting the [[mesoderm]]al embryonic tissue.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{Cite book

Schizocoelous development is typically attributed to [[protostomes]]:&lt;ref name=moore /&gt; phyla [[Mollusca]], [[Annelida]], and [[Arthropoda]], but some [[deuterostomes]] can exhibit schizocoely as well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} &lt;!--'''NOTE TO EXPERT EDITOR: This still doesn't make any sense. Saying it is exclusive is NOT compatible with saying that some deuterostomes can exhibit it. Unless you mean to suggest that "Schizocoelous development" is different from "schizocoely", in which case you need to explain.''' ... Better now?--&gt;

The term refers to the order of organization of cells in the [[gastrula]] leading to development of the [[coelom]]. In these three phyla of organisms, the [[mesoderm]] (the middle [[germ layer]]) forms as a solid mass of migrated cells from the single layer of the gastrula. The new mesoderm then splits, creating the pocket-like cavity of the coelom.

A '''scientific controversy''' is a substantial disagreement among [[scientist]]s. A scientific controversy may involve issues such as the interpretation of [[data]], which ideas are most supported by [[evidence]], and which ideas are most worth pursuing. For example, the connection between [[race and intelligence]] has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century.

When compared to [[controversies]], scientific controversies are specific to scientific related arguments, whereas regular controversies entail a much larger range. More specifically, a scientific controversy may involve issues such as the interpretation of [[data]], which ideas are most supported by [[evidence]], and which ideas are most worth pursuing. A scientific controversy is an argument where they cannot agree on a method, theory, or hypothesis. It influences how we interpret the data to make a conclusion that best fits the data and/or evidence. Scientific controversies are healthy and can be helpful in getting scientists to think of the best ways to do things as well as different ways to approach topics. In addition, they can also help science move forward. Scientific controversies usually create media attention which allows for more people to become aware of the situation and topic being disagreed. This can create an increase in research on the topic. Although, if there are conflicts between scientific views and non-scientific views, this can hurt scientific research.&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;[https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/_0_0/sciencetoolkit_06 What controversy: Is a controversy misrepresented or blown out of proportion?]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of controversies. The main type being fundamental and secondary scientific controversies. Fundamental scientific controversies are controversies that are based on the main idea of hypotheses or theories. Meaning the central idea of a topic and not the ideas that surround it which would be secondary scientific controversies. For example, there is skepticism in the general population if there is global warming but in contrast, the majority of the scientific community agree there is global warming. This is a fundamental scientific controversy because it is the main idea. The real issue, the secondary scientific controversy, is how fast is it occurring and how to model it which is what is being researched and debated. It is important to distinguish between these two so that the real scientific issue does not get missed.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;

Controversies between scientific and non-scientific ideas are not within the realm of science and are not true scientific controversies.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;

A '''script market''' is the system in which a [[screenwriter]] and producer engage in the buying and selling of a script for the film and television industries.  The process of selling a script may begin with the pitch, however since the end of the 1980s the ability to pitch a film to producers has greatly depended on the notoriety of the screenwriter.  One reason attributed to this effect is that studios are looking for the next big hit, but scared to take a chance on a script that doesn’t meet a pre-established formula guaranteed to make money since no one knows what will work.  The majority of scripts are read by studio interns and others, who give the scripts a “consider”, “pass”, or “recommend” status, with most scripts receiving a “pass” rating.  However, an agent who's signed the Artists-Managers Agreement drawn up by the [[Writers Guild of America]] can submit scripts to producers directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Field|first=Syd|title=Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting|year=2005|publisher=Bantam Dell (Random House, Inc)|location=New York|isbn=9780385339032|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agents try to create buzz in the script market using [[spec script]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Paul &amp; Wasko, Janet. (2008) “The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry”. Malden,MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; With everyone in the entertainment industry trying to pursue the million-dollar dream, and Hollywood so desperate for new material ideas, the script market functions and business practices have been pursued in the [[spec script]] manner.

Studio executives, producers, and agents don't have time to read every script, so readers or script analysts prepare script coverage for them. Spec scripts are written in hopes of being purchased by a producer or studio. A spec script can be passed around by an agent, which can create a bidding war. The spec script process is considered by some to be problematic, because the bidding process can attract inflated prices from the boosting of mediocre scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald Paul &amp;|first=Wasko Janet|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|pages=46–47, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary suite''' (or '''accessory dwelling unit''') is an [[urban planning]] term used mainly in [[North American English]] for a self-contained apartment in an owner occupied single-family home / lot that is either attached to the principal dwelling or in a separate structure on the same property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/mod-adu.html|title=Smart Growth / Smart Energy Toolkit - Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU)|website=www.mass.gov|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] the term "annexe" is used instead. Reasons for wanting to add a secondary suite to a property may be to receive additional income, provide social and personal support to a family member, or obtain greater security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/mod-adu.html|title=Smart Growth / Smart Energy Toolkit - Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU)|website=www.mass.gov|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Relationship to main residence===
A secondary suite is considered "secondary" or "accessory" to the [[primary residence]] on the parcel. It normally has its own entrance, kitchen, bathroom and living area. There are three types of accessory units: Interior, Interior with modification, and Detached. Examples of these accessory units include:

* A suite above a rear detached garage (a "[[garage apartment]]"),
* A suite above the main floor of a single-detached dwelling,
* A suite below the main floor of a single-detached dwelling (a "[[basement suite]]").
* A suite attached to a single-detached dwelling at grade, or
* A suite detached from the principal dwelling (a "garden suite" or "[[Guest house (secondary suite)|guesthouse]]").

===Mother-in-law apartment===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of house types]], and redirects [[Granny flat]] and [[Granny annex]] --&gt;

A mother-in-law apartment is a small [[apartment]] accessory to a primary residence. Alternative names include "'''[[Grandmother|granny]] flat'''", "'''granny suite'''","'''in-law suite'''", and "'''accessory apartment'''", the first being used primarily in Australia, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Ireland and [[New Zealand]], where it is the most familiar of these terms, but also in parts of the [[United States]]. Such apartments are frequently used to accommodate an elderly relative who is incapable of independent living, but is not ready for a [[nursing home]] environment or other similar facility.

The apartment may or may not have a communicating door to the main house, but virtually always has a separate entrance and is usually not part of the original design. Many are located above the [[Garage (house)|garage]] of the main house or as a separate building in the rear lawn.

==Legal considerations==

In many North American municipalities, secondary suites are illegal because they do not conform to the [[zoning]] or [[land use]] district the property is in, they have been developed without the proper [[Construction permit|permits]], or they do not meet the local [[building code]]. However, some localities only prohibit the renting out of secondary suites, and allow occupation by a relative or guest, leading to the use of the term '''"mother-in-law" house''' or '''apartment'''. Local jurisdictions may have rules regarding allowing certain relatives to live there and rules about what, if any, rent may be charged.

==By country==

===Australia===

'''Dual occupancy''' is sometimes used to refer to the development of two dwellings on one allotment of land. They may be either attached ([[semi-detached]]) or detached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | author = Planning &amp; Land Management, Territory Planning Branch
  | title = Dual Occupancy Review
  | year = 2002
  | url = http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2162/dualreview2002.pdf
  | accessdate = August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is common in [[Australia]]. A dual occupancy can be either torrens titles or strata titled.

A Dual Occupancy in Victoria,Australia is a means to add value to property through a subdivision of one lot into two. It is that subdivision that makes dual occupancy an attractive proposition for new property investors and developers.

A 'granny flat' in Australia is actually also known as a secondary dwelling on a property, which is totally different to a dual occupancy. It does not require subdivision of the land and its construction require approval from the council or relevant authority. The certifying process between council or a private certifier depends on a few conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://mastergrannyflats.com.au/can-my-granny-flat-be-approved-from-a-private-certifier-or-council/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

{{Further information|Secondary suites in Canada}}

====Government programs====

====CMHC====
The [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] provides a financial assistance program to help Canadians create affordable housing for low-income seniors and adults with a disability within a secondary suite. The program is called the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161602/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_002.cfm Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program (RRAP) -- Secondary/Garden Suite]. The maximum fully [[forgivable loan]] depends on the location of the property:
* Southern Areas of Canada: $24,000/unit
* Northern areas of Canada: $28,000/unit
* Far northern areas: $36,000/unit
A 25% supplement in assistance is available in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_002.cfm Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program (RRAP) -- Secondary/Garden Suite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161602/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_002.cfm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====
The Housing Policy Branch of British Columbia's Ministry of Community, Aboriginal and Women’s Services published a guide for local governments to implement secondary suite programs called 'Secondary Suites: A Guide For Local Governments'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/pub/secondary_suites.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The current issue is dated September 2005. The intent of the guide is to "help local governments develop and implement secondary suite programs". It also highlights good secondary suite practices as well as providing practical information to "elected officials, planners, community groups, homeowners, developers, and others interested in secondary suites".

===Norway===
In Norway, particularly in the bigger cities, it is quite common to build separate adjoined smaller flats for renting out. The owner of the main flat will rent out the smaller adjoined flats.

=== United States ===
In the United States, secondary suites are technically referred to as [[Accessory Dwelling Unit|accessory dwelling unit]]s or ADUs. An ADU is second complete dwelling unit which is legally built within or on the same lot as an existing single family residence. An ADU provides complete independent living facilities including a kitchen, bathroom and its own entryway. ADUs are typically not allowed to be sold separate from the primary home and the homeowners are usually required to reside in one of the two units.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hausable.com/adus-list/guides/the-adu-glossary&lt;/ref&gt; State laws typically delegate planning and zoning powers to city and county governments which specify the appropriate type, distribution and intensity of land uses in the local jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;http://realestate.findlaw.com/land-use-laws/land-use-and-zoning-basics.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the feasibility of building an '''accessory dwelling unit (ADU)''' (also known as a secondary suite, second unit, granny cottage, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://accessorydwellings.org/2012/06/04/beware-of-the-many-synonyms-for-adus/&lt;/ref&gt;) can vary widely from place to place, depending on state law and each local jurisdiction's willingness to adopt regulations that facilitate ADUs.

Popular in the early 20th century, ADUs fell into disfavor after WWII, when a shift to suburban development occurred with emphasis on the nuclear family.  However, with increases in the price of housing in many cities and suburbs, an increased awareness of the costs of low-density car-oriented development patterns and an increased need to care for the aging baby boom generation, ADUs have been promoted by some as a beneficial option.&lt;ref&gt;https://accessorydwellings.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some critics perceive ADUs to be a threat to the character of single-family residential neighborhoods.

In California, Government Code Sections 65852.150, 65852.2 &amp; 65852.22 pertain to local regulation of ADUs.&lt;ref&gt;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;division=1.&amp;title=7.&amp;part=&amp;chapter=4.&amp;article=2.&lt;/ref&gt;  SB 1069 and AB 2299 are California bills approved in 2016 and effective January 1, 2017, that limit local government authority to prohibit ADUs in certain cases (and also reduce cost and bureaucracy hurdles to construction).&lt;ref&gt;SB 1069: http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1069&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AB 2299: http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB2299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFC_ADUs &gt; {{ cite news | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/New-California-housing-laws-make-granny-units-10688483.php | doi= | title=New California housing laws make granny units easier to build | last=Pender | first=Kathleen | publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' | date=2016-12-03 | accessdate=2018-07-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615083653/https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/New-California-housing-laws-make-granny-units-10688483.php | archive-date=2018-06-15 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SJMN_ADUs &gt; {{ cite news | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/09/27/california-eases-restrictions-on-granny-units/ | doi= | title=California eases restrictions on ‘granny units’ | last=Wong | first=Queenie | publisher=''[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]'' | date=2016-09-27 | accessdate=2018-07-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019114401/https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/09/27/california-eases-restrictions-on-granny-units/ | archive-date=2016-10-19 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;

For New South Wales, the two approval paths are available.
1. If the Frontage of the land is 12m or more, a CDC (Private certifier) is possible. If less, then it must go through a DA(Council).
2. If above condition is met, another important requirement is the land size. If your land size is 450sqm or over, we can do a CDC approval. If it is less than 450sqm, we have to lodge the secondary dwelling application through the council.

In [[control theory]] a '''self-tuning''' system is capable of optimizing its own internal running parameters in order to maximize or minimize the fulfilment of an [[objective function]]; typically the maximization of [[efficiency]] or [[error#Science and engineering|error]] minimization.

Self-tuning and auto-tuning often refer to the same concept.  Many software research groups consider auto-tuning the proper nomenclature.

Self-tuning systems typically exhibit [[non-linear]] [[adaptive control]].  Self-tuning systems have been a hallmark of the aerospace industry for decades, as this sort of feedback is necessary to generate [[Multi-objective optimization|optimal multi-variable control]] for non-linear processes.  In the telecommunications industry, [[adaptive communications]] are often used to dynamically modify operational system parameters to maximize efficiency and robustness.

==Examples==
Examples of self-tuning systems in computing include:
*[[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]  (Transmission Control Protocol)
*[[Microsoft SQL Server]]  (Newer implementations only)
*[[FFTW]] (Fastest [[Fourier Transform]] in the West)
*ATLAS ([[Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software]])
*libtune (Tunables library for [[Linux]])
*PhiPAC (Self Tuning Linear Algebra Software for [[RISC]])
*[[MILEPOST GCC]] (Machine learning based self-tuning compiler)

Performance benefits can be substantial.  Professor [[Jack Dongarra]], an American computer scientist, claims self-tuning boosts performance, often on the order of 300%&lt;ref&gt;http://appliedmathematician.org/pdf/news/781.pdf Faster than a Speeding Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Digital self-tuning controllers are an example of self-tuning systems at the hardware level.

==Architecture==
Self-tuning systems are typically composed of four components: expectations, measurement, analysis, and actions. The expectations describe how the system should behave given exogenous conditions.

Measurements gather data about the conditions and behaviour.  Analysis helps determine whether the expectations are being met- and which subsequent actions should be performed. Common actions are gathering more data and performing dynamic reconfiguration of the system.

Self-tuning (self-adapting) systems of automatic control are systems whereby adaptation to randomly changing conditions is performed by means of automatically changing parameters or via automatically determining their optimum configuration &lt;ref&gt;http://bse.sci-lib.com/article099233.html Big Soviet Encyclopedia, Self-Tuning Systems {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. In any non-self-tuning automatic control system there are parameters which have an influence on system stability and control quality and which can be tuned. If these parameters remain constant whilst operating conditions (such as input signals or different characteristics of controlled objects) are substantially varying, control can degrade or even become unstable. Manual tuning is often cumbersome and sometimes impossible. In such cases, not only is using self-tuning systems technically and economically worthwhile, but it could be the only means of robust control. Self-tuning systems can be with or without parameter determination.

In systems with parameter determination the required level of control quality is achieved by automatically searching for an optimum (in some sense) set of parameter values. Control quality is described by a generalised characteristic which is usually a complex and not completely known or stable function of the primary parameters. This characteristic is either measured directly or computed based on the primary parameter values. The parameters are then tentatively varied. An analysis of the control quality characteristic oscillations caused by the varying of the parameters makes it possible to figure out if the parameters have optimum values, i.e.. if those values deliver extreme (minimum or maximum) values of the control quality characteristic. If the characteristic values deviate from an extremum, the parameters need to be varied until optimum values are found. Self-tuning systems with parameter determination can reliably operate in environments characterised by wide variations of exogenous conditions.

In practice systems with parameter determination require considerable time to find an optimum tuning, i.e. time necessary for self-tuning in such systems is bounded from below. Self-tuning systems without parameter determination do not have this disadvantage. In such systems, some characteristic of control quality is used (e.g., the first time derivative of a controlled parameter). Automatic tuning makes sure that this characteristic is kept within given bounds. Different self-tuning systems without parameter determination exist that are based on controlling transitional processes, frequency characteristics, etc. All of those are examples of closed-circuit self-tuning systems, whereby parameters are automatically corrected every time the quality characteristic value falls outside the allowable bounds. In contrast, open-circuit self-tuning systems are systems with para-metrical compensation, whereby input signal itself is controlled and system parameters are changed according to a specified procedure. This type of self-tuning can be close to instantaneous. However, in order to realise such self-tuning one needs to control the environment in which the system operates and a good enough understanding of how the environment influences the controlled system is required.

In practice self-tuning is done through the use of specialised hardware or adaptive software algorithms. Giving software the ability to self-tune (adapt):

#Facilitates controlling critical processes of systems;
#Approaches optimum operation regimes;
#Facilitates design unification of control systems;
#Shortens the lead times of system testing and tuning;
#Lowers the criticality of technological requirements on control systems by making the systems more robust;
#Saves personnel time for system tuning.

'''''Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta''''' (often shortened to '''''Shikasta''''') is a 1979 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Doris Lessing]], and is the first book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series. It was first published in the United States in October 1979 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in November 1979 by [[Jonathan Cape]]. Shikasta is also the name of the [[planets in science fiction|fictional planet]] featured in the novel.

Subtitled ''"Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days"'', ''Shikasta'' is the history of the planet Shikasta (an allegorical [[Earth]]) under the influence of three [[galactic empire]]s, Canopus, Sirius, and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The book is presented in the form of a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to Shikasta who document the planet's [[prehistory]], its degeneration leading to the "Century of Destruction" (the 20th century), and the [[Apocalypse]] ([[World War III]]).

''Shikasta'' draws on the [[Old Testament]] and is influenced by [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] themes in [[Sufism]], an [[Islam]]ic belief system in which Lessing had taken an interest in the mid-1960s. The book represented a major shift of focus in Lessing's writing, from realism to science fiction, and this disappointed many of her readers. It received mixed reviews from critics. Some were impressed by the scope and vision of the book, with one reviewer calling it "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Others were critical of the novel's bleakness, that humanity has no [[free will]] and that their fate lies in the hands of galactic empires.

The story of Shikasta is retold in the third book of the ''Canopus'' series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980), this time from the point of view of Sirius. Shikasta reappears in the fourth book in the series, ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' (1982), and the Zones, briefly mentioned in ''Shikasta'', are the subject of the second book in the series, ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980).

==Plot==
Canopus, a benevolent [[galactic empire]] centred at [[Canopus]] in the constellation [[Argo Navis]], colonises a young and promising planet they name Rohanda (the fruitful). They nurture its bourgeoning [[humanoid]]s and accelerate their evolution. When the Natives are ready, Canopus imposes a "Lock" on Rohanda that links it via "astral currents"&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; to the harmony and strength of the Canopean Empire. In addition to Canopus, two other empires also establish a presence on the planet: their ally, Sirius from the [[Sirius|star of the same name]], and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The Sirians confine their activities largely to [[Genetic engineering|genetic experiments]] on the southern continents during Rohanda's [[prehistory]] (described in Lessing's third book in the ''Canopus'' series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]''), while the Shammat of Puttiora remain dormant, waiting for opportunities to strike.

For many millennia the Natives of Rohanda prosper in a Canopean induced climate of peaceful coexistence and accelerated development. Then an unforeseen "cosmic re-alignment" puts Rohanda out of phase with Canopus which causes the Lock to break. Deprived of Canopus's resources and a steady stream of a substance called SOWF (substance-of-we-feeling), the Natives develop a "Degenerative Disease" that puts the goals of the individual ahead of those of the community.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; The Shammat exploit this disturbance and begin undermining Canopus's influence by infecting the Natives with their evil ways. As Rohanda degenerates into greed and conflict, the Canopeans reluctantly change its name to Shikasta (the stricken). Later in the book, Shikasta is identified as [[Earth]],&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; or an allegorical Earth.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

In an attempt to salvage Canopus's plans for Shikasta and correct the Natives' decline, Canopean emissaries are sent to the planet. Johor is one such emissary, who takes on the form of a Native and begins identifying those individuals who have not degenerated too far and are amenable to his corrective instructions. Johor then sends those he has successfully "converted" to spread the word among other Natives, and soon isolated communities begin to return to the pre-Shikastan days. But without the SOWF and Shammat's influence over the Natives, Canopus is fighting a losing battle and the planet declines further. By the Shikastan's 20th century, the planet has degenerated into war and self-destruction. Johor returns, but this time through Zone 6{{#tag:ref|Shikasta is surround by six metaphysical Zones (akin to [[Plane (esotericism)|cosmological planes]]), each representing different "levels of spiritual being";{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|p=16}} Zone 6 is "closest" to Shikasta and is the plane to which "[[soul]]s" of the planet's dead go, and from which souls are reborn ([[reincarnation|reincarnated]]) back to the planet.&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=111}} Lessing elaborates on the Zones in the next book in the ''Canopus'' series, ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980).|group="nb"|name=Zones}} from which he is born on the planet ([[Incarnation|incarnated]]) as a Shikastan, George Sherban. As Sherban grows up, he establishes contact with other Canopeans in disguise and then resumes his work trying to help the Shikastans. But famine and unemployment grow, and anarchy spreads.

On the eve of [[World War III]], Sherban and other emissaries relocate a small number of promising Shikastans to remote locations to escape the coming [[nuclear holocaust]].  He also takes part in the trial of all Europeans for the crimes of colonialism.  Europe has been conquered by China, but he persuades people that Europe was not the only offender.

The war reduces Shikasta's population by 99% and sweeps the planet clean of the "barbarians". The Shammat, who set the Shikastans on a course of self-destruction, self-destruct themselves and withdraw from the planet. The Canopeans help the survivors rebuild their lives and re-align themselves with Canopus. With a strengthened Lock and the SOWF flowing freely again, harmony and prosperity return to Shikasta.

==Background and genre==
[[File:Doris Lessing 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Doris Lessing speaking at a [[Cologne]] literature festival in Germany, 2006]]
In the mid-1960s Lessing had become interested in [[Sufism]], an [[Islam]]ic belief system, after reading ''[[The Sufis]]'' by [[Idries Shah]]. She described ''The Sufis'' as "the most surprising book [she] had read", and said it "changed [her] life".&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt; Lessing later met Shah, who became "a good friend [and] teacher".&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt; In the early 1970s Lessing began writing "inner space" fiction, which included the novels ''Briefing for a Descent into Hell'' (1971) and ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974).&lt;ref name=NobelPrize-bio/&gt; In the late 1970s she wrote ''Shikasta'' in which she used many [[Sufism|Sufi]] concepts.&lt;ref name=Hoyt/&gt;

''Shikasta'' was intended to be a "single self-contained book", but as Lessing's [[fictional universe]] developed, she found she had ideas for more than just one book, and ended up writing a [[Canopus in Argos|series of five]].{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} ''Shikasta'', and the ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series as a whole, fall into the category of [[soft science fiction]] ("space fiction" in Lessing's own words{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}}) due to their focus on characterization and social and cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of science and technology. [[Robert Alter]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre [[literary criticism|literary critic]] [[Northrop Frye]] called the "anatomy", which is "a combination of fantasy and morality".&lt;ref name=Alter/&gt; [[Gore Vidal]] placed Lessing's "science fiction" "somewhere between [[John Milton]] and [[L. Ron Hubbard]]".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[Idries Shah]], who introduced Lessing to [[Sufism]]&lt;ref name=Lessingon/&gt;]]
''Shikasta'' represented a major shift of focus for Lessing, influenced by [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] themes in Sufism.&lt;ref name=Mural/&gt; This switch to "science fiction" was not well received by readers and critics.&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoyt/&gt; By the late 1970s, Lessing was considered "one of the most honest, intelligent and engaged writers of the day",&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt; and [[Western culture|Western]] readers unfamiliar with Sufism were dismayed that Lessing had abandoned her "rational worldview".{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=21}} George Stade of ''[[The New York Times]]'' complained that "our Grand Mistress of lumpen realism has gone religious on us".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; The reaction of reviewers and readers to the first two books in the series, ''Shikasta'' and ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980), prompted Lessing to write in the Preface to the third book in the series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980):

{{quote|I would so like it if reviewers and readers could see this series, ''Canopus in Argos: Archive'', as a framework that enables me to tell (I hope) a beguiling tale or two; to put questions, both to myself and to others; to explore ideas and sociological possibilities.{{sfn|Lessing|1994b|loc="Preface", p. 11}}}}

Further criticism of the ''Canopus'' series followed, which included this comment by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]]: "One of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs. Lessing&amp;nbsp;... She now propagandizes on behalf of our insignificance in the cosmic razzmatazz."&lt;ref name=Leonard/&gt; Lessing replied by saying: "What they didn't realize was that in science fiction is some of the best [[social science fiction|social fiction]] of our time. I also admire the classic sort of science fiction, like ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', by [[Greg Bear]]. He's a great writer."&lt;ref name=Blume/&gt; Lessing said in 1983 that she would like to write stories about [[Red dwarf|red]] and [[White dwarf|white dwarves]], space rockets powered by [[anti-gravity]], and charmed and coloured [[quark]]s, "[b]ut we can't all be [[physicist]]s".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

Lessing later wrote several essays on Sufism which were published in her essay collection, ''Time Bites'' (2004).&lt;ref name=NobelPrize-bio/&gt; She was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and was described by the [[Swedish Academy]] as "that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny".&lt;ref name=NobelPrize-award/&gt;

Lessing dedicated ''Shikasta'' to her father. While she was still a child in [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, "Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn't really matter if we did blow ourselves up – plenty more where we came from."&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt; ''Shikasta'' gave rise to a [[Cult|religious cult]] in America.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Lessing said in an interview that its followers had written to her and asked, "When are we going to be visited by the gods?", and she told them that the book is "not a cosmology. It's an invention", and they replied, "Ah, you're just testing us".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

The name "Shikasta" comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word شکسته (''shekasteh'') meaning "broken",{{sfn|Perrakis|2004|p=86}} and is often seen used as the name of the [[Iran]]ian national style of [[Persian calligraphy]], [[Shikasta Nastaʿlīq|Shekasteh Nastaʿlīq]].&lt;ref name=PersianCalligraphy/&gt; In the book, Lessing does not state explicitly that the planet Shikasta is [[Earth]], but many critics believe that its similarities to Earth's history make it clear that Shikasta ''is'' Earth as seen by the Canopeans.{{sfn|Dixson|1990|p=17}}&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; Some of the documents in the book written by Shikastans refer to geographical locations and countries on Earth.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc=p. 267.

We stay in London, and then go to a family in Wales." – an extract from Rachel Sherban's journal)}} Other critics, however, interpret Shikasta as an allegorical Earth with parallel histories that deviate from time to time.{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=111}}&lt;ref name=Hazelton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

''Shikasta'' has been called an "anti-novel",&lt;ref name=Perrakis/&gt; and an "architectonic novel".{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=49}} It is the story of the planet Shikasta from the perspective of Canopus and is presented as a case study for "first-year students of Canopean Colonial Rule".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; It contains a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to the planet, extracts from the Canopean reference, ''History of Shikasta'',{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc=''History of Shikasta'', Vol. 3012, "The Century of Destruction", p. 109}} and copies of letters and journals written by selected Shikastans.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; The history of Shikasta is monitored by the virtually immortal Canopeans,&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; from Rohanda's [[prehistory]], through to Shikasta's "Century of Destruction" (Earth's 20th century), and into Earth's future when the Chinese occupy Europe and [[World War III]] breaks out.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; The book purports to be the "true" history of our planet.{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=49}}

''Shikasta'' alludes to the [[Old Testament]], [[Gnosticism]] and [[Sufism]],&lt;ref name=Hammersley/&gt; and draws on several [[Judeo-Christian]] themes.{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=49}} Lessing wrote in the book's [[preface]] that it has its roots in the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 10}} Her SOWF (Substance-Of-We-Feeling), the "spiritual nourishment" that flows from Canopus to Shikasta, is also a word she invented with a pronunciation similar to "Sufi".{{sfn|Galin|1997|p=86}} A reviewer of the book in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that ''Shikasta'' is a "reworking of the Bible",&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; and the Infinity Plus website draws parallels between the Canopeans and their emissaries, and God and his angels from the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=Hammersley/&gt; A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote that the "outer space" where the Canopeans come from is a metaphor for "religious or inner space".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; Thelma J. Shinn, in her book ''Worlds Within Women: Myth and Mythmaking in Fantastic Literature by Women'', described the struggle between Canopus and Shammat, played out on Shikasta, as the "eternal struggle between good and evil",{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=50}} and the "Degenerative Disease" that strikes Shikasta as a metaphor for the [[original sin]].{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=49}} Lessing said in an interview that the final war ([[World War III]]) at the end of the novel is the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref name=Frick/&gt; Phyllis Sternberg Perrakis wrote in ''The Journal of Bahá’í Studies'' that ''Shikasta'' is the "symbolic rendering of the coming of a new prophet to an earthlike planet",{{sfn|Perrakis|2004|p=74}} and relates it to [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá’í]] principles.{{sfn|Perrakis|2004|p=75}}

==Reception==
Paul Gray wrote in a review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' that the documents that make up ''Shikasta'' allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective "dramatically from the near infinite to the minute".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; He said that the book's cohesiveness is its variety, and noted how Lessing interspaces her "grand designs" and "configurations of enormous powers" with "passages of aching poignancy".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Gray said that ''Shikasta'' is closer to ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and the Old Testament than it is to [[Buck Rogers]], and may disappoint readers interpreting her "space fiction" as "science fiction".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans "could not&amp;nbsp;... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little "unsatisfying", but added that even if you do not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, "even furiously engaging on every page".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Gray called ''Shikasta'' "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;

Author [[Gore Vidal]] wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that ''Shikasta'' is a "work of a formidable imagination".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; He said that Lessing is "a master" of [[Eschatology|eschatological]] writing, but added that while her depictions of a terminal [[London]] are "very real", as a whole the book is "never quite real enough".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; Vidal also felt that Zone 6, Lessing's alternate [[Plane (esotericism)|plane]] for the dead,&lt;ref group="nb" name=Zones/&gt; is not as convincing as The Dry Lands in [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]’s ''[[Earthsea|Earthsea trilogy]]''. He compared the Canopeans and Shammat to [[John Milton|Milton]]'s God and Satan in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', but said that while Lucifer's "overthrow&amp;nbsp;... of his writerly creator is an awesome thing",  in ''Shikasta'' Lessing's human race with no [[free will]] is too passive and of no interest.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; Vidal attributed this to Lessing's "surrender" to the [[Sufism|Sufis]] and the SOWF (Substance-Of-We-Feeling), and not her inability to create good characters.&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;

''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reviewer George Stade said that ''Shikasta'' "forces us to think about&amp;nbsp;... what we are, how we got that way and where we are going", but complained that the book is filled with "false hopes", and that the fate of humankind relies on "theosophical emanations, cosmic influences, occult powers, spiritual visitations and stellar vibrations".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing "both indicts and exculpates" them, implying that humanity is bad, but it is not their fault.&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt; While Stade complemented Lessing on the book's satire, and her depictions of Zone 6, which he said "have the eerie beauty of ancient [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] texts", he "disapprove[d]" of the novel as a whole, but added, "that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading it".&lt;ref name=Stade/&gt;

Witing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. M. G. Lord called ''Shikasta'' an "epic" and suspected that it may have influenced the [[Swedish Academy|Nobel committee]] when they referred to Lessing as an "epicist of the female experience".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Thelma J. Shinn wrote in her book, ''Worlds Within Women: Myth and Mythmaking in Fantastic Literature by Women'', that Lessing's history of humanity in ''Shikasta'' is "pessimistic" but "convincing".{{sfn|Shinn|1986|p=52}} ''Infinity Plus'' described ''Shikasta'' as a "mainstream novel that uses SF ideas", and said that while Lessing was not able to predict the fall of the Soviet Union and the impact of computers, the novel "barely seems dated" because of her "cunningly non-specific" approach.&lt;ref name=Hammersley/&gt;

James Schellenberg writing in ''Challenging Destiny'', a Canadian science fiction and fantasy magazine, was impressed by ''Shikasta''{{'s}} "grand sense of perspective" and the context of humanity set in a "vaster scale of civilization and right-thinking".&lt;ref name=Schellenberg/&gt; He liked the concept of SOWF as a "metaphor of community connectedness", but felt it was an unusual way to build a [[utopia]].&lt;ref name=Schellenberg/&gt; The book's fractured storytelling leads to Lessing breaking the "famous dictum of writing – show, don't tell", and while that may work in certain circumstances, Schellenberg felt that that approach does not work very well in ''Shikasta''.&lt;ref name=Schellenberg/&gt; The [[online magazine]] ''Journey to the Sea'' found Lessing's inclusion of stories from the [[Hebrew Bible]] "entertaining and intriguing", and said she challenges the logical thinker's rejection of these [[Religious text|sacred texts]], suggesting that it is "imaginatively possible" that they could be true.&lt;ref name=Hoyt/&gt;

Following Lessing's death in 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' put ''Shikasta'' in their list of the top five Lessing books.&lt;ref name=Guardian-top5/&gt;

'''Standard time''' is the amount of time that should be allowed for an average [[worker]] to process one [[work unit]] using the standard method and working at a normal pace. The standard time includes some additional time, called the [[contingency allowance]], to provide for the worker's personal needs, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and unavoidable delays during the shift.

== Prerequisite for Valid Time Standards ==
*The task is performed by an average worker
*The worker's pace represents standard performance
*The worker uses the standard method
*The task is performed on a standard work unit

== Calculating the Standard Time ==

The standard time (Ts) is calculated from multiplying the observed time (To) by the performance rating (R) and the personal need, fatigue and unavoidable delays (PFD):
Ts = To*R*(1+PFD)

== Usages for Standard Time ==
*Estimate the quantity of the production
*Determine workforce size and equipment requirement
*Compare alternative methods
*Evaluate worker's performance
*Plan and schedule production and estimate costs

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="842">'''Sub-caliber training''' is used to save wear and expense when training with a larger gun by use of smaller weapons with identical ballistic characteristics. The smaller weapons could be inserted into the larger weapon's barrel, externally attached to the barrel or mounted above the weapon. Examples include the [[M303 Sub-Caliber insert]] for the {{convert|120|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[M120 mortar]] that allows the mortar to use {{convert|81|mm|1|abbr=on}} ammunition or the M49A1 sub-caliber device, which used [[7.62×51mm NATO]] rifle rounds in the {{convert|90|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[M67 recoilless rifle]]. These devices/weapons have been used for guns as large as the {{convert|12|-|16|in|1|adj=on|sp=us}} main guns of [[battleship]]s.

'''Total Communication''' ('''TC''') is an approach to [[Deaf education]] that aims to make use of a number of modes of communication such as [[Manual communication|signed]], [[oralism|oral]], auditory, written and visual aids, depending on the particular needs and abilities of the child.

In the UK 'Total Communication' (also known as 'Inclusive Communication') is an approach used, mainly by Speech and Language therapists, to help children and adults with learning disabilities communicate using any mode of communication such as symbols, signing (usually [[Makaton]]), photographs as well as the spoken and written word and gesture.  It has also been found to be useful for those recovering from a stroke or head injury where spoken language is impaired or for people whose language processing is affected, perhaps in old age or through dementia.

Total Communication not only helps deaf children learn to communicate but children who have down syndrome and other learning disabilities where it makes communication hard especially for school aged children and the families who are evolved. 

Total Communication focuses on teaching children special tools to help them communicate better like finger spelling, how to use body language to tell people how you feel, sign language, lip reading and other natural gestures to communicate. Total Communication encourages children to use the little bit of hearing they may have to help make this process work better, with the help of hearing aids and other different kind of implants. Not being able to communicate can be very frustrating, this can cause behavior problems when a child is not able to communicate what her or she needs. 

Total Communication uses both a visual aspect and hearing to help children communicate. When a child is in a classroom setting the teacher and the students may be speaking and using sign language at the same time. This is called simultaneous communication, this form of communication works best in a classroom setting. Teachers who teach these types of classes always emphasize learning the language first. There programs follow the sign language system based on the english system. 

Some things to always remember when using total communcation is that some children may process things at a slower pace, this mean you might have to wait up to 10 seconds to get an answer. The use of yes and no and short answer question are usually the best when asking questions   they only require one answer a yes or no. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icommunicatetherapy.com/child-speech-language/children-special-needs-learning-difficulties/key-guidelines-creating-total-communication-environment/|title=Key Guidelines to Creating a Total Communication Environment - icommunicate therapy|work=icommunicate therapy|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Using print like pictures or symbols can also really help children understand what you are trying to say.

To really help a child you need to understand his or her strengths and weaknesses. Cusacke494 

==History==
An approach very similar to Total Communication was developed by David Denton at the [[Maryland School for the Deaf]] in 1967. The term "Total Communication", though, and its specific philosophy, was first used by Roy Holcomb in California.&lt;ref&gt;Holcomb, R. K. (1970). The Total Approach: Beginning and structure. In R. Madebrink (Ed.) (1972). ''Proceedings of the International Congress on Education of the Deaf, Stockholm, 1970.''. Stockholm, Sweden: International Congress on Education of the Deaf, pp. 104-107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagengast, Larry. (1973) Deafness no handicap to newcomer. ''The Morning News'' (September 4, 1973), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted by the Maryland school as the official name for their educational philosophy. TC was supposed to find a middle ground in age-old disputes between [[oralism]] and [[manualism]], and as an alternative to [[Simultaneous Communication]]. In practice, however, most Total Communication programs use some form of Simultaneous Communication.

Total Communication educational programs have been established in the UK, France, U.S., China, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, France, Germany and elsewhere. In the United States, TC was most popular during the 1970s and 1980s, when most schools and programs for children who are Deaf, as well as most major organizations in the field supported the TC philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ericec.org/digests/e559.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111234/http://ericec.org/digests/e559.html|date=March 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the debate seems to be between TC programs and [[bilingual-bicultural education]].

There is little research concerning that the use of total communication in child centers or his or her own natural environment . But it is considered to be best practiced in early intervention. 

TC's original intent was to provide children with the communication tools needed for children to develop complete language. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hearinglikeme.com/total-communication/|title=How to Use "Total Communication" - Hearing Like Me|date=2016-09-06|work=Hearing Like Me|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;But in later years the philosophy of TC has often been over-simplified and has been confused with simultaneous communication. (found very little research on the confusion) Cusacke494

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2026">'''VISQ''' (Portuguese acronym for "Variables that Interact Semi-Quantitatively") is a scientific-educational [[software]] developed using [[Carnegie-Mellon]]'s [[Vpython#History|cT]], in the year of 1993 by M. Thielo (as a [[physics]] undergrad at the time), based on Jon Ogborn ideas for semi-quantitative modeling of [[dynamical systems]], for both [[MS-DOS]] and [[Macintosh]] systems (in 2012 the author published a new, Windows compatible version). Awarded by the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS) in 1994, the system is based on the theory of continuous [[neural networks]], and have been used in many research projects since then, mainly in Master and Doctoral Dissertations in the area of [[environmental education]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4807">'''Vaginal photoplethysmography''' ('''VPG''', '''VPP''') is a [[photoplethysmogram|technique using light]] to measure the [[vasocongestion|amount of blood]] in the walls of the [[vagina]].  The device that is used is called a vaginal [[photometer]].

==Use==
The device is used to try to obtain an objective measure of a woman's [[sexual arousal]]. There is an overall poor correlation (r = 0.26) between women's self-reported levels of desire and their VPG readings.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010| title = Agreement of Self-Reported and Genital Measures of Sexual Arousal in Men and Women: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 5–56 | pmc=2811244 | pmid=20049519 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9556-9 |vauthors=Chivers ML, Seto MC, Lalumière ML, Laan E, Grimbos T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrument==
The instrument used in the procedure is called vaginal [[photometer]]. The device has a clear shell, inside of which is a light source and a [[photocell]], which senses reflected light.  The use of the device is done with the assumption that the more light that is scattered back, and that the photocell senses, the more blood is in the walls of the vagina.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007/&gt; 

The output of the VPG can be filtered into two types of signals, which have different properties. The [[direct current]] signal is a measure of vaginal blood volume (VBV) and reflects the total blood volume in the [[vagina|vaginal tissues]].&lt;ref name="Hatch"&gt;Hatch, J. P. [“Vaginal photoplethysmography: Methodological considerations”],”Archives of Sexual Behavior, 8, 357–374”, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update inline|date=February 2018}} The [[alternating current]] signal is a measure of vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) and reflects the pressure change within the [[blood vessel]]s of the vaginal wall associated with each heartbeat.&lt;ref name="Hatch" /&gt; While changes in VBV occur in response to sexual and anxiety-inducing stimuli, changes in VPA only occur in response to sexual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Laan, E., Everaerd, W., &amp; Evers, A. [http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/21166/21166.PDF?sequence=1 “Assessment of female sexual arousal: Response specificity and construct validity”], “Psychophysiology, 32, 476–485”, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}} 
 
VPA is defined as the [[amplitude|peak-to-trough amplitude]] of the vaginal pulse wave. It is calculated by subtracting the means of all troughs from the means of all peaks experienced during stimulus presentation.VPA lacks an absolute scale of measurement; each unit of change (mV) does not correspond directly with a physiological change. Since VPA does not have a standard unit of measurement, it is difficult for researchers to make between-participant comparisons.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010/&gt;

==History==
VPG was first introduced in the 1960s by Palti and Berovici, who affixed a light source and photosensitive cell onto a [[speculum (medical)|gynecological speculum]] and recorded vaginal pulse waves.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jannsen|first1=Erick|last2=Prause|first2=Nicole|last3=Geer|first3=James H.|editor1-last=Cacioppo|editor1-first=John T.|editor2-last=Tassinary|editor2-first=Louis G.|editor3-last=Berntson|editor3-first=Gary|title=Handbook of Psychophysiology|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139461931|page=254|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Psychophysiology.html?id=E7hRKwVBXb4C|language=en|chapter=Chapter 11: The Sexual Response}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Molenkamp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molenkamp|first1=Bert|title=SexLab - Equipment &amp; Instruments - Vaginal Photoplethysmography|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/ei-vp-uvaprobe.html|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palti, Y. &amp; Bercovici, B.
