      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">The '''Académie Delécluse''' was an [[atelier]]-style art school in Paris, France, founded in the late 19th century by the painter Auguste Joseph Delécluse. It was exceptionally supportive of women artists, with more space being given to women students than to men.

==History==
The academy was founded by the French painter Auguste Joseph Delécluse (1855-1928) and seems to have been in business by 1884.&lt;ref name=butlin/&gt; It moved several times before establishing a permanent location in Montparnasse on the Rue Notre Dame des Champs.&lt;ref name=butlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=tpweekly/&gt; Like the [[Académie Julian]], [[Académie Colarossi]], and [[Académie Vitti]], it accepted women students. Men and women were trained separately, and it had two studios for women and only one for men.&lt;ref name=leverton/&gt; It proved to be particularly popular among English&lt;ref name=leverton/&gt; and American&lt;ref name=butlin/&gt; women artists. During its heyday, it was one of the four best-known ateliers in Paris,&lt;ref name=leverton/&gt; but its influence and ability to attract good students waned in the early 20th century.

Among its faculty were [[Edward Frederick Ertz]], [[Svend Rasmussen Svendsen]], Georges Callot, Paul Delance, and Delécluse himself. Notable students included [[Gertrude Partington Albright]], [[Nathaniel Choate]], [[Colin Campbell Cooper]], [[Emma Lampert Cooper]], [[Jenny Eakin Delony]], [[Simon Elwes]], [[Agnes Goodsir]], [[Harold Harvey (artist)|Harold Harvey]], [[Sarah Noble Ives]], [[Andrew Law (artist)|Andrew Law]], [[Blanche Lazzell]], [[Harry Leith-Ross]], [[Anna Lownes]], [[Cedric Morris]], [[Hilda Rix Nicholas]],  [[Roland Hinton Perry]], and [[Edith Somerville]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56050">The '''Adverse Childhood Experiences Study''' ('''ACE Study''') is a research study conducted by the American [[health maintenance organization]] [[Kaiser Permanente]]  and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref name="ACE Study"/&gt;  Participants were recruited to the study between 1995 and 1997 and have been in long-term follow up for health outcomes. The study has demonstrated an association of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) (aka [[childhood trauma]]) with health and social problems across the lifespan. The study is frequently cited as a notable landmark in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] research,&lt;ref name=Brooks2012/&gt; and has produced many scientific articles and conference and workshop presentations that examine ACEs.&lt;ref name="ACE Study"/&gt;

== Background ==

In the 1980s, the dropout rate of participants at [[Kaiser Permanente]]'s [[obesity]] clinic in [[San Diego]], [[California]], was about 50%; despite all of the dropouts successfully [[weight loss|losing weight]] under the program.&lt;ref name="Stevens October 2012"/&gt; Vincent Felitti, head of Kaiser Permanente’s Department of Preventive Medicine in San Diego, conducted interviews with people who had left the program, and discovered that a majority of 286 people he interviewed had experienced [[child sexual abuse|childhood sexual abuse]]. The interview findings suggested to Felitti that weight gain might be a coping mechanism for [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[fear]].&lt;ref name="Stevens October 2012"/&gt;

Felitti and Robert Anda from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) went on to survey childhood trauma experiences of over 17,000 Kaiser Permanente patient volunteers.&lt;ref name="Stevens October 2012"/&gt; The 17,337 participants were volunteers from approximately 26,000 consecutive Kaiser Permanente members. About half were female; 74.8% were white; the average age was 57; 75.2% had attended college; all had jobs and good health care, because they were members of the Kaiser [[health maintenance organization]].&lt;ref name=Prevalence/&gt;  Participants were asked about different types of [[childhood trauma]] that had been identified in earlier research literature:&lt;ref name=Anda200304/&gt;
* [[Physical abuse]] 
* [[Child sexual abuse|Sexual abuse]] 
* [[Emotional abuse]] 
* Physical [[neglect]]
* Emotional [[neglect]] 
* Exposure to [[domestic violence]]
* Household [[substance abuse]] 
* Household [[mental illness]] 
* Parental [[Marital separation|separation]] or [[divorce]] 
* [[Imprisonment|Incarcerated]] household member

== Findings ==

[[File:The ACE Pyramid.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Pyramid with horizontal layers representing, in ascending order, Adverse Childhood Experiences; Social, Emotional, and Cognitive Impairment; Adoption of Health-risk Behaviors; Disease, Disability, and Social Problems; and Early Death. A vertical arrow represents the course of life beginning at the base and moving upward. Smaller arrows depict gaps in scientific knowledge about the links between Adverse Childhood Experiences and latter risk factors.|The ACE Pyramid represents the conceptual framework for the ACE Study, which has uncovered how adverse childhood experiences are strongly related to various risk factors for disease throughout the lifespan, according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref name="ACE Pyramid"/&gt;&lt;ref name=About/&gt;]]

According to the United States' [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]], the ACE study found that:

* Adverse childhood experiences are common. For example, 28% of study participants reported physical abuse and 21% reported sexual abuse. Many also reported experiencing a divorce or parental separation, or having a parent with a mental and/or [[substance use disorder]].&lt;ref name=SAMHSA/&gt;
* Adverse childhood experiences often occur together. Almost 40% of the original sample reported two or more ACEs and 12.5% experienced four or more. Because ACEs occur in clusters, many subsequent studies have examined the cumulative effects of ACEs rather than the individual effects of each.&lt;ref name=SAMHSA/&gt;
* Adverse childhood experiences have a [[dose{{ndash}}response relationship|dose–response relationship]] with many health problems. As researchers followed participants over time, they discovered that a person's cumulative ACEs score has a strong, graded relationship to numerous health, [[social problem|social]], and behavioral problems throughout their lifespan, including substance use disorders. Furthermore, many problems related to ACEs tend to be [[comorbid]], or co-occurring.&lt;ref name=SAMHSA/&gt;

About two-thirds of individuals reported at least one adverse childhood experience; 87% of individuals who reported one ACE reported at least one additional ACE.&lt;ref name=Anda200304/&gt; The number of ACEs was strongly associated with adulthood high-risk health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, promiscuity, and severe obesity, and correlated with ill-health including depression, [[heart disease]], [[cancer]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic lung disease]] and shortened lifespan.&lt;ref name=Anda200304/&gt;&lt;ref name=Felitti1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middlebrooks2008/&gt; Compared to an ACE score of zero, having four adverse childhood experiences was associated with a seven-fold (700%) increase in [[alcoholism]], a doubling of risk of being diagnosed with cancer, and a four-fold increase in [[emphysema]]; an ACE score above six was associated with a 30-fold (3000%) increase in attempted suicide.&lt;ref name=Brooks2012/&gt;

The ACE study's results suggest that maltreatment and [[dysfunctional family|household dysfunction]] in childhood contribute to health problems decades later. These include [[chronic condition|chronic]] diseases—such as heart disease, cancer, [[stroke]], and [[diabetes]]—that are the most common causes of death and [[disability]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=WorldHealth/&gt; The study's findings, while relating to a specific population within the United States, might reasonably be assumed to reflect similar trends in other parts of the world, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=WorldHealth/&gt; The study was initially published in the ''[[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(98)00017-8/abstract|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=245–258|doi=10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8|year=1998|last1=Felitti|first1=Vincent J.|last2=Anda|first2=Robert F.|last3=Nordenberg|first3=Dale|last4=Williamson|first4=David F.|last5=Spitz|first5=Alison M.|last6=Edwards|first6=Valerie|last7=Koss|first7=Mary P.|last8=Marks|first8=James S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent surveys ==

The ACE Study has produced more than 50 articles that look at the prevalence and consequences of ACEs.&lt;ref name=Publications/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=February 2017}} It has been influential in several areas. Subsequent studies have confirmed the high frequency of adverse childhood experiences, or found even higher incidences in urban or youth populations.

The original study questions have been used to develop a 10-item [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] questionnaire.&lt;ref name="Bynum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anda 2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=Finding Your ACE Score |url=http://www.acestudy.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/ACE_Calculator-English.127143712.pdf |website=Acestudy.org |author=Anda, Robert |date=2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401151358/http://www.acestudy.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/ACE_Calculator-English.127143712.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous subsequent surveys have confirmed that adverse childhood experiences are frequent.

The CDC runs the [[Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System]] (BRFSS),&lt;ref name=Gudmunson2012/&gt; an annual survey conducted by individual state health departments in all 50 states. An expanded survey instrument in several states found each state to be similar.&lt;ref name="Bynum"/&gt; Some states have collected additional local data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACEs 360 - New York|url=http://www.iowaaces360.org/new-york.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACEs 360 - Arizona|url=http://www.iowaaces360.org/arizona.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse childhood experiences were even more frequent in studies in urban Philadelphia&lt;ref name=PhilAceStudy&gt;{{cite web|title=The Philadelphia Urban ACE Study|url=http://www.instituteforsafefamilies.org/philadelphia-urban-ace-study|accessdate=29 March 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a survey of young mothers (mostly younger than 19).&lt;ref name="Stevens2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Jane Ellen|title=Survey finds teen, young mothers using Crittenton services have alarmingly high ACE scores|url=http://acestoohigh.com/2012/11/02/survey-finds-teen-young-mothers-crittenton-ace-scores/|publisher=ACEs Too High!|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Internationally, an [[Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ)]] is undergoing [[Verification and validation|validation testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ)|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/activities/adverse_childhood_experiences/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys of adverse childhood experiences have been conducted in Romania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Adriana Baban|author2=Alina Cosma|author3=Robert Balazsi|author4=Dinesh Sethi|author5=Victor Olsavszky|title=Survey of Adverse Childhood Experiences among Romanian university students|date=2013|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/187713/e96846.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Czech Republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse childhood experiences survey among young people in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/violence-and-injuries/news/news/2013/12/adverse-childhood-experiences-survey-among-young-people-in-the-czech-republic|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Republic of Macedonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey of Adverse Childhood Experiences Among Young People in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/185570/e96810.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=29 March 2014|author1=Marija Raleva|author2=Dimitrinka Jordanova Peshevska|author3=Dinesh Sethi|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Canada, China and Jordan.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=March 2017}} Child Trends used data from the 2011/12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) to analyze ACEs prevalence in children nationally, and by state.

== Neurobiology of stress ==

{{see also|Social stress|Stress in early childhood}}
Cognitive and neuroscience researchers have examined possible mechanisms that might explain the negative consequences of adverse childhood experiences on adult health.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Adverse childhood experiences can alter the structural [[Human development (biology)|development]] of neural networks and the [[biochemistry]] of [[neuroendocrine system]]s&lt;ref name=Anda2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Danese2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Teicher/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolassa/&gt; and may have long-term effects on the body, including speeding up the processes of disease and aging and compromising immune systems.&lt;ref name=Sorrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moffitt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogosch2011/&gt;

''[[Allostatic load]]'' refers to the adaptive processes that maintain homeostasis during times of [[toxic stress]] through the production of mediators such as adrenalin, cortisol and other chemical messengers. According to researcher [[Bruce S. McEwen]], who coined the term: {{quote|These mediators of the stress response promote adaptation in the aftermath of acute stress, but they also contribute to allostatic overload, the wear and tear on the body and brain that result from being 'stressed out.' This conceptual framework has created a need to know how to improve the efficiency of the adaptive response to stressors while minimizing overactivity of the same systems, since such overactivity results in many of the common diseases of modern life. This framework has also helped to demystify the biology of stress by emphasizing the protective as well as the damaging effects of the body's attempts to cope with the challenges known as stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McEwen |first=Bruce S. |title=Stressed or stressed out: What is the difference? |journal=Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience |date=2005 |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=315–318 |pmid=16151535 |issn=1180-4882 |pmc=1197275}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additionally, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] transmission may occur due to stress during pregnancy or during interactions between mother and newborns. Maternal stress, depression, and exposure to partner violence have all been shown to have epigenetic effects on infants.&lt;ref name=Kolassa/&gt;

== Implementing practices ==

As knowledge about the prevalence and consequences of adverse childhood experiences increases, trauma-informed and resilience-building practices based on the research is being implemented in communities, education, public health departments, social services, faith-based organizations and criminal justice. A few states are considering legislation.

=== Communities ===
As knowledge about the prevalence and consequences of ACEs increases, more communities seek to integrate trauma-informed and resilience-building practices into their agencies and systems. Tarpon Springs, Florida, became the first trauma-informed community in 2011.&lt;ref name="Stevens_CP"&gt;Stevens [http://www.acesconnection.com/blog/community-projects/ "Community Projects"], ACEs Connection, 25 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tarpon"&gt;Saenger [http://peace4tarpon.org/ "PEACE4TARPON Trauma Informed Community Initiative"], 30 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma-informed initiatives in Tarpon Springs include trauma-awareness training for the local housing authority, changes in programs for ex-offenders, and new approaches to educating students with learning difficulties.&lt;ref name="Tarpon ACE"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/02/13/tarpon-springs-may-be-first-trauma-informed-city-in-u-s/ "Tarpon Springs, FL, may be first trauma-informed city in U.S."], ''ACEs Too High'', 13 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Research with American Indian tribal communities has demonstrated that social support and cultural involvement can ameliorate the effects of ACEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brockie|first=Teresa N.|last2=Elm|first2=Jessica H.

===Education===
ACEs exposure is widespread in the US, one study from the National Survey of Children’s Health reported that approximately 68% of children 0–17 years old had experienced one or more ACEs.&lt;ref name= "Blodgett &amp; Langigan, 2018"/&gt; The impact of ACEs on children can manifest in difficulties focusing, self regulating, trusting others, and can lead to negative cognitive effects. One study found that a child with 4 or more ACEs was 32 times more likely to be labeled with a behavioral or cognitive problem than a child with no ACEs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plumb |first1=J.L. |last2=Bush |first2=K.A. |last3=Kersevich |first3=S.E. |title=Trauma-Sensitive Schools: An Evidence Based Approach |journal=School Social Work Jounral |date=2016 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=37–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by the Area Health Education Center of Washington State University found that students with at least three ACEs are three times as likely to experience academic failure, six times as likely to have behavioral problems, and five times as likely to have attendance problems.&lt;ref name="Spokane"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/02/28/spokane-wa-students-child-trauma-prompts-search-for-prevention/ "Spokane, WA, students’ trauma prompts search for solutions"], ''ACEs Too High'', 28 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The trauma-informed school movement aims to train teachers and staff to help children self-regulate, and to help families that are having problems that result in children's normal response to trauma. It also seeks to provide behavioral consequences that will not re-traumatize a child.&lt;ref name="Mass Wash Schools"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/05/31/massachusetts-washington-state-lead-u-s-trauma-sensitive-school-movement/ "Massachusetts, Washington State lead U.S. trauma-sensitive school movement"], ''ACEs Too High'', 31 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma-informed education refers to the specific use of knowledge about trauma and its expression to modify support for children to improve their developmental success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blodgett |first1=C. |title=A Review of Community Efforts to Mitigate and Prevent Adverse Childhood Experiences and Trauma |journal=Washington State University Health Education Center: Spokane, WA |date=2013 |url=http://www.civiccanopy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/A-Review-of-Community-Efforts-to-Mitigate-and-Prevent-ACEs-Blodgett-Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) describes a trauma-informed school system as a place where school community members work to provide trauma awareness, knowledge and skills to respond to potentially negative outcomes following traumatic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=National Child Traumatic Stress Network, Schools Committee. |title=Creating, Supporting, and Sustaining Trauma-Informed Schools: A System Framework. |date=2017 |url=https://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/resources//creating_supporting_sustaining_trauma_informed_schools_a_systems_framework.pdf |location=Los Angeles, CA and Durham, NC: National Center for Child Traumatic Stress}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCTSN published a study that discussed the ARC (attachment, regulation and competency) model, which other researchers have based their subsequent studies of trauma-informed education practices off of.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorado |first1=J.S. |last2=Martinez |first2=M. |last3=McArthur |first3=L.E. |last4=Leibovitz |first4=T. |title=Healthy Environments and Response to Trauma in Schools (HEARTS): A Whole-School, Multi-Level, Prevention and Intervention Program for Creating Trauma-Informed Safe and Supportive Schools. |journal=School Mental Health |date=2016 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=163–176 |doi=10.1007/s12310-016-9177-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trauma-sensitive or trauma-informed schooling has become increasingly popular in Washington, Massachusetts, and California in the last 10 years.&lt;ref name="Blodgett &amp; Langigan, 2018" /&gt;

One study details how several San Francisco schools provided trauma-informed support based on the ARC model to students, adults in the system, and the school system as a whole through universal learning strategies, plans and techniques for children with trauma, and by providing trauma-informed therapy to those children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At El Dorado, an elementary school in this study in San Francisco, trauma-informed practices were associated with a suspension reduction of 89%.&lt;ref name="El Dorado"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2014/01/28/hearts-el-dorado-elementary/ "San Francisco’s El Dorado Elementary uses trauma-informed &amp; restorative practices; suspensions drop 89%"], ''ACEs Too High'', 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln High School in Walla Walla, Washington, adapted a trauma-informed approached to discipline and reduced its suspensions by 85%.&lt;ref name="Stevens April 2012"/&gt; Rather than standard punishment, students are taught to recognize their reaction to stress and learn to control it. Spokane, Washington, schools conducted a research study that demonstrated that academic risk was correlated with students’ experiences of traumatic events known to their teachers.&lt;ref name=Spokane /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spokane2"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2013/08/20/spokaneschools/ "There’s no such thing as a bad kid in these Spokane, WA, trauma-informed elementary schools"], ''ACEs Too High'', 20 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The same school district has begun a study to test the impact of trauma-informed intervention programs, in an attempt to reduce the impact of toxic stress.

In Brockton, Massachusetts, a community-wide meeting led to a trauma-informed approach being adopted by the Brockton School District.&lt;ref name="Mass Wash Schools"/&gt; So far, all of the district's elementary schools have implemented trauma-informed improvement plans, and there are plans to do the same in the middle school and high school. About one-fifth of the district teachers have participated in a course on teaching traumatized students. Police alert schools when they have arrested someone or visited at a student's address. Massachusetts state legislation has sought to require all schools to develop plans to create "safe and supportive schools".&lt;ref name="Mass Wash Schools"/&gt;

===Social services===
Social service providers—including welfare systems, housing authorities, homeless shelters, and [[domestic violence]] centers – are adopting trauma-informed approaches that help to prevent ACEs or minimize their impact. Utilizing tools that screen for trauma can help a social service worker direct their clients to interventions that meet their specific needs.&lt;ref name="Common Ground"&gt;Meister [http://jbcc.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/galleries/common_ground_july_2012.pdf#page=9/ "Addressing Child Traumatic Stress in Child Welfare"], ''Common Ground'', July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma-informed practices can also help social service providers look at how trauma impacts the whole family.&lt;ref name="FIT"&gt;Family-Informed Trauma Treatment Center [http://fittcenter.umaryland.edu/ 15 July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma-informed approaches can improve child welfare services by 1) openly discussing trauma and 2) addressing parental trauma.{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref name="Starve"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/07/30/starve-the-beast-says-these-cities-but-dont-cut-people-off/ "‘Starve the beast,’ say these cities – but don’t cut people off; reduce need for services instead"], ''ACEs Too High'', 30 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The New Hampshire Division for Children Youth and Families (DCYF) is taking a trauma-informed approach to their foster care services by educating staff about childhood trauma, screening children entering foster care for trauma, using trauma-informed language to mitigate further traumatization, mentoring birth parents and involving them in collaborative parenting, and training foster parents to be trauma-informed.&lt;ref name="Common Ground" /&gt;

In Albany, New York the HEARTS Initiative has led to local organizations developing trauma-informed practice.&lt;ref name="Starve" /&gt; Senior Hope Inc., an organization serving adults over the age of 50, began implementing the 10-question ACE survey and talking with their clients about childhood trauma. The LaSalle School, which serves orphaned and abandoned boys, began looking at delinquent boys in from a trauma-informed perspective and began administering the ACE questionnaire to their clients.

Housing authorities are also becoming trauma-informed. Supportive housing can sometimes recreate control and power dynamics associated with clients’ early trauma.&lt;ref name="Bebout"&gt;Bebout [http://homeless.samhsa.gov/resource/waiting-on-the-welcome-mat-how-to-be-at-home-with-trauma-informed-care-50308.aspx "Waiting on the welcome mat: How to be at home with trauma-informed care"], ''camh Cross Currents'', Winter 2010/2011&lt;/ref&gt; This can be reduced through trauma-informed practices, such as training staff to be respectful of clients' space by scheduling appointments and not letting themselves into clients' private spaces, and also understanding that an aggressive response may be trauma-related coping strategies.&lt;ref name="Bebout" /&gt; The housing authority in Tarpon Springs provided trauma-awareness training to staff so they could better understand and react to their clients' stress and anger resulting from poor employment, health, and housing.&lt;ref name="Tarpon ACE" /&gt;

A survey of 200 homeless individuals in California and New York demonstrated that more than 50% had experienced at least four ACEs.&lt;ref name="ACEs 360"&gt;ACEs 360 [http://www.iowaaces360.org/new-york.html "‘ACEs 360-New York"], ''ACEs 360 Iowa'', Retrieved 15 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Petaluma, California, the Committee on the Shelterless (COTS) uses a trauma-informed approach called Restorative Integral Support (RIS) to reduce intergenerational homelessness.&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;Larkin et al. [http://www.posttraumawellness.net/files/6113/5941/5120/RIS_COTS_PublishedCPTW.pdf "‘Mobilizing resilience and recovery in response to adverse childhood experiences (ACE) among homeless people: A Restorative Integral Support (RIS) case study"], ''Prevention Summit'', Retrieved 15 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; RIS increases awareness of and knowledge about ACEs, and calls on staff to be compassionate and focus on the whole person.  COTS now consider themselves ACE-informed and focus on resiliency and recovery.

===Health care services===
Screening for or talking about ACEs with parents and children can help to foster healthy physical and psychological development and can help doctors understand the circumstances that children and their parents are facing. By screening for ACEs in children, pediatric doctors and nurses can better understand behavioral problems. Some doctors have questioned whether some behaviors resulting in [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) diagnoses are in fact reactions to trauma. Children who have experienced four or more ACEs are three times as likely to take ADHD medication when compared with children with less than four ACEs.&lt;ref name="ADHD"&gt;Ruiz [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/how-childhood-trauma-could-be-mistaken-for-adhd/373328/ "How Childhood Trauma Could Be Mistaken for ADHD"], ''The Atlantic'', 7 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Screening parents for their ACEs allows doctors to provide the appropriate support to parents who have experienced trauma, helping them to build resilience, foster attachment with their children, and prevent a family cycle of ACEs.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2014/07/29/to-prevent-childhood-trauma-pediatricians-screen-children-and-their-parentsand-sometimes-just-parents/ "To prevent childhood trauma, pediatricians screen children and their parents…and sometimes, just parents…for childhood trauma"], ''ACEs Too High'', 29 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrimaryHealth"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics [http://www.cssp.org/reform/strengthening-families/messaging-at-the-intersection/Messaging-at-the-Intersections_Primary-Health.pdf "Promoting Children’s Health and Resiliency: A Strengthening Families Approach"], ''Center for the Study of Social Policy''&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma-informed pediatric care also allows doctors to develop a more trusting relationship with parents, opening the lines of communication.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;Gottlieb [http://www.mcpap.com/pdf/TraumaInformedCare.pdf "Toxic Stress and Trauma-Informed Pediatric Care"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905070027/http://www.mcpap.com/pdf/TraumaInformedCare.pdf |date=2014-09-05 }}, ''Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project''&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Montefiore Medical Center]] ACEs screenings will soon be implemented in 22 pediatric clinics. In a pilot program, any child with one parent who has an ACE score of four or higher is offered enrollment and receive a variety of services. For families enrolled in the program parents report fewer ER visits and children have healthier emotional and social development, compared with those not enrolled.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Montefiore Medical Group"&gt;Montefiore Medical Group [http://www.cham.org/programs/healthy-steps "Healthy Steps Program"], ''Montefiore Medical Group''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health===

Most American doctors as of 2015 do not use ACE surveys to assess patients.  Objections to doing so include that there are no [[randomized controlled trial]]s that show that such surveys can be used to actually improve health outcomes, there are no standard protocols for how to use the information gathered, and that revisiting negative childhood experiences could be emotionally traumatic.&lt;ref name="fear"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/03/377569539/even-some-doctors-fear-these-10-questions | title=10 Questions Some Doctors Are Afraid to Ask}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other obstacles to adoption include that the technique is not taught in medical schools, is not billable, and the nature of the conversation makes some doctors personally uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="fear" /&gt;

Some public health centers see ACEs as an important way (especially for mothers and children)&lt;ref name="Hellerstedt"&gt;Hellerstedt [http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ceed/projects/projectforbabies/Spring2013HealthyGenerations.pdf "Adverse Childhood Experience: Public Health Surveillance Measures"], ''Healthy Generations'', Spring 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to target health interventions for individuals during sensitive periods of development early in their life, or even in utero.&lt;ref name="Hellerstedt" /&gt; For example, Jefferson Country Public Health clinic in Port Townsend, Washington, now screens pregnant women, their partners, parents of children with special needs, and parents involved with CPS for ACEs.&lt;ref name="Public Health"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/03/23/public-health-clinic-adds-child-trauma-to-smoking-alcohol-hiv-screening/ "Public health clinic adds child trauma to smoking, alcohol, HIV screening"], ''ACEs Too High'', 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to patient counseling, the clinic treats ACEs like other health risks such as smoking or alcohol consumption.

===Resilience and Resources===

{{Refimprove section|date=August 2017}}

Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone.  According to the American Psychological Association (2017), resilience is the ability to adapt in the face of adversity, tragedy, threats or significant stress — such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems or workplace and financial stressors.  Resilience refers to bouncing back from difficult experiences in life.  There is nothing extraordinary about resilience.  People often demonstrate resilience in times of adversity.  However, being resilient does not mean that a person will not experience difficulty or distress, as emotional pain is common for people when they suffer from a major adversity or trauma.  In fact, the path to resilience often involves considerable emotional pain [70].

Resilience and access to other resources are protective factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brockie|first=Teresa N.|last2=Elm|first2=Jessica H.

Having resilience can benefit children who have been exposed to trauma and have a higher A.C.E score. Children who can learn to develop it, can use resilience to build themselves up after trauma. A child who has not developed resilience will have a harder time coping with the challenges that can come in adult life. People and children who are resilient, embrace the thinking that adverse experiences do not define who they are. They also can think about past events in their lives that were traumatic, and, try to reframe them in a way that is constructive. They are able to find strength in their struggle and ultimately can overcome the challenges and adversity that was faced in childhood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elm|first=Jessica H. L.|last2=Lewis|first2=Jordan P.|last3=Walters|first3=Karina L.|last4=Self|first4=Jen M.|date=2016-06-02|title='I'm in this world for a reason': Resilience and recovery among American Indian and Alaska Native two-spirit women|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|language=en|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=352–371|doi=10.1080/10894160.2016.1152813|pmid=27254761|issn=1089-4160}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In childhood, resiliency can come from having a caring adult in a child's life. Resiliency can also come from having meaningful moments such as an academic achievement or getting praise from teachers or mentors. 
	In adulthood, resilience is the concept of self-care. If you are taking care of yourself and taking the necessary time to reflect and build on your experiences, then you will have a higher capacity for taking care of others. Adults can also use this skill to counteract some of the trauma they have experienced. Self-care can mean a variety of things. One example of self-care, is knowing when you are beginning to feel burned out and then taking a step back to rest and recuperate yourself. Another component of self-care is practicing mindfulness or engaging in some form of meditation. If you are able to take the time to reflect upon your experiences, then you will be able to build a greater level of resiliency moving forward. All of these strategies put together can help to build resilience and counteract some of the childhood trauma that was experienced. With these strategies children can begin to heal after experiencing adverse childhood experiences. 
	This aspect of resiliency is so important because it enables people to find hope in their traumatic past. When first looking at the A.C.E. study and the different correlations that come with having 4 or more traumas, it is easy to feel defeated. It is even possible for this information to encourage people to have unhealthy coping behaviors. Introducing resilience and the data that supports its positive outcome in regards to trauma, allows for a light at the end of a tunnel. It gives people the opportunity to be [[proactive]] instead of reactive when it comes to addressing the traumas in their past.

===Criminal justice===
Since research suggests that incarcerated individuals are much more likely to have been exposed to violence and suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD),&lt;ref name="Corrections"&gt;Miller &amp; Najavits [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3402099/  "Creating trauma-informed correctional care: a balance of goals and environment"], ''European Journal of Psychotraumatology'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a trauma-informed approach may better help to address some of these criminogenic risk factors and can create a less traumatizing criminal justice experience.{{according to whom|date=December 2015}} Programs, like Seeking Safety, are often used to help individuals in the criminal justice system learn how to better cope with trauma, PTSD, and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="Seeking Safety"&gt;Seeking Safety [http://www.seekingsafety.org/  "Seeking Safety: A Model to Improve Coping Skills"], ''Seeking Safety''&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile courts better help deter children from crime and delinquency when they understand the trauma many of these children have experienced.&lt;ref name="Juvenile Courts"&gt;Buffington et al.

===Faith-based organizations===
{{Primary sources|section |date=August 2018|reason=Sources used are connected to orgs named; independent, published sources needed}}

Some faith-based organizations offer spiritual services in response to traumas identified by ACE surveys.  For example, the founder of ACE Overcomers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aceovercomers.com/about-us.html | title=About Us |website=aceovercomers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined the epidemiology of ACEs, the neurobiology of toxic stress and principles of the Christian [[Bible]] into a workbook and 12-week course used by [[clergy]] in several states.&lt;ref name="pastor"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/03/13/ex-pastor-marries-science-bible-studies-to-heal-wounds-of-childhood-trauma/ "Ex-pastor marries science, Bible studies to heal wounds of childhood trauma"], ''ACEs Connection'', 13 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Linda D.|last2=Carroll|first2=Paul|last3=Hamilton|first3=W.

===Legislation===
Vermont has passed a bill, Act 43(H.508), an act relating to building resilience for individuals experiencing adverse childhood experiences which acknowledges the life span effects of ACEs on health outcomes, seeks wide use of ACE screening by health providers and aims to educate medical and health school students about ACEs.&lt;ref&gt;http://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/ACTS/ACT043/ACT043%20As%20Enacted.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/ACTS/ACT043/ACT043%20As%20Enacted.pdf|title=No. 43.

'''Allegorical interpretation of the Bible''' is an interpretive method ([[exegesis]]) that assumes that the [[Bible]] has various levels of meaning and tends to focus on the spiritual sense, which includes the [[allegory|allegorical sense]], the [[tropological reading|moral (or tropological)]] sense, and the [[anagoge|anagogical sense]], as opposed to the [[literal and figurative language|literal]] sense. It is sometimes referred to as the ''[[quadriga]]'', a reference to the Roman chariot that was drawn by four horses.

Allegorical interpretation has its origins in both Greek thought and the [[rabbinical school]]s of Judaism. In the Middle Ages, it was used by Bible commentators of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan A. Barney (1989). "Allegory". Dictionary of the Middle Ages. Vol-1. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four types==
[[File:Wright The Journey of Life 1775 Cornell CUL PJM 1025 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.0| Christian allegorical map of The Journey of Life, or an Accurate Map of the Roads, Counties, Towns &amp;c. in the Ways to Happiness &amp; Misery, 1775]]
Scriptural interpretation is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Quadriga]]'', a reference to the Roman chariot that was pulled by four horses abreast. The four horses are symbolic of the four submethods of Scriptural interpretation:

* Literal interpretation: explanation of the meaning of events for historical purposes from a neutral perspective by trying to understand the text in the culture and time it was written, and location and language it was composed in. That is, since the 19th century, usually ascertained using the higher critical methods like source criticism and form criticism. In many modern seminaries and universities, the literal meaning is usually focused on to a nearly complete abandonment of the spiritual methods, as is very obvious when comparing commentary from a Douay Rheims or Confraternity or Knox Bible with a New Jerusalem, New RSV or NABRE.&lt;ref&gt;Glucksberg, Sam (2001-07-26). ''Understanding Figurative Language from Metaphor to Idioms: From Metaphor to Idioms''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780195111095}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anagogic interpretation: dealing with the future events of Christian history (eschatology) as well as heaven, purgatory, hell, the last judgement, the General Resurrection and second Advent of Christ, etc. (prophecies).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, S.V. "Anagogical Interpretation", Accessed March 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Typological (or allegorical) interpretation: connecting the events of the Old Testament with the New Testament, particularly drawing allegorical connections between the events of Christ’s life with the stories of the Old Testament. Also, a passage speaks directly to someone such as when [[Francis of Assisi]] heard the passage to sell all he had. It can also typologically point to the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is the ark which held the Word of God; Judith, who slew a tyrant is a Marian type; the burning bush, which contains the fire of God but was not consumed, as Mary held the Second Person of the Trinity in her womb but was not burnt up.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, Virginia (1992). The Risen Adam: D.H. Lawrence’s Revisionist Typology. {{ISBN|0271028459}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tropological (or moral) interpretation: "the [[moral of the story]]," or how one should act now. Many of Jesus' parables and the [[Book of Proverbs]] and other wisdom books are packed with tropological meaning&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, Charles, ed. (1913). “Scriptural Tropology”. Catholic Encyclopaedia. Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Latin rhyme designed to help scholars remember the four interpretations survives from the Middle Ages:
{{quote|''Litera gesta docet, Quid credas allegoria,
''Moralis quid agas, Quo tendas anagogia''.&lt;ref name="auto1" &gt;Grant, Robert M. (1963). A Short History of Biblical Interpretation. New York. {{ISBN|0800617622}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rhyme is roughly translated:

The literal teaches what God and our ancestors did,

The allegory is where our faith and belief is hid,

The moral meaning gives us the rule of daily life,

The anagogy shows us where we end our strife.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

==Antiquity ==
[[Origen]], in his ''Treatise on First Principles'', recommends for the Old and New Testaments to be interpreted allegorically at three levels, the "flesh," the "soul," and the "spirit." He states that many of the events recounted in the Scriptures, if they are interpreted in the literal, or fleshly, sense, are impossible or nonsensical. They must be interpreted allegorically to be understood. Some passages have parts that are literally true and parts that are literally impossible. Then, "the reader must endeavor to grasp the entire meaning, connecting by an intellectual process the account of what is literally impossible with the parts that are not impossible but historically true, these being interpreted allegorically in common with the part which, so far as the letter goes, did not happen at all."&lt;ref&gt;''On First Principles'', in ''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
It is a common misconception that [[Paul the Apostle]]'s [[Letter to the Galatians]], in the [[New Testament]], interprets the story of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 16:1-6) allegorically (Galatians 4:21-24). Rather Paul is explaining an allegory - these are two entirely different things.  An explanation is not a call for universal use of an interprative method.  Paul explains Hagar's son [[Ishmael]] is a representation of the fleshly children of [[Abraham]] and Sarah's son [[Isaac]] is a representation of the spiritual children of Abraham, the "children of the promise."

==Middle Ages==
People of the [[Middle Ages]] shaped their ideas and institutions from drawing on the cultural legacies of the ancient world.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;William R. Cook and Ronald B. Herzman (2001). Discovering the Middle Ages. The Teaching Company. {{ISBN|1-56585-701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not see the break between themselves and their predecessors that today's observers see; they saw continuity with themselves and the ancient world by using allegory to bring together the gaps.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; The use of allegorical interpretation in the Middle Ages began as a Christian method for studying the differences between the two Testaments (tropological interpretation).&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Christian scholars believed both Testaments were equally inspired divinely by God and sought to understand the differences between Old Testament and New Testament laws.&lt;ref name="biologos"&gt;http://biologos.org/questions/early-interpretations-of-genesis&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholars believed the Old Testament to serve as an allegory of New Testament events, such as the story of Jonah and the whale, which represents Jesus' death and resurrection.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; According to the Old Testament [[Book of Jonah]], a prophet spent three days in the belly of a fish. Medieval scholars believed this was an allegory (using the typological interpretation) of Jesus' death and his being in the tomb for three days before he rose from the dead.

Another popular allegorical work studied in the Middle Ages comes from [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan A. Barney (1989). “Allegory.” Dictionary of the Middle Ages. Vol-1. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, commonly known as the [[Allegory of the Cave]], Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all their lives facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire and begin to ascribe forms to the shadows.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Stephen (1997), "Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5–7)", Plato: Republic, London: Wordsworth Editions, pp. pages xiv–xvi, {{ISBN|1-85326-483-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called '''artistic revolutions'''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.

== Artistic revolution and political revolutions ==

The role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing.

Artists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

No art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.&lt;ref&gt;jonathanjonesblog&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of revolutionary art in conjunction with cultural and political movements:

*[[Trotskyist]] &amp; [[Diego Rivera]]
*[[Black Panther Party]] &amp; [[Emory Douglas]]
*Cuban [[Poster art]]
*[[Social realism]] &amp; [[Ben Shahn]]
*[[Feminist art]] &amp; the [[Guerrilla Girls]]
*[[Industrial Workers of the World]] &amp; [[Woody Guthrie]]

== Artistic revolution of style ==

[http://www.art-head-start.com/3d/squid/revolution300.jpg Here] is an example of an Artistic Revolution Pieces

== Scientific and Technological ==

Not all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists.  The stylistic revolution known as [[Impressionism]],  by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.

[[Eugene Chevreul]], a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works,  began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics.  Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other.  The French painter Eugène Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones,  embraced Chevreul's book, "The Law of Contrast of Color (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum.  Inspired by Chevreul’s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer’s eye to combine them optically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Eugene-Chevreul&lt;/ref&gt;

They were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance,  painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out.  in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/?no-ist, May 2013, by Perry Hurt&lt;/ref&gt;   Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.

Paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world,  to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment.  Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments -  chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of "impressionists" - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/#P4ovFKfbRLyMIhQT.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s.  It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings.&lt;ref&gt;"Speculating Daguerre: Art and Enterprise in the Work of L. J. M. Daguerre" by Stephen C. Pinson, Chicago, (2012) p. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt;  The neo-classical subject matter,  limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light -  not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events.&lt;ref&gt;Review of "The Lens of Impressionism," at University of Michigan Museum of Art, October- Dec. 2009 by Simon Kelly, Volume 9, Issue 1 Spring 2010, http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring10/the-lens-of-impressionism&lt;/ref&gt; Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.

 [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]  - in their framing, use of color, light and shadow, subject matter  - put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning.

== Faking revolution: the C.I.A. and Abstract Expressionism ==

Their initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the  [[Abstract Expressionists]] who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war.  At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in "my four year old could do that"—these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50's,  expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood.  [[Jackson Pollock]] who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in Life Magazine.

In fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones,  abstract expressionists like Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the C.I.A. in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was, " said former C.I.A. case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995.  Ironically, the covert C.I.A. support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, "If that's art, I'm a Hottentot."  Thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using C.I.A. funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit Abstract Expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the C.I.A.. in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America's leading institution for 20th Century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/17/unpopular-front&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic Movements ==

=== [[Art in ancient Greece|Ancient &amp; Classical Art]] ===
Key dates: 15000 BCE / 400 BCE-200CE / 350 CE-450CE&lt;br /&gt;
Ancient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.&lt;br /&gt;
Classical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.&lt;br /&gt;
Byzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.&lt;ref name=artmovements&gt;http://www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Gothic architecture|Medieval &amp; Gothic]]===
Key dates: 400CE&lt;br /&gt;
Medieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.&lt;br /&gt;
Gothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.&lt;br /&gt;
First developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Renaissance]]===
Key dates: 14th century&lt;br /&gt;
This movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante. Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht Dürer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 16th century Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Brunelleschi, Raphael da Urbino, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Donatello Bardi.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Mannerism]]===
Key dates: 1520-1600&lt;br /&gt;
Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Andrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Baroque]]===
Key dates: 17th century&lt;br /&gt;
Baroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as a reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.&lt;br /&gt;
This movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Vermeer.&lt;br /&gt;
In the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Rococo]]===
Key dates: 18th century&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word "rocaille", which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells used to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. &lt;br /&gt;
Characterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
The Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffman, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Velázquez Vermeer&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]]===
Key dates: 1750-1880&lt;br /&gt;
A nineteenth-century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Jacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Romanticism]]===
Key dates: 1800-1880&lt;br /&gt;
Romanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.&lt;br /&gt;
Although Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.&lt;br /&gt;
Great artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.&lt;br /&gt;
In the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.&lt;br /&gt;
Obvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th-century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
George Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eugène Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5628">[[File:BurSagaleBC762-06-15.gif|thumb|]]
The '''Assyrian eclipse''', also known as the Bur-Sagale eclipse, is a [[solar eclipse]] recorded in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] [[eponym list]]s, most likely dating the ninth year of the reign of king [[Ashur-dan III]].  The eclipse is identified with the one that occurred on 15 June 763 BC (proleptic Julian calendar).

The entry is short and reads:
:"[year of] Bur-Sagale of Guzana. Revolt in the city of Assur. In the month [[Babylonian_calendar#Months|Simanu]] an eclipse of the sun took place."
The phrase used — ''[[shamash]]'' ("the sun") ''akallu'' ("bent", "twisted", "crooked", "distorted", "obscured") — has been interpreted  as a reference to a solar eclipse since the first [[decipherment of cuneiform]] in the mid 19th century.
The name ''Bur-Sagale'' (also rendered ''Bur-Saggile, Pur-Sagale'' or ''Par-Sagale'') is the name of the [[limmu]] official 
in the [[eponym dating system|eponymous year]].

In 1867, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] identified near-[[total eclipse]] of 15 June 763 BC as the most likely candidate (the month ''Simanu'' corresponding to the May/June lunation),&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, Henry Creswicke, "The Assyrian Canon Verified by the Record of a Solar Eclipse, B.C. 763", ''The Athenaeum: Journal of Literature, Science and the Fine Arts'', nr. 2064, 660-661 [18 May 1867].[https://books.google.com/books?id=L5dTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA660#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true]&lt;/ref&gt;  visible in northern Assyria just before noon. 
This date has been widely accepted ever since;  the identification is also substantiated by other astronomical observations from the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Hunger, "Zur Datierung der neuassyrischen Eponymenliste," ''Altorientalische Forschungen'', Vol. 35:2, 2008, pp. 323-325. An English translation is available on the web: [http://kristenfrihet.se/kf4/dating.htm#_ftnref1]&lt;/ref&gt;

This record is one of the crucial pieces of evidence providing an absolute [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]] for the Assyrian period.

&lt;!--
[[Babylonian calendar]]: (explain relevance to the topic)

The mainstream view is that the beginning of the Babylonian year was not determined by observing the equinox, but by observing the appearance of certain constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Schaumberger, Johann ''3. Ergänzungsheft zum Ersten und Zweiten Buch von Franz Xaver Kugler, Sterndienst and Sternkunde in Babel'', Münster in Westfalen, Verlag der Aschendorffschen Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1935, pp. 340-344 [https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125008378909#page/n109/mode/1up]; Hermann Hunger, "A Scheme for Intercalary Months from Babylonia," in ''Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes'',67. Band, Wien 1975, pp. 21-28. Cf. also Hermann Hunger's article in ''Reallexikon der Assyriologie'', Band 10, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York, 2005, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed examination of 101 New Year dates between 748 and 539 BC shows that the dates of the New Year shifted{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In the eighth century it often began before the vernal equinox. The commonly-held belief is that "the aimed-for beginning of the Babylonian year in the eighth century fell about two weeks before the equinox." During the reign of [[Nabopolassar]] (625-605 BC) there was a shift to about ten days after the equinox, although there still were years when the New Year began before the equinox. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In summary, the situation in Babylonia before the last third of the eighth century seems to agree with the statement in MUL.APIN (Hunger and Pingree 1989) that the vernal equinox fell on Nisan 15. Probably around 730 the aimed-for beginning of the Babylonian year was shifted some two weeks upwards in relation to the solar year, so the average New Year's Day fell shortly before the vernal equinox. This holds true for the entire seventh century. Only around 600 did a second shift occur, which pushed the average beginning of the year to about two weeks after the vernal equinox (figure 4B).&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, Manuel "A Common Source for the Late Babylonian Chronicles Dealing with the Eighth and Seventh Centuries," ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 120:4, October–December 2000, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Attachment disorder''' is a broad term intended to describe [[mental disorder|disorder]]s of [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[behavior]], and [[Interpersonal relationship|social relation]]ships arising from a failure to form normal [[attachment theory|attachments]] to [[Primary caregiver|primary care giving figures]] in early [[Attachment in children|childhood]]. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of [[neglect]], [[Child abuse|abuse]], abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].&lt;ref&gt;Fonagy, Peter. ''Attachment Theory and Psychoanalysis''. Other Professional, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A person's ''attachment style'' is permanently established before the age of three. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.

The term attachment disorder is used to describe [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on the age of the individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality.&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; No list of [[symptom]]s can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of [[age appropriate]] social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.

There are currently two main areas of theory and practice relating to the definition and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of attachment disorder, and considerable discussion about a broader definition altogether. The first main area is based on scientific enquiry, is found in academic journals and books and pays close attention to [[attachment theory]]. It is described in [[ICD-10]] as [[reactive attachment disorder]], or "RAD" for the inhibited form, and [[disinhibited attachment disorder]], or "DAD" for the disinhibited form. In [[DSM-IV-TR]] both comparable inhibited and disinhibited types are called reactive attachment disorder or "RAD".&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al. 2006 p78"&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006) p78&lt;/ref&gt;

The second area is controversial and considered [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="Berlin et al."&gt;{{Cite book |author=Berlin LJ |year=2005 |contribution=Preface |title=Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |veditors=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT |series=Duke series in child development and public policy |publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-59385-470-6 | pages=xvii|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in [[clinic]]al practice, on websites and in books and publications, but has little or no [[Evidence based medicine|evidence base]]. It makes controversial claims relating to a basis in attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser p 183&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these controversial [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] of attachment disorder is linked to the use of pseudoscientific [[Attachment therapy|attachment therapies]] to treat them.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al. 2006 p78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlin et al." /&gt;

Some authors have suggested that attachment, as an aspect of emotional [[Child development|development]], is better assessed along a spectrum than considered to fall into two non-overlapping categories. This spectrum would have at one end the characteristics called secure attachment; midway along the range of disturbance would be insecure or other undesirable attachment styles; at the other extreme would be
non-attachment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor &amp; Zeanah, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement has not yet been reached with respect to diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. p. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the term is also sometimes used to cover difficulties arising in relation to various attachment styles which may not be disorders in the clinical sense.

==''Attachment'' and ''attachment disorder''==
{{main | Attachment theory | Attachment in children}}
[[Attachment theory]] is primarily an [[Adaptation|evolutionary]] and [[Ethology|ethological theory]]. In relation to infants, it primarily consists of ''proximity seeking'' to an ''attachment figure'' in the face of threat, for the purpose of survival.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1970) p 181&lt;/ref&gt; Although an attachment is a "tie," it is not synonymous with love and affection, despite their often going together and a healthy attachment is considered to be an important foundation of all subsequent relationships. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton &amp; Munholland (1999) p 89&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental aspect of attachment is called ''basic trust''. Basic trust is a broader concept than attachment in that it extends beyond the infant-caregiver relationship to "...the wider social network of trustable and caring others."&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;Newman, Barbara M., and Philip R. Newman. ''Development through Life: A Psychosocial Approach''. 12th ed. Stamford: Cenage Learning, 2015. 177. Print. {{ISBN|9781285459967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "...links confidence about the past with faith about the future."&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; [[Erik Erikson|"Erikson]] argues that the sense of trust in oneself and others is the foundation of human development"&lt;ref&gt;Kail, Robert V., and John C. Cavanaugh. ''Human Development: A Life-span View''. 5th ed. Australia: Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2010. 168. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and with a balance of mistrust produces [[hope]].

In the [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] sense, a [[Disease|disorder]] is a condition requiring [[therapy|treatment]] as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders.&lt;ref&gt;AACAP 2005, p1208&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. [[Reactive attachment disorder]] indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of ''proximity seeking'' to an identified ''attachment figure''. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of [[Reactive attachment disorder|RAD]] under [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[ICD-10]] are largely based on this understanding of the nature of attachment.

The words ''[[Attachment in children|attachment style]]'' or ''pattern'' refer to the various types of attachment arising from early care experiences, called ''secure'', ''anxious-ambivalent'', ''anxious-avoidant'', (all organized), and ''disorganized''. Some of these styles are more problematic than others, and, although they are not disorders in the clinical sense, are sometimes discussed under the term 'attachment disorder'.

Discussion of the disorganized attachment style sometimes includes this style under the rubric of attachment disorders because disorganized attachment is seen as the beginning of a developmental trajectory that will take the individual ever further from the normal range, culminating in actual disorders of thought, behavior, or mood.&lt;ref&gt;Levy K.N. et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in the person's life.

[[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] and colleagues proposed an alternative set of [[Criterion validity|criteria]] (see below) of three categories of attachment disorder, namely "no discriminated attachment figure", "secure base distortions" and "disrupted attachment disorder". These classifications consider that a disorder is a variation that requires treatment rather than an individual difference within the normal range.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p 223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boris and Zeanah's typology==
Many leading attachment theorists, such as [[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] and Leiberman, have recognized the limitations of the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria and proposed broader diagnostic criteria. There is as yet no official consensus on these criteria. The APSAC Taskforce recognised in its recommendations that "attachment problems extending beyond RAD, are a real and appropriate concern for professionals working with children", and set out recommendations for assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin (2006) p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Boris and Zeanah (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Boris &amp; Zeannah (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; have offered an approach to attachment disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an attachment, those where there is a distorted relationship, and those where an existing attachment has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no attachment to a ''specified'' attachment figure.

Boris and Zeanah use the term "disorder of attachment" to indicate a situation in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. Such children may be indiscriminately sociable and approach all adults, whether familiar or not; alternatively, they may be emotionally withdrawn and fail to seek comfort from anyone. This type of attachment problem is parallel to Reactive Attachment Disorder as defined in DSM and ICD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms as described above.

Boris and Zeanah also describe a condition they term "secure base distortion". In this situation, the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, may cling to the adult, may be excessively compliant, or may show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult.

The third type of disorder discussed by Boris and Zeanah is termed "disrupted attachment". This type of problem, which is not covered under other approaches to disordered attachment, results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. The young child's reaction to such a loss is parallel to the grief reaction of an older person, with progressive changes from protest (crying and searching) to despair, sadness, and withdrawal from communication or play, and finally detachment from the original relationship and recovery of social and play activities.

Most recently, [[Daniel Schechter]] and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between maternal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood.   Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Issue.  Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics of North America, 18(3), 665-687.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of attachment style==
{{main|Attachment theory | Attachment in children}}
The majority of 1-year-old children can tolerate brief separations from familiar caregivers and are quickly comforted when the caregivers return. These children also use familiar people as a "secure base" and return to them periodically when exploring a new situation. Such children are said to have a secure attachment style, and characteristically continue to develop well both cognitively and emotionally.

Smaller numbers of children show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, they appear to be on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.

Insecure attachment styles in toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or may go to the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to him/her, and fail to return to their previous play. These children are more likely to have later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.

A small group of toddlers show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness of the person who is being sought.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J (2006) p 107&lt;/ref&gt; Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;VanIJzendoorn &amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah et al. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible mechanisms==
One study has reported a connection between a specific [[genetic marker]] and disorganized attachment (not RAD) associated with problems of parenting.&lt;ref name= "Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Ijzendoorn MH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ |title=DRD4 7-repeat polymorphism moderates the association between maternal unresolved loss or trauma and infant disorganization |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=291–307 |year=2006 |pmid=17178609 |doi=10.1080/14616730601048159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another author has compared atypical social behavior in genetic conditions such as [[Williams syndrome]] with behaviors symptomatic of RAD.&lt;ref name ="Zeanah 2007"&gt;Zeanah CH (2007). "Reactive Attachment Disorder". In  Narrow WE, First MB ''et al.'' (Eds.) ''Gender and age consideration in psychiatric diagnosis.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association. {{ISBN|0-89042-295-8}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical attachment development begins with unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to send and receive social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This makes it possible for an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.&lt;ref name="Dozier ''et al.'' (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dozier M, Stovall KC, Albus KE, Bates B |title=Attachment for infants in foster care: the role of caregiver state of mind |journal=Child Dev |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=1467–77 |year=2001 |pmid=11699682 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With insensitive or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, an infant may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways of coping with fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[[DSM-IV]] [[American Psychiatric Association]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as the development of an internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.&lt;ref name="Mercer, Sarner, &amp; Rosa 2003"&gt;Mercer J, Sarner L and Rosa L (2003) ''Attachment Therapy on Trial: The Torture and Death of Candace Newmaker.'' Westport, CT: Praeger {{ISBN|0-275-97675-0}}, pp. 98–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), pp. 64–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atypical development of fearfulness, with a constitutional tendency either to excessive or inadequate fear reactions, might be necessary before an infant is vulnerable to the effects of poor attachment experiences.&lt;ref name="Marshall &amp; Fox (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marshall, |first=P.J. |authorlink= |author2=Fox, N.A. |year=2005 |month= |title=Relationship between behavioral reactivity at 4 months and attachment classification at 14 months in a selected sample |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28 |issue= 4|pages=492–502 |doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.06.002 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the two variations of RAD may develop from the same inability to develop "stranger-wariness" due to inadequate care. Appropriate fear responses may only be able to develop after an infant has first begun to form a selective attachment. An infant who is not in a position to do this cannot afford not to show interest in any person as they may be potential attachment figures. Faced with a swift succession of carers the child may have no opportunity to form a selective attachment until the possible biologically-determined sensitive period for developing stranger-wariness has passed. It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p"&gt;Prior and Glaser p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inhibited form infants behave as if their attachment system has been "switched off". However the innate capacity for attachment behavior cannot be lost. This may explain why children diagnosed with the inhibited form of RAD from institutions almost invariably go on to show formation of attachment behavior to good carers. However children who suffer the inhibited form as a consequence of neglect and frequent changes of caregiver continue to show the inhibited form for far longer when placed in families.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p" /&gt;

Additionally, the development of [[Theory of Mind]] ''may'' play a role in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as [[autism]], have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie the development of reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006) p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonagy ''et al.''

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Attachment measures}}
Recognised assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the [[Attachment measures|Strange Situation procedure]] ([[Mary Ainsworth]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1978),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Main &amp;amp; Solomon (1986), pp.95-124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Main &amp;amp; Solomon (1990), pp. 121-160.&lt;/ref&gt; the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment ("PAA"),&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment ("ORCE")&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]](1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Attachment measures|Attachment Q-sort]] ("AQ-sort").&lt;ref&gt;Waters and Deane (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent research also uses the [[Attachment measures|Disturbances of Attachment Interview]] or "DAI" developed by Smyke and Zeanah, (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Smyke and Zeanah (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely having a discriminated, preferred adult, seeking comfort when distressed, responding to comfort when offered, social and emotional reciprocity, emotional regulation, checking back after venturing away from the care giver, reticence with unfamiliar adults, willingness to go off with relative strangers, self endangering behavior, excessive clinging, vigilance/hypercompliance and role reversal.
===Classification===
{{main|Reactive attachment disorder}}

[[ICD-10]] describes [[Reactive attachment disorder|Reactive Attachment Disorder of Childhood]], known as RAD, and Disinhibited Disorder of Childhood, less well known as [[Disinhibited attachment disorder|DAD]]. [[DSM-IV-TR]] also describes Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood. It divides this into two subtypes, Inhibited Type and Disinhibited Type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:
*markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts,
*the disturbance is not accounted for solely by developmental delay and does not meet the criteria for [[Pervasive Developmental Disorder]],
*onset before 5 years of age,
*requires a history of significant neglect, and
*implicit lack of identifiable, preferred attachment figure.
ICD-10 includes in its diagnosis psychological and physical [[Child abuse|abuse]] and injury in addition to neglect. This is somewhat controversial, being a ''commission'' rather than ''omission'' and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.

The inhibited form is described as "a failure to initiate or respond...to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited responses" and such infants do not seek and accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain 'proximity', an essential element of attachment behavior. The disinhibited form shows "indiscriminate sociability...excessive familiarity with relative strangers" (DSM-IV-TR) and therefore a lack of 'specificity', the second basic element of attachment behavior. The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable. 'Disinhibited' and 'inhibited' are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can co-exist in the same child. The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver whilst the disinhibited form is more enduring.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser 2006, p. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

While RAD is likely to occur following neglectful and abusive childcare, there should be no automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p218-219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
{{main|Attachment-based therapy (children)}}
There are a variety of  mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment disorder, attachment problems and moods or behaviors considered to be potential problems within the context of [[attachment theory]]. All such approaches for infants and younger children concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, changing the caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AACAP (2005) p. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BakermansKranenburg ''et al.'' (2003) A meta-analysis of early interventions.&lt;/ref&gt; Such approaches include 'Watch, wait and wonder,'&lt;ref&gt;Cohen ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; manipulation of sensitive responsiveness,&lt;ref&gt;van den Boom (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van den Boom (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; modified 'Interaction Guidance,'.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit ''et al.'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Preschool Parent Psychotherapy,'.&lt;ref&gt;Toth ''et al.'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Circle of Security',&lt;ref&gt;Marvin et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC),&lt;ref name="Dozier et al. 2005"&gt;Dozier ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; the New Orleans Intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Larrieu &amp; Zeanah (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larrieu &amp; Zeannah (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeannah &amp; Smyke (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and Parent-Child psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Leiberman ''et al.'' (2000), p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; Other known treatment methods include Developmental, Individual-difference, Relationship-based therapy (DIR) (also referred to as ''Floor Time'') by [[Stanley Greenspan]], although DIR is primarily directed to treatment of [[pervasive developmental disorders]]&lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental &amp; Learning Disorders. (2007). [http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml Dir/floortime model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225132429/http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml |date=2008-02-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these approaches, such as that suggested by Dozier, consider the attachment status of the adult caregiver to play an important role in the development of the emotional connection between adult and child. This includes foster parents, as children with poor attachment experiences often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses from their attachment behaviors despite 'normative' care.&lt;ref name="Dozier et al. 2005" /&gt;

Treatment for reactive attachment disorder for children usually involves a mix of therapy, counseling, and parenting education. These must be designed to make sure the child has a safe environment to live in and to develop positive interactions with caregivers and improves their relationships with their peers.

Medication can be used as a way to treat similar conditions, like depression, anxiety, or hyperactivity; however, there is no quick fix for treating reactive attachment disorder. A pediatrician may recommend a treatment plan. For example, a mix of family therapy, individual psychological counseling, play therapy, special education services and parenting skills classes.&lt;ref name="Types of treatment for reactive attachment disorder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helpguide.org/mental/parenting_bonding_reactive_attachment_disorder.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145603/http://helpguide.org/mental/parenting_bonding_reactive_attachment_disorder.htm |archivedate=2011-11-26 |df= }} , 'HelpGuide.org', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudoscientific diagnoses and treatment==
{{main|Attachment therapy}}
In the absence of officially recognized [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians to refer to a broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al., (2006) p 81&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006) p 82&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[therapy]], including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream [[psychology]] or, despite its name, to be based on [[attachment theory]], with which it is considered incompatible.&lt;ref name="O'Connor (2003)"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Zeanah CH |title=Attachment disorders: assessment strategies and treatment approaches |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=223–44 |year=2003 |pmid=12944216 |doi=10.1080/14616730310001593974 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10.1080/14616730310001593974&amp;magic=pubmed }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ziv"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ziv Y |year=2005 |contribution=Attachment-Based Intervention programs: Implications for Attachment Theory and Research |title=Enhancing Early Attachments. Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |veditors=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT |series=Duke series in child development and public policy|publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=1-59385-470-6|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as potentially abusive and a [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.&lt;ref name="Berlin et al." /&gt;

A common feature of this form of diagnosis within [[attachment therapy]] is the use of extensive lists of "symptoms" which include many behaviours that are likely to be a consequence of neglect or abuse, but are not related to attachment, or not related to any clinical disorder at all. Such lists have been described as "wildly inclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p186-187&lt;/ref&gt; The APSAC Taskforce (2006) gives examples of such lists ranging across multiple domains from some elements within the DSM-IV criteria to entirely non-specific behavior such as developmental lags, destructive behaviors, refusal to make eye contact, cruelty to animals and siblings, lack of cause and effect thinking, preoccupation with fire, blood and gore, poor peer relationships, stealing, lying, lack of a conscience, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, poor impulse control, abnormal speech patterns, fighting for control over everything, and hoarding or gorging on food. Some checklists suggest that among infants, "prefers dad to mom" or "wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible" are indicative of attachment problems. The APSAC Taskforce expresses concern that high rates of [[false positive]] diagnoses are virtually certain and that posting these types of lists on web sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders."&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin (2006) p 82&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a considerable variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as [[attachment therapy]]. These therapies have little or no evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are [[holding therapy]], [[Rebirthing (attachment therapy)|rebirthing]], [[rage-reduction]] and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p 262&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical base is broadly a combination of [[Age regression in therapy|regression]] and [[catharsis]], accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] and parental control.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' 2006, p. 79–80. The APSAC Taskforce Report.&lt;/ref&gt; These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006) p 79&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated six children have died as a consequence of the more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Boris 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Sarner &amp; Rosa 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the most well-known cases are those of [[Candace Newmaker]] in 2001 and the [[Michael and Sharen Gravelle|Gravelles]] in 2003 through 2005. Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children. This change may have been hastened by the publication of a Task Force Report on the subject in January 2006, commissioned by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC) which was largely critical of attachment therapy, although these practices continue.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, ATTACh, an organisation originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting.&lt;ref name="attach07"&gt;{{Cite web|title=ATTACh White paper on coercion|year=2007|url=http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=ATTACh|accessdate=2008-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072425/http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippines]]' '''Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources''' ({{lang-fil|Kawanihan ng mga Pangisdaan at mga Yamang-Tubig}}, abbreviated as '''BFAR'''), is an agency of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]] under the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] responsible for the development, improvement, management and conservation of the [[Philippines]]' fisheries and aquatic resources.

==History==
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) started as a small agency in 1901 under the name Bureau of Government Laboratories, Department of Interior of the Philippine Commission. When the Civil Government was established on July 4, 1901, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] Commission proposed the creation of an Office under the Department of Interior to take charge of the conservation, promotion and development of the country's fishery resources. This was not carried out, due to limited funds. The Secretary of the Interior, [[Dean Conant Worcester]], continued to stir interest in the development of fisheries and, finally, in 1907, studies in fisheries began following the arrangement made by the Secretary of Interior for the services of the [[United States Fish Commission]] fisheries research vessel ''[[USS Albatross (1882)|USS Albatross]]'' to work in Philippine waters for 18 months, and the employment of an American fisheries specialist in the Bureau of [[Science]], to take charge of all work pertaining to fisheries.  Considerable advances in the taxonomy of fish in the Philippines and documentation of fishing methods were made by [[Albert William Herre]] who served as the chief fishery officer in the Bureau of Science from 1919 to 1928.

On January 1, 1933, by virtue of General Memorandum Order No. 4 dated December 5, 1932 of the Secretary of [[Agriculture]] and [[Commerce]], the Division of Fisheries and Division of [[Zoology]] of the Bureau of [[Science]] together with the Division of Forest [[Fauna]] and Grazing of the Bureau of [[Forestry]] were fused into one special division known as the Fish and Game Administration, which was placed under the direct administrative jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Under this arrangement, the Fish and Game Administration operated under the provisions of the Fisheries Act (Act No. 4003) and Act No. 2590, entitled "An Act for the Protection of Game and Fish." By subsequent reorganization effected on September 27, 1934, the Fish and Game Administration was returned to the Bureau of Science. The reason for its return was to strengthen the office through the use of equipment, personnel and appropriation of the Bureau.

On July 1, 1941, under the provisions of General Administrative Order No. 15, the Fish and Game Administration was reorganized as an independent unit under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce and renamed the Division of Fisheries. The functions pertaining to forest fauna and grazing was returned to the Bureau of Forestry and those of the Division of Zoology to the Bureau of Science.

The Divisions of Fisheries as a special division under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce functioned up to the outbreak of the war in 1941. During the early days of [[World War II]], the Division of Fisheries was fused with the Bureau of Forestry and then known as the Bureau of Forestry and Fishery. In the latter part of Japanese occupation, however, the Division of Fisheries was converted into an independent office known as the Bureau of Fisheries.

Taking cognizance of the increasing importance of effectively administering and conserving fisheries and other aquatic resources and in efforts to rehabilitate the devastated economy brought upon bu World War II, the [[Congress of the Philippines]] enacted [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 177 creating the present Bureau of Fisheries which took effect on July 1, 1947. The Division of Fisheries and all sections, field districts, experimental stations and all activities and agencies of the National Government connected with fishery work have been incorporated in the Bureau of Fisheries.

As organized on July 1, 1947, the Bureau of Fisheries had seven functional divisions, namely, (1) Administrative Division, (2) Division of Fish Culture and Fisheries Biology,(3) Division of Commercial Fisheries, (4) Division of Fisheries Technology, (5) Division of Licenses and Regulations, (6) Division of Investigation and Inspection, and (7) Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology offering a 2½ year course in fisheries on collegiate level. Subsequently, branches of this Institute offering a 4 years secondary course in fisheries were established in the following seven [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]: [[Samar]], [[Cebu]], [[Albay]], [[Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City]], [[Antique]] and [[Batangas]].

The entire [[Philippines]] was divided into 10 fishery districts with a District Fishery Officer as head of each District. The headquarters of the fishery districts were located in strategic places in the different fishing regions as follows; Fishery District No. 1-Aparri, [[Cagayan]]; 2-[[Dagupan City]], 3-[[Manila]]; 4-[[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]]; 5-[[Catbalogan, Samar|Catbalogan City, Samar]]; 6-[[Iloilo City]]; 7-[[Coron, Palawan]]; 8-[[Cebu City]]; 9-[[Davao City]] and 10-[[Zamboanga City]].

Under the reorganization Plan No. 30-A reorganizing the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources as implemented by Executive Order No. 216, dated November 17, 1956, the Bureau of Fisheries was reorganized again effective January 16, 1957 such that functional divisions of the Bureau had been reduced from seven to five, namely, (1) Licenses and Regulations Divisions; (2) Marine Fisheries Division; (3) Fisheries Research Division; (4) Inland Fisheries Division; and (5) Administrative Services Division.

[[File:Alaminosjf377.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Alaminos Regional Mariculture Technodemo Center (RMaTDeC) - April 20, 2011]]
The Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology had been transferred to the [[University of the Philippines]]. The seven secondary schools of fisheries in the provinces previously mentioned had been transferred to the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] under the administration of the Bureau of Public Schools. On March 20, 1963, R. A. 3512 reorganized the Bureau into the Philippine Fisheries Commission.  And on September 30, 1972, under the Integrated Reorganization Plan, the Philippine Fisheries Commission was reverted to the Bureau of Fisheries. By virtue of Presidential Decree No. 461 signed on May 17, 1974, which reorganized the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Natural Resources, the Philippine Fisheries Commission was renamed Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and placed under the Ministry of Natural Resources.

On June 30, 1984, BFAR was transferred from the Ministry of Natural Resources to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, in compliance with Executive Order 967 mandating the conversion of BFAR as a staff Bureau and integrating its Regional Offices with the Regional Offices of the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]]. The staff functions of the Central Office and the integration of BFAR's Regional Offices into Regional Offices of the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] was fully implemented with the issuance of Executive Order 116 signed by [[President of the Philippines|President]] on January 30, 1987.

On February 25, 1998 [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed into law [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 8550, entitled, "An Act Providing For the Development, Management and Conservation of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Integrating all laws pertinent thereto and for other purposes", otherwise known as the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998. This law took effect on March 23, 1998.

On January 5, 2008, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Philippines) (BFAR) announced that a [[fish kill]] at [[Taal Lake]] (January 2 to 4) caused the 50 metric tons or P 3.25-million ($80,000) loss of cultured [[tilapia]] in the [[villages]] of Leviste and Balakilong in [[Laurel, Batangas|Laurel]] and in Barangay Aya and Barangay Quiling in [[Talisay, Batangas|Talisay]]. 6,000 maliputo fishes (P 230,000) also died at Quiling. [[Toxic]] [[sulfur]] and high level of [[hydrogen sulfide]] in Ambulong while low dissolved [[oxygen]] caused the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=110554 Inquirer.net, Taal Lake fish kill causes P3-M losses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117031940/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=110554 |date=2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current organization==
After undergoing series of reorganizations, the BFAR today has nine (9) functional divisions: the Fisheries Policy Research and Economics Division, Fishery Resources Administration Division, Fisheries Development and Support Services Division, Aquaculture Division, Fisheries Resources Research Division, EEZ Fisheries and Allied Services Division, Fishing Technology Division, Fisheries Regulation and Quarantine Division, and Post Harvest Technology Division. It also has eight (8) fisheries technology center under its wing: The National Marine Fisheries Development Center, National Brackishwater Aquaculture Technology Research Center, National Freshwater Fisheries Technology Research Center, Tanay Freshwater Experimental Station, Fisheries Biological Station Complex, National Fisheries Research and Development Center, National Seaweeds Technology and Development Center and the Mindanao Freshwater Fisheries Technology Center.

The '''Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology''' ('''IGB''') is an interdisciplinary facility for [[genomics]] research at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. The construction of the IGB, which was completed in 2006, represented a strategy to centralize biotechnology research at the University of Illinois.  A goal of the IGB is to provide a collaborative environment in which researchers with diverse backgrounds are drawn together by their pursuit of scientific questions related to genomics.  The interdisciplinary nature of the institute promotes the creation of innovative solutions to societal challenges related to health, the environment, and food production. Current research at the IGB explores the genomic bases of a wide range of phenomena, including the progression of cancer, the ecological impact of global change, tissue and organ growth, and the diversity of animal behavior.&lt;ref name=igbweb&gt;{{cite web|title=The Institute for Genomic Biology: Where science meets society.|url=http://www.igb.illinois.edu|accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Construction===
Plans for what would become the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) were formed in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;  Initially, the facility was to be named the Post-Genomic Institute; the name was changed to Institute for Genomic Biology in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tallon|first=Mary|title=U. Illinois trustees approve health benefits for same-sex partners.|newspaper=Daily Illini|date=2003-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Funds of $67.5 million were initially appropriated by the state of Illinois for construction in 2000.&lt;ref name=aps1stfunding&gt;{{cite news|title=Governor expected to unveil $1 billion technology initiative.|newspaper=Associated Press Services|date=2000-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response to economic hardships, the state halted plans for construction in 2001 as part of a large set of budget cuts,&lt;ref name=stlouis&gt;{{cite news|last=McDermott|first=Kevin|title=Ryan pares $219 million from Illinois budget.|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=2001-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but in 2002, funds were re-appropriated.&lt;ref name=midconst&gt;{{cite news|title=State gives U. of I. $123 million for tech buildings.|newspaper=Midwest Construction|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Construction began in April 2004 and was completed in November 2006.  The building was dedicated in March 2007.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;  The Institute, initially named the Institute for Genomic Biology, officially changed its name to the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology in 2015 to honor the scientific contributions of [[Carl Woese]].

===Leadership===
The IGB was initially led by [[Harris Lewin]], then a professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois.  Lewin served as the founding director until 2011, when he accepted the position of Research Vice Chancellor at [[University of California, Davis]].  [[Gene E. Robinson]], a professor in the Entomology department, took over as Interim Director, and was named the new Director of IGB in January 2012.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

==Research==

===Personnel===
The IGB houses over 130 faculty and 600+ graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and research personnel.  IGB faculty are drawn from a broad range of departments, including Crop Sciences, Psychology, Entomology, Physics and Computer Science.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

===Aims===
The research goals of the IGB fall under one of three Program Areas ([[Systems Biology]], [[Biological engineering|Cellular]] and [[Metabolic engineering|Metabolic Engineering]], and Genome Technology).  Work at the IGB addresses societal challenges related to health, the environment, and food production, both through basic science research and through exploration of ethical and legal issues.  Research is further organized into Themes, each of which occupies a customized lab and office space.  Each Theme contains multiple research groups.  These groups often pursue some research questions independently, but are unified by a common interest in the broader area of the Theme.  The multi-group space encourages communication and collaboration between researchers with diverse backgrounds and technical skills.  One senior faculty member acts as Theme leader, and is responsible for shaping and guiding the overall research initiative.  Themes are reviewed every five years; new Themes may be added or existing Themes modified to reflect the current state of genomics research.  Current Themes are listed below:&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;

==Notable awards and partnerships==

In 2007, the University of Illinois, along with the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], became partners with the energy company [[BP]] as part of a major research project to develop bioenergy sources.  The University of Illinois facility is based in the IGB.&lt;ref name=bpnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Mercer|first=David|title=Two U.S. universities chosen by BP for partnership in alternative-fuels research.|newspaper=Associated Press Worldstream|date=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Abbott Nutrition and the University of Illinois formed collaboration to establish a research center for the study of the relationship between [[nutrition and cognition]], the [http://cnlm.illinois.edu/ Center for Nutrition, Learning, and Memory] (CNLM).  Several campus units are currently partners of CNLM, including the IGB.&lt;ref name=cnlm&gt;{{cite news|last=des Garennes|first=Christine|title=University of Illinois, Abbott developing nutrition, cognition research center.|newspaper=The News-Gazette|date=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

The IGB is located on the south side of the University of Illinois main campus at Urbana-Champaign.  The building was constructed by the architecture firm CUH2A (now a part of the architecture-engineering company HDR).  The exterior of the building was designed to include elements of [[Georgian architecture]], consistent with many other campus buildings, but with a modern feel.&lt;ref name=cu2ha&gt;{{cite news|title=Award winning Institute for Genomic Biology designed by CUH2A opens at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.|newspaper=Business Wire|date=2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Inside, each Research Theme has a large, [[open plan]] laboratory space and additional work rooms and office and meeting area.&lt;ref name="igbweb" /&gt;  The building stands adjacent to the Morrow Plots.

'''Cazaux Air Base''' ({{lang-fr|Base aérienne 120 Cazaux}}) {{airport codes||LFBC}} is a [[French Air Force]] ({{lang-fr|'''Armée de l'Air'''}}) base.  The base is located in the village of Cazaux, part of the town of [[La Teste-de-Buch]], and is approximately {{convert|35|mi|km}} southwest of [[Bordeaux]].

==Overview==
The air base was created at the behest of Commandant Marzac. The site did not take the name of BA 120 until 1962, becoming the largest air base in France one hundred years after it was founded. The base is used mainly for training and integration of French fighter pilots and gunnery training over the [[Bay of Biscay]].

The Franco-Belgian [[Alphajet]] aerial fighter school is based at Cazaux. It is responsible for training future fighter pilots of the two nations.

Since 1998, the base has hosted the No. 150 Squadron of the Republic of Singapore Air Force, equipped with [[ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk]]s, and since 15 November 2012, with [[Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master|Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master]]s to train pilots before assigning Singaporeans to operational [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C/D Fighting Falcon]]s and [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15SG Strike Eagle]] units. {{As of|March 2010}}, 120 pilots had been trained at the base.

Approximately 2,600 military and civilian personnel work on the base.

==Units assigned==
* The operational transition Squadron 1/8 "Saintonge" on [[Alphajet]]. Based in Cazaux since 1964.
* The operational transition Squadron AJeTS 2/8 "Nice" on Alphajet. Based in Cazaux since 1964.
* The Helicopter Squadron 1/67 "Pyrenees" on Puma and [[EC725]] Caracal . Based in Cazaux since 1972.
* The Centre of Expertise in Embedded Arm (00 331 SEAC) which since 1 September 2009 replaces Experimentation Center and Shooting Instruction in Air (Ceita), which forms each year 200-250 French and foreign trainees
* Group Instruction Flight Safety (GISV) of the National Gendarmerie from 1 September 2010.
* A DGA test site in Flight (Formerly CEV Cazaux).
* Technicians Training Center Safety of Air Force (CFTSAA) 00/308
* No. 150 Squadron of the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]].

==History==

The airfield was created in 1914 in order to train French and Allied military pilots (fighters and bombers) and still exists as Base Aérienne 120 "Commandant Marzac".

Most of the American volunteer pilots of the [[Lafayette Escadrille]] came to the Cazaux camp to achieve their training as war pilots.

When the U.S. entered the war, the AEF (American Expeditionary Force) had several units based here, including the [[36th Aero Squadron]], two Balloon companies (36th and 45th) and Artillery observers.

A former French then Russian camp located {{convert|5|km|mi}} from the airfield was "Camp Hunt", where infantry and artillery troops were trained before joining the Front.

Near this "Camp Hunt" a cemetery was established for American casualties; some of the pilots killed when serving at Cazaux were buried in this cemetery.

===American presence===
American Air Service pilots training was reinforced by the finishing course in aerial gunnery which permitted the American Air Service to give, under French supervision and direction, at French aerial gunnery school situated at Cazaux. This work, which commenced on December 1917, in a large measure neutralized the delay in getting an American aerial gunnery school into operation, and overcame the early difficulties caused by American lack of machine guns and ammunitions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101013-007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This meant that after graduation pilots were given a full course in shooting from the air, either at Cazaux or the American school at St.
Jean-de-Monts.

===Luftwaffe use===
After the French defeat Cazaux was used by Luftwaffe units from the summer of 1940 onwards. Several Training and Fighter units used the place, including the 1st group of the night fighter squadron NJG.2 or the 2nd and 3rd Fighter squadrons in Fighter Group JG26. Of the Destroyer Squad 1. Between spring 1943 and summer 1944, it was a target of allied air raids.

===French Air Force===
After German withdrawal French Air Force repaired the base, naming it Airfield R.51, and Cazaux was the home of the French bomber group GB 1/31 "Aunis" equipped with Ju-88 in the spring of 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaviationmagazine.com/airshowsreview/2014_Meeting_Aerien%20_Cazaux_Air_Show.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962/1963 the Bomber group 2/91 "Guyenne", previously been deployed in the Algerian war, was stationed briefly. This Group was replaced in 1964 by No 293, Escadron de Chasse 2/8 “Nice" equipped with Mystère IV, which merged with the local shooting center and henceforth operated two flying groups. From 1982 on, units based in Cazaux were equipped with Alpha Jets as the Ecole de Transition Opérationnelle (E.T.O.) since 1995. Currently theere are two training squadrons in Cazaux, 1/8 and 2/8. In June 2004 Belgian 11 Squadron, equipped with Alpha jets, was relocated to Cazaux, forming the French-Belgian Alpha Jet School (AJetS).

Also based at Cazaux is 1/67th Pyrenees Squadron, a combat search and rescue helicopter unit equipped with [[EC-725]] Caracal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acc.af.mil/News/Features/Display/tabid/5765/Article/204115/exchanging-more-than-just-a-pilot.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ottosenphotography.com/blog/2016/9/pyrenees&lt;/ref&gt; This is a joint unit, so its pilots come from different armed services, but is assigned namely to the French Air Force.

===Singapore Air Force presence===
Cazaux Air Base is home to 150 Squadron RSAF and its personnel. The RSAF has conducted flying training in France since 1998, and both Air Forces also interact regularly through various professional exchanges and courses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/press_room/official_releases/nr/2015/may/21may15_nr.html#.WDse_OnrvIU&lt;/ref&gt; 150 Squadron currently operates M-346 aircraft that replaced A-4SU in fighter pilots training. The Landes forest, the target centre of Captieux and the aerial zones of Golfe de Gascogne offer all the necessary space for RSAF pilots training requirements which RSAF cannot find in Singapore.

The '''chronology of the Bible''' is an elaborate system of lifespans, "generations," and other means by which the passage of events is measured, beginning with [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] and extending through other significant events. A widespread scholarly understanding is that the Bible marks out a world cycle ([[Great Year]]) of 4,000 years, beginning with Creation and ending, presumably, around 164 [[Common Era|BCE]], with the year [[Anno Mundi|AM]] 2666 for [[the Exodus]] representing 26 2/3 of 100 years or two-thirds of the total.&lt;ref name="Johnson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall D.

The count begins with creation and Year 1. The passage of time from the Creation to [[the Exodus]] is measured by adding the ages of the [[Patriarch]]s at the birth of their firstborn sons, later through express statements, and later still by the synchronised reigns of the [[kings of Israel and Judah]].{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=96–97}} The Exodus takes place in the year [[Anno Mundi|''anno mundi'']] 2666, or AM 2666, exactly two thirds of the way through the four thousand years, the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is commenced 480 years, or 12 generations of 40 years each, after that, and 430 years pass between the building of the Temple and its destruction.{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=96–97}} The 50 years between the destruction of the Temple and the "[[Cyrus's edict|Decree of Cyrus]]" and end of the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]], added to the 430 years for which the Temple stood, produces another symmetrical period of 480 years,{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}} and the 374 years between the re-dedication of the Temple by the [[Maccabees]] and the Edict of Cyrus completes the 4,000 years.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}}

As recently as the 18th century, scholars of the stature of [[Isaac Newton]] believed that the date of Creation was knowable from the Bible.{{sfn|Barr|1987|p=3}} Today, the Genesis account of Creation has long since vanished from serious [[cosmology]], the Patriarchs and Exodus are no longer included in most serious histories of ancient Israel,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=81, 168}} and it is almost universally accepted that [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] have little historical value.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Mazar|2007|pp=62, 74}} Even the monarchy is questioned, and although scholars continue to advance proposals for reconciling the chronology of the [[Books of Kings]], there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=81, 168}}{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}

== Pre-Masoretic chronologies ==
During the centuries that [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Biblical texts and canons developed]], theological chronologies emerged at different composition stages, though scholars have advanced various theories to identify these stages and their schematizations of time. These chronologies include:
* A "Progenitor" chronology that placed [[Abraham]]'s birth at AM 1600 and the foundation of the Temple at AM 2800. Alfred Jepsen proposed this chronology on the basis of melding time periods in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan]] and [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic recensions]].{{sfn|Northcote|2004|pp=3ff.}}
* Distinct chronologies can be inferred from the [[Priestly source]] (of the Pentateuch), along with priestly authors of later Biblical books,&lt;ref&gt;On the "Priestly chronology", see especially Hughes, e.g., 233f.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deuteronomistic history]], which purports to chronicle the reigns of the kings of Judah and Israel (with some significant historical corroboration, see below and [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]). 
* The Nehemiah chronology, devised to show 3,500 years from creation to [[Nehemiah|Nehemiah's]] mission. Northcote says that this chronology was "probably composed by [[Levites]] in Jerusalem not long after Nehemiah's mission, perhaps sometime late in the fifth century BCE (i.e. nearing 400 BCE)."{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=8}} Bousset (1900) apparently sees this schematization, too, but calls it Proto-[[Masoretic Text|MT]].{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=8}}
* A proto-Masoretic chronology, shaped by [[Jubilee (biblical)|jubilees]], with an overall literary showing of 3,480 years from creation to the completion of the [[Second Temple]], per B.W. Bousset (1900), and which had the [[first Temple]] at 3,000 years.
* The Saros chronology that reflected 3,600 years leading up to the first Temple and 4,080 years from creation to the completion of the Second Temple. This scheme served as "the basis for the later [[Septuagint|LXX]] chronology and pre-SP [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] chronologies".{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=12}}

== Masoretic Text ==

{{hatnote|The following table is derived from Thomas L. Thompson, ''The Mythic Past'';{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=75}} notes within the table as cited.}}

It should be noted that some data in this table are questionable. For example, Genesis 11:10 states that Shem was 100 years old when he gave birth to his son two years after the flood. The statement (Gn 5:32) that Noah was 500 years old when his sons were born, means that they were born starting then. Some commentators state that Shem was the youngest of the three, which could mean that he was born two years later in order to make his age 100 two years after the flood. If one starts from two years after the flood (no matter what the age of Shem was) and adds the ages of his descendants, Abraham was born in 1948 AM. Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old in 2048. According to some commentators the Exodus is dated as 400 years after the birth of Isaac (from Genesis 15:13), making it 2448. According to others the 430 year time mentioned in Exodus 12:40 is dated from the descent of Jacob to Aegypt, making it 2668.

The temple was built 480 years after the Exodus, in the fourth year of King Solomon's rein, according to I Kings 6:1. This places the start of King Solomon's reign as 2924 and the building of the temple as 2928.

The Masoretic Text is the basis of modern Jewish and Christian bibles. While difficulties with Biblical texts make it impossible to reach sure conclusions, perhaps the most widely held hypothesis is that it embodies an overall scheme of 4,000 years (a "great year") taking the re-dedication of the Temple by the Maccabees in 164 BCE as its end-point.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}} Two motives may have led to this: first, there was a common idea at the time of the Maccabees that human history followed the plan of a divine "week" of seven "days" each lasting a thousand years;{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=246}} and second, a 4,000 year history—even longer in the Septuagint version—would establish the antiquity of the Jews against their pagan neighbours.{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=98–99}}

== Other Second Temple chronologies: Septuagint, Samaritan, Jubilees==
[[File:Tissot Solomon Dedicates the Temple at Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Solomon Dedicates the Temple ([[James Tissot]])]]

The canonical text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] is called the [[Masoretic Text]], a text preserved by Jewish rabbis from early the 7th and 10th centuries CE. There are, however, two other major texts, the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. The Septuagint is a [[Koine Greek]] translation of the original [[biblical Hebrew]] holy books. It is estimated that the first five books of the Septuagint, known as the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch, were translated in the mid-3rd century [[BCE]] and the remaining texts were translated in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=April 7, 2018|date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It mostly agrees with the Masoretic Text, but not in its chronology. The Samaritan text is the text preserved by the [[Samaritan]] community. This community dates from some time in the last few centuries BCE—just when is disputed—and, like the Septuagint, differs markedly from the Masoretic Text in its chronology. Modern scholars do not regard the Masoretic Text as superior to the other two—the Masoretic is sometimes clearly wrong, as when it says that Saul began to reign at two years of age and reigned for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a13.htm 1 Samuel 13:1]&lt;/ref&gt; More relevantly, all three texts have a clear purpose, which is not to record history so much as to bring the narrative to a point which represents the culmination of history.

In the Samaritan Pentateuch, 'the genealogies and narratives were shaped to ensure a chronology of 3000 years from creation to the Israelite settlement of Canaan. Northcote reports this as the "Proto-SP chronology," as designated by John Skinner (1910), and he speculates that this chronology may have been extended to put the rebuilding of the Second Temple at an even AM 3900, after three 1,300-year phases. In the Septuagint version of the Pentateuch the Israelite chronology extends 4,777 years from creation to the finishing of the Second Temple, as witnessed in the [[Codex Alexandrinus]] manuscript. This calculation only emerges by supplementing Septuagint with the MT's chronology of kings. There were at least 3 variations of Septuagint chronology; [[Eusebius]] used one variation, now favored by Hughes and others. Northcote asserts that the Septuagint calendrical pattern was meant to demonstrate that there were 5,000 years from creation to a contemporaneous [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], circa 300 BCE.{{sfn|Northcote|2004|pp=14ff}}

The 2nd century BCE [[Book of Jubilees]] begins with the Creation and measures time in years, "weeks" of years (groups of seven years), and jubilees (sevens of sevens), so that the interval from Creation to the settlement of Canaan, for example, is exactly fifty jubilees (2450 years).{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p=245}}

==Seder Olam==

More significant, and still in common use among Jews, was the [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] ("Great Order of the World"), a work tracing the history of the world and the Jews from Creation to the 2nd century CE.{{sfn|Milikowski|2011|p = 656}}{{sfn|Solomon|2006|p = 61}} It allows 410 years for the duration of the First Temple, 70 years from its destruction to the Second Temple, and 420 years for the duration of the Second Temple, making a total of 900 years for the two temples.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p = 253}} This schematic approach to numbers accounts for its most remarkable feature, the fact that it shortens the entire Persian Empire from over two centuries to just 52 years, mirroring the 52 years it gives to the [[Babylonian exile]].{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p = 257}}

==Christian use and development of biblical chronology==

The early Church Father [[Eusebius]] (c. 260–340), attempting to place Christ in the chronology, put his birth in AM 5199, and this became the accepted date for the Western Church.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=259–260}} As the year AM 6000 (800 CE) approached there was increasing fear that the end of the world was nigh, until the [[Venerable Bede]] made his own calculations and found that Christ's birth took place in AM 3592, allowing several more centuries to the end of time.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=259–260}}

[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) switched the point of focus from Christ's birth to the Apostolic Council of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 15, which he placed in the year AM 4000, believing this marked the moment when the Mosaic Law was abolished and the new age of grace began.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=260–261}} This was widely accepted among European Protestants, but in the English-speaking world, Archbishop [[James Ussher]] (1581–1656) calculated a date of 4004 BCE for creation; he was not the first to reach this result, but his chronology was so detailed that his dates were incorporated into the margins of English Bibles for the next two hundred years.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=261–262}} This popular 4,000 year theological timespan, which ends with the birth of Jesus, differs from the 4,000 timespan later proposed for the Masoretic text alone, which ends with the Temple rededication in 164 BCE.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}}

==The Israelite kings==
{{For|detailed reconstructions of the chronology of the Hebrew kings|Kings of Judah}}

The chronology of the monarchy, unlike that of earlier periods, can be checked against non-Biblical sources and seems to be correct in general terms.{{sfn|Lemche|2010|pp=95–96}} This raises the prospect that the [[Books of Kings]], linking the Hebrew kings by accession and length of reign ("king X of Judah came to the throne in the ''n''th year of king Y of Israel and ruled ''n'' years"), can be used to reconstruct a chronology for the monarchy, but the task has in fact proven intractably difficult.{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=2}} The problem is that the books contain numerous contradictions: to take just one example, since Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel began to rule at the same time (1 Kings 12), and since Ahaziah of Judah and Joram of Israel were killed at the same time (1 Kings 9:24, 27), the same amount of time should have elapsed in both kingdoms, but the count shows 95 years passing in Judah and 98 in Israel.{{sfn|Galil|1996|p=12}} In short, "[t]he data concerning the synchronisms appeared in hopeless contradiction with the data as to the lengths of reigns."{{sfn|Thiele|1983|p=15}}

Possibly the most widely followed attempt to reconcile the contradictions has been that proposed by [[Edwin R. Thiele]] in his ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (three editions between 1951 and 1983), but his work has been widely criticised for, among other things, introducing "innumerable" co-regencies, constructing a "complex system of calendars", and using "unique" patterns of calculation; as a result his following is largely among scholars "committed ... to a doctrine of scripture's absolute harmony" (the criticism is to be found in [[Brevard Childs]]' ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'').{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=4 and fn.6}} The weaknesses in Thiele's work have led subsequent scholars to continue to propose chronologies, but, in the words of a recent commentary on Kings, there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}

[[Image:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|Building a CEB project in Midland, Texas in August 2006]]
A '''compressed earth block''' ('''CEB'''), also known as a ''pressed earth block'' or a ''compressed soil block'', is a [[building material]] made primarily from damp [[soil]] compressed at high pressure to form blocks. Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press to form blocks out of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic [[subsoil]], non-expansive [[clay]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as [[Portland cement]] they are called ''compressed stabilized earth block'' (CSEB) or ''stabilized earth block'' (SEB). Typically, around {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.

Creating CEBs differs from [[rammed earth]] in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from [[mud brick]]s in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB can meet or exceed that of typical cement or mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB.

CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard [[bricklaying]] and [[masonry]] techniques. The [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may be a simple [[slurry]] made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues. [[Hydraform block]]s are shaped to be interlocking.

==Development==
CEB technology has been developed  for low-cost construction, as an alternative to adobe, and with some advantages.  A commercial industry has been advanced by eco-friendly contractors, manufacturers of the mechanical presses, and by cultural acceptance of the method.  In the [[United States]], most general contractors building with CEB are in the Southwestern states: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], and to a lesser extent in [[Texas]].  The methods and presses have been used for many years in [[Mexico]], and in [[developing countries]].

The [[South Africa]]n Department of Water Affairs and Forestry considers that CEB, locally called "'''Dutch brick'''" is an appropriate technology for a developing country, as are adobe, rammed earth and cob. All use natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=6|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Masibambane/documents/civil/CrossCuttingFeb08.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Critical Sustainability Pillars for service delivery in the Water Sector|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the International Institute for Energy Conservation was one of the winners of a [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]] for a project to make an energy-efficient Dutch brick-making machine for home construction in South Africa. By making cheaper bricks that use earth, the project would reduce housing costs while stimulating the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/29725/south-africa-poverty-reduction-winners|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Poverty reduction winners|publisher=IRIN|date=11 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would be mobile, allowing bricks to be made locally from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbdm/idea/housing-and-jobs-better-future|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Housing and Jobs for a Better Future|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of CEB production machines exist, from manual to semi-automated and fully automated,  with increasing capital-investment and production rates, and decreased labor.  Automated machines are more common in the developed world, and manual machines in the developing world.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages of the CEB system.   On-site materials can be used, which reduces cost, minimizes shipping costs for materials, and increases efficiency and sustainability.  The wait-time required to obtain materials is minimal, because after the blocks are pressed, materials are available very soon after a short drying period.  The uniformity of the blocks simplifies construction, and minimizes or eliminates the need for mortar, thus reducing both the labor and materials costs.  The blocks are strong, stable, water-resistant and long-lasting.
* CEB can be pressed from damp earth. Because it is not wet, the drying time is much shorter. Some soil conditions permit the blocks to go straight from the press onto the wall. A single mechanical press can produce from 800 to over 5,000 blocks per day, enough to build a {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} house in one day.   A high performance CEB press, of [[open source]] design, named "The Liberator", can produce from 8,000 to 17,000 or more blocks per day.  The production rate is limited more by the ability to get material into the machine, than the machine itself.
* Shipping cost: Suitable soils are often available at or near the construction site. [[Adobe]] and CEB are of similar weight, but distance from a source supply gives CEB an advantage.  Also, CEB can be made available in places where adobe manufacturing operations are non-existent.
* Uniformity: CEB can be manufactured to a predictable size and has true flat sides and 90-degree angle edges.  This makes design and costing easier.  This also provides the contractor the option of making the exteriors look like conventional [[stucco]] houses. 
* Presses allow blocks to be consistently made of uniform size, while also obtaining strengths that exceed the ASTM standard for concrete blocks (1900 psi).
* Non-toxic:  materials are completely natural, non-toxic, and do not out-gas
* Sound resistant:  an important feature in high-density neighborhoods, residential areas adjacent to industrial zones
* Fire resistant:  earthen walls do not burn
* Insect resistant: Insects are discouraged because the walls are solid and very dense, and have no food value
* [[Mold]] resistant:  there is no cellulose material - such as in wood, [[Oriented Strand Board]] or [[drywall]] - that can host [[mold]] or rot
* In India, CSEB's with cement stabilization have shown to be very beneficial. The observed compressive strength, flexural strength at 28 days of aging with 9% cement stabilization has been observed to be 3.2 MPa and 1 MPa respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267637559|accessdate=2014-11-11|title=Effect Of Varying Cement Proportions On Properties Of Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) - A Sustainable Low-Cost Housing Material|publisher=DOI: 10.13140/2.1.4966.4963 Conference: International Conference on Sustainable Civil Infrastructure, ASCE India Section 17–18 October 2014, At Hyderabad, India, Volume: pg 1000-1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presses==
CEB had very limited use prior to the 1980s. It was known in the 1950s in [[South America]], where one of the most well-known presses, the [[Cinva Ram]], was developed by Raul Ramirez in the Inter-American Housing Center (CINVA) in Bogota, Colombia.  The Cinva Ram is a single-block, manual-press that uses a long, hand-operated lever to drive a [[cam]], generating high pressure.

Industrial manufacturers produce much larger machines that run with diesel or gasoline engines and hydraulic presses that receive the soil/aggregate mixture through a hopper. This is fed into a chamber to create a block that is then ejected onto a conveyor.

During the 1980s, soil-pressing technology became widespread. [[France]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]] began to write standards. The [[Peace Corps]], [[USAID]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other programs began to implement it into housing projects.

==Finishing==
Completed walls require either a reinforced bond beam or a ring beam on top or between floors and if the blocks are not stabilized, a plaster finish, usually stucco wire/stucco cement and/or lime plaster. Stabilized blocks can be left exposed with no outer plaster finish. In tropical environments, polycarbonate varnish is often used to provide an additional layer of wet-weather protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Foundations==
Standards for foundations are similar to those for brick walls. A CEB wall is heavy. Footings must be at least 10&amp;nbsp;inches thick, with a minimum width that is 33 percent greater than the wall width. If a stem wall is used, it shall extend to an elevation not less than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  above the exterior finish grade. Rubble-filled foundation trench designs with a reinforced concrete grade beam above are allowed to support CEB construction.

==Strength==
Using the [[ASTM]] D1633-00 stabilization standard, a pressed and cured block must be submerged in water for four hours. It is then pulled from the water and immediately subjected to a compression test. The blocks must score at least a 300 [[pound-force per square inch]] (p.s.i) (2 MPa) minimum.  This is a higher standard than for adobe, which must score an ''average'' of at least 300 p.s.i. (2 MPa)

The '''date of birth of [[Jesus]] ''' is not stated in the [[gospels]] or in any secular text but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett. (2000). [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html "Calendars"] (Ch. 12), in P. Kenneth Seidelmann (Ed.) ''Explanatory supplement to the astronomical almanac.'' Sausalito, CA: University Science Books. {{ISBN|0-935702-68-7}}. p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches—one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[Gospel of Luke|Gospels of Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M.

==Estimation via the Nativity accounts==
The [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[New Testament]] gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus, and [[Karl Rahner]] states that the gospels do not, in general, provide enough details of dates to satisfy the demands of modern historians.&lt;ref name=Rahner732 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} p. 731&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholars do not see the Luke and Matthew nativity stories as historically factual,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Borg]], "The Meaning of the Birth Stories" in Marcus Borg, N T Wright, ''The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions'' (Harper One, 1999) page 179: "I (and most mainline scholars) do not see these stories as historically factual."&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason, they do not consider them a reliable method for determining Jesus' date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus''. Penguin, 1993, pages 85–88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states that the authors of the gospels generally focused on theological elements rather than historical chronologies.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Luke and Matthew associate Jesus' birth with the time of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name="Rahner731"/&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] states that "Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king". He also implies that Jesus could have been as much as two years old at the time of the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], because Herod ordered the murder of all boys up to the age of two years, "in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi". [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:16|Matthew 2:16]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Edwin D | last = Freed | title = Stories of Jesus' Birth | publisher = Continuum International | year = 2004 | page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that Herod died in 4 BC, although a case has also been made that Herod died only in 1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Timothy David|title=The Date of Herod's Death|journal=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|issue=19|year=1968|pp=204–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernegger|first=P.

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of Jesus,&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 /&gt; but places the birth during the [[Census of Quirinius]], which only took place ten years later in AD 6 as described by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 /&gt; He, in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (c. AD 93), indicates that Cyrenius/Quirinius' governorship of Syria began in AD 6, and Josephus mentions a census sometime between AD 6–7.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E5dCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=josephus+antiquities+of+the+jews&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 18, Chapters 1–2]. Josephus indicates that the census under Cyrenius (i.e., Quirinius) occurred in the 37th year after Octavian's (i.e., Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus') victory over Marc Antony at Actium, which secular historical records date to 2 September 31 BC. Therefore 31 BC + 37 years = AD 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars believe Luke made an error in referring to the census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Archer | first=Gleason Leonard | authorlink=Gleason Leonard Archer | title=Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties |date=April 1982  | publisher=Zondervan Pub.

As far as the month of Jesus' birth, it can be inferred to be summer or fall. Combining inferences from when shepherds would likely be in the fields and working backward from Zechariah's priestly service (John the Baptist's father) and its connections to Jesus' birth, one arrives at a likely date of mid-September to early October. This would suggest the conception of Jesus might have been in December, but not his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/when-was-jesus-born|title=When was Jesus born? {{!}} Bibleinfo.com|website=www.bibleinfo.com|language=en|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://christinprophecy.org/articles/when-was-jesus-born/|title=When Was Jesus Born?|work=Lamb and Lion Ministries|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working backwards from when Jesus began preaching==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Pharisees Question Jesus (Les pharisiens questionnent Jésus) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|Dispute of Jesus and the Pharisees, by [[James Tissot]], c. 1890]]
Another approach to estimating the year of birth works backwards from when Jesus began preaching, based on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that he was "about 30 years of age" at that time.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]], L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus began to preach after being baptised by [[John the Baptist]], and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]]), which scholars estimate would be in about AD 28–29.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pages 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoehner 1978 29–37"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ | last = Hoehner| first = Harold W | authorlink = Harold Hoehner|year= 1978|publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0-310-26211-9|pages= 29–37| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6z-NcR7fVSIC&amp;dq=CHronological+Aspects+of+the+Life+of+Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By working backwards from this, it would appear that Jesus was probably born no later than 1 BC. However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 27–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christmas celebration==
Despite the celebration of Christmas in December, neither Luke nor Matthew mentions a season for when Jesus was born. However, scholarly arguments regarding the realism of shepherds grazing their flock during the winter have taken place, both challenging a winter birth for Jesus as well as defending it by relying on the mildness of winters in ancient Israel and [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] rules regarding sheep near Bethlehem before February.&lt;ref&gt;"New Testament History" by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: an introduction and commentary'' by Leon Morris 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-0419-5}} p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of Jesus' Birth'' by Edwin D. Freed 2004 {{ISBN|0-567-08046-3}} pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Murray of ''History Today'' says that the celebration of [[Christmas]] as the birth day of Jesus is based on a date of a pagan feast rather than historical analysis.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas "Medieval Christmas"], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saturnalia]], the Roman feast for Saturn, was associated with the [[winter solstice]]. Saturnalia was held on 17 December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through to 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms. It is likely that such a Christian feast was chosen for Christ's marked contrast and triumph over paganism; indeed, new converts who attempted to introduce pagan elements into the Christian celebrations were sharply rebuked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7399|title=Library : History &amp; Origin: Feast of the Nativity|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 25 may have been selected due to its proximity to the winter solstice, because of its theological significance. After the solstice, the days begin to lengthen with more sunlight, which Christians see as representing the [[Light of Christ]] entering the world. This mirrors the celebration of the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on June 24, near the [[summer solstice]]; John said of Jesus "He must increase, I must decrease." {{bibleref2|John 3:30|NRSV}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-do-we-celebrate-jesus-birth-on-december-25|title=Why do we celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25? - Catholic Answers|website=www.catholic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday) was the earliest Christian celebration and included a number of theological themes. In the 2nd century, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] became a separate feast as [[Easter]] and in the same century [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] began to be celebrated in the Churches of the East on 6 January.&lt;ref&gt;''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-5856-3}} page 237&lt;/ref&gt; The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the [[Western Church]] notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present'' by Lukas Vischer 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-0520-5}} pages 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest source stating 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is likely by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox]] which he placed on 25 March, and then added nine months – festivals on that date were then celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer Dictionary'' of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 142&lt;/ref&gt; 25 March would also roughly be the date of his crucifixion, which ancient Christians would have seen as confirming the date of his birth, since there was a notion that the great prophets were conceived into the afterlife on the same date they were conceived into the world.  [[John Chrysostom]] also argued for a 25 December date in the late 4th century, basing his argument on the assumption that the offering of incense in Luke 1:8–11 was the offering of incense by a high priest on [[Yom Kippur]] (early October), and, as above, counting fifteen months forward. However, this was very likely a retrospective justification of a choice already made rather than a genuine attempt to derive the correct birth date.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Beckwith (2001). Calendar and chronology, Jewish and Christian: biblical, intertestamental and patristic studies, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, 25 December might be a reference to the date of the Feast of the Dedication, which occurs on the 25 Kislev of the Jewish calendar.  This would require that early Christians simply translated Kislev directly to December.

==In Islam==
In Islam, the Quran references a fruit branch which Mary shook as she gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=3YhpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Quran+Jesus+19&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ4_H4_4_YAhWMNY8KHd1OAG8Q6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20Jesus%2019&amp;f=false|title=Women in the Qur'an, Traditions, and Interpretation|last=Stowasser|first=Barbara Freyer|date=22 August 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199761838|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fruit, the date, is known to ripen during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dateland.com/how-are-dates-grown/|title=How are Dates Grown?

The '''Diane and Guilford Glazer Institute of Jewish Studies''', formerly the '''Institute of Jewish Studies''', is a center devoted to [[Judaic studies]] in [[Nanjing]], [[China]]. It is associated with the Department of [[Religious Studies]] of [[Nanjing University]].

The institute was founded in May 1992, a few months after the establishment of diplomatic relations between [[Israel]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] in January of that year. It offers courses in Jewish studies which now enroll over 200 students each year, has published a one-volume Chinese version of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', and other publications. It has now established both masters and Ph.D. program in Jewish studies, the only Chinese institution to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Open New Chapter With the People of the Book" ''The Forward'' April 20, 2007, p. A1-B2 [http://www.forward.com/articles/10542/]&lt;/ref&gt; It held an  International Seminar on Holocaust and Genocide in World War II on August 7–12, 2005, in Nanjing.

It was given its present name after the construction of a quarters for it from the [[Guilford Glazer|Diane and Guilford Glazer Foundation]] in a new building at the University in 2006. It is planned that it will become part of  a larger Nanjing University–[[Johns Hopkins University]] Institute for International Research.

==Digital leisure==
Digital leisure, similar to leisure, is a contentious term. Leisure has traditionally been defined in three main ways, as time (that which is not work), as activity (freely chosen), and as a state of mind (denoted by such things as intrinsic motivation, perceived freedom, and positive affect). Digital leisure practices and spaces are intertwined with work in ways that physical leisure spaces are not. Widespread surveillance of digital leisure practices and spaces allows companies to benefit monetarily from the data collected during the users’ leisure experiences (hence, the user is indeed working during their leisure time). Therefore, digital leisure is time spent engaged in digital practices and spaces while in a leisurely state of mind.

==Digital leisure cultures==
Traditionally, leisure scholars have focused on analogue leisure cultures such as sports, outdoor activities, [[fandom]], and summer camps. In a digital age, there are very few (if any) pure analogue leisure spaces in existence. Most leisure cultures have been digitized in some way. With wearable fitness trackers digitizing every aspect of our leisure (even our sleep) and smartphones-turned-watches, our very leisured bodies have become digital assemblages&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_HEhBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Lupton,+D.+(2015).+Digital+sociology.+New+York:+Routledge&amp;ots=WTpm0fPy92&amp;sig=KvSLoivJENDmlE2Digz4_TTiHjI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Digital Sociology|last=Lupton|first=Deborah|date=2014-11-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317691815|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lupton&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; noted how the metaphor of entanglement is commonly used to explain our relationship with digitization, as it “emphasizes the inextricably intertwined relationships of human subjects with material objects” (p. 41). As such, digital leisure cultures refer to the digitization of previous analogue areas of leisure research&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tara Brabazon|title=Digital Leisure Studies|date=2016|url=https://archive.org/details/DigitalLeisureStudies|accessdate=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Digital leisure cultures “covers some of the following technologies and practices which have built cultures around them: namely apps (applications), smartphones, online games, interaction on some form of social media, and the downloading of films, live televised sports events and music”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Brabazon&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of Physical Cultural Studies|last=Brabazon|first=T.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=|editor1=M. Silk|editor2=D. L. Andrews|editor3=H. Thorpe|location=New York|pages=597-603|chapter=Afterword: Digital physical cultural studies?}}&lt;/ref&gt; has identified two systemic ways in which analogue leisure cultures and digital cultures differ: deterritorialization and disintermediation. [[Deterritorialization|Deterritorilization]] refers to the ways [[digitization]] is post-territory. As a concept, it captures “how particular media platforms and communicative systems de-emphasize our position in analogue space and time in favour of virtual space and time”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, Brabazon&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; used the example of social media. We can join [[Pinterest]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] – and we can be involved in and share content in each of these distinct spaces with each other, even if we do not share physical space with each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Disintermediation]] refers to the ways in which digital leisure cultures involve “peer-to-peer networks where links are removed from the traditional supply chain”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; . As part of these networks, the producer can also be the consumer (prosumer). In this way, material in digital leisure cultures can be created and disseminated much more quickly than in analogue leisure cultures.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Digital turn: theories and methodologies ==
Leisure studies (and academia in general) currently exists in the age of the “digital turn.” The digital turn refers to the different ways digitization influences our lives, including our behaviors, social interactions, environments, economies, and politics. The digital turn signifies a new period in leisure scholarship and demands a conceptual change, one in which leisure scholars turn to new resources and ways of capturing what digitization means for our lives and leisure&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Redhead&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;noted, leisure scholars “need to produce sustained theorizing of the “digital turn” in Leisure Studies and with it more satisfactory theoretically informed empirical studies of digital leisure cultures” (p. 828) to engage in broader scholarly conversations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137405876|title=Digital Leisure, the Internet and Popular Culture {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Spracklen|first=Karl|language=en-gb|doi=10.1057/9781137405876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To do so, it has been suggested leisure scholars shift the ways they are thinking about leisure and draw on different disciplines and theories as resources to begin to shape digital leisure theory and theorizing&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=FM|first=Player|title=Beyond leisure studies|url=https://ppab.player.fm/series/tarabrabazons-podcast/beyond-leisure-studies|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, Redhead&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; has recommended that digital leisure theory be shaped by critical theory and critical theorists from other disciplines such as philosophers, including [[Jean Baudrillard|Braudrillard]], [[Alain Badiou|Badiou]], [[Slavoj Žižek|Zizek]], and [[Paul Virilio|Virilio]]. Redhead presented two concepts to guide digital leisure theory: accelerated culture and claustropolitanism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULoBCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Football+and+accelerated+culture:+This+modern+sporting+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEh8rP2qPZAhUGUt8KHTJ7BUwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Football%20and%20accelerated%20culture:%20This%20modern%20sporting%20life&amp;f=false|title=Football and Accelerated Culture: This Modern Sporting Life|last=Redhead|first=Steve|date=2015-06-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317411543|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ok_DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Theoretical Times|last=Redhead|first=Steve|date=2017-11-17|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781787146693|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Spracklen has presented a theory of communicative and instrumental digital leisure drawing on theorists such as Habermas, Catells, Urry, and Bauman. He argued that digital leisure is more communicative given its possibilities for interactivity and resisting power disparities, but despite these possibilities, it is not immune to instrumental structures that shape traditional (non-digitized) popular leisure&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. In this way, digital leisure should not be seen as something novel, but as “just another leisure space.” In his work, he has also emphasized the work of leisure theorists, such as Rojek, Stebbins, Aitchison, Blackshaw, Giulianotti and Crouch, who have focused attention towards understanding and critically engaging with digital leisure.

With the digital turn in research, also comes the need to consider methodologies and methods used to effectively study digital leisure cultures. Digital leisure scholars are still actively working to envision new methodologies and methods and retool existing ones.

'''Election law''' is a discipline falling at the juncture of [[constitutional law]] and [[political science]]. It researches "the politics of law and the law of politics". The conceptual knowledge behind election law focuses on who votes, when that person can vote, and the construction behind the tabulated totals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/lf/lfa/lfa03/lfa03c|title=Electoral Laws —|website=aceproject.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
Some of the questions that are addressed by election law are:

* Which people are [[Suffrage|entitled to vote]] in an [[election]] (e.g. age, residency or literacy requirements, or [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]), and the procedures by which such persons must [[voter registration|register to vote]] or present identification in order to vote
* Which people are entitled to hold office (for example, age, residency, birth or citizenship requirements), and the procedures [[candidate]]s must follow to appear on the ballot (such as the formatting and filing of [[nominating petition]]s) and rules governing [[write-in candidate]]s
* The rules about what subjects may be submitted to a direct popular vote through a [[referendum]] or plebiscite, and the rules that governmental agencies or citizen groups must follow to place questions on the ballot for public consideration
* The framework by which [[political parties]] may organize their internal government, and how they select candidates to run for political office (e.g. [[primary election]]s)
* The financing of elections (e.g. contribution limits, rules for [[public financing of elections]], the public disclosure of contributors, and rules governing [[interest group]]s other than a candidate's campaign organization)
* The requirements for creating districts which elect representatives to a legislative assembly (examples include [[congressional district]]s, [[electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] or wards within a municipality)
* What restrictions are placed on campaign advocacy (such as rules on anonymous or [[false advertising]])
* How votes are cast at an election (including whether to use a paper [[ballot]], or some other form of recording votes such as a mechanical [[voting machine]] or [[electronic voting]] device, and how information is presented to voters on the ballot or device)
* How votes are counted at an election, recounts, and election challenges
* Whether, and how, voters or candidates may file legal actions in a [[court|court of law]] or administrative agency to enforce their rights or contest the outcome of an election
* Definition of [[electoral fraud]] and other [[crime]]s against the electoral system
* The sources of election law (for example, constitutions, national statutes, state statutes, or judicial decisions) and the interplay between these sources of law

== Regimes in comparative law ==

=== France ===

The French electoral code addresses most of the elections. However, other texts frame this material for special elections. Thus the Constitution but fixed some general basic provisions concerning the presidential election, the legislative and senatorial elections.

For litigation election, the court depends on the concerned election. The Constitutional Council is responsible for the most important elections: presidential elections and senatorial elections or referendums. In contrast, to the municipal or district elections the administrative tribunal has jurisdiction, then the appeal is to the State Council. Finally, for the regional and European elections, the Council of State which has jurisdiction at first and last resort.

In decisions on electoral matters, the law takes into account the results: if an essential principle is violated, the election is canceled but if fraud is "classic" (ballot stuffing, failure to register as voters, vote the dead ...) but the election was won (after counting of ballots invalidated) with a large or very large lead, the judge then cancels rarely the result.&lt;ref&gt;On the other side, opposite judgement comes when the participation of the lists has resulted in an imbalance, also because the deviation of the votes between the two clusters is less than one thousand ballotts: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= La partecipazione (viziata) delle liste produce uno squilibrio nel voto|journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2001| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89309068}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
The Italian Constitution fixes some general basic provisions concerning the legislative elections.
Electoral disputes in Italy are complex because they are divided between several court orders. For example, with regard to the dispute concerning registration of candidates for ballots or litigation election, the administrative court has jurisdiction. For eligibility and disfranchisement, the judge is the ordinary tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;"A principle of separation of powers ( ... ) is the rationale of the law ( ... ) which ousts the administrative courts from ineligibility dispute": {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Il giudicato civile in materia elettorale preclude l'azione popolare davanti al Tar|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89298285}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a fraud is proven by the judge, it does not cancel necessarily the elections,&lt;ref&gt;The faults, as null and void, cannot justify a reversal "by forfeit" of the electoral outcome: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Elezioni Molise: gestione incerta fino all'annullamento definitivo|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89298439}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they think that the result of election without the fraud would not have been identical. The survival of the acts already performed by the elected organs would seem solved by abundant case law that protects innocent trust of third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = L'incandidabilità di un eletto travolge il consiglio regionale abruzzese (e ripropone gli interrogativi molisani)|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2002| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89310220}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{UK}} ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], election law is legislated for by The [[Houses of Parliament]]. The statutory governance of UK Election law comes from acts of parliament such as the [[Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011]]. The Electoral Commission's mandate and establishment was set out in the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] (PPERA), and ranges from the regulation of political donations and expenditure by political and third parties through to promoting greater participation in the electoral process.

The [[Electoral Administration Act 2006]] made a number of improvements to electoral registration, improving the security arrangements for absent voting, allowing observers to attend elections and a major change in reducing the minimum age for candidates at UK parliamentary elections. It also introduced the performance standards regime for electoral services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">'''Eric Segelberg''' (20 December 1920 Nykoping, Sweden – 17 October 2001 Uppsala, Sweden) was theologian and a priest of the Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]].

Segelberg was ordained to priesthood in 1944, and he continued to study Theology and Classics at both [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] Universities, getting doctor's degree in the History of Religion. His dissertation in 1958 was on the "Maşbūtā. Studies in the Ritual of the Mandæan Baptism". He became professor of Classics at [[Dalhousie University]], Canada in 1968. As [[Emeritus]] he returned to Sweden. Widely known in many fields, he specialized in study of [[Patristics]] and the [[Mandeans]] and [[gnosticism]]. His main specialization was in liturgics. His quite outstanding liturgical knowledge was characterizising his studies in history of religion. Well-known are his studies "The ''Benedictio Olei'' in the Apostolic Tradition of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]]", (Oriens Christianus 48, 1964), and "The Ordination of the Mandæan ''tarmida'' and its Relation to Jewish and Early Christian Ordination Rites", (''[[Studia Patristica]]'' 10, 1970).

Segelberg was member of the [[Societas Sanctae Birgittae]] and in Sweden a well known member of the [[High Church Lutheranism|Swedish high church movement]] [[Arbetsgemenskapen Kyrklig Förnyelse]] ("[[The Church Union]] in Sweden"). He  established a trust in 1984 to enhance Christian theological research, education and youth work. In Sweden he founded "Segelbergska stiftelsen för liturgivetenskaplig forskning" (The Segelberg foundation on liturgical research), sited in Uppsala,Sweden. In 1990 it was published a Festschrift to him, collecting a lot of his own writings: ''Gnostica – mandaica – liturgica. Opera eius ipsius selecta &amp; collecta septuagenario Erico Segelberg oblata'' curantibus Jan Bergman, Jan Hjärpe, Per Ström ''una cum Bibliographia Segelbergiana'' ab Oloph Bexell redacta (Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis.

Baron '''Ernst Friedrich von Liphart''' or '''Earnest Lipgart''' (1847–1932) was a painter, a noted art expert and art collector from what is now [[Tartu]] in Estonia. After living for a time in Florence, he moved to France and then to Russia, where he was a curator at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

==Life==
Liphart was born in [[Kambja Parish]] in [[Tartu County]] in 1847. His father, [[Karl Eduard von Liphart]], came from a [[Baltic nobility|noble]] [[Baltic German]] family that was based at [[Raadi Manor]] in what is now Estonia. His family were members of the national intelligentsia and owned a significant art collection.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.erm.ee/en/visit/raadi/history-of-manor History of Manor], Eesti. Rahva Muuseum, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travels in Spain and Italy==
Liphart accompanied his father on his travels, starting in 1860.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; In 1862, they moved to Florence because of Liphart's weak health. His father continued his interest in art, which was financed and supported by Grand Duchess [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819–1876)|Maria Nikolaevna]], the daughter of [[Tsar Nicholas I]].&lt;ref name=reh/&gt; Ernst studied painting under [[Franz von Lenbach]] before travelling to Spain with him to study paintings from 1866 to 1868.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; This trip was funded by Lenbach's patron [[Adolf Friedrich von Schack|Count Schack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iment.com/maida/family/mother/vicars/ernstdeliphart.htm Ernst Friederich von Liphart], Master Paintings, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris==
Liphart was disinherited by his father in 1873 after he converted to Roman Catholicism to marry Luisa Juan, a Florentine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/baron-ernst-friedrich-von-liphart Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart], RusArtNet.com, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; before they moved to Paris. He studied under [[Gustave Boulanger]] and [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre]] at the [[Académie Julian]] whilst illustrating the leading magazines ''La vie élégante'' and ''La vie moderne''.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt;

==Saint Petersburg==
[[File:Menu for Nicholas II coronation by Lipgart.jpg|thumb|Menu for Nicholas II's coronation by Lipgart]]
In 1886 Liphart moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], where he was a successful artist, painting a portrait of [[Tsar Nicholas II]], as well as decorating the curtain and ceiling of the theatre of the [[Moika Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intertimes.ru/?type=spec&amp;id=21 Yusupov Palace], intertimes.ru, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and several imperial palaces.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; Liphart also took on more unusual requests, including the menu for the Tsar's coronation in 1896 and then painting 100 figures on a piano, telling the story of [[Orpheus]]. The piano was a present from the Tsar to Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicholasandalexandra.com/piano.html Grand Piano], Liphart, 1898, nicholasandalexandra.com, retrieved 4 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernst's father died in [[Florence]] in 1904. After his death his art collection was moved back to Estonia, where it was combined with his family's collection at [[Raadi Manor]].&lt;ref name=reh&gt;[http://www.rehs.com/printimage.html?image_no=28 The Environs of Plymouth], rehs.com, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Liphart's home was still in Russia, where he taught at the Drawing School of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] in Saint Petersburg in the 1890s, where his students included [[Eugene Lanceray]].&lt;ref name=bown243&gt;Bown, Matthew Cullerne. "Art Under Stalin", page 243. New York: Holmes &amp; Meier, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Jan Tsionglinsky]] and Liphart.&lt;ref name=leek&gt;{{cite book|last=Leek|first=Peter|title=Russian painting|year=2005|publisher=Parkstone International|location=New York|isbn=1780429754|page=257|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1780429754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liphart was appointed to several Russian learned societies and he became the curator of paintings at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=herm/&gt; He held the position until 1929. Liphart continued his father's interest in Leonardo da Vinci. Liphart arranged for the museum to purchase [[Madonna and Child with Flowers]]&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; which he had correctly attributed to da Vinci.&lt;ref name=herm/&gt; Liphart also notably identified the painting of [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul (El Greco)|Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] to be by [[El Greco]].&lt;ref name=herm&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_8.html Directors of the Imperial Hermitage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227012744/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_8.html |date=February 27, 2014 }}, Hermitage Museum, retrieved 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liphart art collection that had been at the family residence was moved after the [[Russian Revolution]]. The collection appeared first in a sale in [[Copenhagen]] in 1920. Raadi Manor was used by the [[Estonian National Museum]] in 1922&amp;ndash;4 after the manor came under the management of the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref name=reh/&gt; The graphic art collection created by the Liphart family came into the possession of [[Tartu University]] in the 1920s. The university's art museum still has the collection, which includes examples of Japanese woodcuts as well as noted prints by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[William Hogarth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html Graphic Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101050527/http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html |date=2014-01-01 }}, University of Tartu Art Museum, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 he was evicted from his house and his daughter was executed for harbouring a [[White movement#Structure|White Army]] officer. Before he died, Liphart wrote a novel and a play.&lt;ref name=rus&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/baron-ernst-friedrich-von-liphart Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart], RusArtNet.com, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15211">The '''ethics of terraforming''' has constituted a philosophical debate within [[biology]], [[ecology]], and [[environmental ethics]] as to whether [[terraforming]] other worlds is an [[ethics|ethical]] endeavor.

==Support==
On the pro-terraforming side of the argument, there are those like [[Robert Zubrin]] and [[Richard L. S. Taylor]] who believe that it is humanity's moral obligation to make other worlds suitable for Terran life, as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth. They also point out that Earth will eventually be destroyed as nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all Earth life to become extinct. Dr. Zubrin further argues that even if native microbes have arisen on Mars, for example, the fact that they have not progressed beyond the microbe stage by this point, halfway through the lifetime of the Sun, is a strong indicator that they never will; and that if microbial life exists on Mars, it is likely related to Earth life through a common origin on one of the two planets, which spread to the other as an example of [[panspermia]]. Since Mars life would then not be fundamentally unrelated to Earth life, it would not be unique, and competition with such life would not be fundamentally different from competing against microbes on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why life on Mars may help change the paradigm|url=http://www.bernardokastrup.com/2012/12/life-mars-paradigm.html|publisher=By [[Bernardo Kastrup]] (December 2, 2012) |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Zubrin summed up this view:

{{Cquote
|''Some people consider the idea of terraforming Mars heretical—humanity playing God. Yet others would see in such an accomplishment the most profound vindication of the divine nature of the human spirit, exercised in its highest form to bring a dead world to life. My own sympathies are with the latter group. Indeed, I would go farther. I would say that failure to terraform Mars constitutes failure to live up to our human nature and a betrayal of our responsibility as members of the community of life itself. Today, the living biosphere has the potential to expand its reach to encompass a whole new world. Humans, with their intelligence and technology, are the unique means that the biosphere has evolved to allow it to make that land grab, the first among many. Countless beings have lived and died to transform the Earth into a place that could create and allow human existence. Now it's our turn to do our part''. (1996) &lt;ref name="zoob1"&gt;Robert Zubrin, ''[[The Case for Mars|The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must]]'', pp. 248-249, Simon &amp; Schuster/Touchstone, 1996, {{ISBN|0-684-83550-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Richard Taylor more succinctly exemplified this point of view with the slogan, "move over microbe".&lt;ref name="Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fogg| first=Martyn J.| year=1995| title=Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments| publisher=SAE International, Warrendale, PA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics label this argument as an example of [[anthropocentrism]]. These critics may view the homocentric view as not only [[geocentric]] but short-sighted, and tending to favour human interests to the detriment of [[ecosystem|ecological systems]]. They argue that an anthropocentrically driven approach could lead to the extinction of indigenous [[extraterrestrial life]], or the [[Interplanetary contamination]].

[[Martyn J. Fogg]] rebutted these ideas by delineating four potential rationales on which to evaluate the ethics of terraforming—[[anthropocentrism]], [[Biocentrism (ethics)|zoocentrism]], [[ecocentrism]], and [[preservationism]]—roughly forming a spectrum from placing the most value on human utility to placing the most value on preserving [[nature]]. While concluding that arguments for protecting alien biota can be made from any of these standpoints, he also concludes with an argument, similar to Zubrin's, that strict preservationism is "untenable", since "it assumes that human consciousness, creativity, culture and technology stand outside nature, rather than having been a product of natural selection. If ''Homo sapiens'' is the first space faring species to have evolved on Earth, space settlement would not involve acting 'outside nature', but legitimately 'within our nature'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~mfogg/EthicsDTP.pdf | title=The Ethical Dimensions of Space Settlement| format=pdf| accessdate=2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Strong [[ecocentrist]]s like [[Richard Sylvan]] feel there is an intrinsic value to life, and seek to preserve the existence of native lifeforms. This idea is usually referred to as [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]]. In response to these objections, weak anthropocentrism incorporates biocentric ethics, allowing for various degrees of terraforming.

[[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Christopher McKay]] strikes a position between these two, what may be termed weak ecocentrism, proposing that an entire biosphere of alien life, even if only microbial life, has far more value than individual microbes, and should not be subject to interference by Earth life. However, he also proposed that it would be valuable and desirable to terraform a planet to nurture the alien life, to allow it to thrive as well as to exhibit a broader range of behavior for scientific study, and that such activity is ultimately justified by the utilitarian value to humans of being able to study and appreciate the still somewhat undisturbed alien life.

McKay put his views in these words:

{{Cquote
|''If we discover living or dormant organisms on Mars and these forms represent a different type of life than the life we have on Earth, then we should not bring life from Earth to Mars. Instead, we should alter the Martian environment so that this native Martian life can expand to fill a planetary scale biosphere''. [...] ''it is essential to maintain the categorical distinction between killing individual microorganisms and extinguishing an entire alternative system of life. There is no logical argument against killing microorganisms per se, either for research, medical, sanitary, or even casual reasons. However... it does not logically follow that destroying or displacing the first example of life beyond Earth is acceptable if the only examples of that life are microscopic''. [...] ''If we terraformed Mars to allow the expansion of that life we would then reap the maximum benefits from the scientific study of that life form and its development into a full scale global biosphere. We would also enjoy the educational and [aesthetic] benefits of life in a biologically richer solar system''.&lt;ref name="ontomars"&gt;Christopher McKay and Robert Zubrin, "Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration?", pp. 177-182, in ''[[On to Mars: Colonizing a New World]]'', Apogee Books Space Series, 2002, {{ISBN|1-896522-90-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2002)}}

Even this "help" would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve at its own pace as well as its own direction, free of any outside interference. The impact of the human species on otherwise untouched worlds and the possible interference with or elimination of alien life forms are good reasons to leave these other worlds in their natural states; this is an example of a strong biocentric view, or object-centered ethic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terraforming|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Terraforming_-_Ethical_issues/id/2077768|publisher=By [[Global Oneness Commitment]]|accessdate=May 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222154427/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Terraforming_-_Ethical_issues/id/2077768|archivedate=December 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim this is a form of [[Antihumanism|anti-humanism]] and they assert that rocks and bacteria can not have rights, nor should the discovery of alien life prevent terraforming from occurring.

Pragmatists argue that humanity on other planets is [[sociology|sociologically]] impractical. The basis is that being on another planet wouldn't change [[human nature]], so it wouldn't be long until pollution and destruction by humankind began, and on a planet that has probably only known peace since its formation. Since [[life|life on Earth]] will ultimately be destroyed by planetary impacts or the [[red giant]] phase of the Sun, all native species will perish if not allowed to move to other objects.

Some advocates of animal welfare have pointed out the ethical issues associated with spreading Earth-based wild-animal life by terraforming. In particular, they claim it may be ethically objectionable to bring into existence large numbers of animals that suffer greatly during their often-short lives in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html
| author=Brian Tomasik | title=The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering | accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also concerns that even with full terraformation, distinct differences between Earth and Mars, such as gravity, lengths of the day and night cycles, and differing/lacking magnetic fields, would cause harm to many introduced species that have evolved for millions of years under Earth conditions. Though some species may survive, and others possibly could be adapted through genetic modification, if the introduced species were isolated on Mars and not frequently interbred with Earth counterparts, the species would eventually evolve through many generations in order to better suit their new environment, possibly leading to different evolutionary lines. Thus, the introduced life may eventually look and act very different from their Earthly counterparts and/or ancestors.

Another aspect of terraforming ethics deals with an opposing extreme in this debate. Terraforming could be seen as a potential waste of precious materials, in light of alternative uses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} believe that it would constrict the growth potential of humanity by encapsulating the material inside of an astronomical object. Once the surface is terraformed and people have taken residence there, all the interior material is needed to sustain the maximum gravity potential for those inhabitants. If all of the material were utilized to produce space habitation systems, a much greater number of lives would then be supported.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Future prospects==
The contrasts between these arguments are fully explored in the field of environmental ethics. Some researchers suggest that both paradigms need to mature into a more complex, [[cosmocentric ethic]] which incorporates the (unknown) value of extraterrestrial life with the values of humanity and all things in the universe. Debates often focus on how much time and effort should be expended on investigating the possibility of any microscopic life on a planet before deciding whether to terraform, and what level of sophistication or chances for future development alien life would deserve varying levels of commitment to non-interference. Such debates have been engaged in live, between Zubrin and McKay and others, at various conferences of the [[Mars Society]], which has made written and video records of the debates available. For example, a written account of some of these debates is available in ''[[On to Mars: Colonizing a New World]]'', as a joint article, "Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration?" (pp.&amp;nbsp;177–182)

==Ethics of terraforming in fiction==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rgbmars.jpg|thumb|right|307px|Covers of the ''Mars'' series]] --&gt;
A fairly thorough non-fictional analysis of the ethics of terraforming is also presented under the guise of the fictional [[Mars trilogy]] by [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], particularly between the characters [[Mars trilogy#Ann Clayborne|Ann Clayborne]] and [[Mars trilogy#Saxifrage .22Sax.22 Russell|Sax Russell]], with Clayborne epitomizing an ecocentric ethic of non-interference and Russell embodying the anthropocentric belief in the virtue of terraforming.
The idea of interplanetary colonization and its ethical implications are also explored by C.S. Lewis in the first book of his Space Trilogy ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' published in 1938.

The plot of the 1982 film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' is based around the use of the so-called "Genesis Device" to create the conditions and organic building-blocks for life on previously lifeless planets. In debating the ethics of the device, [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]], [[Spock]] and [[James T. Kirk|Admiral Kirk]] reflect on the Device's ability to replace any existing lifeforms with "its new matrix". McCoy describes the ethics of the Device in the following terms: "According to myth, the Earth was created in six days. Now watch out - here comes Genesis! We'll do it for you in six minutes!" The technology is shown to be flawed in the 1984 sequel, ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]''

''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' dealt with terraforming. In the episode "[[Home Soil]]", terraformers are causing harm to the native lifeforms on Velara III, with disastrous consequences.

In the novel ''[[Revelation Space]]'' by [[Alastair Reynolds]], there was a political dispute in the human colony of a fictional planet called Resurgam between a faction who were in support of terraforming the planet and another faction of archeologists who were against terraforming due to the discovery of the remains of an extinct alien civilisation on the planet and due to the fear that any attempt to terraform the planet would destroy the valuable artifacts that still might be buried underground.

The ethics of terraforming, as well as deep [[space colonization]], are recurring themes in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', in which they are compared to the issues of [[expansionism]] and [[imperialism]] in the [[American Old West]].

It (along with several other pieces) is in fact credited to Orff's longtime collaborator, [[Gunild Keetman]], on at least one recent release of the Schulwerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orff-Schulwerk, Volume 1: Musica Poetica, Celestial Harmonies 13104-2|url=http://harmonies.com/releases/13104.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other pieces from the [[Schulwerk]], it has been used multiple times on television, radio, music, and in films, including the films ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1973), ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993) (in a re-worked version by [[Hans Zimmer]]), ''[[Ratcatcher (film)|Ratcatcher]]'' (1999), ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000), ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' (2003), and, most recently, Michael Moore's ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]'' (2009) and ''[[The Simpsons]]''′ 22nd-season episode "[[The Scorpion's Tale]]" (2011). The piece was used as the theme music for an afternoon radio program also titled ''Gassenhauer'' on the classical music station [[WCLV]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Mark|title=Street Song / Gassenhauer: A 500 Year History|journal=Evergreen American Orff-Schulwerk Association Chapter Newsletter|year=2010|volume=34|issue=1|page=3|url=http://www.evergreenorffchapter.com/eocnews341.pdf|accessdate=June 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113202156/http://www.evergreenorffchapter.com/eocnews341.pdf|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece also has clear influences on the 1940s golden-age Argentine Tango ''vals Caballero de la luna'' by instrumentalist Enrique Rodríguez&lt;ref&gt;https://tango.info/Z0000635824.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German '''Climate Action Plan 2050''' ({{lang-de|Klimaschutzplan 2050}}) is a [[Climate change mitigation|climate protection]] policy document approved by the German government on 14{{nbsp}}November 2016.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan outlines measures by which Germany can meet its various national [[greenhouse gas]] emissions reduction goals through to 2050 (see [[#table-greenhouse-gas-policy-targets|table]]) and service its international commitments under the 2016 [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]].  The [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB), under minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]], led the development of the plan.  The plan was progressively watered down since a draft was first leaked in {{nowrap|early-May}} 2016.  Projections from the environment ministry in September 2016 indicate that Germany will likely miss its 2020 climate target.&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;

The Climate Action Plan{{nbsp}}2050 should not be confused with an earlier document, the Climate Action Programme{{nbsp}}2020 (''{{lang|de|Aktionsprogramm Klimaschutz{{nbsp}}2020}}''), approved in December 2014 and which only covers the period until 2020.  In early 2017 it was agreed that the 2020 Programme would be scrapped.

== Climate Action Programme 2020 ==

The Climate Action Programme{{nbsp}}2020 (''{{lang|de|Aktionsprogramm Klimaschutz{{nbsp}}2020}}'') is an attempt by Germany to help meet its official 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reductions target after a 'climate gap' had been identified.{{efn|Official translations use the British spelling of programme.}}  Projections from 2013 show Germany may miss its 40% reductions target by about {{nowrap|7%-points}} without additional measures.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The first draft of the programme was released in {{nowrap|mid-November}} 2014.  How best to control the contribution from coal-fired generation remained controversial, but economy and energy minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) dismissed plans aired in his ministry in October 2014 to retire 10{{nbsp}}GW of coal capacity.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014b"&gt;

The most significant part of the new package is a pledge to cut electricity sector emissions substantially by 2020.  To do so, the government proposes to cap emissions from the sector at 22{{nbsp}}million tonnes between 2016 and 2020 or 4.4{{nbsp}}million tonnes each year.  Once the cap is in place, energy companies will be allocated allowances based on their current emissions.  If they cut their emissions by a greater amount, they may be able to sell their surplus to other companies.  The package also contains measures to improve energy efficiency and the transport sector.&lt;ref name="hope-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However a government report, released on 30{{nbsp}}September 2016, shows that Germany will meet its 2020 greenhouse gas commitments only under "a best case scenario".&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wettengel-2016"/&gt;  The report, prepared for the European Union, is available in German.&lt;ref name="projection-report-2015"&gt;

== Development of the Climate Action Plan 2050 ==

The history of the Climate Action Plan{{nbsp}}2050 is quite involved.  The [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB) is the lead agency for the plan, under the direction of environment minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]).  A novel [[public consultation]] process was utilized to collect ideas from state and city governments, [[advocacy groups]], and [[citizenship|citizens]] and these ideas were then used to help create the first version.  Internal drafts of the plan were leaked three times to the media in 2016, the first in {{nowrap|early-May}}, the second in {{nowrap|late-June}}, and the third in {{nowrap|early-November}}.

=== Coalition agreement: 2013 ===

The notion of a climate action plan arose from the coalition agreement between the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]], and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] parties in 2013.  The agreement stated:

{{quote|[I]n Germany we want to define an emissions reduction pathway with a final target of 80{{nbsp}}to 95{{nbsp}}percent lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 by 2050.  We will augment this target with concrete measures, drawn up through a broad dialogue (Climate Action Plan).&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|1}}}}

=== Public consultation: 25 June 2015 – 19 March 2016 ===

A public consultation with stakeholders began on {{nowrap|25–26 June}} 2015 with a Kick-off Conference in Berlin.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016a"&gt;

=== First leaked draft: early-May 2016 ===

A draft of the plan was leaked to media for the first time in {{nowrap|early-May}} 2016.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the result of consolidating a long catalog of measures from the consultation process.  The leaked plan included proposals for:&lt;ref name="appunn-2016a"/&gt;

* [[ecotax|ecological tax reform]] and the internalization of [[externality|environmental costs]]
* climate friendly investment
* reducing emissions from coal and a [[Fossil-fuel phase-out#Germany|phase-out of coal]] (''{{lang|de|Kohleausstieg}}'') well before 2050
* making both old and new buildings [[carbon neutrality|climate-neutral]]
* the digitalisation and electrification of the transport sector
* a floor price for carbon and climate-aware investment
* a reduction in the numbers of ruminant animals and for the public to eat less meat
* the use forests as [[carbon sink]]s and the renaturalisation of [[moorland]]s for the same purpose
* the investigation of a new national welfare index
* the embedding of climate protection in local and regional public services

The plan also suggested a "pluralistic" (meaning diverse groups are represented) commission be established, tasked with developing a coal phase-out plan by {{nowrap|mid-2017}}.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016a"/&gt;

Following the leaked document, state governments became increasingly concerned that they were being railroaded into climate change goals that could damage their regional economies.&lt;ref name="kersting-and-stratmann-2016"&gt;

=== Second leaked draft: 21 June 2016 ===

A draft of the plan was leaked to media for the second time in {{nowrap|late-June}} 2016.  The draft was dated 21{{nbsp}}June 2016 and is available for download in German.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016b"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The new draft shows that individual sectors may escape specific emissions targets and that an end date for coal-fired generation has been omitted.  Earlier versions had contained sector-specific targets for energy, transport, industry, buildings, and agriculture.  The energy sector which was previously slated to make a "considerable" contribution is now required to make an "adequate" contribution.  Rather than saying that coal-fired generation must "end well before 2050" the new draft emphasizes that "the importance of power production from coal will decrease" and that there will be a "step-by-step reduction".  The previous draft stated that the transport sector would need to deliver "disproportionately high" emissions reductions (on account of the poor performance of the sector to date), that has now diminished to an "ambitious" contribution.  Other proposals remain, including the development of ecological tax reform.  The plan also includes targets for modernizing the heating and cooling systems in buildings, including no new fossil-fueled heating systems in houses after 2030.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016b"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal for a Commission on Climate Protection, Growth, Structural Change, and the Completion of the ''Energiewende'' (''{{lang|de|Kommission "Klimaschutz, Wachstum, Strukturwandel und Vollendung der Energiewende"}}'') remains, but now without the specific task of developing a roadmap for the phase-out of coal.&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"/&gt;

The weakening of the plan is also a result of industry associations repeatedly criticizing sector targets and itemized measures, which they fear would harm Germany's economic performance and international competitiveness.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016b"/&gt;

=== Official draft: 6 September 2016 ===

An official draft was released on 6{{nbsp}}September 2016 and is available in German.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016c"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  This draft retains a provision for the establishment of a Commission on Climate Protection, Growth, Structural Change, and the Completion of the ''Energiewende''.

The content however has been watered down considerably.  Concrete emissions reductions targets were removed altogether.  The previously leaked June 2016 draft stated that by 2030 "a large majority of newly registered cars" would need to be powered by either electricity or [[biofuel]]s.  But the new draft merely states that "the government aims to significantly lower car emissions by 2030" and that electric cars can contribute to that goal.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;

[[Environmental movement|Environmental groups]] have become increasingly critical of the plan as each iteration led to a watering down of its climate protection provisions.  The [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] were particularly concerned about the lack of detail concerning a [[Fossil-fuel phase-out#Germany|coal phase-out]].  On 24 September 2016, Greenpeace Germany issued a report critical of the watering down of the results of the consultation process.&lt;ref name="greenpeace-press-release-2016"&gt;

=== Cabinet deliberations: late-2016 ===

In {{nowrap|late-2016}}, the plan went to the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] (''{{lang|de|Bundeskanzleramt}}'') to coordinate the final version to be agreed by the [[Cabinet of Germany|German cabinet]] (''{{lang|de|Bundeskabinett}}'').

Media reports in {{nowrap|late-October}} 2016 suggest a deepening rift between the economics and energy ministry (BMWi) and the environment ministry (BMUB) over the plan and the exit process for coal-fired generation (''{{lang|de|Kohleausstieg}}'').  Economy and energy minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] opposes the setting of a coal exit date before job alternatives for [[lignite]] workers have been determined.&lt;ref name="amelang-2006"&gt;

A revised draft plan, circulated by the environment ministry on 4{{nbsp}}November 2016, was obtained by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]''.  The plan has become more stringent and now includes passages that had earlier been removed during the negotiations between ministries.  The new plan also precludes new coal-fired generation and the expansion of existing [[Open-pit mining|open-pit mines]] and calls on the government to lobby for an EU-wide [[Price floor|floor price]] for auctioned [[European Union Emission Trading System|EU ETS]] emissions allowances.&lt;ref name="clew-2016b"&gt;

On 7{{nbsp}}November 2016, over 40 German companies, including energy suppliers [[EnBW]] and [[MVV Energie]] and network operator [[50Hertz Transmission GmbH|50Hertz]], together with [[Commerzbank]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[IKEA]], and [[Hochtief]], are lobbying for a more ambitious program, one which ensures that Germany's [[Paris Agreement]] commitments are met.  The companies want sector-specific emissions targets for 2030 and state that "only in this way can new business models and concrete plans for decarbonisation be developed".  They want the  goal to be the "rapid switch to 100% renewable energy".  British economist [[Nicholas Stern]] also backs a more ambitious plan.&lt;ref name="clew-2016c"&gt;

On 8{{nbsp}}November 2016, economy and energy minister Gabriel vetoed the plan amid concerns by trade union [[IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie|IG BCE]] and supported by the [[:de:Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie|BDI]] industry group.

}} This document is not an extract translated from the official plan.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan is to be supplemented by a program of policy measures, developed by the German parliament (''{{lang|de|Bundestag}}''), with the first such program to be in place in 2018.  Annual reporting will track progress and should facilitate specific policy adjustments where needed.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

=== Preamble ===

The plan begins with a preamble that states that the document is an evolving work in progress and "cannot and does not want to be a detailed masterplan".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  It adds that there will be "no rigid provisions" and that the plan is technology neutral and open to innovation.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  The preamble stresses that the government will simultaneously maintain German competitiveness:

{{quote|We want to advance the upcoming changes without structural ruptures. It's about using the strength and creativity of the German market economy, as well as the forces of competition to reach existing national, European and international climate protection targets.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;}}

The preamble also reiterates Germany's 2010 climate targets (see [[#table-greenhouse-gas-policy-targets|table]]) and its 2016 [[Paris Agreement]] commitment.{{efn|Germany's 2015 intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) became its nationally determined contribution (NDC) when it ratified the Paris Agreement on 5{{nbsp}}October 2016.}}&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Sector targets ===

Sector targets remained controversial during the development of the plan.  Notwithstanding, the official document now specifies sector targets for the first time under a national climate protection policy.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  The initial sector targets will be subject to a comprehensive impact assessment and consultation and may well be adjusted as a result in 2018.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;

=== Commission for growth, structural change, and regional development ===

The plan establishes a commission for growth, structural change, and regional development.  But unlike earlier versions, the commission will not be tasked with setting a date for an exit from coal.  Instead, the commission will "support the structural changes" resulting from transformation and will "develop a mix of instruments that will bring together economic development, structural change, social acceptability and climate protection".  The commission will be based at the economics and energy ministry, but will consult with other ministries, federal states, municipalities, and unions, as well as with representatives of "affected" companies and regions.  The commission is scheduled to start work at the beginning of 2018 and to report at the end of 2018.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}

=== EU Emissions Trading System ===

{{main article|European Union Emission Trading System}}

The plan stresses to role of the [[European Union Emission Trading System]] (EU{{nbsp}}ETS) as the primary climate protection instrument covering the energy sector and parts of industry in central Europe.  The government wants to strengthen price signaling and will campaign to make the EU{{nbsp}}ETS "effective" at a European level.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;  Earlier provisions to set a floor price for emissions allowances were removed.

=== Energy sector ===

{{main article|Energy in Germany|Energiewende in Germany}}

The energy sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|175–183 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 61–62% relative to 1990.  The energy supply must be "almost completely decarbonised" by 2050, with renewables as its main source.  For the electricity sector, "in the long-term, electricity generation must be based almost entirely on renewable energies" and "the share of wind and solar power in total electricity production will rise significantly".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

If "possible and economically sensible", renewable energy will be used directly in all sectors, and electricity from renewable sources will be used efficiently for heating, transport, and industry.  The utilization of biomass will be limited and sourced mostly from waste.  The plan states that transitioning to a power supply based on renewables while ensuring supply security is "technically feasible".  During the transition, "less carbon-intensive natural gas power plants and the existing most modern coal power plants play an important role as interim technologies".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

The plan states that "the climate targets can only be reached if coal-fired power generation is reduced step-by-step".  Moreover, the German government "in its development cooperation does not lend support to new coal power plants".  Regions which depend on coal, like the ''[[Lusatia|Lausitz]]'', need special consideration: "we must succeed in establishing concrete perspectives for the future of the affected regions, before concrete decisions on the step-by-step withdrawal from the lignite industry can be taken".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

Notwithstanding, a coal phase-out for Germany is implied in the plan, environment minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]] said in an interview on 21{{nbsp}}November 2016.  "If you read the Climate Action Plan carefully, you will find that the exit from coal-fired power generation is the immanent consequence of the energy sector target.{{nbsp}}... By 2030{{nbsp}}... half of the coal-fired power production must have ended, compared to 2014", Hendricks said.&lt;ref name="clew-2016e"&gt;

The plan also establishes a regional fund to foster new businesses in lignite mining regions. The government will need to ensure that EU competition law does not inhibit the operation of the fund.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Building sector ===

The building sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|70–72 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 66–67% relative to 1990.  Under the plan, Germany's building stock will be largely carbon-neutral by 2050 and their limited energy needs will be met through renewables.  Due to the slow turnover of buildings, the groundwork for this goal must be laid by 2030.  The government will invest heavily in programs to implement high energy standards for buildings.  Heating, cooling, and electricity supply will be progressively switched to renewables.  The government will terminate support programs that rely on fossil fuels by 2020 and switch instead to support programs using renewable systems.  The aim is to "make renewables-based systems much more attractive than fossil-fuel-based ones".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Transport sector ===

The transport sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|95–98 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 40–42% relative to 1990.  Unlike earlier drafts, the plan does not now set a deadline for all new cars to be emissions free.  Rather the plan states that stricter emissions limits for new cars will be set by the European Union and that "the government will advocate [an] ambitious development of the targets" so that its 2030 goal can be met.  These cuts will derive from improved efficiencies and increasingly GHG-neutral energy.  Such cuts will require "a significant contribution by the electrification of new cars and should have priority".  The plan emphasizes the contribution that [[biofuel]]s can make, stating that "in the target scenario, the energy supply of street and rail traffic, as well as parts of air and maritime traffic and inland shipping is switched to biofuels – if ecologically compatible – and otherwise largely to renewable electricity as well as other GHG-neutral fuels".  The need to support public transport, rail transport, and cycling is stressed in the plan.  The plan states a next step is to determine the framework needed to ensure that new [[powertrain]] technologies and [[Energy carrier|energy forms]] will be adopted at scale.  This then "involves the question of when, at the latest, they should be introduced into the market, and what penetration rate they should achieve by what date".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Industry ===

The industry [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|140–143 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 49–51% relative to 1990.  Good progress has been made and, {{as of|lc=yes|2016}}, the sector must reduce its emissions by about another 20%.  Notwithstanding, the plan emphasizes the need to maintain international competitiveness:

{{quote|With our modernizing strategy for the economy, the correct political framework, and active regional and structural policy that supports structural change, we want to create dependable framework conditions for the German economy, to adjust to this transformational process early, and use the possibilities connected to it.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;}}

The plan continues that, despite the costs and challenges, climate protection could become an "innovation motor" for a modern high-tech economy.  The plan acknowledges that some industrial emissions cannot be avoided – for instance, those from steel production or chemical plants.  Such emissions should be reduced as far as possible by developing new processes and replacing old ones – or through the use of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) or [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  The government will launch a [[research and development]] program to advance these and other low-carbon processes.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Agricultural sector ===

The agricultural sector [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] target for 2030 is {{nowrap|58–61 million}} tonnes [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] or a reduction of 31–34% relative to 1990.  The plan acknowledges that agriculture cannot reach zero emissions, due to the biological processes inherent in plant cultivation and livestock farming.  Instead the plan will focus on reducing emissions as much as possible and on the more efficient use of resources.  About one third of agricultural emissions are due to [[nitrous oxide]] from fertilizer use.  The government wants to reduce these emissions through better management and through [[research and development]].  Another one third of emissions derive from ruminant animals.  The government will develop a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions from livestock farming by 2021.  The plan states that 20% of agricultural land by 2030 "should be used for [[organic farming]]", compared with 6.3% in 2014.  The government also advocates the use of financial instruments under a reformed EU [[Common Agricultural Policy]] to reduce GHG emissions from the sector."&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Land use and forestry sector ===

The land use and forestry sector offers opportunities for [[carbon sequestration]].  The government will prioritize improving the performance of forests as carbon sinks.  Sustainable forest management will also be promoted and permanent grasslands and marshes are to be preserved.  The expansion of settlements and transport infrastructure is to be reduced to {{val|30|ul=ha}} per day by 2020 and to zero by 2050.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

=== Financial matters ===

Under the plan, the government will consider how to incrementally revise taxation through to 2050, on the understanding that "environmental taxes and levies can create incentives for ecological economic activity" and that "environmentally related taxes and levies can cost-efficiently trigger climate-friendly economic behavior".  The government also intends to reduce environmentally harmful subsidies.  In addition, the government will support efforts to reconcile global finance flows with climate protection goals, for instance through its role on the [[G20]] [[Financial Stability Board]].&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;

=== Implementation and revision of the plan ===

The plan is predicated on a gradual transformation, achieved through a learning process involving the scientific community and accompanied by public dialogue.&lt;ref name="bmub-2016e"/&gt;{{rp|6}}  It is therefore intended that the plan can and should respond to changing technological, political, and social conditions.  The plan will be reviewed every five years to align it with the evolution of Germany's [[Paris Agreement#Nationally determined contributions|nationally determined contribution]] (NDC) under the [[Paris Agreement]].  The first update is therefore slated for {{nowrap|late-2019}} or {{nowrap|early-2020}}.  As early as 2018, the government intends to strengthen the plan by quantifying the various emission reduction efforts and their associated ecological, social, and economic impacts.  The sector targets may be modified as a result.  Annual reporting should help the government to evaluate and adjust its specific climate protection measures in the short-term.&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016a"/&gt;

== Reactions ==

Thilo Schaefer, climate and energy expert at the [[Cologne Institute for Economic Research]] (IW) comments that "it looks like the government forgot that the energy sector and industry already participate in the European emissions trading system{{nbsp}}... in the end, it will simply become more expensive for the affected sectors, but they won't save a single extra ton of {{CO2}}{{nbsp}}... because the emissions saved by German sectors can be emitted by other states".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"&gt;

[[Simone Peter]], co-chair of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], said "this is not a good plan anymore, it has become an empty shell, because the ministerial colleagues of [environment minister] Hendricks have removed anything that could be of relevance – be it the coal exit, the end of the combustion engine, or a transition in agriculture".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

[[Klaus Töpfer]], founding director of the [[:de:Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies|Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies]] (IASS), said "this plan is certainly not yet capable of securing the German contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement.  This will require more work".&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

Regine Günther, director of policy and climate at [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF Germany]], said "today's climate action plan is only a fraction of what is needed. The only plus point: all sectors get precise reduction targets, which WWF welcomes. However, the list of negatives is much longer: there are no appropriate measures to reach those targets.  There is also a blank on the issue of coal.  The plan completely dropped the urgently needed ban on further extension of open cast mining.  The commission on coal will not start until 2018, after the federal elections.  A minimum price on carbon is also missing completely.  With this plan, the industry and energy lobbies have proven how well placed they are in the economy ministry.  With such a plan there can be no ambitious climate protection."&lt;ref name="amelang-etal-2016b"/&gt;

[[Ottmar Edenhofer]], a German climate economist and director of the [[Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change|MCC]], criticized the plan.  He said economy and energy minister "[[Sigmar Gabriel]] yielded to lobbyists and sadly put short-term interests before long-term interests".&lt;ref name="clew-2016f"&gt;

The '''Human Security Gateway''' is a database of research and information related to [[human security]]. Additions to the database are made daily, and it contains over 27,000 English and French-language resources related to conflict and human security. It is run by the [[Human Security Report Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Security Report Project]]: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=342&amp;Itemid=68 About the Project] (accessed 23 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Gateway "focuses attention on threats stemming from violence to individuals and to societies at risk".&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Gateway: [http://www.humansecuritygateway.info/aboutUs.php About the Human Security Gateway] (accessed 23 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It uses an approach to gathering and categorizing information that is complementary to the "broad" conception of human security;&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between the 'narrow' and 'broad' definitions of [[Human Security]], is summarized [[Human security#Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond|here]] on the [[Human Security]] page.&lt;/ref&gt; this is the same definition of human security that the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) used in its 1994 ''[[Human Development Report]]''.

==Content==
The Gateway offers users catalogued resources including reports, journal articles, and fact sheets. Its coverage ranges from the global to national (and sub-national) levels. Information is available in English and French, and via presentation formats such as: 
* Regional Gateways focusing on regions,
* National Gateways,
* Topical Gateways,
* Customizable Updates.

The Gateway can be searched by keyword, geographic region, or subject heading, and an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] can be viewed before downloading the full-text of the article or report. Subscribers can be notified of additions to the database, filtered by topic, region, language, or format, with feeds provided by email and RSS news feed.

Topics include: [[Military use of children|child soldiers]]; [[climate change]]; conflict prevention; [[Violent crime|criminal violence]]; [[gender]]; [[governance]]; health; [[human rights]]; [[humanitarian intervention]]; [[international law]]; [[Land mine|landmines]]; [[natural resource]]s; [[peacekeeping]]; post-conflict [[peacebuilding]]; [[small arms]]; [[refugee]]s; and [[terrorism]].

'''Irrumatio''' is a form of oral sex where a man [[pelvic thrust|thrusts]] his [[penis]] into someone else's mouth, in contrast to ''fellatio'' where the penis is being actively orally excited by a fellator. The difference lies mainly in which party takes the active part. By extension, ''irrumatio'' can also refer to the sexual technique of thrusting the penis between the thighs of a partner ([[intercrural sex]]), or between the [[abdomen|abdomens]] of two men.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/irrumatio|title=irrumatio in Sex-Lexis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Latin erotic terminology actually distinguishes two acts. First, ''fellation'', in which the man’s penis is orally excited by the fellator. Second, ''irrumation'', in which the man (the irrumator)&amp;nbsp;... engages in motions by moving his hips and body in a rhythm of his own choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=G.|first=Legman|title=[[Oragenitalism]]: Oral Techniques in Genital Excitation|publisher=The Julian Press|year=1969|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Latin]] synonym for "irrumator" is ''labda'' (Varr. ap. Non. 70,11; Aus. Epigr. 126).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis &amp; Charles Short : ''A Latin Dictionary''. Oxford, at the Clarendon Press. (s.v {{Clarify|date=December 2012}} "2. labda").&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|ancient Roman sexual vocabulary]], ''irrumatio'' is strictly a form of [[oral rape]] (''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|os impurum]]''), in which a man forces his penis into someone else's mouth, almost always that of another man.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "The Meaning of irrumare in Catullus and Martial", Classical Philology 76.1 (1981) 40–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and history ==
{{originalresearch|section|date=May 2016}}
The [[English language|English]] noun ''irrumatio'' or ''irrumation'' and verb ''irrumate'' come from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|irrumare}}'', to force receptive male oral sex.&lt;ref name="Whitaker irrumare"&gt;[http://archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=irrumatio Whitaker's Words: irrumatio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=269544|title=Richlin, A.  1981.

Butrica, in his review of R.&amp;nbsp;W. Hooper's edition of ''The Priapus Poems'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2000/2000-02-23.html|title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2000.02.23|last=James L. Butrica|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[text corpus|corpus]] of poems known as ''[[Priapeia]]'' in Latin, states that "some [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sexual practices, like ''irrumatio'', lack simple English equivalents".&lt;ref name="."&gt;{{cite book|last=Richard W. Hooper (ed. {{Clarify|date=December 2012}})|title=The Priapus Poems|publisher=Urbana and Chicago, IL, University of Illinois Press|year=1999|isbn=0-252-06752-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some conjecture among linguists, as yet unresolved, that ''irrŭmātio'' may be connected with the Latin word ''rūmen, rūminis'', the throat and gullet, whence 'ruminate', to chew the cud, therefore meaning 'insertion into the throat'. Others&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1982), ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; connect it with ''rūma'' or ''rūmis'', an obsolete word for a teat, hence it would mean "giving milk", "giving to suck". (Compare the word ''fellō'', which literally meant "suck (milk)" before it acquired its sexual sense.)

As the [[quotation]] from Butrica suggests and an article by W.&amp;nbsp;A. Krenkel shows, ''irrumatio'' was a distinct sexual practice in ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krenkel, W.&amp;nbsp;A.|title="Fellatio and Irrumatio" in W.&amp;nbsp;Bernard and C.&amp;nbsp;Reitz (eds.).

N. Adams states that "it was a standard joke to speak of ''irrumatio'' as a means of silencing someone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams, J.&amp;nbsp;N.|title=''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary''|publisher=Baltimore|year=1982|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|Oral sex]] was considered to be an act of defilement: the mouth had a particularly defined role as the organ of oratory, as in [[Greece]], to participate in the central public sphere, where discursive powers were of great importance. Thus, to penetrate the mouth could be taken to be a sign of massive power differential within a relationship. [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|Erotic art from Pompeii]] depicts ''irrumatio'' along with ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male–female sex|fututio]]'', [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Cunnilingus and fellatio|fellatio and cunnilingus]], and ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|pedicatio]]'' or anal sex.&lt;ref name="Pomp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focusarticle.com/children/article349.htm |title=Roman Sex ?C Hot Sex from the Frescos in Pompeii |last=Tarkovsky, S. |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094859/http://www.focusarticle.com/children/article349.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extant wall paintings depicting explicit sex often appear to be in bathhouses and brothels, and oral sex was something usually practiced with [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]] because of their lowly status.
Craig A. Williams argues that ''irrumatio'' was regarded as a degrading act, even more so than anal rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams, C.&amp;nbsp;A.|title=''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity''|publisher=Oxford:  Oxford University Press:|year=1999|pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.&amp;nbsp;Tarkovsky states that, despite being popular, it was thought to be a hostile act, "taken directly from the Greek, whereby the Greek men would have to force the fellatio by violence".&lt;ref name="Pomp"/&gt; Furthermore, as A.&amp;nbsp;Richlin has shown in an article in the ''[[Journal of the History of Sexuality]]'', it was also accepted as "oral [[rape]]", a [[punitive]] act against [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3704392|title=Preview of "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the Cinaedus and the Roman Law against Love between Men"|pages=523–573|last1=Richlin|first1=A.|volume=3|issue=4|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catullus]] threatens two friends who have insulted him with both ''irrumatio'' and ''pedicatio'' in his [[Catullus 16|''Carmen'' 16]], although the use could also mean "go to hell," rather than being a literal threat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Micaela Wakil Janan|title=When the Lamp Is Shattered: Desire and Narrative in Catullus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gG9Zcc6aeUC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=26 May 2016|date=18 January 1994|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-1765-3|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern English, the term "fellatio" has expanded to incorporate ''irrumatio'', and the latter has fallen out of widespread use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/fellatio|title="Fellatio" in Sex-Lewis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''irrumatio'' might today be called "forced fellatio" or "oral rape". The concept remains in more vulgar expressions like ''face-fuck'' and ''skull-fuck''.

Another synonym for ''irrumatio'' is ''Egyptian rape'' or simply ''Egyptian''; this goes back to the time of the [[Crusades]] when [[Mamluk]]s were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E. L. ''The cradle of erotica'', New York: Julian Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

A '''level spreader''' is an [[erosion control]] device designed to reduce [[water pollution]] by mitigating the impact of high-velocity [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff]].  It is used both on [[construction sites]] and for permanent applications such as drainage for [[road]]s and [[highway]]s. The device reduces the energy level in high-velocity flow by converting it into sheet flow, and disperses the discharged water so that it may be [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrated]] into [[soil]].

In theoretical linguistics, '''mirror theory''' refers to a particular approach to the architecture of the language organ developed by [[Michael Brody]], who claims his theory to be purely representational (unlike most of the current generative theories that are either derivational or combining derivation and representation).

==Phrase Structure==
There are several important respects in which '''mirror theory''' is different from more traditional theories of phrase structure in [[generative linguistics]] such as [[X-bar theory]] or [[bare phrase structure]]. The first principle, called ''mirror'', states that the syntactic relation 'X complement of Y' is identical to an inverse-order morphological relation 'X specifier of Y'. Thus, the notions of 'syntactic' and 'morphological' specifiers and complements are crucial for the linearisation of syntactic structure and its mapping to the morphological component.

When the structure is pronounced, it linearises in the following order: specifiers precede heads, and heads precede their complements. So when a sentence like that in the diagram below is pronounced, 'John' precedes the V-v-T chain, which in turn precedes 'Mary', the latter being the specifier of V. However, English is a VO language, which means that the morphological word 'loves' associated with the V-v-T chain is spelled in v, deriving the correct word order.

[http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/@fNKsYaIQUrKyTcsb/CXRWLPNx?18 Brody, M. ''Mirror Theory'']

== The Mirror Principle in Distributed Morphology ==
Similar to mirror theory is the '''Mirror Principle''' of the [[Distributed morphology|Distributed Morphology]] framework that deals primarily with issues of affix ordering.&lt;ref&gt;Halle, Morris &amp; Alec Marantz. 1993.  'Distributed Morphology and the Pieces of Inflection.'  In The View from Building 20, ed. Kenneth Hale and S. Jay Keyser.  MIT Press, Cambridge, 111-176.&lt;/ref&gt; In the model of Distributed Morphology, the underlying assumption is such that all morphemes in a morphologically complex word are effectually "leaves" on a syntactic tree. These syntactic "leaves" undergo operations that lead to the build-up of words, meaning that word-formation is subject to the same principles that govern the syntactic build-up of sentences. The mirror principle surmises that a complex word is generated in a derivation with the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] of a given word merging lower than all subsequent [[suffix]]es that attach to that word. These suffixes immediately c-command the root word and are ordered in accordance with the principle of semantic scope; morphemes that have scope over other parts of a words. To generate the proper linear structure, '''[[Left-Head Movement]]''' is applied recursively to include the morphemes that [[c-command]] a given root.

Empirical arguments for the Mirror Principle are provided by Baker's (1985) account for the distribution of a number of valence changing operations in [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], showing that the linear order of morphemes is related to the syntactic hierarchy in that morphemes are linearized in a reverse order to how they appear in a syntactic structure. His findings are summarized in ''The Mirror Generalization'', which states:  &lt;blockquote&gt;'''''Morphological derivations must directly reflect syntactic derivations (and vice versa).'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The mirror principle and morphosyntactic explanation|last = Baker|first = Mark|date = 1985|journal = Linguistic Inquiry 16: 373-415|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The generalization is observed in Baker's (1988) account for [[Applicative voice|applicatives]] and [[Passive voice|passives]] in [[Chewa language|Chichewa]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Incorporation: A theory of grammatical function changing|last = Baker|first = Mark|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above examples attest the ordering of the applicative morpheme and the passive morpheme in Chichewa. In this language, applicatives may be passivized, however, passives can not be made into applicatives. Applying the Mirror Principle to this set of data, we assume that in the underlying deep structure of the syntax, all affixes that occur to the right of the lexical root ''perek'' are projected above this root in the syntax. These affixes are then adjoined to the lexical root via head-movement.

== Alternative accounts for affix ordering ==
Numerous observations in languages are also available, apart from the mirror principle. [[Yupik languages|Yupik]], for example, is able to account for affix order appealing entirely to semantic scope. However, semantic scope and the mirror principle are not mutually exclusive ways to account for affix ordering

Challenges to the Mirror Principle have been offered in analyses of the morpheme orders of [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and [[Cupeño language|Cupeño]] by Harley (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001534/current.pdf|title = Affixation and the Mirror Principle|date = July 19, 2009|accessdate = |website = Lingbuzz|publisher = |last = Harley|first = Heidi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mirza Sahiba''''' ({{lang-pa|ਮਿਰਜ਼ਾ ਸਾਹਿਬਾਂ}}, {{lang|pa|مرزا صاحباں}}, ''{{IAST|mirzā sāhibāṁ}}'') is one of the three popular tragic romances of [[Punjab]]. The other two are ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'', ''[[Sohni Mahiwal]]'' . There are six other popular folklore stories in Punjab: ''[[Momal Rano]]'', [[Sassui Punnhun|Sassi Punhoon]], ''[[Umar Marvi]]'', ''[[LiLa Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'' and ''[[Dhaj, Ror Kumar]]''. These nine tragic romances are popular in Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punjabiworld.com/Creative-Punjab/Legends-of-Punjab/love-legends-of-punjab.html|title=Love Legends In History of Punjab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These six and ''[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]'' are originally from [[Sindh]], and along with ''Sohni Mahiwal'' and ''Sassi Punnun'' are commonly known as Seven Queens ({{lang-sd|ست صورميون}}) of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224737/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are culturally included in both [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] traditions.

''Mirza Sahiba'' was first written by the Punjabi sofi poet Hafiz Barkhudar Ranjha from Tahat Hazara District Sargodha Pakistan. Hafiz Barkhudar was student of a Hakeem family, ancestors of Punjab and do Bait under Hakeem family ancestors. That Hakeem family brought Hafiz Sahab from Tahat Hazara district Sargodha to a place in Sialkot Pakistan named Chitti Sheikhan. Hafiz Sahab lived and died in Chitti Sheikhan.

Mirza Khan was the son of Wanjhal Khan, the leader of the Kharal jat/Rajput Tribe origin in Danabad, a town in the [[Jaranwala]] area of [[Faisalabad]], [[Pakistan]]. Sahiba was the daughter of Mahni, the chief of Khewa, a town in Sial Territory in the [[Jhang]] district, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Mirza_Sahiban|title=Mirza Sahiban - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A long time ago in the village of Kheewa, a town in the control of Sial tribe of [[Jat people|Jats]], a woman gave birth to a baby boy. Unfortunately, the woman died after giving birth and was unable to breastfeed her son. However, another woman nearby had recently given birth to a girl. This woman took it upon herself to help the little boy. She fed this boy as she did her own daughter.

Thus, as is the custom for such occasions, these two children became “milk siblings” because they were given the same milk to drink. Later as the children became adults, the girl, named Fateh Bibi, got married and moved a day’s journey on horseback away to the village of Danababad near present-day Faisalabad. Fateh Bibi married a man named Wanjal, the Sardar of the Kharrals, and they had a strong son named Mirza.

Meanwhile, Fateh Bibi’s milk brother, no longer a boy but a man named Khewa Khan, Sardar of the Sial Jats, had a daughter named Sahiba.

When it was time to enroll the children in school, Mirza’s parents had decided to send him to his “milk uncle’s” house so he could get educated there. Sahiba’s father enrolled her and her “cousin” into classes to learn the Quran together since they were of the same age. 

Mirza did not know that his “cousin” Sahiba was such a beauty one can only dream of beholding. He did not notice her at first when he came to Kheewa to study because they were just children. As the two children grew into adolescence, feelings of love began to blossom between the two. 

One day the adventurous young Mirza took a different path home while walking back from school. There was a bazaar on that street. He saw Sahiba buying some vegetables for her family. He watched as she asked for various squashes and leaves to cook. When the merchant began to weigh her purchases, he weighed out extra because he was lost in her beauty. Mirza, too, was transfixed by her gracefulness and raced all the way home fueled by love.

Mirza became skilled as a horseman and archer as he grew older. He rode on a powerful steed named Bakki who swiftly maneuvered through the land. Mirza was so skillful that every arrow he shot would willfully go exactly where he wanted. Sahiba only grew more and more beautiful with time.

Soon, their love began to blossom. Mirza could not live without his Sahiba. They were lost in their own world. Once, when Sahiba had pronounced her lessons incorrectly, her maulvi beat her with a chimmak.  This thin branch gives a person a burning sting when swatted with it. As Sahiba received her punishment with the chimmak, she spoke to the maulvi. 

Sadly, their days of blissful love did not last. Sahiba’s parents found out about the love affair and sent Mirza back home to his parents. Not too long after that, they arranged Sahiba’s marriage to a man named Tahir Khan. He was from the same town. With Mirza back home, Sahiba’s parents were able to prepare for the wedding without any interruptions. 

Sahiba, via her friend, a Brahmin named Karmu, sent word of her unfortunate marriage to her darling Mirza.  As soon as he heard of this, he made plans to leave.  His family tried to stop him but he would not succumb to their pleas.  He had to go.  Before Mirza left, his father, seeing that there was no other way, went to Mirza and told him that if he went, then he must be sure to return with Sahiba or else it would bring great dishonor. With those words, Wanjal gave his son his blessings to pursue his love.
“Chal, my Bakki,” Mirza, equipped with his bow and arrows, commanded his horse to ride on to the village of Kheewa.

Mirza reached Sahiba on the day of the wedding right before the ceremony was about to proceed. He opened the door to the room Sahiba was waiting in and entered secretly. He admired her; she was dressed in bright red wedding clothes, her delicate hands darkly painted with mehndi. Without waiting another moment, he held her hand and took her away with him on horseback and rode until he thought that they had reached a safe distance.  Tired, he decided to rest by under the shade of a tree while his sweet Sahiba watched over him.

Meanwhile, back at the wedding party, Sahiba brothers called for her to come down to proceed with the ceremonies. When she did not come, her brothers realized that something was wrong. Sahiba’s brothers, the jilted bridegroom, and other male cousins rode on horseback in search for Mirza and Sahiba.

Sahiba, while keeping watch over her slumbering beloved, feared that her brothers would soon catch up. She did not know what to do. If her brothers came and Mirza woke up then her brothers would surely die at the hands of Mirza’s quick arrows.

With the hope of her brothers taking pity on her, Sahiba reached Mirza’s quiver and broke each sharp arrow it contained in half.  She believed that no blood would be spilled this way. Suddenly, Sahiba’s brothers and relatives found the couple under the tree. With one quick shot from Sahiba’s brother’s bow, Mirza awoke to an arrow piercing his throat. Mirza reached for his arrow and saw all the broken pieces. He looked up at Sahiba, searching for an answer in her face but was struck with yet another arrow, this time in the chest. Sahiba threw herself over him and together, they died.

==In popular culture==
The tale of Mirza Sahiban is part of popular [[Punjabi culture]]. There are many folk song versions, including the hit version titled "Mirza" sung by the legendary [[Alam Lohar]]. He was the first main Punjabi singer to bring this story to a song format and had a distinct way of singing it, with extreme vocal strength with Algoza (Jhori) and Chimta in 1941. Since then many other Punjabi singers have followed his style, including [[Noor Jehan]] for the film ''Mirza Jat'', released in 1982.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

There have been various film interpretations of the folk tale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69360">'''Music education''' is a field of study associated with the [[teaching]] and [[learning]] of [[music]].  It touches on all learning domains, including the psychomotor domain (the development of skills), the cognitive domain (the acquisition of knowledge), and, in particular and significant ways, the affective domain (the learner's willingness to receive, internalize, and share what is learned), including [[music appreciation]] and sensitivity.  Music training from preschool through post-secondary education is common in most nations because involvement with music is considered a fundamental component of human [[culture]] and [[human behavior|behavior]]. Cultures from around the world have different approaches to music education, largely due to the varying histories and politics. Studies show that teaching music from other cultures can help students perceive unfamiliar sounds more comfortably, and they also show that musical preference is related to the language spoken by the listener and the other sounds they are exposed to within their own culture.

During the 20th century, many distinctive approaches were developed or further refined for the teaching of music, some of which have had widespread impact. The Dalcroze method ([[eurhythmics]]) was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. The [[Kodály Method]] emphasizes the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. The [[Orff Schulwerk]] "approach" to music education leads students to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music.

The [[Suzuki method]] creates the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language.  Gordon Music Learning Theory provides the music teacher with a method for teaching musicianship through ''[[audiation]]'', Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind ''with understanding''. Conversational Solfège immerses students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American. The Carabo-Cone Method involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard.  The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.&lt;ref name="Madeleine"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED034358&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED034358|title=A Sensory-Motor Approach to Music Learning. Book I - Primary Concepts.|first=Carabo-Cone,|last=Madeleine|date=30 November 1968|website=ed.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular music pedagogy]] is the systematic teaching and learning of [[rock music]] and other forms of [[popular music]] both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Some have suggested that certain musical activities can help to improve breath, body and voice control of a child.&lt;ref&gt;Oaklander, Violet. (2006) Hidden Treasure : A Map to the Child's Inner Self. London,   Karnac Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MMCP]] (Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project) aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving. 

== Overview ==
In [[primary schools]] in [[Western world|European]] countries, children often learn to play instruments such as [[Music keyboard|keyboards]] or [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the elements of music and [[history of music]]. In countries such as [[India]], the [[harmonium]] is used in schools, but instruments like keyboards and violin are also common. Students are normally taught basics of [[Hindustani classical music|Indian Raga music]]. In [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s, students may often have the opportunity to perform in some type of [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[choir]], [[orchestra]], or [[school band]]: [[concert band]], [[marching band]], or [[jazz band]]. In some secondary schools, additional music classes may also be available. In [[junior high school]] or its equivalent, music usually continues to be a required part of the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="HDoM"&gt;Randel, D. (Ed.) (1986). Education in the United States. In '''''The New Harvard Dictionary of Music''''' (pp. 276–278). London/Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[university]] level, students in most arts and humanities programs receive academic credit for music courses such as music history, typically of Western art music, or [[music appreciation]], which focuses on listening and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities offer music ensembles – such as choir, concert band, marching band, or orchestra – that are open to students from various fields of study. Most universities also offer degree programs in music education, certifying students as primary and secondary music educators. Advanced degrees such as the [[D.M.A.]] or the [[Ph.D]] can lead to university employment. These degrees are awarded upon completion of music theory, music history, technique classes, private instruction with a specific instrument, ensemble participation, and in depth observations of experienced educators. Music education departments in North American and European universities also support interdisciplinary research in such areas as [[music psychology]], music education [[historiography]], educational [[ethnomusicology]], [[sociomusicology]], and [[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|philosophy of education]].

The study of western art music is increasingly common in music education outside of North America and Europe, including Asian nations such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of outside the Western art music canon, including [[music of West Africa]], of Indonesia (e.g. [[Gamelan music]]), Mexico (e.g., [[mariachi]] music), Zimbabwe ([[marimba]] music), as well as [[popular music]].

Music education also takes place in individualized, lifelong learning, and in community contexts. Both amateur and professional musicians typically take [[music lessons]], short private sessions with an individual teacher.

==Instructional methodologies==
While instructional strategies are determined by the music teacher and the music [[curriculum]] in his or her area, many teachers rely heavily on one of many instructional [[methodology|methodologies]] that emerged in recent generations and developed rapidly during the latter half of the 20th Century.

===Major international music education methods===

====Dalcroze method====
{{Main|eurhythmics}}
The Dalcroze method was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. The method is divided into three fundamental concepts − the use of [[solfège]], improvisation, and [[eurhythmics]]. Sometimes referred to as "rhythmic gymnastics," eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that engages all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic. According to the Dalcroze method, music is the fundamental language of the human brain and therefore deeply connected to who we are. American proponents of the Dalcroze method include Ruth Alperson, Ann Farber, Herb Henke, Virginia Mead, Lisa Parker, Martha Sanchez, and Julia Schnebly-Black.  Many active teachers of Dalcroze method were trained by Dr. Hilda Schuster who was one of the students of Dalcroze.

====Kodály method====
{{Main|Kodály method}}
[[File:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Curwen's Solfège hand signs. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]
[[Zoltán Kodály]] (1882–1967) was a prominent [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] music educator and composer who stressed the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. Although not really an educational method, his teachings reside within a fun, educational framework built on a solid grasp of basic [[music theory]] and [[music notation]] in various verbal and written forms. Kodály's primary goal was to instill a lifelong love of music in his students and felt that it was the duty of the child's school to provide this vital element of education. Some of Kodály's trademark teaching methods include the use of [[solfège]] hand signs, musical shorthand notation (stick notation), and rhythm [[solmization]] (verbalization). Most countries have used their own folk music traditions to construct their own instruction sequence, but the United States primarily uses the Hungarian sequence. The work of Denise Bacon, Katinka S. Daniel, John Feierabend, Jean Sinor, Jill Trinka, and others brought Kodaly's ideas to the forefront of music education in the United States.

====Orff Schulwerk====
{{Main|Orff Schulwerk}}
[[Carl Orff]] was a prominent German composer. Orff Schulwerk is considered an "approach" to music education. It begins with a student's innate abilities to engage in rudimentary forms of music, using basic rhythms and melodies. Orff considers the whole body a percussive instrument and students are led to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music. The approach fosters student self-discovery, encourages improvisation, and discourages adult pressures and mechanical drill. [[Carl Orff]] developed a special group of instruments, including modifications of the [[glockenspiel]], [[xylophone]], [[metallophone]], [[drum]], and other [[percussion instrument]]s to accommodate the requirements of the Schulwerk courses. Experts in shaping an American-style Orff approach include Jane Frazee, Arvida Steen, and Judith Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/orff-approach-emc/ "Orff Approach"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.  Doreen Hall, Keith Bissell, Emily-Jane Orford. 02/07/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suzuki method====
{{Main|Suzuki method}}
The Suzuki method was developed by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] in Japan shortly after World War II, and uses music education to enrich the lives and [[moral character]] of its students.  The movement rests on the double premise that "all children can be well educated" in music, and that learning to play music at a high level also involves learning certain character traits or virtues which make a person's soul more beautiful.  The primary method for achieving this is centered around creating the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language.  This 'ideal' environment includes love, high-quality examples, praise, rote training and repetition, and a time-table set by the student's developmental readiness for learning a particular technique. While the Suzuki Method is quite popular internationally, within Japan its influence is less significant than the Yamaha Method, founded by [[Genichi Kawakami]] in association with the [[Yamaha Music Foundation]].

===Other notable methods===
In addition to the four major international methods described above, other approaches have been influential. Lesser-known methods are described below:

====Gordon's Music Learning Theory====
{{Main|Gordon Music Learning Theory}}
Edwin Gordon's Music Learning Theory is based on an extensive body of research and field testing by Edwin E. Gordon and others in the larger field of [[Music Learning Theory]]. It provides music teachers with a comprehensive framework for teaching musicianship through [[Gordon Music Learning Theory#audiation|audiation]], Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind with understanding and comprehension when the sound is not physically present.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Azzara, Audiation, Improvisation, and Music Learning Theory. 1991, The Quarterly, 2(1–2), 106–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of instructions is Discrimination Learning and Inference Learning. Discrimination Learning, the ability to determine whether two elements are the same or not the same using aural/oral, verbal association, partial synthesis, symbolic association, and composite synthesis. Inference Learning, students take an active role in their own education and learn to identify, create, and improvise unfamiliar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Willie J. |title=Gordon's Music Learning on Piano |url=https://pianoin21days.com/how-to-play-piano/ |website=PI21 |publisher=Owensboro |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills and content sequences within the Audiation theory help music teachers establish sequential curricular objectives in accord with their own teaching styles and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giml.org/home.php GIML: The Gordon Institute for Music Learning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824082226/http://www.giml.org/home.php |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There also is a Learning Theory for Newborns and Young Children in which the Types and Stages of Preparatory Audiation are outlined.

====World Music Pedagogy====
The growth of cultural diversity within school-age populations prompted music educators from the 1960s onward to diversify the music curriculum, and to work with ethnomusicologists and artist-musicians to establish instructional practices rooted in musical traditions.  'World music pedagogy' was coined by [[Patricia Shehan Campbell]] to describe world music content and practice in elementary and secondary school music programs.  Pioneers of the movement, especially Barbara Reeder Lundquist, William M. Anderson, and Will Schmid, influenced a second generation of music educators (including J. Bryan Burton, Mary Goetze, Ellen McCullough-Brabson, and Mary Shamrock) to design and deliver curricular models to music teachers of various levels and specializations. The pedagogy advocates the use of human resources, i.e., "culture-bearers," as well as deep and continued listening to archived resources such as those of Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Teaching Music Globally (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conversational Solfège====
Influenced by both the Kodály method and Gordon's Music Learning Theory, Conversational Solfège was developed by Dr. John M. Feierabend, former chair of music education at the [[Hartt School]], [[University of Hartford]].  The program begins by immersing students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American.  Music is seen as separate from, and more fundamental than, notation.  In twelve learning stages, students move from hearing and singing music to decoding and then creating music using spoken syllables and then standard written notation. Rather than implementing the Kodály method directly, this method follows Kodály's original instructions and builds on America's own folk songs instead of on Hungarian folk songs.

==== Carabo-Cone Method ====
This early-childhood approach, sometimes referred to as the Sensory-Motor Approach to Music, was developed by the violinist Madeleine Carabo-Cone.  This approach involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard.  The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.&lt;ref name="Madeleine"/&gt;

====Popular Music Pedagogy====
{{Main|Popular music pedagogy}}
'Popular music pedagogy' — alternatively called rock music pedagogy, modern band, popular music education, or rock music education — is a recent development in music education consisting of the systematic teaching and learning of [[rock music]] and other forms of [[popular music]] both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Popular music pedagogy tends to emphasize group improvisation,&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee and Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Free to be Musical: Group Improvisation in Music (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and is more commonly associated with community music activities than fully institutionalized school music ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee, Community Music: In Theory and in Practice (Oxford University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MMCP ====
{{Main|MMCP}}
The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project was developed in 1965 as a response to declining student interest in school music. This creative approach aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving.  Rather than imparting factual knowledge, this method centers around the student, who learns through investigation, experimentation, and discovery.  The teacher gives a group of students a specific problem to solve together and allows freedom to create, perform, improvise, conduct, research, and investigate different facets of music in a spiral curriculum. MMCP is viewed as the forerunner to projects in creative music composition and improvisation activities in schools.

==History of music education in the United States==

===18th century===
After the preaching of Reverend Thomas Symmes, the first singing school was created in 1717 in [[Boston]]  for the purposes of improving singing and music reading in the church. These singing schools gradually spread throughout the colonies.  Music education continued to flourish with the creation of the Academy of Music in Boston. Reverend John Tufts published ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes Using Non-Traditional Notation'' which is regarded as the first music textbook in the colonies. Between 1700 and 1820, more than 375 tune books would be published by such authors as Samuel Holyoke, Francis Hopkinson, William Billings, and Oliver Holden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201838/http://www.bsu.edu/classes/bauer/hpmused/colonial.html The Colonial Period: 1600-1800] - Timeline: Music Education History/Philosophy (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

Music began to spread as a curricular subject into other school districts. Soon after music expanded to all grade levels and the teaching of music reading was improved until the music curriculum grew to include several activities in addition to music reading. By the end of 1864 public school music had spread throughout the country.

===19th century===
In 1832, [[Lowell Mason]] and George Webb formed the [[Boston Academy of Music]] with the purposes of teaching singing and theory as well as methods of teaching music.  Mason published his ''Manuel of Instruction'' in 1834 which was based upon the music education works of Pestalozzian System of Education founded by Swiss educator [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].  This handbook gradually became used by many singing school teachers. From 1837–1838, the Boston School Committee allowed Lowell Mason to teach music in the Hawes School as a demonstration.  This is regarded as the first time music education was introduced to public schools in the United States.  In 1838 the Boston School Committee approved the inclusion of music in the curriculum and Lowell Mason became the first recognized supervisor of elementary music.  In later years [[Luther Whiting Mason]] became the Supervisor of Music in Boston and spread music education into all levels of public education (grammar, primary, and high school).  During the middle of the 19th century, Boston became the model to which many other cities across the United States included and shaped their public school music education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Martha Chrisman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3344928 "Portrait of a Nineteenth-Century School Music Program"], Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Summer, 1990), pp. 79–89, MENC: The National Association for Music Education&lt;/ref&gt; Music methodology for teachers as a course was first introduced in the [[Normal School]] in Potsdam. The concept of classroom teachers in a school that taught music under the direction of a music supervisor was the standard model for public school music education during this century. (See also: ''[[Music education in the United States]]'') While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, "later, it was accepted that [[Women in music|women would have a role in music education]], and they became involved in this field...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;

===Early 20th century===
In the United States, teaching colleges with four-year degree programs developed from the Normal Schools and included music.  [[Oberlin Conservatory]] first offered the Bachelor of Music Education degree. Osbourne G. McCarthy, an American music educator, introduced details for studying music for credit in Chelsea High School.  Notable events in the history of music education in the early 20th century also include:
* Founding of the Music Supervisor's National Conference (changed to Music Educators National Conference in 1934, later [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]] in 1998, and currently [http://nafme.org/ The National Association for Music Education – NAfME]) in [[Keokuk, Iowa]] in 1907.
* Rise of the school band and orchestra movement leading to performance oriented school music programs.
* Growth in music [[method (music)|methods]] publications.
* [[Frances Elliot Clark]] develops and promotes phonograph record libraries for school use.
* [[Carl Seashore]] and his ''Measures of Musical Talent'' music aptitude test starts testing people in music.

Music course offerings and even entire degree programs in [[online music education]] developed in the first decade of the 21st century at various institutions, and the fields of [[world music pedagogy]] and [[popular music pedagogy]] have also seen notable expansion.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, social aspects of teaching and learning music came to the fore. This emerged as praxial music education,&lt;ref&gt;http://bern.library.nenu.edu.cn/upload/soft/0000/11.1goble{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[1].pdf&lt;/ref&gt; critical theory,&lt;ref&gt;http://users.rider.edu/~vrme/v6n1/visions/Regelski%20Critical%20Theory%20as%20a%20Foundation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/1461380032000182849 | volume=6 | title=Feminist theory in music education research: grrl‐illa games as nomadic practice (or how music education fell from grace) | journal=Music Education Research | pages=67–79| year=2007 | last1=Gould | first1=Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of importance are the colloquia and journals of the MayDay Group, "an international think tank of music educators that aims to identify, critique, and change taken-for-granted patterns of professional activity, polemical approaches to method and philosophy, and educational politics and public pressures that threaten effective practice and critical communication in music education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maydaygroup.org/about-us/|title=About the MayDay Group – Mayday Group|author=|date=|website=www.maydaygroup.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a new focus on social aspects of music education, scholars have analyzed critical aspects such as music and race,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bradley5_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; gender,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Lamb3_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0027432112442944 | volume=98 | issue=4 | title=Social Class and School Music | journal=Music Educators Journal | pages=33–37| year=2012 | last1=Bates | first1=Vincent C }}&lt;/ref&gt; institutional belonging,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Froehlich6_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bates10_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Institutional music education was started in colonial India by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] after he founded the [[Visva-Bharati University]]. At present, most universities have a faculty of music with some universities specially dedicated to fine arts such as [[Indira Kala Sangeet University]], [[Swathi Thirunal College of Music]] or [[Rabindra Bharati University]].[[Indian classical music]] is based on the [[Guru Shishya parampara|gurushyshyaparampara]] system. The [[teacher]], known as [[Guru]], transmit the musical knowledge to the student, or shyshya. This is still the main system used in [[India]] to transmit musical knowledge. Although European art music became popularized in schools throughout much of the world during the twentieth century (East Asia, Latin America, Oceania, Africa), India remains one of the few highly populated nations in which non-European indigenous music traditions have consistently received relatively greater emphasis. That said, there is certainly much western influence in the popular music associated with [[Bollywood]] film scores.

==Africa==
The [[South African Department of Education]] and the ILAM Music Heritage Project SA teach African music using western musical framework. ILAM's ''Listen and Learn'' for students 11–14 is "unique" in teaching curriculum requirements for western music using recordings of traditional African music.&lt;ref&gt;''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' ed. Jonathan McCollum and [[David G. Hebert]], p.325&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time that Africa was colonized up to 1994, indigenous music and arts being taught in schools was a rare occurrence. The African National Congress (ANC) attempted to repair the neglect of indigenous knowledge and the overwhelming emphasis on written musical literacy in schools. It is not well known that the learning of indigenous music actually has a philosophy and teaching procedure that is different from western “formal” training. It involves the whole community because indigenous songs are about the history of its people. After the colonization of Africa, music became more centered on Christian beliefs and European folk songs, rather than the more improvised and fluid indigenous music.  Before the major changes education went through from 1994 to 2004, during the first decade of the democratic government, teachers were trained as classroom teachers and told that they would have to incorporate music into other subject areas. The few colleges with teaching programs that included instrumental programs held a greater emphasis on music theory, history of western music, western music notation, and less on making music. Up until 1999, most college syllabi did not include training in indigenous South African Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=Anri|last2=de Wet|first2=Jacques|last3=Rijsdijk|first3=Susan|title=A Survey of Music Education in the Primary Schools of South Africa's Cape Peninsula|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|date=2005|volume=53|issue=3|pages=260–283|doi=10.2307/3598684|jstor=3598684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In African cultures music is seen as a community experience and is used for social and religious occasions. As soon as children show some sign of being able to handle music or a musical instrument they are allowed to participate with the adults of the community in musical events. Traditional songs are more important to many people because they are stories about the histories of the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nketia|first1=J. H. Kwabena|title=Music Education in Africa and the West: We Can Learn from Each Other|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=1970|volume=57|issue=3|pages=48–55|doi=10.2307/3392906|jstor=3392906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South America==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Among the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas, music was used in ceremonies and rituals to teach the history of their civilizations and was also used for worship. The Aztec people were mainly educated by their priests. Music remained an important way to teach religion and history and was taught by priests for many centuries.  When Spain and Portugal colonized parts of South America, music started to be influenced by European ideas and qualities. Several priests of European descent, such as Antonio Sepp, taught European systems of music notation and theory based on their knowledge of playing instruments throughout the 1700-1800s. Since music was taught to the general public by rote, very few knew how to read music other than those who played instruments until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  The development of music in South America mainly followed that of European development. Choirs were formed to sing masses, chants, psalms, but secular music also became more prevalent in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Couve|first1=Alicia C.|last2=Pino|first2=Claudia Dal|last3=Frega|first3=Ana Lucía|title=An Approach to the History of Music Education in Latin America|jstor=40214944|journal=The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education|pages=10–39|doi=10.2307/40214944|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music education in Latin America today has large emphasis on folk music, masses, and orchestral music. Many classrooms teach their choirs to sing in their native language as well as in English. Several Latin American Schools, specifically in Puerto Rico and Haiti, believe music to be an important subject and are working on expanding their programs. Outside of school, many communities form their own musical groups and organizations. Community performances are very popular with the local audiences. There are a few well-known Latin American choral groups, such as "El Coro de Madrigalistas" from Mexico. This famous choral group tours around Mexico, showing students around the country what a professional choral ensemble sounds like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawler|first1=Vanett|title=Music Education in Fourteen Latin-American Republics|jstor=3386758|journal=Music Educators Journal|pages=20–30|doi=10.2307/3386758|date=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-Cultural Music Education==
The music, languages, and sounds we are exposed to within our own cultures determine our tastes in music and affect the way we perceive the music of other cultures. Many studies have shown distinct differences in the preferences and abilities of musicians from around the world. One study attempted to view the distinctions between the musical preferences of English and Japanese speakers, providing both groups of people with the same series of tones and rhythms. The same type of study was done for English and French speakers. Both studies suggested that the language spoken by the listener determined which groupings of tones and rhythms were more appealing, based on the inflections and natural rhythm groupings of their language.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bicknell|first1=Jeanette|title=Cross-Cultural Research and the Nature of Music|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-music-moves-us/201303/cross-cultural-research-and-the-nature-music|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study had Europeans and Africans try to tap along with certain rhythms. European rhythms are regular and built on simple ratios, while African rhythms are typically based on irregular ratios. While both groups of people could perform the rhythms with European qualities, the European group struggled with the African rhythms. This has to do with the ubiquity of complex polyrhythm in African culture and their familiarity with this type of sound.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

While each culture has its own musical qualities and appeals, incorporating cross-cultural curricula in our music classrooms can help teach students how to better perceive music from other cultures. Studies show that learning to sing folk songs or popular music of other cultures is an effective way to understand a culture as opposed to merely learning about it. If music classrooms discuss the musical qualities and incorporate styles from other cultures, such as the Brazilian roots of the Bossa Nova, the Afro-Cuban clave, and African drumming, it will expose students to new sounds and teach them how to compare their cultures’ music to the different music and start to make them more comfortable with exploring sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilari|first1=Beatriz|last2=Chen-Hafteck|first2=Lily|last3=Crawford|first3=Lisa|title=Singing and cultural understanding: A music education perspective|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0255761413487281|website=International Journal of Music Education|pages=202–216|language=en|doi=10.1177/0255761413487281|date=1 May 2013|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and assessment==
Achievement standards are curricular statements used to guide educators in determining objectives for their teaching. Use of standards became a common practice in many nations during the 20th century. For much of its existence, the curriculum for music education in the United States was determined locally or by individual teachers. In recent decades there has been a significant move toward adoption of regional and/or national standards. [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]], created nine voluntary content standards, called the ''National Standards for Music Education''.{{ref|standardfoot}} These standards call for:
# [[Singing]], alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# [[Performing]] on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# [[Improvising]] melodies, variations, and accompaniments.
# [[Musical composition|Composing]] and arranging music within specified guidelines.
# [[Reading (activity)|Reading]] and notating music.
# Listening to, analyzing, and describing music.
# Evaluating music and music performances.
# Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts.
# Understanding music in relation to history and culture.

Many states and school districts have adopted their own standards for music education.

==Integration with other subjects==
[[File:2013 Orgelkids Doe-orgel pijpen plaatsen.jpg|thumb|200px|Children in primary school are assembling a do-organ of [[Orgelkids]]]]
Some schools and organizations promote integration of arts classes, such as music, with other subjects, such as math, science, or English, believing that integrating the different curricula will help each subject to build off of one another, enhancing the overall quality of education.

One example is the [[Kennedy Center]]'s "Changing Education Through the Arts" program. CETA defines arts integration as finding a natural connection(s) between one or more art forms (dance, drama/theater, music, visual arts, storytelling, puppetry, and/or creative writing) and one or more other curricular areas (science, social studies, English language arts, mathematics, and others) in order to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surfaquarium.com/ceta.htm CETA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512034843/http://www.surfaquarium.com/ceta.htm |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]] has funded three projects that use music to support language learning. Lullabies of Europe (for pre-school and early learners),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lullabies-of-europe.org/ Lullabies of Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; FolkDC (for primary),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkdc.eu/|title=home|author=|date=11 February 2011|website=folkdc.eu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recent PopuLLar (for secondary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/PopuLLar-Music-and-Language-Learning/181858685219155|title=PopuLLar - Music and Language Learning|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ARTinED project is also using music for all subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artined.eu/home.html|title=ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts|author=|date=|website=www.artined.eu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===

A number of researchers and music education advocates have argued that studying music enhances [[academic achievement]],&lt;ref&gt;"Multiple studies link music study to academic achievement." [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/is-music-the-key-to-success.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB&amp;_r=0 Joanne Lipman, New York Times]. October 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; such as William Earhart, former president of the Music Educators National Conference, who claimed that "Music enhances knowledge in the areas of mathematics, science, geography, history, foreign language, physical education, and vocational training."&lt;ref name="Morrison, Steven J 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Steven J | year = 1994 | title = Music students and academic growth | url = | journal = Music Educators Journal | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 33–36 | doi=10.2307/3398812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the University of Wisconsin suggested that students with piano or keyboard experience performed 34% higher on tests that measure spatial-temporal lobe activity, which is the part of the brain that is used when doing mathematics, science, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rauscher | first1 = F. | last2 = Zupan | first2 = M.A. | year = 2000 | title = Classroom Keyboard Instruction Improves Kindergarten Children's Spatial-Temporal Performance: A Field Experiment | url = | journal = Early Childhood Research Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 215–228 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2006(00)00050-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment by Wanda T. Wallace setting text to melody suggested that some music may aid in text recall.&lt;ref name="Wallace, W. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallace | first1 = W | year = 1994 | title = Memory for music: Effect of melody on recall of text | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1471–1485 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.6.1471}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created a three verse song with a non-repetitive melody; each verse with different music.  A second experiment created a three verse song with a repetitive melody; each verse had exactly the same music.  A third experiment studied text recall without music.  She found the repetitive music produced the highest amount of text recall, suggesting music can serve as a mnemonic device.&lt;ref name="Wallace, W. 1994"/&gt;

Smith (1985) studied background music with word lists.  One experiment involved memorizing a word list with background music; participants recalled the words 48 hours later.  Another experiment involved memorizing a word list with no background music; participants also recalled the words 48 hours later.  Participants who memorized word lists with background music recalled more words demonstrating music provides contextual cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = S | year = 1985 | title = Background music and context-dependent memory | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 4| pages = 591–603 | doi=10.2307/1422512| jstor = 1422512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing studies that support music education's involvement in intellectual development and academic achievement, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring that: "Music education enhances intellectual development and enriches the academic environment for children of all ages; and Music educators greatly contribute to the artistic, intellectual and social development of American children and play a key role in helping children to succeed in school."&lt;ref&gt;(H. Res. 266)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobbett (1990) suggests that most public school music programs have not changed since their inception at the turn of the last century. "…the educational climate is not conducive to their continuance as historically conceived and the social needs and habits of people require a completely different kind of band program."&lt;ref&gt;Bobbett, G. C. (1990). Rural Appalachian Band Directors' Academic Preparation: Musical Preparation, Facilities, Monetary Resources, and Methods of Student Evaluation, and Their Students' Musical Independence. [S.l.]: Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse.&lt;/ref&gt;    A 2011 study conducted by Kathleen M. Kerstetter for the Journal of Band Research found that increased non-musical graduation requirements, block scheduling, increased number of non-traditional programs such as magnet schools, and the testing emphases created by the No Child Left Behind Act are only some of the concerns facing music educators. Both teachers and students are under increased time restrictions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerstetter | first1 = Kathleen M | year = 2011 | title = Investigating High School Band Recruitment Procedures Using Educational Marketing Principles | url = | journal = Journal of Band Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Patricia Powers states, "It is not unusual to see program cuts in the area of music and arts when economic issues surface.  It is indeed unfortunate to lose support in this area especially since music and the art programs contribute to society in many positive ways." &lt;ref name="Morrison, Steven J 1994" /&gt; Comprehensive music education programs average $187 per pupil, according to a 2011 study funded by the national Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fermanich | first1 = M. L. | year = 2011 | title = Money for music education: a district analysis of the how, what, and where of spending for music education | url = | journal = Journal of Education Finance | volume = 37 | issue = 2| page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas Commission on Drugs and Alcohol Abuse Report noted that students who participated in band or orchestra reported the lowest lifetime and current use of all substances including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmusicworkshop.com/advocacy/benefits.html|title=Benefits of Music Education - How do students benefit from music?|author=|date=|website=childrensmusicworkshop.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-musical benefits===
Studies have shown that music education can be used to enhance cognitive achievement in students. In the United States an estimated 30% of students struggle with reading, while 17% are reported as having a specific learning disability linked to reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Register | first1 = D. | last2 = Darrow | first2 = A.A | last3 = Swedberd | first3 = O. | last4 = Standley | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The use of music to enhance reading skills of second grade students and students with reading disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1093/jmt/44.1.23| pmid = 17419662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using intensive music curriculum as an intervention paired alongside regular classroom activities, research shows that students involved with the music curriculum show increases in reading comprehension, word knowledge, vocabulary recall, and word decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Register | first1 = D. | last2 = Darrow | first2 = A.A | last3 = Swedberd | first3 = O. | last4 = Standley | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The use of music to enhance reading skills of second grade students and students with reading disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 23–37 | pmid = 17419662 | doi=10.1093/jmt/44.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student is singing a melody with text, they are using multiple areas of their brain to multitask. Music effects language development, increases IQ, spatial-temporal skills, and improves test scores. Music education has also shown to improve the skills of dyslexic children in similar areas as mentioned earlier by focusing on visual auditory and fine motor skills as strategies to combat their disability.&lt;ref&gt;Overy, K. (2000). Dyslexia, temporal processing and music: The potential of music as an early learning aid for dyslexic children. Psychology of Music 28(2). 218–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Since research in this area is sparse, we cannot convincingly conclude these findings to be true, however the results from research done do show a positive impact on both students with learning difficulties and those who are not diagnosed. Further research will need to be done, but the positive engaging way of bringing music into the classroom cannot be forgotten, and the students generally show a positive reaction to this form of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butzlaff | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = Can music be used to teach reading? | url = | journal = The Journal of Aesthetic Education | volume = 34 | issue = 3/4| pages = 167–178 | doi=10.2307/3333642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music education has also been noted to have the ability to increase someones overall IQ, especially in children during peak development years.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schellenberg | first1 = E.G. | year = 2004 | title = Music lessons enhance IQ | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 511–514 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spacial ability, verbal memory, reading and mathematic ability are seen to be increased alongside music education (primarily through the learning of an instrument).&lt;ref name="Schellenberg"/&gt; Researchers also note that a correlation between general attendance and IQ increases is evident, and due to students involvement in music education, general attendance rates increase along with their IQ.

Fine motor skills, social behaviours, and emotional well being can also be increased through music and music education. The learning of an instrument increases fine motor skills in students with physical disabilities. Emotional well being can be increased as students find meaning in songs and connect them to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosacki | first1 = S. | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Early adolescents' emotional perceptions and engagement with popular music activities in everyday life | url = | journal = International Journal of Adolescence and Youth | volume =  20| issue = 2| pages =  228–244| doi = 10.1080/02673843.2013.785438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through social interactions of playing in groups like jazz and concert bands, students learn to socialize and this can be linked to emotional and mental well being.

===Music advocacy===
In some communities – and even entire national education systems – music is provided little support as an academic subject area, and music teachers feel that they must actively seek greater public endorsement for music education as a legitimate subject of study. This perceived need to change public opinion has resulted in the development of a variety of approaches commonly called "music advocacy". Music advocacy comes in many forms, some of which are based upon legitimate scholarly arguments and scientific findings, while other examples controversially rely on emotion, anecdotes, or unconvincing data.

Recent high-profile music advocacy projects include the "[[Mozart Effect]]", the [[National Anthem Project]], and the movement in  [[World Music Pedagogy]] (also known as  [[Cultural Diversity in Music Education]]) which seeks out means of equitable pedagogy across students regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic circumstance.  The Mozart effect is particularly controversial as while the initial study suggested listening to Mozart positively impacts [[spatial-temporal reasoning]], later studies either failed to replicate the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F | year = 1999 | title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 400 | issue = 6747| pages = 826–827 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid = 10476958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = Kenneth M. | last2 = Bass | first2 = Karen E. | last3 = Crook | first3 = Melissa D. | year = 1999 | title = The Mystery of the Mozart Effect: Failure to Replicate | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 366–369 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;Rudi Črnčec, Sarah J. Wilson and Margot Prior, "No Evidence for the Mozart Effect in Children," ''Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Vol. 23, No. 4 (2006): 305–318. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/mp.2006.23.4.305]&lt;/ref&gt; or suggested the music of Mozart could be substituted for any music children enjoy in a term called "enjoyment arousal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Schellenberg | first2 = E.G. | last3 = Husain | first3 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Mood, arousal, and the Mozart effect | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 248–251 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggested that even if listening to Mozart may temporarily enhance a student's spatial-temporal abilities, learning to play an instrument is much more likely to improve student performance and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;(Rauscher, F. H., &amp; Hinton, S. C. (2006). The Mozart Effect: Music Listening is Not Music Instruction. Educational Psychologist, 41(4), 233–238.  Abstract: This paper clarifies the position of the author's earlier works.)&lt;/ref&gt; Educators similarly criticized the [[National Anthem Project]] not only for promoting the educational use of music as a tool for non-musical goals, but also for its links to [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Bradley, "Oh That Magic Feeling! Multicultural Human Subjectivity, Community, and Fascism's Footprints," ''Philosophy of Music Education Review,'' Vol. 17, No. 1 (2009): 56, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary music scholars assert that effective music advocacy uses empirically sound arguments that transcend political motivations and personal agendas. [[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|Music education philosophers]] such as [[Bennett Reimer]], [[Estelle Jorgensen]], [[David J. Elliott]], [[John Paynter (composer)|John Paynter]], and [[Keith Swanwick]] support this view, yet many music teachers and music organizations and schools do not apply this line of reasoning into their music advocacy arguments. Researchers such as [[Ellen Winner]] conclude that arts advocates have made bogus claims to the detriment of defending the study of music,&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Wu, "Entrepreneurship in Research: Ellen Winner on Why We Need the Arts," ''Entrepreneurship Review,'' (2013): [2 http://miter.mit/edu/ellen-winner-on-why-we-need-the-arts/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]&lt;/ref&gt; her research debunking claims that music education improves math, for example.&lt;ref name="David J 2015"&gt;David J.

Elliott and Marissa Silverman, Music Matters, A Philosophy of Music Education, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; these actions recognizing that music and music-making are inherent to human culture and behavior, distinguishing humans from other species.&lt;ref name="Yudkin, J. 2008 p. 4"&gt;Yudkin, J.

==Role of women==

While music critics argued in the 1880s that "...[[Women in music|women]] [composers] lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php|title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1|author=|date=|website=parlorsongs.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in music education, and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;"Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences. A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination."

After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers|title=A historical view of women in music education careers|first=|last=bigbadbariguru|date=5 July 2012|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12429">Throughout the years, the Cuban nation has developed a wealth of musicological material created by numerous investigators and experts on this subject.

==Early 20th century==

Apart from the work of some authors who provided information about the music in Cuba during the 19th century, that was usually included in chronicles covering a more general subject, the first investigations and studies specifically dedicated to the musical art and practice did not appear in Cuba until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="valdes"&gt;Valdés Cantero, Alicia, Determined women ready to succeed. The ''International Journal of Cuban Studies'', 2 December 2008. http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/i18088_3.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, musicological research and documentation in Cuba was not undertaken by professionals fully dedicated to that subject, but instead it was conducted by historians, ethnologists or composers such as polymath [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] (b. 1881) or composer [[Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes]] (b. 1874). The controversy sustained by these distinguished personalities in reference to the possible African (or indigenous) roots of Cuban music spanned several decades, from the 1930s to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando. Africanía de la Música Folklórica de Cuba. Editora Universitaria, La Habana, Cuba. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another important personality, María Muñoz (b. 1886), a Galician pianist, professor and choir conductor that graduated at the Madrid Conservatory under the guidance of Manuel de Falla, developed an outstanding musical activity in Cuba. Together with her husband Antonio Quevedo, she co-founded the Society of Contemporary Music in 1929, promoted the cultural journal “Musicalia” and founded the Havana Choral Society.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P.145&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Fernando Ortiz, she gave summer courses on musicology at the [[Havana University]] from the 1930s. Those courses nurtured and stimulated the careers of some future outstanding musicologists such as [[María Teresa Linares Savio]] (b. 1920).&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;

One of the earliest contribution to musicological studies in [[Cuba]] was provided by Emilio Grenet, brother of the famous Cuban composer [[Eliseo Grenet]].
 
Emilio Grenet was born in [[Havana]] in 1901 and passed away in the same city, in 1941. He studied [[Sight-reading]] and [[Music theory]] with professor Armando Laguardia and worked as a pianist in [[New York City]] in 1923. After returning to Cuba he traveled to Spain where he met composer [[Joaquín Turina]] who introduced him to his professor of [[Harmony]], [[Conrado del Campo]].

Grenet returned again to [[Cuba]] where he worked in the Education Ministry Radio Station, started his investigations about the genres of Cuban popular music and travelled to [[New York City]] to record with the orchestra of his brother [[Eliseo Grenet]]. He taught [[Musical composition]] to the renowned Cuban conductor Enrique González Mántici and [[Harmony]] to the composer and guitarist Vicente González Rubiera ([[Guyún]]).

In 1939, Grenet published his important work "Cuban popular music", which represented a serious study of the Cuban popular music genres, and a thorough insight into the most important aspects of the musical creation in [[Cuba]], from the 19th Century until that time. The book also included 80 scores of representative compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Grenet. EcuRed: https://www.ecured.cu/Emilio_Grenet. Retrieved: 07-30-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1940s and 1950s==

[[File:Alejocarpentier.jpg|thumb|right|100px|&lt;center&gt;Alejo Carpentier.]]
In 1946, the famous Cuban writer, art critic and musicologist [[Alejo Carpentier]] (b. 104) established a benchmark with his work “La música en Cuba” (1946), an attempt to put together a comprehensive history of Cuban music from the 16th century until his time. Although the work presented as facts some controversial historical issues, such as the origins of the well known “Son de la Mateodora” and the “Cuban Contradanza”, this important study (based on extensive investigations conducted by Carpentier) offered a deep insight into Cuban music history never witnessed before.
 
Coincidentally, young composers and musicologists such as [[Argeliers León]] (b. 1918) and Hilario González (b. 1920) were diligently working along with [[José Ardévol]]  at “Grupo de Renovación Musical” to improve and renovate  the Cuban musical panorama.&lt;ref&gt;EcuRed. Grupo de Renovación Musical. http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/Grupo_de_Renovaci%C3%B3n_Musical&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, [[Argeliers León]] continued offering the musicology summer courses started by María Muñoz and [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] at the Havana University and served as a professor of such prominent students as pianist and professor Ana Margarita Aguilera Ripoll (b. 1903), author of the important compilation of children songs “Cancionero Infantil de Hispanoamérica.” Other contemporary Cuban musicologists were María Antonieta Henriquez, founder of the National Museum of Music, and [[Lydia Cabrera]], an anthropologist renowned for her studies of Afro-Cuban music.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;

==Post revolutionary period (1959)==

After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Pablo Hernández Balaguer (b. 1928) was teaching musicology at the Oriente University, an educational institution that offered the first Music Degree in the history of Cuba. Balaguer conducted an important study about the work of composer Esteban Salas and published the Music Catalog from the archives of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral. He was a professor of several distinguished musicologists such as Virtudes Feliú Herrera (b. 1941), who conducted a thorough research into Cuban historical ritual and festive traditions. Her work has been compiled in the “Ethnographic Atlas of Cuba,” which received an award from the Cuban Academy of Science.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;


[[Argeliers León]] and his wife María Teresa Linares were the leading figures of Cuban musicology during the early decades after the Cuban Revolution (1959). Between 1961 and 1970, León was de director of the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences of Cuba and he also headed the Folklore Department at the National Theater of Cuba, the Music Department of the José Martí National Library and the Music Department at Casa de Las Américas. He served as professor at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, taught African cultures in Cuba at the Havana University and musicology at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). As a musicologist he published several books which included Del Canto y el Tiempo (1974), where he proposed a subdivision in “generic complexes” to study the musical styles in Cuba.&lt;ref name="orovio"&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

María Teresa Linares conducted extensive investigation on several areas of Cuban music history and published numerous books and articles. She worked as a professor at the Alejandro García Caturla Conservatory, the Havana University and the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences. Until year 2000 she was the director of the Museum of Music, and at a later time she was affiliated to the Fernando Ortiz Foundation.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

During the first decade of the Cuban Revolution (1960 to 1970) an emerging generation of musicologists started to acquire recognition within the Cuban musical scene. We should mention, in first place, two humble and dedicated investigators that had certain common characteristics. They both had university backgrounds and worked for many years at the José Martí National Library as researchers; also their main subjects of investigation were somewhat related to the musicological work of Alejo Carpentier. Alberto Muguercia (b. 19280), a lawyer from Santiago de Cuba holds the honor of having refuted one of the greatest myths in the history of Cuban music: The “Son de la Ma Teodora” origins. In his famous book “La música en Cuba”, Alejo Carpentier categorically attributed a 16th-century origin to a popular melody called Son de la Ma Teodora without conducting a thorough investigation about the subject, thus establishing an erroneous fact as a popular tradition.  In a brilliant article about this subject: “Teodora Ginés: ¿Mito o realidad histórica? Muguercia demonstrated the inaccuracy of this theory.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

In turn, Zolia Lapique (b. 1930), a librarian and historian, refuted a theory formulated by Carpentier in reference to the French-Haitian origin of the “Contradanza Cubana”. She attributed an earlier development and other possible origins (Spanish and English) to this musical style in her outstanding article: “Aportes Franco-Haitianos a la contradanza cubana: mitos y realidades.”  &lt;ref&gt;Giro, Radamés. Panorama de la Música Popular Cubana. Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1995. P. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members of this generation are: Cristóbal Díaz Ayala (b. 1930), author of a complete Cuban music discography, Jorge Ibarra (b. 1931), Leonardo Acosta (b. 1933), Dulcila Cañizares (b. 1936), Raul Martínez Rodríguez (b. 1937), Helio Orovio (b. 1938), Radamés Giro (b. 1940), [[Danilo Orozco]] (b. 1944) and Alberto Faya (1944).&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

==The second generation (1970s) and beyond==

The members of the second generation of Cuban musicologists that appeared during the Cuban Revolution period, graduated in their great majority either from the Havana Municipal Conservatory or the [[Instituto Superior de Arte]] (ISA), which from 1976 offered the first Musicology Degree in the history of Cuba. Many of them worked at a later time at the newly created Centro para la investigación y desarrollo de la música cubana (CIDMUC), founded in 1978.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;
From this group we should mention two renowned musicologists that frequently worked in collaboration with each other: Victoria Elí (b. 1945) and Zoila Gómez (b. 1948). We should also mention Tamahra Martín (b. 1945), who dedicated two books to the Cuban choral music: “La música coral en Cuba” (1987) and “Música Coral” (1990).

[[File:Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández, musicólogo, violonchelista y profesor cubano.]]
Two other important musicologists from this generation are: [[Alberto Alén Pérez]]  (b. 1948) and [[Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández]] (b. 1947). Alberto Alén applied his extensive knowledge of psychology and statistics to musical form analysis as well as music pedagogy, in publications such as: “La forma de las formas musicales” and “Diagnosticar la musicalidad”. Rolando Pérez developed extensive investigations about Afro-Cuban music and is well known for having documented and analyzed the process of transition from ternary rhythms to binary rhythms of the Cuban and Latin American popular music, during the 18th and 19th centuries, in his book: “Proceso de binarización de los ritmos ternarios africanos en América Latina (1987).”&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

Olavo Alén (b. 1947) has closely followed the steps of Argeliers León in his studies of Afro-Cuban music and, most importantly, has elaborated and expanded León's theory of “generic complexes”, in works such as: “Géneros de la música cubana” from 1976.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt; 

Those theories have been strongly refuted by other musicologists such as Leonardo Acosta, who explains in his article “De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones”: 

{{Cita|“Fortunately, the theology [sic] of generic complexes has been viewed with skepticism in musicological circles of several countries, including Cuba, where quite a few musicologists have oscillated [in his opinion]&lt;ref&gt;Note by the editor.&lt;/ref&gt;between rejection, disbelief and disdain …” &lt;ref&gt;Acosta, Leonardo. De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones. Clave. Publicación del Instituto Cubano de la Música. Año 4, No. 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Other members of this Group are renowned musicologists Martha Ezquenazi (1949), Jesús Gómez Cairo (1949) and Dora Ileana Torres (1956).

'''O2 Global Network''' ('''O2 International Network for Sustainable Design''', stylized as '''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Global Network''') is an [[international]] network for people interested in [[sustainable design]]. The [[Social network|network]] is made up of the O2 Global Network foundation, [[regional]] hubs, local groups, [[wikt:liaison|liaison]]s and individuals (called O2's). It has currently more than 70 country contacts.

==History==
O2 ("[[Oxygen]]") was founded in 1988 in [[Milan]] by Niels Peter Flint, Thierry Kazazian, Jorgi Scheicher, Jeremy Quinn and others. O2 Groups in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]] followed.
Six years later (5 July 1994), [[Iris de Graaf]] and [[Willem Hanhart]] founded the O2 Global Network foundation, or in short, the O2 Global Network. O2GN, as it became to be known, was set up as an independent organization. Its first home page appeared in November that year, and by August 1995, the network had hosted their first [[World Wide Web|web]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]], live from [[Rotterdam]].

==Objective==
For nearly two decades, O2 has pioneered solutions to a central problem of the made environment: ''how to foster sustainability while having a good quality of life''. The people in this forum have been wrestling with the problems of a throw-away culture, formulating non-[[polluting]] [[Manufacturing|production]] methods, sourcing non-toxic, sustainably managed [[Chemical susbtance|materials]], innovative sustainable product services, sustainable [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]], [[behavior]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]—and, most importantly, passing on that [[knowledge]].

The basic idea of the O2 Global Network is ''"global thinking and local action"''. Global information and knowledge is exchanged and discussed. Local groups, mostly [[non-governmental organization]]s, or O2 individuals organize lectures, projects and workshops as well as distributing newsletters to promote, educate and implement design for [[sustainability]], with all of its facets in mind.

==Members==
The network involves people with a background in [[design]], [[industrial design]], [[architecture]], [[packaging design]], [[graphic design]], [[art]]s, [[fashion]], and [[innovation]], as well as people from [[academies]], [[universities]], public authorities, [[companies]] or knowledge centers. The O2 Global Network's primary method of communication is by means of electronic media such as the home page and an [[electronic mailing list]] where information and knowledge can be exchanged. O2 Hubs, O2 groups and O2 liaisons can be found worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6557">In [[philosophical]] [[ontology]], '''ontic''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄν}}, genitive {{lang|grc|ὄντος}}: "of that which is") is physical, real, or factual existence.&lt;br&gt;

==Overview==
"Ontic" describes what is there, as opposed to the nature or properties of that being. To illustrate:

*[[Roger Bacon]], observing that all languages are built upon a common grammar, stated that they share a foundation of ontically anchored linguistic structures.
*[[Martin Heidegger]] posited the concept of ''Sorge'', or caring, as the fundamental concept of the [[intentionality|intentional being]], and presupposed an ontological significance that distinguishes [[ontology|ontological]] being from mere "thinghood" of an ontic being. He uses the [[German language|German]] word "[[Dasein]]" for a being that is capable of ontology, that is, [[recursivity|recursively]] comprehending [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of the very fact of its own Being. For Heidegger, "ontical" signifies concrete, specific realities, whereas "ontological" signifies deeper underlying structures of reality. Ontological objects or subjects have an ontical dimension, but they also include aspects of being like self-awareness, evolutionary vestiges, future potentialities, and networks of relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontico-Ontological Distinction|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679516_ss1-33|publisher=Blackwell Reference|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Michael|title=The Ontological and the Ontic|url=http://mikejohnduff.blogspot.com/2007/08/ontological.html|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nicolai Hartmann]] distinguishes among ontology, ontics, and metaphysics: (i) ontology concerns the categorical analysis of entities by means of the knowledge categories able to classify them, (ii) ontics refers to a pre-categorical and pre-objectual connection which is best expressed in the relation to transcendent acts, and (iii) metaphysics is that part of ontics or that part of ontology which concerns the residue of being that cannot be rationalized further according to categories.

== Philosophy of science ==
[[Harald Atmanspacher]] writes extensively about the philosophy of science, especially as it relates to [[Chaos theory]], [[determinism]], [[Causality|causation]], and [[stochastic process|stochasticity]]. He explains that "''ontic'' states describe all properties of a physical system exhaustively. ('Exhaustive' in this context means that an ''ontic'' state is 'precisely the way it is,' without any reference to [[epistemic]] knowledge or ignorance.)"{{ref|autonumber}}

In an earlier paper, Atmanspacher portrays the difference between an [[epistemic]] perspective of a [[system]], and an ontic perspective:

:Philosophical [[discourse]] traditionally distinguishes between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] and generally enforces this distinction by keeping the two subject areas separated. However, the relationship between the two areas is of central importance to [[physics]] and [[philosophy of physics]]. For instance, many [[measurement]]-related problems force us to consider both our [[knowledge]] of the [[Classical mechanics|states]] and [[observables]] of a [[system]] ([[epistemic perspective]]) and its states and observables, independent of such knowledge (ontic perspective). This applies to [[quantum|quantum systems]] in particular.{{ref|autonumber}}

== Critical realism ==
{{noref-section|date=August 2018}}
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] [[Roy Bhaskar]], who is closely associated with the philosophical [[Cultural movement|movement]] of [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] writes:
:"I differentiate the 'ontic' ('ontical' etc.) from the 'ontological'. I employ the former to refer to

:# whatever pertains to being generally, rather than some distinctively philosophical (or scientific) theory of it (ontology), so that in this sense, that of the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', we can speak of the ontic presuppositions of a work of art, a [[joke]] or a strike as much as a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]; and, within this [[rubric]], to
:# the [[intransitive]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of some specific, [[historically determinate]], [[scientific investigation]] (or set of such investigations), the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

:"The ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is always specified, and only identified, by its relation, as the intransitive object(s) of some or other (denumerable set of) particular transitive process(es) of enquiry. It is cognitive process-, and level-specific; whereas the ontological (like the ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not."{{ref|autonumber}}

[[Ruth Groff]] offers this expansion of Bhaskar's note above:
:"'ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' is an abstract way of denoting the [[object-domain]] of a particular [[scientific]] area, field, or inquiry. E.g.: [[molecules]] feature in the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry. He's just saying that the scientific undertaking ITSELF is not one of the objects of said, most narrowly construed, immediate object-domain. So [[chemistry]] itself is not part of the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry."

The '''Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology''' ('''OCMA''') is a specialist research group within the School of [[Archaeology]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]].

==Overview==
Established in 2003 with the ongoing support of the [[Hilti Foundation]], the OCMA is devoted to the study of people who live or work on and around water. The centre offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in maritime archaeology and fosters research that ranges from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and its surrounding seas and oceans to the maritime cultures and peoples of the Indian Ocean and [[South China Sea]] from antiquity to the early modern period. In [[Egypt]], the OCMA collaborates on field projects implemented by the [[Institut Européen d’Archéologie Sous-Marine]] (IEASM),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieasm.org Institut Européen d'Archéologie Sous-Marine] (IEASM).&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of [[Franck Goddio]]. In 2011, OCMA began the excavation of shipwreck 43 in [[Aboukir Bay]] and the centre is also involved in work in [[Libya]]. Its research is disseminated through a vigorous programme of international conferences and in-house monograph publication.

==Teaching and research==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology offers post-graduate courses in maritime archaeology and provides post-graduate supervision within the School of Archaeology and the Faculty of Classics.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The Hilti Foundation funds two postgraduate studentships into research relating to IEASM excavations in ancient [[Heracleion]]. Current{{when|date=December 2013}} post-graduates research includes the Byzantine harbours in [[Greece]] and [[Spain]], and the maritime archaeology of the [[Philippines]], [[Korea]] and [[Cambodia]]. An option in Mediterranean maritime archaeology is also available to undergraduates.

==Excavation==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology is actively engaged in fieldwork as part of its on-going research strategy. It also offers training opportunities in field methods for its students.

===Shipwreck 43, Aboukir Bay===
OCMA is currently{{when|date=December 2013}} excavating shipwreck 43, one of 67 ancient ships so-far recorded by IEASM under Franck Goddio.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, D. (2012). "News"''Nautical archaeology Society Newsletter'' (Winter 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Tentatively dated to between 785-481 cal BC, the vessel has a distinctive form of naval architecture that has not been fully documented elsewhere in the ancient [[Mediterranean]]. This involved the use of long tenons that were initially fitted into mortice holes that passed through the keel plank over which multiple lines of planking were added, pegged into place with wooden treenails. From the albeit limited excavations, there do not appear to be any frames and consequently the long tenons may have provided the structural stability of the vessel through a kind of ‘internal framework’. As the structural elements of the wreck were made from the locally-available wood [[Acacia]] Totilis/Radiana, it is thought{{who|date=December 2013}} that shipwreck 43 was [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] in origin and thus probably involves a shipbuilding tradition that developed in accordance with the availability of local supplies of timber and the realities of nautical life at the margins of the [[Nile Delta]].

===The Western Marmarica Coastal Survey===
The OCMA supports the Western Marmarica Coastal Survey (WMCS) to investigate the engagement of the Roman and Byzantine countryside with coastal trade in eastern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;Hulin, L. et al. (2008-2010). Reports in ''Libyan Studies'' 39-41 (Winter 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The region east of [[Tobruk]] was populated by small farms and villages, most of whom exported their produce in amphora made in their own kilns. Although the area lacked the environmental resources to develop into a major centre, it is not isolated. A range of archaeological finds suggest connections, at different times, to [[Cyrenaica]], ca. 250&amp;nbsp;km west and to the [[Egypt]]ian delta, some 600&amp;nbsp;km to the east, as well as contacts across the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], and through the [[Sahara]] to west [[Africa]] or the [[Sudan]].

==Conferences and publication==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology publishes a monograph series as part of the Institute of Archaeology’s publication programme. The OCMA oversees the scholarly publication of the fieldwork conducted by the IEASM in Alexandria and the submerged Canopic region, as well as post-excavation studies of the material culture recovered from these excavations by IEASM specialists and Hilti Foundation sponsored post-graduate students. The OCMA regularly organizes conferences exploring themes within maritime archaeology or relating to the fieldwork of the IEASM. Volumes arising out of these conferences are also included in the monograph series.

Each volume is assessed by an internal review committee comprising principal members of staff from the Institute of Archaeology, the Oriental Institute, the Classics Centre and the [[Ashmolean Museum]], and are also peer-reviewed.

'''Performativity''' is [[language]] which effects change in the world and functions as a form of social action.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Jillian R.|title=Performativity|journal=Anthropology|date=10 March 2015|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199766567-0114|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0114.xml|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has multiple applications in diverse fields, such as [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[jurisprudence|law]], [[gender studies]], [[performance studies]], and [[economics]].

Performativity was first defined by [[philosopher of language]] [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] as the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be "evaluated as true or false".&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt;

Influenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].&lt;ref name="Butler1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt; This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis – Barker &amp; Galasinski&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===J. L. Austin===

The term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]], who did not use the word "performativity", but did, beginning in the 1950s, give the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words "I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|year=1962|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a "performative utterance" cannot be said to be either true or false, as a constative utterance might be. It can only be judged either "happy" or "infelicitous", depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between "performative" and "constative" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:

* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) 
* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) 
* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)

For example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.

Austin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).

The concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a "representational idiom" to a "performative idiom" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).

Other uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define—and break—boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67–91), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.

===John Searle's reformulation===
In ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin’s theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: “In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin’s taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last key departure from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that four of his universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed.&lt;ref name="John1979"&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the “rules of language.”&lt;ref name="John1979" /&gt;

=== Jacques Derrida ===
Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language. 

In "Signature, Event, Context," Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker ("signature") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.&lt;blockquote&gt;Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called "normal." What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions. 

=== Judith Butler ===
{{Main|Gender performativity}}

Philosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as “that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of "Sex"|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = 9780415903660|location = New York|pages = xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.&lt;ref&gt;This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).

==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====

Butler sees gender as an act that has been rehearsed, much like a script, and that people, as actors who make a script a reality through repetition, come to perform in the mode of belief. “For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by hegemonic social conventions and ideologies” (Felluga, 2006).  Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of "self-making" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler’s theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  A person is merely in a condition of “doing straightness” or “doing queerness” (Lloyd, 1999).

==== Theoretical criticisms ====

There are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration. (Lloyd, 1999)

Another criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a “real” existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)

Others criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of "doing" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.

=== Jean-François Lyotard ===
In ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.

Lyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: "be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth. 

Lyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize "audit culture" and "global performativity." 

Against performativity and [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.

==Other applications==

===Video art===

Theories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[José Esteban Muñoz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Muñoz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, "The Transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author = Muñoz|authorlink = José Esteban Muñoz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.

=== Finance and economics ===
In economics, the “performativity thesis” is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is debated in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &amp;#124; Ivan Boldyrev &amp;#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===

The German news anchorman [[Hanns Joachim Friedrichs]] once argued that a good journalist should never act in collusion with anything, not even with a good thing. In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: "The gates of the wall are wide open." („Die Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.“) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubiläum - der schönste Fehler in 40 Jahren "Tagesthemen"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Planet Earth: The Future''''' is a 2006 [[BBC]] [[documentary]] series on the environment and conservation, produced by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] as a companion to the multi-award winning [[nature documentary]] ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]''. The programmes were originally [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on [[BBC Four]] immediately after the final three episodes of ''Planet Earth'' on [[BBC One]]. Each episode highlights the conservation issues surrounding some of the [[species]] and environments featured in ''Planet Earth'', using interviews with the film-makers and eminent figures from the fields of [[science]], [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], [[politics]], and [[theology]]. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was [[Fergus Beeley]].

==Background==
When the first episodes of ''Planet Earth'' were broadcast in the [[UK]], the producers were criticised by some green campaigners for glossing over the [[environmental problem]]s faced by the planet. Executive producer [[Alastair Fothergill]] defended the approach, explaining that a heavy-handed environmental message would not work on primetime [[BBC One]]. However, the ''Planet Earth'' film crews witnessed first-hand scenes of [[environmental degradation]] and the increasing scarcity of wildlife in some of the shooting locations. This experience formed the basis of ''Planet Earth - The Future'', which was designed to engage viewers in a mature debate about [[environmental issues]].

The following year, the BBC commissioned ''[[Saving Planet Earth]]'', the second overtly conservation-themed series to be shown on [[BBC One]]. The first BBC series to deal comprehensively with conservation was ''[[State of the Planet]]'' in 2000.

 |ShortSummary    = The first programme asks if there really is an [[extinction]] crisis facing certain species. Alastair Fothergill, executive producer of ''Planet Earth'', admits that making the series was a bittersweet experience since some creatures were filmed with the knowledge that their continued existence is under threat. David Attenborough believes that conservation of the [[natural environment|natural world]] is something that can unite humanity if people know enough about it. Cameraman Martyn Colbeck relates that every single day during a six-week [[Africa]]n visit to film for "Jungles", he and his crew were awakened by the sound of gunshots. [[Poaching]] can quickly wipe out a population, and David Greer of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] explains that in 2005 his team confiscated 70 guns in the area — a 700% increase from 1999. Other featured animals at risk include the [[walia ibex]], the [[snow leopard]], the [[boto]], and [[saiga antelope]]. The attack of a [[polar bear]] on a [[walrus]] colony on dry land in "Ice Worlds" was a rare occurrence. Footage from a 1997 ''[[BBC Wildlife Specials|BBC Wildlife Special]]'' shows the bears hunting smaller prey on sea ice. Species have always become extinct, but now, the viewer is told, the rate of extinction is accelerating (see [[Holocene extinction]]) and it will "really reach biblical proportions within a few decades." Mankind is urged to respect [[biodiversity]]: it is estimated that if a monetary value could be put on all that the world's [[ecosystem]]s do for humanity, it would total some [[US$]]30 trillion.

 |Title           = Into the Wilderness
 |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|03|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary    = The second part looks at man's potential effect on the world's areas of [[wilderness]]. As the [[human population]] has grown, only a quarter of Earth's land now remains uninhabited (aside from [[Antarctica]]). Although around 12% is protected, this may not be enough — providing such places are not just 'enclosures' and bordering territories are also managed. [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Semien Mountains]] are increasingly encroached upon for farming land, and this example leads to the question of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Some interviewees argue that it is not just about numbers: how humans consume their [[natural resources]] is also important. However, others believe that the world would be greatly more sustainable if the population level was reduced to about half its current level. [[Jonathon Porritt]] believes that this could be achieved simply: by good education on [[family planning]]. Consumption of [[fresh water]] is highlighted: there are now 40,000 more dams in existence than in 1950. The controversy over drilling for oil in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is discussed by both its advocates and opponents. [[E. O. Wilson]]'s concept of [[Biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] is discussed, and David Attenborough believes that a child's innate love of wildlife, for whatever reason, is being lost in adulthood. An answer to [[deforestation]] is found in [[Costa Rica]], where farmers are paid to allow their pasture to revert to forest for its water [[ecosystem services]]. The also deals with [[climate change]] and related [[global warming]], which is now happening at a faster rate than ever before.

 |Title           = Living Together
 |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|10|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary    = The last episode deals with the future of conservation. It begins by looking at previous efforts. The 'Save The Whales' campaign, which started in the 1960s, is seen to have had a limited effect, as [[whaling]] continues and fish stocks also decline. In the 1990s, as head of the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]], [[Richard Leakey]] took on the poachers by employing armed units. Although it was successful in saving [[elephant]]s, the policy was detrimental to the [[Maasai people]], who were forced from their land. The need for "fortress" areas is questioned, and the recently highlighted [[Raja Ampat]] [[coral reef]] in [[Indonesia]] is an example. The more [[tourism]] it generates, the greater the potential for damage — and inevitable coastal construction. [[Sustainable development]] is viewed as controversial, and one contributor perceives it to currently be a "contradiction in terms". [[Trophy hunting]] is also contentious. Those that support it argue that it generates wealth for local economies, while its opponents point to the reducing numbers of species such as the [[markhor]]. [[Ecotourism]] is shown to be beneficial, as it is in the interests of its providers to protect their environments. However, in some areas, such as the [[Borneo]] [[rainforest]]s, the great diversity of species is being replaced by [[monoculture]]s. The role of both [[Religion and environmentalism|religion]] and the media in conservation is argued to be extremely important. Contributors to the programme admit a degree of worry about the future, but also optimism.

'''Psychological resilience''' is the ability to successfully cope with a crisis and to return to pre-crisis status quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Terte|first=Ian|last2=Stephens|first2=Christine|date=2014|title=Psychological Resilience of Workers in High-Risk Occupations|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.2627|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=353–355|doi=10.1002/smi.2627|issn=1532-3005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resilience exists when the person uses "mental processes and behaviors in promoting personal assets and protecting self from the potential negative effects of stressors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Ivan T.|last2=Cooper|first2=Cary L.|last3=Sarkar|first3=Mustafa|last4=Curran|first4=Thomas|date=2015-04-25|title=Resilience training in the workplace from 2003 to 2014: A systematic review|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joop.12120|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|language=en|volume=88|issue=3|pages=533–562|doi=10.1111/joop.12120|issn=0963-1798}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, psychological resilience exists in people who develop psychological and behavioral capabilities that allow them to remain calm during crises/chaos and to move on from the incident without long-term negative consequences. Psychological resilience is an evolutionary advantage that most people have and use to manage normal stressors.

==Background==

Resilience is generally thought of as a "positive adaptation" after a stressful or adverse situation.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hopf S.M |title= Risk and Resilience in Children Coping with Parental Divorce|journal= Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science |year=2010|url=http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2010/risk-and-resilience-in-children-coping-with-parental-divorce#.VTceVpNGRHA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is "bombarded by daily stress, it disrupts their internal and external sense of balance, presenting challenges as well as opportunities". Resilience is the integrated adaptation of physical, mental and spiritual aspects in a set of "good or bad" circumstances, a coherent sense of self that is able to maintain normative developmental tasks that occur at various stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richardson | first=Glenn E. | title=The metatheory of resilience and resiliency | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=58 | issue=3 | year=2002 | issn=0021-9762 | doi=10.1002/jclp.10020 | pages=307–321 | pmid=11836712}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Children's Institute of the [[University of Rochester]] explains that "resilience research is focused on studying those who engage in life with hope and humor despite devastating losses".&lt;ref name="childrens_institute"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.childrensinstitute.net/sites/default/files/documents/children-resilience-family-court-review.pdf | title=Fostering children's resilience in the aftermath of divorce: The role of evidence-based programs for children | work=Children's Institute, [[University of Rochester]] | date=2005 | accessdate=30 March 2016 | author=Pedro-Carroll, JoAnne | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to note that resilience is not only about overcoming a deeply stressful situation, but also coming out of the said situation with "competent functioning". Resiliency allows a person to rebound from adversity as a strengthened and more resourceful person.

==History==

The first research on resilience was published in 1973. The study used [[epidemiology]], which is the study of disease prevalence, to uncover the risks and the protective factors that now help define resilience.&lt;ref&gt;Garmezy, N. (1973). "Competence and adaptation in adult schizophrenic patients and children at risk", pp. 163–204 in Dean, S. R. (Ed.), ''Schizophrenia: The first ten Dean Award Lectures''. NY: MSS Information Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the same group of researchers created tools to look at systems that support development of resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garmezy | first1 = N. | last2 = Streitman | first2 = S. | year = 1974 | title = Children at risk: The search for the antecedents of schizophrenia. Part 1. Conceptual models and research methods | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 1 | issue = 8| pages = 14–90 | pmid = 4619494 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/1.8.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmy Werner]] was one of the early scientists to use the term ''resilience'' in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from [[Kauai]], Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many of the children in the study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, E. E. (1971). ''The children of Kauai : a longitudinal study from the prenatal period to age ten''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|0870228609}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-[[marriage|wedlock]] births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'.&lt;ref name=w1989&gt;Werner, E. E. (1989). ''Vulnerable but invincible: a longitudinal study of resilient children and youth''. New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0937431036}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.

Resilience also emerged as a major theoretical and research topic from the studies of children with mothers diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Masten, Best 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masten | first1 = A. S. | last2 = Best | first2 = K. M. | last3 = Garmezy | first3 = N. | year = 1990 | title = Resilience and development: Contributions from the study of children who overcome adversity | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 425–444 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579400005812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1989 study,&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S. (1989). "Resilience in development: Implications of the study of successful adaptation for developmental psychopathology". In D. Cicchetti (Ed.), ''The emergence of a discipline: Rochester symposium on developmental psychopathology'' (Vol. 1, pp. 261–294). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|0805805532}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the results showed that children with a [[schizophrenic]] parent may not obtain an appropriate level of comforting caregiving—compared to children with healthy parents—and that such situations often had a detrimental impact on children's development. On the other hand, some children of ill parents thrived well and were competent in academic achievement, and therefore led researchers to make efforts to understand such responses to adversity.

Since the onset of the research on resilience, researchers have been devoted to discovering the protective factors that explain people's adaptation to adverse conditions, such as maltreatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cicchetti | first1 = D. | last2 = Rogosch | first2 = F. A. | year = 1997 | title = The role of self-organization in the promotion of resilience in maltreated children | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 797–815 | pmid= 9449006 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579497001442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; catastrophic life events,&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, Tugade 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B.

S. (1999). ''Poverty and children's adjustment.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage, {{ISBN|0761905189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of empirical work then has been shifted to understand the underlying protective processes. Researchers endeavor to uncover how some factors (e.g. connection to family) may contribute to positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="Luthar 1999"/&gt;

==Process==

In all these instances, resilience is best understood as a process. It is often mistakenly assumed to be a trait of the individual, an idea more typically referred to as "resiliency".&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A.S. (1994). "Resilience in individual development: Successful adaptation despite risk and adversity", pp. 3–25 in M. Wang &amp; E. Gordon (Eds.), ''Risk and resilience in inner city America: challenges and prospects''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|080581325X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most research now shows that resilience is the result of individuals being able to interact with their environments and the processes that either promote well-being or protect them against the overwhelming influence of risk factors.&lt;ref name="Zautra, A.J. 2010 pp. 3-34"&gt;Zautra, A.J., Hall, J.S. &amp; Murray, K.E. (2010). "Resilience: A new definition of health for people and communities", pp. 3–34 in J.W. Reich, A.J. Zautra &amp; J.S. Hall (eds.), ''Handbook of adult resilience''. New York: Guilford, {{ISBN|146250647X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to understand the process or this cycle of resiliency. When people are faced with an adverse condition, there are three ways in which they may approach the situation.

# Erupt with anger
# Implode with overwhelming negative emotions, go numb, and become unable to react
# Simply become upset about the disruptive change

Only the third approach promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become upset about the disruptive state and thus change their current pattern to cope with the issue. The first and second approaches lead people to adopt the victim role by [[projection (psychology)|blaming others]] and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, spring back, and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, and hopelessness which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears and worries weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Al (2005). ''The Resiliency Advantage'', pp. 2–4. Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1576753298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These processes include individual coping strategies, or may be helped by a protective environment like good [[family resilience|families]], schools, communities, and social policies that make resilience more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, B., Dodgen, D. &amp; Solarz, A. (2005). "The resilience revolution: A paradigm shift for research and policy", pp. 47–63 in R.D. Peters, B. Leadbeater &amp; R.J. McMahon (eds.), ''Resilience in children, families, and communities: Linking context to practice and policy''. New York: Kluwer. {{ISBN|0306486555}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense "resilience" occurs when there are cumulative "protective factors". These factors are likely to play a more important role, the greater the individual's exposure to cumulative risk factors.

==Biological models==
Three notable bases for resilience—self-confidence, self-esteem and [[self-concept]]—all have roots in three different nervous systems—respectively, the [[somatic nervous system]], the [[autonomic nervous system]] and the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Al (2005). ''The Resiliency Advantage'', pp. 74–78. Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1576753298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging field in the study of resilience is the neurobiological basis of resilience to stress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/339586/title/Brain_scan_foretells_who_will_fold_under_pressure Brain scan foretells who will fold under pressure; Tests on high-stakes math problems identify key regions of neural activity linked to choking], sciencenews.org (May 5, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and 5-Dehydroepiandrosterone (5-DHEA) are thought to limit the stress response by reducing sympathetic nervous system activation and protecting the brain from the potentially harmful effects of chronically elevated cortisol levels respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Charney|first1= DS |title=Psychobiological mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability: implications for successful adaptation to extreme stress |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=195–216 |year=2004 |pmid=14754765 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.2.195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the relationship between social support and stress resilience is thought to be mediated by the oxytocin system's impact on the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=18627668| year=2008| last1=Ozbay| first1=F| last2=Fitterling| first2=H| last3=Charney| first3=D| last4=Southwick| first4=S| title=Social support and resilience to stress across ''the life'' span: A neurobiologic framework| volume=10| issue=4| pages=304–10| journal=Current Psychiatry Reports| doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0049-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Resilience, conceptualized as a positive bio-psychological adaptation, has proven to be a useful theoretical context for understanding variables for predicting long-term health and well-being".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Parental resilience: A neglected construct in resilience research|doi = 10.1111/cp.12053 | volume=19|issue=3|journal=Clinical Psychologist|pages=111–121|authors=Gavidia-Payne, S., Denny, B., Davis, K., Francis, A. and Jackson, M.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some limited research that, like trauma, resilience is [[epigenetic]]—that is, it may be inherited—but the science behind this finding is preliminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/28/trauma-may-be-woven-dna-native-americans-160508|work=Indian Country Today|title=Trauma May Be Woven in DNA of Native Americans|last=Pember|first=Mary Annette|date=May 28, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related factors==

Studies show that there are several factors which develop and sustain a person's resilience:&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;American Psychological Association. (2014). [http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/road-resilience.aspx The Road to Resilience].&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ability to make realistic plans and being capable of taking the steps necessary to follow through with them
# Confidence in one's strengths and abilities
# Communication and problem-solving skills
# The ability to manage strong impulses and feelings

Resilience is negatively correlated with personality traits of neuroticism and negative emotionality, which represents tendencies to see and react to the world as threatening, problematic, and distressing, and to view oneself as vulnerable. Positive correlations stands with personality traits of openness and positive emotionality, that represents tendencies to engage and confront the world with confidence in success and a fair value to [[self-directedness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John W. Reich|author2=Alex J. Zautra|author3=John Stuart Hall|title=Handbook of Adult Resilience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyRc8ZshU98C&amp;pg=PA114|year=2012|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-4625-0647-7|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive emotions===

There is significant research found in scientific literature on the relationship between [[positive emotions]] and resilience. Studies show that maintaining positive emotions whilst facing adversity promote flexibility in thinking and problem solving. Positive emotions serve an important function in their ability to help an individual recover from stressful experiences and encounters. That being said, maintaining a positive emotionality aids in counteracting the physiological effects of negative emotions. It also facilitates adaptive coping, builds enduring social resources, and increases personal well-being.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, B. L. 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 21852891 | pmc = 3156609 | year = 2005 | author1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B. L. | title = Positive emotions broaden the scope of attention and thought-action repertoires | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–332 | last2 = Branigan | first2 = C | doi = 10.1080/02699930441000238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formation of conscious perception and monitoring one's own socioemotional factors is considered as a stability aspect of positive emotions.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This is not to say that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual.&lt;ref name=tugade&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 14769087 | pmc = 3132556 | year = 2004 | author1 = Tugade | first1 = M. M. | title = Resilient individuals use positive emotions to bounce back from negative emotional experiences | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 320–33 | last2 = Fredrickson | first2 = B. L. | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.730| pmid = 17014296| title = Psychological resilience, positive emotions, and successful adaptation to stress in later life| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 91| issue = 4| pages = 730–49| year = 2006| last1 = Ong | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Bergeman | first2 = C. S.| last3 = Bisconti | first3 = T. L. | last4 = Wallace | first4 = K. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/fare.12134 | volume=64| issue=4|journal=Family Relations|pages=505–518| title=Examining Social Support Among Adult Children of Incarcerated Parents| year=2015| last1=Luther| first1=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive emotions not only have physical outcomes but also physiological ones. Some physiological outcomes caused by humor include improvements in immune system functioning and increases in levels of salivary [[immunoglobulin A]], a vital system antibody, which serves as the body's first line of defense in respiratory illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00223980209604148| pmid = 12081092| title = Perceived Attributes of Health-Promoting Laughter: A Cross-Generational Comparison| journal = The Journal of Psychology| volume = 136| issue = 2| pages = 171–81| year = 2002| last1 = Mahony | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Burroughs | first2 = W. J. | last3 = Lippman | first3 = L. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2190/R7FD-URN9-PQ7F-A6J7| title = Positive Emotional States and Enhancement of the Immune System| journal = The International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine| volume = 15| pages = 13–18| year = 1985| last1 = Baker | first1 = K. H. | last2 = Minchoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Dillon | first3 = K. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, other health outcomes include faster injury recovery rate and lower readmission rates to hospitals for the elderly, and reductions in a patient's stay in the hospital, among many other benefits. A study was done on positive emotions in trait-resilient individuals and the cardiovascular recovery rate following negative emotions felt by those individuals. The results of the study showed that trait-resilient individuals experiencing positive emotions had an acceleration in the speed in rebounding from cardiovascular activation initially generated by negative emotional arousal, i.e. heart rate and the like.&lt;ref name=tugade/&gt;

===Grit===
{{Main|Grit (personality trait)}}
Grit refers to the perseverance and passion for long-term goals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duckworth|first1= A.L. |last2=Peterson|first2= C. |last3=Matthews|first3= M.D. |last4=Kelly|first4= D.R. |title= Grit: perseverance and passion for long-term goals. |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol|volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=11087–1101 |year=2007 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1087}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is characterized as working persistently towards challenges, maintained effort and interest over years despite negative feedback, adversity, plateaus in progress, or failure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; High grit people view accomplishments as a marathon rather than an immediate goal. High grit individuals display a sustained and focused application of self in problematic situations than less gritty individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit affects the effort a person contributes by acting on the importance pathway. When people value a goal as more valuable, meaningful, or relevant to their self-concept they are willing to expend more effort on it when necessary. The influence of individual differences in grit results in different levels of effort-related cardiac activity when gritty and less gritty individuals performed the same task. Grit is associated with differences in potential motivation, one pathway in motivational intensity theory. Grit may also influence an individual's perception of task difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Silvia|first1= P.J. |last2=Eddington|first2= K.M. |last3=Beaty|first3= R.E. |last4=Nusbaum|first4= E.C. |last5=Kwapil|first5= T.R. |title= Gritty people try harder: grit and effort-related cardiac autonomic activity during an active coping challenge |journal=J Int J Psychophysiol|volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=200–205 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grit was highly correlated with the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] [[conscientiousness]] trait.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although grit and conscientiousness highly overlap in their achievement aspects, they differ in their emphasis. Grit emphasizes long-term stamina, whereas conscientiousness focuses on short-term intensity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit varies with level of education and age. More educated adults tend to be higher in grit than less educated individuals of the same age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Post college graduates report higher grit levels than most other education level groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Grit increases with age when education level is controlled for.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In life achievements, grit may be as important as talent. College students at an elite university who scored high in grit also earned higher GPAs than their classmates, despite having lower SAT scores.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In a study at the West Point military academy it was found that grit was a more reliable predictor of first summer retention than self-control or a summary measure of cadet quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Gritty competitors at the Scripps National Spelling Bee outranked other competitors who scored lower in grit, at least partially due to accumulated practice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit may also serve as a protective factor against [[suicide]]. A study at [[Stanford University]] found that grit was predictive of psychological health and well-being in medical residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salles|first1= A. |last2=Cohen|first2= G.L. |last3=Mueller|first3= C.M. |title= The relationship between grit and resident well-being|journal=Am J Surg|volume=207 |issue=2 |pages=251–254|year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.09.006|pmid= 24238604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gritty individuals possess self-control and regular commitment to goals that allows them to resist impulses, such as to engage in [[self-harm]]. Individuals high in grit also focus on future goals, which may stop them from attempting suicide. It is believed that because grit encourages individuals to create and sustain life goals, these goals provide meaning and purpose in life. Grit alone does not seem to be sufficient, however. Only individuals with high gratitude and grit have decreased suicidal ideation over long periods of time. Gratitude and grit work together to enhance meaning in life, offering protection against death and suicidal thoughts or plans.&lt;ref name=Kleinman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kleinman|first1= E.M. |last2=Adams|first2= L.M. |last3=Kashdan|first3= T.B. |last4=Riskind|first4= J.H. |title= Gratitude and grit indirectly reduce risk of suicidal ideations by enhancing meaning in life: Evidence for a mediated moderation mode |journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=539–546|year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2013.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other factors===

A study was conducted among high achieving professionals who seek challenging situations that require resilience. Research has examined 13 high achievers from various professions, all of whom had experienced challenges in the workplace and negative life events over the course of their careers but who had also been recognized for their great achievements in their respective fields. Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, sense of control, flexibility and adaptability, balance and perspective, and perceived social support. High achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies, exercising, and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/spy0000003| title = Ordinary magic, extraordinary performance: Psychological resilience and thriving in high achievers| journal = Sport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology| volume = 3| pages = 46–60| year = 2014| last1 = Sarkar | first1 = M. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors are found to modify the negative effects of adverse life situations. Many studies show that the primary factor for the development of resilience is social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theron|first=Linda|last2=van Rensburg|first2=Angelique|date=August 2018|title=Resilience over time: Learning from school-attending adolescents living in conditions of structural inequality|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140197118301052|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=67|pages=167–178|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.06.012|issn=0140-1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham 359–366"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Ruth|last2=Lien|first2=Lars|last3=Hanssen|first3=Ingrid|date=2018-03-27|title=Coping, resilience and posttraumatic growth among Eritrean female refugees living in Norwegian asylum reception centres: A qualitative study|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0020764018765237|journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry|language=en|volume=64|issue=4|pages=359–366|doi=10.1177/0020764018765237|issn=0020-7640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagnon|first=Anita J.|last2=Stewart|first2=Donna E.|date=2013-11-13|title=Resilience in international migrant women following violence associated with pregnancy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00737-013-0392-5|journal=Archives of Women's Mental Health|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=303–310|doi=10.1007/s00737-013-0392-5|issn=1434-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many competing definitions of social support exist, most can be thought of as the degree of access to, and use of, strong ties to other individuals who are similar to one’s self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Nan|last2=Woelfel|first2=Mary W.|last3=Light|first3=Stephen C.|date=September 1985|title=The Buffering Effect of Social Support Subsequent to an Important Life Event|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2136756|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|pages=247|doi=10.2307/2136756|issn=0022-1465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social support requires not only that you have relationships with others, but that these relationships involve the presence of solidarity and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]], intimate communication, and mutual obligation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perlin|first=L.|date=1981|title="The stress process."|url=|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=22|pages=337–56|via=EbscoHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; both within and outside the [[family]].&lt;ref name="Abraham 359–366"/&gt; Additional factors are also associated with resilience, like the capacity to make realistic plans, having [[self-confidence]] and a positive [[self image]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elm|first1=Jessica|title="I'm in this world for a reason": Resilience and recovery among American Indian and Alaska Native two-spirit women|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|date=June 2016|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=352–371|doi=10.1080/10894160.2016.1152813|pmid=27254761}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing [[communication skills training|communications skills]], and the capacity to manage strong feelings and [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentsuccess.unc.edu/files/2015/08/The-Road-to-Resiliency.pdf |title=APA – Resilience Factors &amp; Strategies |publisher=unc.edu |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperamental and constitutional disposition is considered as a major factor in resilience. It is one of the necessary precursors of resilience along with warmth in family cohesion and accessibility of prosocial support systems.&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S., &amp; Reed, M. G. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Cr5rP8jOnsC&amp;pg=PA74 Resilience in development]. In C. R. Snyder, &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 74-88). London, England: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three kinds of temperamental systems that play part in resilience, they are the appetitive system, defensive system and attentional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=DERRYBERRY | first=DOUGLAS | last2=REED | first2=MARJORIE A. | last3=PILKENTON–TAYLOR | first3=CAROLYN | title=Temperament and coping: Advantages of an individual differences perspective | journal=Development and Psychopathology | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=15 | issue=04 | date=14 November 2003 | issn=0954-5794 | doi=10.1017/s0954579403000439 | pmid=14984137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another protective factor is related to moderating the negative effects of environmental hazards or a stressful situation in order to direct vulnerable individuals to optimistic paths, such as external social support. More specifically a 1995 study distinguished three contexts for protective factors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werner | first1 = E. E. | year = 1995 | title = Resilience in development| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 81–85 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# personal attributes, including outgoing, bright, and positive [[self-concept]]s;
# the family, such as having close bonds with at least one family member or an emotionally stable parent; and
# the community, such as receiving support or counsel from peers.

Furthermore, a study of the elderly in Zurich, Switzerland, illuminated the role humor plays as a coping mechanism to maintain a state of happiness in the face of age-related adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ruch | first1 = W. | last2 = Proyer | first2 = R. T. | last3 = Weber | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1007/s00391-009-0090-0 | title = Humor as a character strength among the elderly | journal = Zeitschrift für Gerontologie und Geriatrie | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–18 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20012063 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the above distinction on resilience, research has also been devoted to discovering the individual differences in resilience. [[Self-esteem]], ego-control, and ego-resiliency are related to behavioral adaptation.&lt;ref name=Ci1993&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cicchetti | first1 = D. | last2 = Rogosch | first2 = F. A. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = M. | last4 = Holt | first4 = K. D. | year = 1993 | title = Resilience in maltreated children: Processes leading to adaptive outcome | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 629–647 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579400006209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, maltreated children who feel good about themselves may process risk situations differently by attributing different reasons to the environments they experience and, thereby, avoid producing negative [[internalized]] [[self-perception]]s. Ego-control is "the threshold or operating characteristics of an individual with regard to the expression or containment"&lt;ref&gt;Block, J. H., &amp; Block, J. (1980). "The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency in the organisation of behaviour". In W. A. Collins (Ed.), ''Development of cognition, affect, and social relations: Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology '' (Vol. 13, p. 43). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|089859023X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of their impulses, feelings, and desires. Ego-resilience refers to "dynamic capacity, to modify his or her model level of ego-control, in either direction, as a function of the demand characteristics of the environmental context"&lt;ref&gt;Block, J. H., &amp; Block, J. (1980). "The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency in the organisation of behaviour". In W. A. Collins (Ed.), ''Development of cognition, affect, and social relations: Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology '' (Vol. 13, p. 48). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|089859023X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltreated children who experienced some risk factors (e.g., single parenting, limited maternal education, or family unemployment), showed lower ego-resilience and intelligence than nonmaltreated children. Furthermore, maltreated children are more likely than nonmaltreated children to demonstrate disruptive-aggressive, withdraw, and internalized behavior problems. Finally, ego-resiliency, and positive self-esteem were predictors of competent adaptation in the maltreated children.&lt;ref name=Ci1993/&gt;

Demographic information (e.g., gender) and resources (e.g., social support) are also used to predict resilience. Examining people's adaptation after disaster showed women were associated with less likelihood of resilience than men. Also, individuals who were less involved in affinity groups and organisations showed less resilience.&lt;ref name=Bonanno&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonanno | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Galea | first2 = S. | last3 = Bucciareli | first3 = A. | last4 = Vlahov | first4 = D. | year = 2007 | title = What predicts psychological resilience after disaster?

Certain aspects of religions and spirituality may, hypothetically, promote or hinder certain psychological virtues that increase resilience. Research has not established connection between spirituality and resilience. According to the 4th edition of ''Psychology of Religion'' by Hood, et al., the "study of positive psychology is a relatively new development...there has not yet been much direct empirical research looking specifically at the association of religion and ordinary strengths and virtues".&lt;ref&gt;Hood, R., Hill, P., Spilka, B., (2009) ''The psychology of religion, 4th edition: An empirical approach''. Newyork: The Guilford press, {{ISBN|1606233920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the literature on the relationship between religiosity/spirituality and PTSD, amongst the significant findings, about half of the studies showed a positive relationship and half showed a negative relationship between measures of religiosity/spirituality and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peres | first1 = J. | last2 = Moreira-Almeida | first2 = A. | last3 = Nasello | first3 = A. | last4 = Koenig | first4 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Spirituality and resilience in trauma victims | journal = Journal of Religion &amp; Health | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 343–350 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-006-9103-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army has received criticism for promoting spirituality in its new [Comprehensive Soldier Fitness] program as a way to prevent PTSD, due to the lack of conclusive supporting data.

In military studies it has been found that resilience is also dependent on group support: unit cohesion and morale is the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization. Resilience is highly correlated to peer support and group cohesion. Units with high cohesion tend to experience a lower rate of psychological breakdowns than units with low cohesion and morale. High cohesion and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Army (2009). Field Manual No. 6-22.5. Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers. Department of the Army Headquarters, Washington, DC, 18 March 2009. p 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

In [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], building resilience is a matter of mindfully changing basic behaviors and thought patterns.&lt;ref name="Padesky"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padesky|first=Christine A.|last2=Mooney|first2=Kathleen A.|date=2012-06-01|title=Strengths-Based Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: A Four-Step Model to Build Resilience|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpp.1795|journal=Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=283–290|doi=10.1002/cpp.1795|issn=1063-3995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step is to change the nature of self-talk. Self-talk is the internal monologue people have that reinforce beliefs about the person's self-efficacy and self-value. To build resilience, the person needs to eliminate negative self-talk, such as "I can't do this" and "I can't handle this", and to replace it with positive self-talk, such as "I can do this" and "I can handle this". This small change in thought patterns helps to reduce psychological stress when a person is faced with a difficult challenge. The second step a person can take to build resilience is to be prepared for challenges, crises, and emergencies. In business, preparedness is created by creating emergency response plans, business continuity plans, and contingency plans. For personal preparedness, the individual can create a financial cushion to help with economic crises, he/she can develop social networks to help him/her through trying personal crises, and he/she can develop emergency response plans for his/her household.

Resilience is also enhanced by developing effective coping skills for stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chua|first=Li Wen|last2=Milfont|first2=Taciano L.|last3=Jose|first3=Paul E.|date=2014-11-27|title=Coping Skills Help Explain How Future-Oriented Adolescents Accrue Greater Well-Being Over Time|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-014-0230-8|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=44|issue=11|pages=2028–2041|doi=10.1007/s10964-014-0230-8|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping skills help the individual to reduce stress levels, so they remain functional. Coping skills include using meditation, exercise, socialization, and self-care practices to maintain a healthy level of stress, but there are many other lists associated with psychological resilience.

The [[American Psychological Association]] suggests "10 Ways to Build Resilience",&lt;ref name="apa.org" /&gt; which are:

# to maintain good [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s with close family members, friends and others;
# to avoid seeing [[crisis|crises]] or [[Stress (biology)|stressful]] events as unbearable problems;
# to accept circumstances that cannot be changed;
# to develop realistic [[goal]]s and move towards them;
# to take decisive actions in adverse situations;
# to look for opportunities of self-discovery after a struggle with loss;
# to develop self-confidence;
# to keep a long-term perspective and consider the stressful event in a broader context;
# to maintain a hopeful outlook, expecting good things and [[Mental image|visualizing]] what is wished;
# to take care of one's [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]], [[physical exercise|exercising]] regularly, paying attention to one's own needs and feelings.

The Besht model of natural resilience building in an ideal family with positive access and support from family and friends, through parenting illustrates four key markers. They are:

# Realistic upbringing
# Effective risk communications
# Positivity and restructuring of demanding situations
# Building self efficacy and hardiness

In this model, [[self-efficacy]] is the belief in one's ability to organize and execute the courses of action required to achieve necessary and desired goals and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]] is a composite of interrelated attitudes of commitment, control, and challenge.

A number of self-help approaches to resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT).&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1444168716|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a group cognitive-behavioral intervention, called the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), has been shown to foster various aspects of resilience. A meta-analysis of 17 PRP studies showed that the intervention significantly reduces depressive symptoms over time.&lt;ref name="pmid19968381"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunwasser SM, Gillham JE, Kim ES.|title=A meta-analytic review of the Penn Resiliency Program's effect on depressive symptoms|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=2009|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1042–1054|doi=10.1037/a0017671|pmid=19968381|last2=Gillham|last3=Kim|pmc=4667774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of 'resilience building' is debatably at odds with the concept of resilience as a process,&lt;ref name="Rutter, M. 2008 pp. 3"&gt;Rutter, M. (2008). "Developing concepts in developmental psychopathology", pp. 3–22 in J.J. Hudziak (ed.), ''Developmental psychopathology and wellness: Genetic and environmental influences''. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, {{ISBN|1585622796}}.&lt;/ref&gt; since it is used to imply that it is a developable characteristic of oneself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masten | first1 = A. S. | year = 2001 | title = Ordinary magic: Resilience processes in development | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 227–238 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.56.3.227 | pmid = 11315249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who view resilience as a description of doing well despite adversity, view efforts of 'resilience building' as method to encourage resilience. [[Bibliotherapy]], positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, T. M., Egeland, B., &amp; Sroufe, L. A. (2003). "Rethinking resilience: A developmental process perspective", pp. 234–256 in S. S. Luthar (Ed.), ''Resilience and vulnerability: Adaptation in the context of childhood adversities''. New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Resilience: Building immunity in psychiatry | pmc=3777343 | pmid=24082242 | doi=10.4103/0019-5545.117134 | volume=55 | issue=3 | year=2013 | journal=Indian J Psychiatry | pages=224–34 | last1 = Shastri | first1 = PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting research finds that strategies to regulate and control emotions, in order to enhance resilience, allows for better outcomes in the event of mental illness.&lt;ref name=Min&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.comppsych.2013.05.008| pmid = 23806709| title = Cognitive emotion regulation strategies contributing to resilience in patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders| journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry| volume = 54| issue = 8| pages = 1190–7| year = 2013| last1 = Min | first1 = J.

H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While initial studies of resilience originated with developmental scientists studying children in high-risk environments, a study on 230 adults diagnosed with depression and anxiety that emphasized emotional regulation, showed that it contributed to resilience in patients. These strategies focused on planning, positively reappraising events, and reducing rumination helped in maintaining a healthy continuity.&lt;ref name=Min/&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2016}} Patients with improved resilience were found to yield better treatment outcomes than patients with non-resilience focused treatment plans,&lt;ref name=Min/&gt; providing potential information for supporting evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions that may better handle mental disorders by focusing on the aspect of psychological resilience.

Military organizations test personnel for the ability to function under stressful circumstances by deliberately subjecting them to stress during training. Those students who do not exhibit the necessary resilience can be screened out of the training. Those who remain can be given stress inoculation training. The process is repeated as personnel apply for increasingly demanding positions, such as [[special forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Robson | first =Sean | author-link = | last2 =Manacapilli | first2 =Thomas | author2-link = | title =Enhancing Performance Under Stress: Stress Inoculation Training for Battlefield Airmen | place =Santa Monica, California | publisher =[[RAND Corporation]] | series = | volume = | orig-year = | year =2014 | month= | edition = | chapter = | chapter-url = | page = | pages =61 | language = | url =http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR750/RAND_RR750.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn =9780833078445 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

Resilience in children refers to individuals who are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, it is not a trait or something that some children simply possess. There is no such thing as an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Resilience is the product of a number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children experience small exposures to adversity or some sort of age appropriate challenges to develop mastery and continue to develop competently.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, T. M., Egeland, B., &amp; Sroufe, L. A. (2003). "Rethinking resilience: A developmental process perspective", pp. 234–256 in S. S. Luthar (Ed.), ''Resilience and vulnerability: Adaptation in the context of childhood adversities''. New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives children a sense of personal pride and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven J. Wolin, M.D.|author2=Sybil Wolin, Ph.D.|title=The Resilient Self: How Survivors of Troubled Families Rise Above Adversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UF3-Wjg4SoC|year=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-75687-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on 'protective factors', which are characteristics of children or situations that particularly help children in the context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents).&lt;ref&gt;Luthar, S. S. (2006). "Resilience in development: A synthesis of research across five decades", pp. 739–795 in D. Cicchetti and D. J. Cohen (Eds.), ''Developmental Psychopathology (2nd ed.): Vol. 3 Risk, Disorder, and Adaptation''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.

===Building in the classroom===

Resilient children within classroom environments have been described as working and playing well and holding high expectations, have often been characterized using constructs such as [[locus of control]], [[self-esteem]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Garmezy, N. (1974, August) ''The study of children at risk: New perspectives for developmental psychopathology.''&lt;/ref&gt; All of these things work together to prevent the debilitating behaviors that are associated with [[learned helplessness]].

===Role of the community===
Communities play a huge role in fostering resilience. The clearest sign of a cohesive and supportive community is the presence of social organizations that provide healthy human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garmezy | first1 = N. | year = 1991 | title = Resiliency and vulnerability to adverse developmental outcomes associated with poverty | journal = American Behavioral Scientist | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 416–430 | doi = 10.1177/0002764291034004003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Services are unlikely to be used unless there is good communication concerning them.

===Role of the family===

Fostering resilience in children requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold high expectations for children's behavior and encourage participation in the life of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Haertel, &amp; Walberg, M. C., G. D., &amp; H. J (Ed.). (1994). ''Educational Resilience in Inner Cities.'' Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="Benard, B. 1991"&gt;Benard, B. (1991) [https://archive.org/details/fosteringresilie00benarich ''Fostering resiliency in kids: Protective factors in the family, school and community.''] Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience.&lt;ref name=w1989/&gt; Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Families in poverty===
Numerous studies have shown that some practices that poor parents utilize help promote resilience within families. These include frequent displays of warmth, affection, emotional support; reasonable expectations for children combined with straightforward, not overly harsh discipline; family routines and celebrations; and the maintenance of common values regarding money and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Cauce, Ana Mari; Stewart, Angela; Rodriguez, Melanie D.; Cochran, Bryan; Ginzler, Joshua.

Luthar (ed.), ''Resilience and Vulnerability: Adaptation in the Context of Childhood Adversities''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Christopher B. Doob, "Poor children growing up in resilient families have received significant support for doing well as they enter the social world—starting in daycare programs and then in schooling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher B.|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence#Resilience}}

Beyond preventing [[bullying]], it is also important to consider how interventions based on emotional intelligence (EI) are important in the case that bullying does occur. Increasing EI may be an important step in trying to foster resilience among victims. When a person faces stress and adversity, especially of a repetitive nature, their ability to adapt is an important factor in whether they have a more positive or negative outcome.&lt;ref name=Brisa&gt;Monroy Cortés, B. G. &amp; Palacios Cruz, L. (2011) [http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=58220785008 Resiliencia: ¿Es posible medirla e influir en ella?] ''Salud Mental'', ''34''(3) 237–246. México: Instituto Nacional de Psiquiátrica Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz. {{ISSN|0185-3325}} [Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study examined adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being negatively associated with resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills as a form of intervention.&lt;ref name=Sapouna&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.05.009| title = Resilience to bullying victimization: The role of individual, family and peer characteristics| journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect| volume = 37| issue = 11| pages = 997–1006| year = 2013| last1 = Sapouna | first1 = M. | last2 = Wolke | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emotional intelligence]] has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2013.07.460| title = Emotional intelligence and resilience| journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 55| issue = 8| pages = 909–914| year = 2013| last1 = Schneider | first1 = T.

(2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.&lt;ref name=Schneider /&gt;

==Studies in specific populations and causal situations==

===Affected populations===

====Among transgender youth====

Transgender youth experience a wide range of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aspects of Psychological Resilience among Transgender Youth|journal=LGBT Youth|date=8 April 2011|volume=8|issue=2|pages=103–115|doi=10.1080/19361653.2011.541347|last1=Grossman|first1=Arnold H.|last2=d'Augelli|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Frank|first3=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among pregnant adolescents and depressive symptoms====

Pregnancies among adolescents are considered as a complication, as they favour education interruption, poor present and future health, higher rates of poverty, problems for present and future children, among other negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pérez-López FR, Chedraui P, Kravitz AS, Salazar-Pousada D, Hidalgo L |title= Present problems and controversies concerning pregnant adolescents|journal= Open Access Journal of Contraception |year=2011|volume=2 |pages=85–94|url= http://www.unizar.es/gine/adol.pdf|doi=10.2147/OAJC.S13398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators from the Ecuadorian Catholic University ([[Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil]]) (Guayaquil) and the Spanish [[University of Zaragoza]] (Zaragoza), performed a comparative study at the Enrique C. Sotomayor Obstetric and Gynecology Hospital (Guayaquil) assessing resilience differences between pregnant [[adolescents]] and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Salazar-Pousada | first1 = D. | last2 = Arroyo | first2 = D. | last3 = Hidalgo | first3 = L. | last4 = Pérez-López | first4 = F. R. | last5 = Chedraui | first5 = P. | title = Depressive Symptoms and Resilience among Pregnant Adolescents: A Case-Control Study | doi = 10.1155/2010/952493 | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology International | volume = 2010 | pages = 1–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21461335 | pmc =3065659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 56.6% of gravids presented total CESD-10 scores 10 or more indicating depressed mood. Despite this, total CESD-10 scores and depressed mood rate did not differ among studied groups. Adolescents did, however, display lower resilience reflected by lower total resilience scores and a higher rate of scores below the calculated median (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis could not establish any risk factor for depressed mood among studied subjects; however, having an adolescent partner and a preterm delivery related to a higher risk for lower resilience.

===Causal situations===

====Divorce====

Oftentimes divorce is viewed as detrimental to one's emotional health, but studies have shown that cultivating resilience may be beneficial to all parties involved. The level of resilience a child will experience after their parents have split is dependent on both internal and external variables. Some of these variables include their psychological and physical state and the level of support they receive from their schools, friends, and family friends.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; The ability to deal with these situations also stems from the child's age, gender, and temperament. Children will experience divorce differently and thus their ability to cope with divorce will differ too. About 20–25% of children will "demonstrate severe emotional and behavioral problems" when going through a divorce.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; This percentage is notably higher than the 10% of children exhibiting similar problems in married families.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1741-3729.2003.00352.x| title = Children's Adjustment Following Divorce: Risk and Resilience Perspectives| journal = Family Relations| volume = 52| issue = 4| pages = 352–362| year = 2003| last1 = Kelly | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Emery | first2 = R. E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having divorces parents of approximately 75–80% of these children will "develop into well-adjusted adults with no lasting psychological or behavioral problems". This comes to show that most children have the tools necessary to allow them to exhibit the resilience needed to overcome their parents' divorce.

The effects of the divorce extend past the separation of both parents. The remaining conflict between parents, financial problems, and the re-partnering or remarriage of parents can cause lasting stress.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; Studies conducted by Booth and Amato (2001) have shown that there is no correlation between post-divorce conflict and the child's ability to adjust to their life circumstance.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; On the other hand, Hetherington (1999) completed research on this same topic and did find adverse effects in children.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; In regards to the financial standing of a family, divorce does have the potential to reduce the children's style of living. Child support is often given to help cover basic needs such as schooling. If the parents' finances are already scarce then their children may not be able to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and music lessons, which can be detrimental to their social lives.

Repartnering or remarrying can bring in additional levels of conflict and anger into their home environment. One of the reasons that re-partnering causes additional stress is because of the lack of clarity in roles and relationships; the child may not know how to react and behave with this new "parent" figure in their life. In most cases, bringing in a new partner/spouse will be the most stressful when done shortly after the divorce. In the past, divorce had been viewed as a "single event", but now research shows that divorce encompasses multiple changes and challenges.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; It is not only internal factors that allow for resiliency, but the external factors in the environment are critical for responding to the situation and adapting. Certain programs such as the 14-week Children's Support Group and the Children of Divorce Intervention Program may help a child cope with the changes that occur from a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.childrensinstitute.net/sites/default/files/documents/children-resilience-family-court-review.pdf|author=Pedro-Carroll, JA |title= Fostering children's resilience in the aftermath of divorce: The told of evidence based programs for children|journal= Family Court Review|volume=43|year=2005|pages=52–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural disasters====
Resilience after a natural disaster can be gauged in a number of different ways. It can be gauged on an individual level, a community level, and on a physical level. The first level, the individual level, can be defined as each independent person in the community. The second level, the community level, can be defined as all those inhabiting the locality affected. Lastly, the physical level can be defined as the infrastructure of the locality affected.&lt;ref name="ecologyandsociety.org"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.5751/ES-05377-180216|title=Education, Vulnerability, and Resilience after a Natural Disaster|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=18|issue=2|year=2013|last1=Frankenberg|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Sikoki|first2=Bondan|last3=Sumantri|first3=Cecep|last4=Suriastini|first4=Wayan|last5=Thomas|first5=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCAP funded research on how communities show resiliency in the wake of natural disasters.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Theme Study on Building Resilience to Natural Disasters and Major Economic Crises|journal= Welcome to UN ESCAP. |url= http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/ThemeStudy2013-full2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that, physically, communities were more resilient if they banded together and made resiliency an effort of the whole community.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; Social support is key in resilient behavior, and especially the ability to pool resources.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; In pooling social, natural, and economic resources, they found that communities were more resilient and able to over come disasters much faster than communities with an individualistic mindset.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt;

The World Economic Forum met in 2014 to discuss resiliency after natural disasters. They conclude that countries that are more economically sound, and have more individuals with the ability to diversify their livelihoods, will show higher levels of resiliency.&lt;ref name="weforum.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Building Resilience to Natural Disasters|journal= The World Economic Forum. |url= http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/building-resilience-natural-disasters-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not been studied in depth yet, but the ideas brought about through this forum appear to be fairly consistent with already existing research.&lt;ref name="weforum.org"/&gt;

====Death of a family member====

Little research has been done on the topic of family resilience in the wake of the death of a family member.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rynearson, Edward K. |title=Violent Death: Resilience and Intervention Beyond the Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoRCPUeylLYC&amp;pg=PP1|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-92633-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, clinical attention to bereavement has focused on the individual mourning process rather than on those of the family unit as a whole. Resiliency is distinguished from recovery as the "ability to maintain a stable equilibrium"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bonanno|first1=George A.|title=Loss, Trauma, and Human Resilience|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=20–8|pmid=14736317|year=2004|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is conducive to balance, harmony, and recovery. Families must learn to manage familial distortions caused by the death of the family member, which can be done by reorganizing relationships and changing patterns of functioning to adapt to their new situation.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Greeff|first1=Abraham P.|last2=Human|first2=Berquin|title=Resilience in families in which a parent has died|journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy|volume=32|pages=27–42|doi=10.1080/01926180490255765|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibiting resilience in the wake of trauma can successfully traverse the bereavement process without long-term negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2190/OM.61.1.b| title = Reactions to Loss Scale: Assessing Grief in College Students| journal = OMEGA – Journal of Death and Dying| volume = 61| pages = 25–51| year = 2010| last1 = Cooley | first1 = E.| last2 = Toray | first2 = T.| last3 = Roscoe | first3 = L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the healthiest behaviors displayed by resilient families in the wake of a death is honest and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss of a loved one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that helps to bind the family together through regular contact and order. The continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Therapeutic Interventions to Strengthen Resilience in Vulnerable Children|journal=School Psychology International|volume=35|issue=3|pages=309–337|doi=10.1177/0143034314529912|year=2014|last1=Heath|first1=M. A.|last2=Donald|first2=D. R.|last3=Theron|first3=L. C.|last4=Lyon|first4=R. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize resilience discourse and its rising popularity in their book, ''Resilient Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Brad|last2=Reid|first2=Julian|title=Resilient Life: The Art of Living Dangerously|date=2014|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-0-7456-7152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors assert that policies of resilience can put the onus of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts. Tied to the emergence of [[neoliberalism]], [[climate change]] theory, third-world development, and other discourses, Evans and Reid argue that promoting resilience draws attention away from governmental responsibility and towards self-responsibility and healthy psychological affects such as "posttraumatic growth".

Another criticism regarding resilience is its definition. Like other psychological phenomena, by defining specific psychological and affective states in certain ways, controversy over meaning will always ensue. How the term resilience is defined affects research focuses; different or insufficient definitions of resilience will lead to inconsistent research about the same concepts. Research on resilience has become more heterogeneous in its outcomes and measures, convincing some researchers to abandon the term altogether due to it being attributed to all outcomes of research where results were more positive than expected.&lt;ref name=burt&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579412000119| pmid = 22559126| title = Resilience in the transition to adulthood| journal = Development and Psychopathology| volume = 24| issue = 2| pages = 493–505| year = 2012| last1 = Burt | first1 = K. B. | last2 = Paysnick | first2 = A. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also controversy about the indicators of good psychological and social development when resilience is studied across different cultures and contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyden, J. &amp; Mann, G.

The '''Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute''' (QSMI) ({{lang-th|สถานเสาวภา}} ''Sathan Saovabha'') in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], is a [[institute]] that specialises in the [[husbandry]] of venomous [[snakes]], the extraction and [[research]] of [[snake venom]], and vaccines, especially [[rabies vaccine]]. It houses the '''[[snake farm]]''', a popular tourist attraction.

The origins of the institute can be traced back to 1912 when [[Vajiravudh|King Rama VI]] granted permission for a government institute to manufacture and distribute [[rabies]] vaccine at the suggestion of [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Prince Damrong]], whose daughter, [[:th:หม่อมเจ้าบันลุศิริศานต์ ดิศกุล|Princess Banlusirisarn]], died from rabies infection. It was officially opened on 26 October 1913 in the Luang Building on Bamrung Muang Road as the ''Pastura Institute'' after [[Louis Pasteur]], who discovered the first vaccine against rabies. In 1917 it was renamed the ''Pasteur Institute'' and placed under the supervision of the [[Thai Red Cross Society]]. The institute also produced vaccine against [[smallpox]]. The Travel and Immunization Clinic is now located here. If offers vaccines and pre-travel consultation. 

In the early-1920s the king offered his private property for the construction of a new home for the institute on Rama IV Road. The new buildings were officially opened on 7 December 1922, now named for the king's mother, [[Saovabha Phongsri|Queen Saovabha Phongsri]]. At the same time, the institute's first director, Dr. Leopold Robert, requested contributions from foreigners living in Thailand for the establishment of a snake farm, which would enable the institute to manufacture [[antivenom]] for snake bites. Reportedly the second snake farm in the world after the one in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, it was opened on 22 November 1923 by [[Savang Vadhana|Queen Savang Vadhana]], then President of the Thai Red Cross, on the institute's premises.

Research into snake venom is highly important, since many people fall victim to venomous snake bites. Normally only an [[antidote]] that is based from the same snake's venom can save the individual's life.

The snake farm houses thousands of some of the most venomous snakes in the world, such as the [[king cobra]] and all sorts of [[Viperidae|viper]]s. Visitors can see handlers interact with [[Pythonidae|python]]s, and venom extractions can be seen. There is also a museum, and lectures are given.

The QSMI and the snake farm are near [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]], on the corner of [[Henri Dunant Road]] and Rama IV Road.

'''Reginald "Reg" Piggott''' (1930 – c. 2014) was a British book [[cartographer]] whose maps were known for their elegance, clarity, and distinctive italic script. His work was published by [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[The Folio Society]] among other presses. Early in his life, he was a campaigner for better handwriting and in 1957 organised a survey of British handwriting which drew over 25,000 responses and was subsequently published in book form. He advocated the use of a form of italic script to replace the civil service script widely used in Britain which he thought tended to illegibility when written at speed.

==Early life and family==
Reginald Piggott was born in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;British Library catalogue. Retrieved 23 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He married Marjorie. He was a long time resident of Decoy Lodge, Decoy Road, [[Potter Heigham]], Norfolk.

==Handwriting survey==
In February 1957,&lt;ref&gt;"Handwriting", Reginald Piggott, Letters to the Editor, ''The Observer'', 17 February 1957, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; eleven newspapers and journals published a letter from Reginald Piggott of 10 Finlay Drive, Dennistoun, Glasgow, in which he requested samples of handwriting. By far the greatest response came from readers of ''[[The Observer]]'' whose readers sent him 15,000 samples of their writing. In an article in that paper in March 1957, Piggott explained that he had been interested in the history of handwriting since he had begun to study [[calligraphy]] and that he wished to develop a "practical, everyday cursive" script to replace the civil service style then in use in Britain that was derived from Victorian [[Copperplate script|copperplate writing]] but which tended to illegibility when written at speed. By gathering samples of handwriting, he hoped to develop a new style that would command widespread acceptance. He made clear that he was not a [[Graphology|graphologist]] and was not offering insights into the character of the writer.&lt;ref name=obs&gt;"Handwriting To-morrow", Reginald Piggott, ''The Observer'', 10 March 1957, pp. 10 &amp; 12. ProQuest Historical Newspapers. Retrieved 4 July 2016. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piggott envisaged a simplified script that dispensed with loops and flourishes and reduced letter forms to as fundamental a shape as possible. In a [[running script]], joins were to be made in the simplest manner. He went on to discuss the beauty of [[italic script]], which he used in his own writing, and the unsuitability of the [[ball point pen]] to produce it before concluding that once his research was complete "and it is certain that the new style is near perfect", then it could be widely adopted, leading to a great improvement in the handwriting of the nation.&lt;ref name=obs/&gt;

The results of the survey were published in 1958 as ''Handwriting: A national survey, together with a plan for better modern handwriting'' by which time Piggott had acquired over 25,000 samples of handwriting.&lt;ref name="Hensher"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hensher, Philip.|title=The Missing Ink: How Handwriting Made Us Who We Are|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4BoNlW2-QEYC&amp;pg=PT41|year=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-76736-2|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sassoon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sassoon, Rosemary.|title=Handwriting of the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-FUcR7Pq7sC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2007|publisher=Intellect Books|location=Bristol|isbn=978-1-84150-178-9|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He analysed the results of his survey according to multiple characteristics including sex, age and occupation, and concluded with a chapter outlining a plan for better modern writing using a form of italic script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1141549 "Handwriting: A national survey"], Linton Godown, ''[[The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science]]'', Vol. 49, No. 6 (Mar.- Apr., 1959), pp. 625-626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/999367 "On Italic Handwriting"], Frank N. Freeman, ''[[The Elementary School Journal]]'', Vol. 60, No. 5 (Feb., 1960), pp. 258-264.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''New Scientist'', Gail Vines placed Piggott's research and the public's enthusiasm for the project in the context of rapid social and technological change in the 1950s that resulted in a moral panic about declining standards of penmanship that reflected a generalised anxiety about threats to standards in a changing world.&lt;ref&gt;"The big scribble", Gail Vines, ''[[New Scientist]]'', 25 June 2005, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartography==
Piggott's cartography was known for its clarity and elegance which was aided by his distinctive italic lettering. In 2014, the travel writer [[Nicholas Crane]] described him as "the most brilliant book-cartographer of our generation".&lt;ref&gt;"Cartographers: Masters of omission" by Nicholas Crane in ''Folio'', March 2014, pp. 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

He produced numerous maps for Cambridge University Press,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemble.asnc.cam.ac.uk/node/79 Maps of Anglo-Saxon England.] Kemble: The Anglo-Saxon Charters Website. Retrieved 22 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a long association with The Folio Society for whose books he produced many works, including a double page map of the spread of the [[Great Fire of London]] which was included in their volume on that subject published in 2003. He prepared the maps for ''[[The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain]]'' (1984) and with his wife Marjorie for volumes of [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s ''The Buildings of England''.

In 2012, Aurum Press published ''Mile by mile London to Paris'' in which the route between the cities was mapped out by Piggott with a text by Matt Thompson, assuming a journey by the [[Golden Arrow (train)|Golden Arrow]], when it existed, and the [[Eurostar]] more recently.

'''Science studies'''  is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] research area that seeks to situate scientific [[expertise]] in broad social, historical, and philosophical contexts. It uses various methods to analyze the production, representation and reception of scientific knowledge and its [[epistemology|epistemic]] and [[semiotics|semiotic]] role.

Similarly to [[cultural studies]], science studies are defined by the subject of their research and encompass a large range of different theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. The interdisciplinary approach may include and borrow methods from the humanities, natural and formal sciences, from [[scientometrics]] to [[ethnomethodology]] or [[cognitive science]]. Science studies have a certain importance for [[evaluation]] and science policy. Overlapping with the field of [[science, technology and society]], practitioners study the relationship between science and technology, and the interaction of expert and lay knowledge in the public realm.

== Scope ==
The field started with a tendency toward [[Omphaloskepsis|navel-gazing]]: it was extremely self-conscious in its genesis and applications.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; From early concerns with scientific [[discourse]], practitioners soon started to deal with the relation of scientific expertise to politics and lay people.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; Practical examples include [[bioethics]], [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), [[pollution]], [[global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Martello M (2004) Global change science and the Arctic citizen.Sci Public Policy 31(2):107–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff S (ed) (2004) States of knowledge: the co-production of science and social order. Routledge, Abingdon&lt;/ref&gt; [[biomedical sciences]], [[physical sciences]], [[natural hazard]] predictions, the (alleged) impact of the Chernobyl disaster in the UK, generation and review of science policy and risk governance and its historical and geographic contexts.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; While staying a discipline with multiple metanarratives, the fundamental concern is about the role of the perceived ̳expert‘ in providing governments and local authorities with information from which they can make decisions.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;
The approach poses various important questions about what makes an expert and how experts and their authority are to be distinguished from the lay population and interacts with the values and policy making process in liberal democratic societies.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

Practitioners examine the forces within and through which scientists investigate specific phenomena such as
* technological milieus, epistemic instruments and [[Epistemic cultures|cultures]] and [[laboratory life]] (compare [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]], [[Bruno Latour]], Hans-Jörg Rheinberger)
* Science and technology (e.g. [[Wiebe Bijker]], [[Trevor Pinch]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]])
* Science, technology and society (e.g. [[Peter Weingart]], [[Ulrike Felt]], [[Helga Nowotny]] and [[Reiner Grundmann]])
* Language and  [[rhetoric of science]] (e.g. [[Charles Bazerman]], [[Alan G. Gross]], Greg Myers)
* [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics and science|aesthetics of science]] and visual culture in science (u.a. [[:de:Peter Geimer]]), the role of aesthetic criteria in scientific practice (compare [[mathematical beauty]]) and the relation between emotion, [[cognition]] and rationality in the development of science.&lt;ref&gt;International Studies in the Philosophy of Science   Volume 16,  Issue 1, 2002, Recent work on aesthetics of science DOI:10.1080/02698590120118783 James W. McAllister pages 7-11, 21 Jul 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[semiotics|Semiotic]] studies of creative processes, as in the discovery, conceptualization, and realization of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interaction and management of different forms of knowledge in cooperative research.&lt;ref&gt;Organisierte Kreativität: Die vielen Gesichter der Innovation, Rene J.Jorna, in Zeichen für Kunst: Zur Organisierbarkeit von Kreativität Detlev Nothnagel, ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 ZfS, Band 29, Heft 4/2007 {{ISBN|978-3-86057-887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Large scale research and research institutions, e.g. particle colliders ([[Sharon Traweek]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Traweek | first = Sharon | author-link = Sharon Traweek | title = Beamtimes and lifetimes: the world of high energy physicists | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780674044449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[research ethics]], [[science policy]], and the role of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Biagioli: ''The science studies reader''. Routledge, New York 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-91867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek de Solla Price]]: ''Little Science, Big Science. Von der Studierstube zur Großforschung.'' Suhrkamp, 1982, {{ISBN|978-3518076484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the field ==
[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanislaw Ossowski]] started to introduce the concept in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kölbel: [http://www.dart-europe.eu/full.php?id=466024 ''Wissensmanagement in der Wissenschaft''], Berlin: Gesellschaft für Wissenschaftsforschung e.V. c/o Inst. f. Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, 2002, elektronische Bereitstellung 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn's]] ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) led to an increased interest in not only the [[history of science]], but also its [[history and philosophy of science|philosophical underpinnings]]. Kuhn's work established that the [[history of science]] was less a linear succession of discoveries, but rather the concept of [[paradigm]]s to the [[philosophy of science]]. Paradigms are broader, socio-intellectual constructs that determine which types of truth claims are permissible. Science studies try to identify crucial [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]] as in science and technology, nature and culture, theories and experiments; science and fine art leading to the separation of various science fields and practices. [[Sociology of scientific knowledge]] developed at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where [[David Bloor]] and his colleagues developed what has been termed the '[[strong programme]]'. The strong programme proposed that both 'true' and 'false' scientific theories should be treated the same way.&lt;ref&gt;David Bloor, "The strengths of the strong programme." Scientific rationality: The sociological turn (Springer Netherlands, 1984) pp. 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Wiebe E. Bijker, et al. The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology (MIT press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.&lt;ref&gt;Harry M. Collins, "Introduction: Stages in the empirical programme of relativism." Social studies of science (1981): 3-10. in JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

It proved however difficult to address natural science topics with sociologist methods, as proven by the US [[science wars]].&lt;ref name=thn/&gt; The use of a deconstructive approach (as for works on arts or religion) on natural sciences risked to endanger not only the "hard facts" of natural sciences, but as well the objectivity and positivist tradition of sociology itself.&lt;ref name=thn&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Latour | first = Bruno | author-link = Bruno Latour | title = When things strike back: a possible contribution of ‘science studies’ to the social sciences | journal = [[British Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–123 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | date = March 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2000.00107.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view on scientific knowledge production as a (at least partial) social construct was not easily accepted.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;  Latour and others identified a dichotomy crucial for modernity, the division between nature (things, objects) as being [[Transcendental idealism|transcendent]], allowing to detect them, and society (the subject, the state) as [[Immanence#Continental philosophy|immanent]] as being artificial, constructed. The dichotomy allowed for a mass production of things (technical-natural hybrids) and large scale [[global issue]]s that in the meanwhile threaten endangered the distinction as such. E.g. ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' asks to reconnect the social and natural worlds returning to the premodern use of "thing"&lt;ref&gt;In premodern times (and various languages) the term both meant an object and [[Thing (assembly)|an assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt; - addressing objects as hybrids made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lash | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Lash |year=1999 | title = Objects that judge: Latour's parliament of things, in another modernity, a different rationality | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford  | isbn = 9780631164999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science studies scholars such as [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Steve Woolgar]] started already in the 1980s to involve "technology", and called their field '[[science, technology and society]]'.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies&lt;/span&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Sergio+Sismondo%22 &lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; Sergio Sismondo&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt; John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/span&gt;, 17.08.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This "turn to technology" brought science studies into communication with academics in science, technology, and society programs.

More recently, a novel approach known as [[mapping controversies]] has been gaining momentum among science studies practitioners, and was introduced as a course for students in engineering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demoscience.org/ MIT] web.mit.edu Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ Ecoles Polytechniques Fédérales de Lausanne] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712012636/http://mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch/ |date=2012-07-12 }} mappingcontroversies.epfl.ch Retrieved on 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mappingcontroversies.co.uk University of Manchester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515123357/http://www.mappingcontroversies.co.uk/ |date=2009-05-15 }} mappingcontroversies.co.uk Retrieved on 2009-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 [[Harry Collins]] and Robert Evans asked for a third wave of science studies (a pun on ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler)|The Third Wave]]''), namely studies of ''expertise'' and ''experience'' answering to recent tendencies to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies of Science April 2002 vol. 32 no. 2 235-296 The Third Wave of Science Studies Studies of Expertise and Experience H.M.

=== Sheepfarming after Chernobyl ===
[[File:Pair of Herdwicks grazing.jpg|thumb|[[Herdwick]]s grazing in Cumbria]]

A showcase of the rather complex problems of scientific information and its interaction with lay persons is [[Brian Wynne]]'s study of Sheepfarming in Cumbria after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah&gt;Wynne B (1989) Sheepfarming after Chernobyl: a case study in communicating scientific information. Environment 31(2):33–39
&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on the responses of sheep farmers in [[Cumbria]], who had been subjected to administrative restrictions because of [[radioactive contamination]], allegedly caused by the nuclear accident at [[Chernobyl]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  The sheep farmers suffered economic losses and their resistance against the regulation imposed was being deemed irrational and not adequate.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt;  It turned out that the source of radioactivity was actually the [[Sellafield]] nuclear reprocessing complex; thus, the experts who were responsible for the duration of the restrictions were completely mistaken.&lt;ref name=mah/&gt; The example lead to various attempts to better involve local knowledge and experience of lay people and to assess its often highly geographically and historically defined background.&lt;ref&gt;Risk, Environment and Modernity: Towards a New Ecology [[Scott Lash]] [[Bronislaw Szerszynski]], [[Brian Wynne]] SAGE, 05.04.1996&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science studies / STS on volcanology ===
[[Image:Soufrière Hills volcanic aftermath (Aerial views, Montserrat, 2007) 02.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the 2007 [[Soufrière Hills]] eruption in Montserrat]]

Donovan et al. (2012) used and described the STS respectively science studies for ''social studies of [[volcanology]]'' and the generation of knowledge and expert advice on various active volcanoes.&lt;ref name=vulc&gt;Amy Donovan, Clive Oppenheimer, Michael Bravo. Social studies of volcanology: knowledge generation and expert advice on active volcanoes. Bulletin of Volcanology, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2012, 74 (3), pp.677-689. doi:&lt;10.1007/s00445-011-0547-z insu-00691620&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a survey of volcanologists carried out during 2008 and 2009 and interviews with scientists in the [[List of volcanoes in the United Kingdom|UK]], [[Soufrière Hills|Montserrat]], [[Volcanology of Italy|Italy]] and [[Volcanology of Iceland|Iceland]] during fieldwork seasons. Donovan et al. (2012) asked the experts about the felt purpose of volcanology and what they considered the most important eruptions in historical time. The survey tries to identify eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science and to assess the role of scientists in policymaking.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; 
A main focus was on the impact of the Montserrat eruption 1997. The eruption, a classical example of the [[black swan theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Donovan et al. (2012) cite Taleb NN (2007) The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable. Allen Lane, London 
&lt;/ref&gt; directly killed (only) 19 persons. However the outbreak had major impacts on the local society and destroyed important infractructure, as the [[W. H.

The Montserrat case put immense pressure on volcanologists, as their expertise suddenly became the primary driver of various public policy approaches.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The STS approach provided valuable insights in that situation.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; There were various miscommunications among scientists. Matching scientific uncertainty (typical of volcanic unrest) and the request for a single unified voice for political advice was a challenge.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; The Montserrat Volcanologists began to use statistical elicitation models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but allowing to synthesizing consensus and experience-based expertise step by step.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt; It involved as well local knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=vulc/&gt;

[[Volcanology]] as a science currently faces a shift of its epistemological foundations of volcanology. The science started to involve more research into risk assessment and risk management. It requires new, integrated methodologies for knowledge collection that transcend scientific disciplinary boundaries but combine qualitative and quantitative outcomes in a structured whole.&lt;ref&gt;Horlick-Jones T, Sime J (2004) Living on the border: knowledge, risk and transdisciplinarity. Futures 36(4):441&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experts and Democracy ==
Science has become a major force in Western democratic societies, which depend on innovation and technology (compare [[Risk society]]) to address its risks.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Beck"&gt;{{cite book |title=Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity |author=[[Ulrich Beck]] |publisher=Sage Publications |location=New Delhi |date=1992 |isbn=978-0803983465}} (in German: Die Risikogesellschaft 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Beliefs about science can be very different from those of the scientists themselves, for reasons of e.g. moral values, epistemology or political motivations.The designation of expertise as authoritative in the interaction with lay people and decision makers of all kind is nevertheless challenged in contemporary risk societies, as suggested by scholars who follow [[Ulrich Beck]]'s theorisation. The role of expertise in contemporary democracies is an important theme for debate among science studies scholars. Some argue for a more widely distributed, pluralist understanding of expertise ([[Sheila Jasanoff]] and [[Brian Wynne]], for example), while others argue for a more nuanced understanding of the idea of expertise and its social functions (Collins and Evans, for example).&lt;ref name="CollinsEvans"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking Expertise |first1= Harry |last1=Collins |first2=Robert |last2=Evans |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2007 |isbn=978-0226113623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins|first1=Harry |title=Interactional expertise as a third kind of knowledge |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=125–143 |issn=1568-7759 |doi=10.1023/B:PHEN.0000040824.89221.1a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual jealousy''' is a special form of [[jealousy]] in [[human sexuality|sexual]] relationships, present in [[animal]]s that reproduce through [[internal fertilization]], and is based on suspected or imminent [[sexual infidelity]]. It is founded on the [[instinct]] of keeping [[gene]]s in the [[gene pool]] and expecting sexual partners to care for the [[offspring]]. The concept is studied in human and non-human [[primates]] in the field of [[evolutionary psychology]].

''Evolutionary psychologists'' have suggested that there is a gender difference in sexual jealousy driven by men and women's different reproductive biology.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The state of affairs: Explorations in infidelity and commitment|last=Duncombe, J., Harrison K., Allan., G, &amp; Marsden., D|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For men it is felt as a threat to his relationship's future because he could be cuckolded into raising children that are not his own. For women they can lose their relationship and all the benefits that entails to another. Research has shown that men are impacted more by sexual infidelity, while women are more impacted by emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David|title=Strategies of Human Mating|journal=Psychological Topics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=239–260|year=2006|url=http://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2015/09/strategies_of_human_mating2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation is from a ''social-cognitive perspective''. Typically men will place a lot of importance on their masculinity and sexual dominance. When the male's partner commits infidelity, these two components of his ego become severely threatened which is why men are more upset when a partner has sex with someone else. In contrast, women invest a lot of emotion into a relationship and will experience a threat to their self-perception when a partner commits infidelity, hence why women are more concerned with emotional infidelity rather than the sexual kind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some research has suggested that there are no sex differences in sexual jealousy, concluding that males and females both equally experience distress over emotional and sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal but how it manifests itself may differ across cultures.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hupka|first2=R|date=1987|title=Cross-cultural differences in the elicitation of sexual jealousy.|jstor=3812538|volume=23|issue=1|pages=12–22|ref=Buunk, Bram; Hupka, Ralph B.

Psychologists have found that males react very strongly to sexual infidelity, whereas females are more likely to forgive a one-time sexual adventure if it does not threaten the male [[parental investment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The moral animal: Why we are, the way we are: The new science of evolutionary psychology.|last = Wright, R.|publisher = Vintage|year = 2010|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, jealousy is likely to be evoked in females if they feel that their partner may leave them for another woman; this has been shown to be more likely to occur if the male commits emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Emotional infidelity occurs when one partner develops a meaningful, emotional attachment with someone outside of their primary romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy|last = Salovey, P.|publisher = The Guildford Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional jealousy ===
Many studies have shown that females tend to place a stronger emphasis on the emotional aspect of infidelity, over the sexual aspect; it is this emotional infidelity that becomes the focus of female sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most direct evidence for female's focus on emotional jealousy comes from Buss et al. (1992)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; who presented participants with scenarios in which they were asked to choose between a partner's sexual unfaithfulness and a partner's emotional unfaithfulness as the most distressing event. They found that more females than males reported a partner's emotional infidelity as the most distressing event. As well as using self-report measures, the researchers measured the participants' physiological responses ([[heart rate]] and [[electrodermal activity]]) to the scenarios; women were also found to be more physiologically upset to the idea of their partners committing emotional infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male sexual jealousy manifests itself in the emotion of jealousy, using or threatening with violence to ensure sexual exclusivity and the inclination to control women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This idea of males ensuring sexual exclusivity has also led to laws on [[adultery]].

=== Expression in females ===

==== Aggression ====
While most empirical research suggests that males are more likely to act aggressively in response to sexual jealousy, some studies have shown that females may also display aggression and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A mind of her own: The evolutionary psychology of women|last=Campbell, A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have been found to report that their hypothetical sexual jealousy would manifest itself as anger and physical aggression towards the man. It has been suggested that this is because women are more empathetic towards the "victim", triggering strong aggression towards the unfaithful man.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Cross, C. P., &amp; Campbell, A.
| date = 2011

| access-date =
| issue=5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not known if these hypothetical reports would become actions in real life situations. Furthermore, statistics on [[domestic violence]] continue to show that in relationships it is primarily men who are the abusers, rather than the women.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

On the other hand, it has been suggested that because it is the woman that ultimately chooses the mate, aggression caused by infidelity is directed at the rival female. As a result, when a woman is around a suspected rival female, she is more likely than a male counterpart to announce that her companion is "taken", and go out of her way to enhance her appearance to her spouse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Self-blame ====
Following infidelity, women are more likely to focus their sexual jealousy on their own relationship and self-blame. Women are also more likely to experience symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] following the infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Evidence for the interpretation that in jealousy situations women focus more on their own functioning as a partner comes from research by Dijkstra and Buunk (2002).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This research suggests that unlike men's jealousy, women's jealousy stems more from comparing their own qualities with those of the rival. That is, the higher the level of [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]], a personality characteristic referring to the tendency to compare one's characteristics with those of others, the more jealousy various rival characteristics evoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1991-98375-000|title=Intimate relationships|last=Brehm, S.

==== Mate guarding behaviour ====
''See main page:'' [[Mate guarding in humans]]

One behaviour arising from male's sexual jealousy towards their partner's sexual infidelity is mate guarding. These tactics are used to prevent partner infidelity and so might be used when there are perceived threats in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetz|first=Aaron T.|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|last3=Weekes-Shackelford|first3=Viviana A.|last4=Euler|first4=Harald A.|last5=Hoier|first5=Sabine|last6=Schmitt|first6=David P.|last7=LaMunyon|first7=Craig W.|date=2005-03-01|title=Mate retention, semen displacement, and human sperm competition: a preliminary investigation of tactics to prevent and correct female infidelity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886904001722|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=38|issue=4|pages=749–763|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2004.05.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; It results in several behaviours, researchers have documented up to 19 different tactics used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David|date=1988|title=From vigilance to violence: Tactics of mate retention in American undergraduates|url=|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=9|issue=5|pages=291–317|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90010-6|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes (but is not exclusive to):
* [[Violence]] directed towards competitors, 
* Taking up all of the mate's time so that they have no time to meet other potential mates,
* Emotionally manipulate their mate,
* Increase their possession signals with jewellery,
* Enhancing their appearance.

=== Attachment style ===
According to [[attachment theory]], the quality of a child's interactions with caregivers during times of need shape their future interactions; this includes later relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~psykliff/pubs/publications/at2.pdf|title=Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications|last=Cassidy, J.|publisher=The Guildford Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that insecure-avoidant individuals tend to report more sexual jealousy than those who are securely attached. This may be due to the fact that, in comparison to securely attached individuals, those who are insecurely attached tend to experience lower levels of trust, intimacy and stability in their romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal

H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex drive ===
[[Libido|Sex drive]], also known as libido, is the physiological need for sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The relation between sex drive and sexual attraction to men and women: A cross-national study of heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual men and women|last = Lippa, R.

=== Relationship quality ===

== Explanations ==
Researchers have proposed a number of theories to explain sexual jealousy in both males and females. In addition, some of these explanations can be used to explain the sex differences in sexual jealousy and why there may be differences in the degree to which people experience jealousy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Evolutionary psychology perspective ===

Evolutionary psychologists propose that the core function of sexual jealousy is to retain access to a valuable mate.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal

For males, their biggest concern when they commit to a relationship is ensuring that any offspring produced is biologically theirs, therefore, sexual infidelity is a huge threat to them as there is then a chance that they are not the [[Genetics|genetic]] parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a male raises a child that is not genetically his own, he has effectively wasted his resources raising another man's child, that will not pass on any of his genes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As women have genetic certainty when they bear a child this is not a concern to them, however, women do face a different evolutionary problem. If her partner becomes emotionally attached to another woman, there is a real chance that the male may share his resources with the other woman, or leave their current relationship all together. Either way, the female loses some of the male parental investment; the loss of her mate’s resources may significantly reduce the survival of herself and her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The evolutionary psychology perspective has been supported by a study conducted by David Buss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|date=2013|title=Sexual jealousy|url=|journal=Psychological Topics|volume=22|pages=155–182|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that male sexual jealousy is triggered by sexual infidelity, whereas female sexual jealousy was triggered by emotional infidelity. The study concluded that sexual jealousy may be an adaptive function in which is triggered in order to retain access to a valuable mate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Researchers David Buss and Todd Shackleford propose and test several hypotheses about sexual jealousy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|last2=Shackleford|first2=Todd K.|date=1997|title=From vigilance to violence: Mate retention tactics in married couples|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=72|issue=2|pages=346–361|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.2.346|pmid=|citeseerx=10.1.1.387.7053}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is younger than them, than men whose partner is older than them'''. This hypothesis rests on the evolutionary principle of [[Mate Value|mate value]]. Younger women are likely to have more mate value because they are more [[Fertility|fertile]]. Therefore, it is predicted that men are likely to engage in mate retention behaviours more often when their partner is younger rather than older than them.
# Resting on the principle of mate value again, is the prediction that '''men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is perceived to be [[physically attractive]], than when their partner is perceived to be less physically attractive'''. Females who are physically attractive have a higher mate value than those who are less physically attractive.
# '''Women will allocate more resources to mate retention when their partner has a wealth of resources than women whose partners have few resources'''. This hypothesis also rests on the mate value principle. Men who have more resources and wealth have a higher mate value than those who do not.
# '''If a man perceives his partner as having a higher mate value than him, then he is more likely to engage in efforts towards mate retention than men who perceive their partners as having a lower than or equal to mate value than them.''' This hypothesis rests on perceived mate value. If a male's partner has a higher mate value than him, she is more likely to be able to attract other men who may be of a similar mate value to her. As such, the male is at a greater risk of losing her to another man with a higher mate value.
# '''Individuals who suspect their partners are being unfaithful are more likely to devote effort towards mate retention than those who do not suspect their partners are being unfaithful.''' This hypothesis relies on the perceived probability of infidelity. Men risk being cuckolded into raising children that are not genetically his, and women risk losing their mate's resources and time.
Their research provided evidence to support all above hypotheses except for hypothesis 5; this effect was unique to men only.

=== The double-shot hypothesis ===
The hypothesis contradicts the evolutionary perspective.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=D.M.|last2=Larsen|first2=R.J.|last3=Westen|first3=D|date=1996|title=Special Section Commentary: Sex Differences in Jealousy: Not Gone, Not Forgotten, and Not Explained by Alternative Hypotheses.|journal=Psychological Science|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00392.x|pmid=|jstor=40062983|volume=7|issue=6|pages=373–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that these sex differences in feelings of sexual jealousy are due to beliefs and have not evolved.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The double-shot hypothesis (also known as the two-for-one hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitty|first=M.T|last2=Quigley|first2=L.L.|date=2008|title=Emotional and sexual infidelity offline and in cyberspace.|journal=Journal of Marital and Family Therapy|doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.2008.00088.x|pmid=19017185|volume=34|issue=4|pages=461–468|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/83753/7/WRAP_Emotional%20and%20Sexual%20infidelity_Whitty.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) suggests that women have a belief that men can have sexual relations without emotionally committing themselves. Women also believe that for men, to have emotional commitment, sex is a prerequisite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desteno|first=D.A|last2=Salovey|first2=P|date=1996|title=Evolutionary origins of sex differences in jealousy? Questioning the "fitness" of the model.|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/7/6/367.short|journal=Psychological Science|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00391.x|access-date=25 March 2016|volume=7|issue=6|pages=367–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if men and women place importance on different aspects of relationship, this explains why they may also be upset by different types of sexual jealousy differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiederman|first=M.W.|last2=Kendall|first2=E|date=1999|title=Evolution, sex, and jealousy: Investigation with a sample from Sweden.|url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(98)00046-4/abstract|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(98)00046-4
|pmid=|access-date=25 March 2016|volume=20|issue=2|pages=121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social-cognitive perspective ===
As both forms of jealousy are threatening to both men and women, the social-cognitive perspective suggests that there are no inherent, evolutionarily induced gender differences. Instead, both emotional and sexual jealousy are believed to occur when an individual believes that a rival is posing a threat to what one perceives to be a valuable interpersonal relationship. When the relationship or one's self-esteem is threatened, jealousy is evoked.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The perspective also provides explanations as to why men would be more upset by sexual infidelity than women. Men are socialized to be masculine, which includes having great sexual prowess. If a man’s partner commits sexual infidelity, this brings into question his sexual prowess and therefore threatens his masculinity. This results a strong, negative reaction in response to the sexual infidelity, which does not tend to occur in response to emotional infidelity. In contrast, women are taught to be emotional nurturers in a relationship, therefore, if their partner commits emotional infidelity, this may threaten her sense of self more than if her partner commits sexual infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The social-cognitive perspective also proposes the '''''transactional model of jealousy''''', which can be used to explain why there may be differences in the degree to which individuals experience sexual jealousy within genders, as well as between genders. This model examines how three variables – (1) [[Physiological arousal|arousability]], (2) [[Personal commitment|commitment]] and, (3) insecurity – moderate jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

# Individual differences in sexual jealousy are determined by the difference in levels of ''physiological arousal'': individuals who are easily aroused have more intense jealous reactions, than those with lower physiological arousal
# ''Commitment'' refers to the degree of dedication a person has in the relationship: the more committed a person is to a relationship, the greater the threat of loss, which leads to greater feelings of jealousy
# ''Insecurity'' refers to the perceived level of commitment of the partner: if we perceive our partner to be uninvolved or disinterested in the relationship, we feel more insecure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The degree to which these factors are experienced together determine the intensity of sexual jealousy felt by an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Culture  ==
Sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal and affects both men and women.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; However, the extent of sexual jealousy varies across cultures. Sexual jealousy is strongly mediated by culture in both heterosexual and homosexual couples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=R.O.|date=1990|title=The Relationship Between Culture, Personality, and Sexual Jealousy in Men in Heterosexual and Homosexual Relationships|url=http://search.proquest.com/psycinfo/docview/617891480/113308AE58FC4D14PQ/2?accountid=14888|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|doi=10.1300/j082v19n03_04|pmid=2212631|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=19|issue=3|pages=67–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  in males, is said to be prevalent in cultures in which heritability runs through the male side.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=W|last2=Eagly|first2=A.H.|date=2002|title=A cross-cultural analysis of the behavior of women and men: implications for the origins of sex differences.|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.699|pmid=12206191|volume=128|issue=5|pages=699–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evocation ===

There are cross-cultural differences in behaviours that evoke sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Specifically, one study focused on seven different countries: Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Yugoslavia. Different behaviours were found to elicit different extents of sexual jealousy. For instance, flirting, kissing and sexual involvement elicit sexual jealousy across all of the nations. However, dancing, hugging and kissing evoke very different reactions across cultures. In the Soviet Union, the most sexual jealousy is seen across dancing, hugging, flirting and kissing behaviours. Yugoslavian participants display the most intense sexual jealousy to flirting behaviour but the least to kissing. Dutch participants show the least sexual jealousy to kissing, dancing and hugging behaviours.

=== In Western cultures ===
Societies that permit extra-marital sexual relations, often discourage sexual jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Canela: Bonding through kinship, ritual, and sex.|last=Crocker|first=W|last2=Crocker|first2=J|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|year=1994|isbn=|location=Fort Worth, TX|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Denmark very low sexual jealousy rates are determined by the very low 10% disapproval of extra-marital sex. On the other hand, individuals in the American Midwest show high feelings of sexual jealousy which corresponds to the 90% disapproval of extra-marital sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=H.T.|date=1973|title=Attitudes toward marital infidelity: A nine-cultural sampling of university student opinion.|url=|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|jstor=41600842|volume=4|pages=197–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American men also feel more sexual jealousy compared to German men&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buunk|first=B.P.|last2=Angleitner|first2=A|last3=Oubaid|first3=V|last4=Buss|first4=D.M.|date=1996|title= Sex differences in jealousy in evolutionary and cultural perspective: Tests from the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States.|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/7/6/359.short|journal=Psychological Science|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00389.x|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=7|issue=6|pages=359–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; when asked which would cause them more distress: i) a partner having formed a strong emotional attachment with another person or ii) a partner having passionate sexual intercourse with another person. Scenario i) measured sexual jealousy and scenario ii) measured emotional jealousy. The American men reported 33% greater sexual and emotional jealousy compared to German men.

Greater sexual jealousy seen in American men may be because in American culture, love, sex, family relationships and marriage are strongly connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Sexual Tragedy|last=Ellis|first=A|publisher=Lyle Stuart|year=1962|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, when partners therefore entangle with others, loss of love and relationship, and therefore sexual jealousy, is likely to be felt.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiederman|first=M.W|last2=Allgeier|first2=E.R|date=1993|title=Gender differences in sexual jealousy: Adaptionist or social learning explanation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309593900116|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(93)90011-6|pmid=|access-date=19 March 2016|volume=14|issue=2|pages=115–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in Western culture, inducement of sexual jealousy is more likely by females in their partners compared to men. Inducing sexual jealousy is to increase their partner's attention towards them and counteract sexual and emotional jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=G.L.|date=1980|title=Inducing Jealousy A Power Perspective|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/6/2/222.short|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|doi=10.1177/014616728062006|pmid=|access-date=19 March 2016|volume=6|issue=2|pages=222–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Western culture now is mainly monogamous which is very different to the environment in which the majority of evolution thus far has occurred.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Therefore, evolutionarily it is likely that different past cultures also showed differences in sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== In Eastern cultures ===
Cross-cultural comparisons between China and United States reveal that, regardless of nation, men show greater sexual jealousy than women. Females show significantly higher levels of emotional jealousy. In contrast, between the nations, both men and women from the United States show greater sexual jealousy than Chinese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geary|first=David C|last2=Rumsey|first2=Michael|last3=Bow-Thomas|first3=Christine|last4=Hoard|first4=Mary K|date=1995|title=Sexual jealousy as a facultative trait: Evidence from the pattern of sex differences in adults from China and the United States.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309595000577|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00057-7|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=16|issue=5|pages=355–383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary India, sexual jealousy is a primary cause of violence towards women compared to other causes. Approximately fifty-one per cent of the violence towards women in an Indian sample was due to sexual jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panchanadeswaran|first=S|last2=Koverola|first2=C|date=2005|title=The voices of battered women in India|url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/11/6/736.abstract|journal=Violence Against Women|doi=10.1177/1077801205276088|pmid=16043569|access-date=19 March 2016|volume=11|issue=6|pages=736–758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In history, between 1880 and 1925, there were a large number of suicides amongst Indian immigrants on plantations in Fiji that reports attributed to sexual jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sites of desire/economies of pleasure: Sexualities in Asia and the Pacific.|last=Manderson|first=L|last2=Jolly|first2=M|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual Jealousy was high amongst these immigrants due to the disproportionate number of sexes: high numbers of men to few women. In suicide reports, sexual jealousy was described as a "racial trait" in Indian men and that it was evoked when European men slept with their women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lal|first=B.V|date=1985|title=Veil of Dishonour: Sexual jealousy and suicide on Fiji plantations|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|doi=10.1080/00223348508572516|pmid=11617439|jstor=25168874|volume=20|issue=3|pages=135–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations for cross-cultural differences ==

=== Evolutionary psychology model ===
The differences feelings of the jealousy across cultures provides support for the evolutionary psychological model. Different weightings are given to triggers of sexual jealousy cross-culturally. In liberal cultures, male mating effort is based on the number of women. These men therefore invest less time in each woman and, therefore, exhibit less sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Paternity certainty ===
Paternity certainty is the extent to which a male knows or believes that a woman's child is his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=P.J.|date=1978|title=Promiscuity, paternity, and culture.|journal=American Ethnologist|doi=10.1525/ae.1978.5.1.02a00110|pmid=|volume=5|pages=151–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In polygamous societies, men feel greater sexual jealousy when there is low paternity certainty.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This is because they don't want to risk losing time, energy and resources to a child that is not theirs.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Socio-economic differences between cultures also affects paternity certainty.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; In "natural fertility" countries, such as Namibia, 96% of males show sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scelza|first=B.A.|date=2014|title=Jealousy in a small-scale, natural fertility population: the roles of paternity, investment and love in jealous response.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513813001219|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2013.11.003|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=35|issue=2|pages=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is greater likelihood of paternity loss and uncertainty due to lack of contraceptives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This provides another explanation for why industrialised countries tend to show lower sexual jealousy compared to pre-industrialised.

SDWA ceased to exist on the 1st of April 2014 after it successfully met all its Key Performance Indicators. The collaboration between NUS and Deltares is continued through [http://www.nusdeltares.org NUSDeltares].

== History ==
As part of [[w:Singapore|Singapore's]] push to be a Global Hydrohub, a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;(2006, Jun. 27). MOU for water knowledge signed, The Business Times.&lt;/ref&gt; between NUS, PUB and Delft Hydraulics to create a center of excellence for water knowledge at NUS . This MoU resulted in the creation of  SDWA which was officially launched in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Chow P.N.(2007, Feb.   8). Singapore as a hydrohub.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Focus ==
SDWA's research focus was within the following six disciplines:
* [[hydrodynamics]]
* [[hydrology]]
* [[morphodynamics]]
* [[water quality]] and [[ecology]]
* [[policy analysis]]
* [[hydroinformatics]]

==Projects==
SDWA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20101122233248/http://www.sdwa.nus.edu.sg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=116 research projects] were interdisciplinary. The major ongoing research projects were:
* MHBox: This project focused on understanding and developing a pre-operational forecasting system for residual currents and water levels.&lt;ref&gt;Tan. T. (2007, Feb. 17). Systems to forecast tides and currents. The Straits Times, Science.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Peatland: Peatlands store a large fraction of the world's carbon resources. However the most rapid peatland degradation currently occurs in Southeast Asia. The aims of this project were to support large-scale implementation of mitigative water management and improved spatial planning of production and conservation areas in peatlands.
* ASC Pandan: This project aimed to understand the fundamental processes and interactions in an urban water system to be able to develop adequate and cost-effective water improvement measures&lt;ref&gt;(2007, Feb. 17).

The Straits Times, Home, p10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newshub.nus.edu.sg/headlines/0708/asc_3jul08.php Aquatic Science Centre in Pandan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mangroves: This project looked in several aspects of mangoves, such as rates of sediment capture and erosion, and dispersion of seeds. The research is continued at the [http://www.themangrovelab.com/ Mangrove Lab].&lt;ref&gt;Tan. T. (2007, Feb. 17). Harnessing plant power to absorb tidal waves. The Straits Times, Science.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seagrass Project: This project aimed to improve understanding of the natural dynamics of seagrass ecosystems in tropical coastal waters in response to environmental variability in turbidity and sedimentation.
* Sediment Project: The project 'Large Scale Sediment Transport and Turbidity in Singapore's Coastal Waters' aimed to determine the processes responsible for the increased turbidity by identification of a sediment budget of the Singapore coastal waters, including the main sources and sinks (and the changes thereof) and of the dominant sediment transport mechanisms.
* Upper Peirce: The SDWA Upper Peirce research programme was focussed on gaining better insights into the hydrological, hydrodynamic, chemical, biological and biochemical processes of tropical reservoirs through experimental work, modelling, and advanced and innovative monitoring.
* Multi-Reservoir: The Multi-Objective Multiple-Reservoir Management project aimed at developing tools and methods for maximising catchment yield and satisfying pre-set water quality standards, while at the same time ensure flood protection for reservoir systems.

SDWA also carried out several large research projects for Singapore agencies such as the Public Utilities Board and National Environmental Agency.

== Education ==
SDWA considered that strong research capabilities and activities are essential to education and training. As such students and course participants were exposed to mature reflections on the results generated through the research projects in which SDWA members were involved, and also to results from research done elsewhere.

As part of this approach SDWA was spearheading a new double M.Sc. degree program in Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management in collaboration between the National University of Singapore and the Delft University of Technology. The programme is based on an institutionally innovative concept under which students spend one year of study in both Singapore and The Netherlands and receive separate M.Sc. degrees from both Universities.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
'''Spirit of place''' (or soul) refers to the unique, distinctive and cherished aspects of a place; often those celebrated by artists and writers, but also those cherished in [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[festival]]s and celebrations. It is thus as much in the invisible weave of culture ([[folklore|stories]], art, memories, beliefs, histories, etc.) as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place ([[monument]]s, boundaries, [[river]]s, [[woodland|woods]], architectural style, [[rural crafts]] styles, pathways, [[Vista (landscaping)|views]], and so on) or its [[interpersonal]] aspects (the presence of [[Kinship|relatives]], [[friendship|friends]] and kindred spirits, and the like).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Often the term is applied to a rural or a relatively unspoiled or regenerated place &amp;mdash; whereas the very similar term [[sense of place]] would tend to be more domestic, [[urbanist|urban]], or [[suburban]] in tone. For instance, one could logically apply 'sense of place' to an urban high street; noting the [[architecture]], the width of the [[road]]s and [[Sidewalk|pavement]]s, the [[plants|plantings]], the style of the [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]]-fronts, the [[street furniture]], and so on, but one could not really talk about the 'spirit of place' of such an essentially urban and commercial environment. However, an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep meaning in [[children's street culture]].{{or|date=December 2016}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] term for spirit of place was [[Genius loci]], by which it is sometimes still referred. This has often been historically envisaged as a guardian [[animal]] or a small supernatural being ([[puck (mythology)|puck]], [[fairy]], [[elf]], and the like) or a [[ghost]]. In the developed world these beliefs have been, for the most part, discarded. A new layer of less-embodied superstition on the subject, however, has arisen around [[ley lines]], [[feng shui]] and similar concepts, on the one hand, and urban leftover spaces, such as back alleys or gaps between buildings in some North-American downtown areas, on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akkerman and A.F. Cornfeld (2010) "Greening as an urban design metaphor: Looking for the city's soul in leftover spaces," The ''[https://www.usask.ca/structurist/ Structurist]'' 49/50: 30-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The western cultural movements of [[Romanticism]] and [[Neo-romanticism]] are often deeply concerned with creating cultural forms that 're-enchant the land', in order to establish or re-establish a spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;T. Graves and L. Poraj-Wilezynska (2009) "'Spirit of place' as process: Archaeography, dowsing and perceptual mapping at Belas Knap," ''[http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx Time and Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123161318/http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx |date=2010-11-23 }}'' 2: 167-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[earth art]] (sometimes called environment art) artists such as [[Andy Goldsworthy]] have explored the contribution of natural/ephemeral sculpture to spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;B. E. Bannon (2011) "Re-envisioning nature: The role of aesthetics in environmental ethics," ''[http://www.cep.unt.edu/enethics.html Environmental Ethics]'' 33(4): 415-436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, R. (2008) Andy Goldsworthy: Nature's collaborator, art's alchemist," ''[http://www.queensu.ca/quarterly/ Queen's Quarterly]'' 114(4): 597-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many indigenous and tribal cultures around the world are deeply concerned with spirits of place in their [[landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;Opp, J. (2011) "Public history and the fragments of place: Archaeology, history and heritage site development in southern Alberta," ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rrhi20/current Rethinking History]'' 15: 241-267&lt;/ref&gt; Spirits of place are explicitly recognized by some of the world's main religions: [[Shinto]] has its [[Kami]] which may incorporate spirits of place; Christianity has spirits of place in the Angelic Choirs of [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Dominions|Dominions]] and [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Principalities|Principalities]], [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] and [[Bonpo]] traditions.

==Spirit of Place Symposia==

Between 1988 and 1993, five annual Spirit of Place Symposiums were produced by environmental psychologist James Swan and Roberta Swan, in the United States and Japan. The programs sought to explore the relationship between ancient wisdom about the importance of a sense or spirit of a place, and modern science and design. The programs—held in Davis, CA; Grace Cathedral, San Francisco' Mesa Verde National Park; Tenri, Japan; and San Rafael, CA—featured over 350 speakers, including scientists, designers, and representatives of natives cultures. They also included concerts by Paul Horn, Anna Halprin, [[Steven Halpern]], and R. Carlos Nakai. The five programs attracted an audience of 10,000, and featured on national TV in the United States and Japan. The 1992 symposium held in Tenri, Japan, was the largest environmental conference in Japan that year. Representatives of 20 different American Indian tribes, Ainu, Inuit, Aborigine, and African traditional cultures were speakers in the series. Two anthologies edited by James and Roberta Swan, ''The Power of Place'' (Quest, 1991) and ''Dialogues with the Living Earth'' (Quest, 1996) present a selection of presentations at the Spirit of Place Symposiums.

'''''The Naked Scientists''''' is a one-hour audience-interactive [[science]] radio talk show broadcast live by the [[BBC]] in the [[East of England]], nationally by BBC Radio 5 Live and internationally on [[Radio National|ABC Radio National, Australia]]; it is also distributed globally as a [[podcast]].

The programme was created and is edited by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] consultant virologist [[Chris Smith (doctor)|Dr Chris Smith]]. The present ''Naked Scientists'' line up also includes science broadcaster and harpist Kat Arney and producers Georgia Mills, Adam Murphy, Katie Haylor and Izzie Clarke, with [[Peter Cowley]] adding a technology perspective

In 2009 the group appointed the first official ''Naked Scientists'' PhD student, Diana O'Carroll, to examine the educational impacts of science broadcasting and new media. O'Carroll also set up a 
''Naked Scientists'' spin-off podcast, ''Naked Archaeology'', which launched in 2008. A second spin-off, ''Naked Astronomy'', featuring Cambridge University-based space scientists and astronomers, has been podcast since December 2009. Naked Astronomy also hosts the Space Boffins podcast, produced by journalists Richard Hollingham and Sue Nelson. A combined video and audio programme, ''Naked Engineering'', produced by Dave Ansell and Meera Senthilingam and supported by the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], launched in September 2010. For Christmas 2010 the group also showcased a new video podcast strand, the ''Naked Science Scrapbook''. In 2012, a Naked Neuroscience strand was unveiled, and in 2013 the Material Chef video series, showcasing materials science, was launched.

==''Naked Scientists'' show content==
Each episode of the main ''Naked Scientists'' programme is one hour long and includes a digest of topical science news stories, audience questions answered live on the air and interviews with guest scientists. These individuals join the hosts in the studio to talk about their work and to take questions live from listeners. Previous featured guests include the discoverer of the DNA fingerprint,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/html/shows/2005.12.04.htm |title=Forensics, DNA Fingerprinting and Human Origins |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2005-12-04 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alec Jeffreys]], the  [[Astronomer Royal]]  Sir [[Martin Rees]], and the co-discoverer of [[DNA]] structure, [[James D. Watson]].

The show also features on-location reports and interviews, and an ad-hoc interactive segment called ''Kitchen Science'' where listeners are encouraged to attempt a science experiment at home during the show. Kitchen Science experiments have included building a desktop [[trebuchet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/the-trebuchet/ |title=The Trebuchet |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[chocolate]] [[teapot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/how-useless-is-a-chocolate-teapot/ |title=How useless is a Chocolate Teapot? |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Liver]] powered [[Bottle Rocket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/fizzes-from-peroxide/ |title=Fizzes from peroxide |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kitchen Science segment also hosts experiments that listeners may not be able to do at home, such as generating [[X-rays]] from Sticky Tape &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/glowing-tape/ |title=Glowing tape |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Dr Carlos Camara of [[UCLA]] and testing how much fat would stop a bullet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/kitchenscience/exp/how-fat-would-you-have-to-be-to-stop-a-bullet/ |title=How fat would you have to be to stop a bullet? |publisher=The Naked Scientists |date=2007-06-17 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with researchers at [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]].

==Awards and prizes==
''The Naked Scientists'' have won eight national and international awards for science communication since 2006. The show won the [[Biosciences Federation]] Prize for Science Communication, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsf.ac.uk/Media/award/sci_comm2006.htm Biosciences Federation Science Communication Award 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113175023/http://www.bsf.ac.uk/Media/award/sci_comm2006.htm |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Joshua Phillips Award for Innovation in Science Engagement in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/news/article.aspx?ID=232 |title=And the winner is... |publisher=[[Manchester Science Festival]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218231113/http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/news/article.aspx?ID=232 |archivedate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Society for General Microbiology]]'s Peter Wildy Prize 2008, the [[Royal Society]] [[Kohn Award]] for 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/awards/kohn-award/ |title=Royal Society Kohn Award |publisher=[[Royal Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Best Radio Show Award at the Population Institute's 29th Global Media Awards, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.populationinstitute.org/newsroom/press-release/?id=89 |title=29th Annual Global Media Award Winners Announced |publisher=The Population Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224102213/http://www.populationinstitute.org/newsroom/press-release/?id=89 |archivedate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Podcast Award]] for UK Non-Profit podcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.european-podcast-award.eu/european-podcast-award-0809-winners-announced-44 |title=European Podcast Award 08/09 Winners announced |date=2009-04-01 |publisher=European Podcast Award |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural Royal College of Pathologists Furness Prize for science communication 2010 and the Society of Biology Science Communication Prize 2012.

''The Naked Scientists'' was also in the five finalists in the 2006 World Podcast Awards and received two nominations, for "best produced" and "best science and technology podcast" in the 2007 awards. It was also a top five finalist in the 2008 and 2009 awards.

Bandwidth consumed by the programme's podcast exceeds 28TB (terabytes) of downloads per month and more than 40 million copies have been downloaded since 2007.

==Other media==
The Naked Scientists appeared on [[Five (TV channel)|TV Channel Five's]] [[panel game]] ''[[The What in the World? Quiz]]'' and have contributed to the 2007 [[Channel 4]] programme "The Farm Revealed". In September 2008, with the [[Open University]], the Naked Scientists launched a new UK national radio edition of their programme, ''The Naked Scientists - Up All Night'' (subsequently renamed "Breaking Science") which was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] for 12 months before finishing in 2009.

In November 2008, with the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], a series entitled ''The Naked Scientists In Africa'' began on [[Channel Africa]], the [[international broadcasting]] service of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]].   ''The Naked Scientists in Africa'' was produced by Naked Scientist team-member Meera Senthilingam, incorporating international science news and a focus on science stories originating in, or pertinent to, African countries. This project ran until 2010.

==Scheduling changes==
In August 2012, BBC East announced an impending change to the Sunday schedule, which would see the show discontinued. In response to public reaction, the head of BBC East, Mick Rawsthorne, was interviewed on national radio about the decision to end the programme. Rawsthorne explained that the ''Naked Scientists'' did not fit the station's core purpose of providing "local radio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curry |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2012/nov/20/1 |title=Radio Ga Ga: BBC axes popular science radio show|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2012-11-20 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nq3lx |title=BBC Radio 4 - Feedback, 09/11/2012 |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=2012-11-11 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rawsthorne did acknowledge the quality of the ''Naked Scientists'' programming and recognised that, with Cambridge University at the heart of Cambridgeshire, special consideration should be made for science in Cambridgeshire. Consequently, the BBC reconsidered their decision to terminate the programme and developed a proposal for it to continue as well as a way for enhanced scientific coverage and content to be integrated within the other mainstream mid-week outputs of [[BBC Cambridgeshire]], significantly increasing the reach of the programme and the representation of science within the outputs of BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.

From January 2013, a new initiative involving the Naked Scientists began on BBC Radio Norfolk. A dedicated hour of science Q and A was included within the station's Tea Time output (hosted by Matthew Gudgin) on alternate Wednesday evenings from 1800-1900. Listeners call, text, tweet or email with questions on any scientific subject and the team answer them.

==ABC Radio National, Australia==
From January 2013, the ''Naked Scientists'' programme also began to air across Australia on [[ABC Radio National]], initially on a Sunday morning. From January 2014 the first airing of the programme was moved to a Friday evening 10pm slot, repeated on Sundays at 1500. This show is also released as the Naked Scientists Podcast.

==BBC Radio 5 live Science==
Launched in May 2014, ''5 live Science'' is a new weekly one-hour programme from the Naked Scientists aired by [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC 5 live]]. Under the banner ''5 live Science'' it's a newly formatted version of the show produced by the Naked Scientists team and fronted by [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Dr Chris Smith]]; it airs nationally every Sunday morning. The programme is also released as a podcast under the same name. 

==Internship Programme==
The Naked Scientists regularly host paid internships including positions supported in the past by Cambridge University, the Royal Academy of Engineering, MRC (Medical Research Council), STFC (Science and Technology Facilities Council), the UK's Genetics Society and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The present programme targets science PhD students. Applicants are "bought out" from their research projects for two months to join the Naked Scientists team where they learn to participate in the programme-making process, including presenting, writing and publishing skills. In 2017 the Naked Scientists hosted their first international trainee when University of Western Australia PhD student Michael Wheeler joined the team, and in 2018 Virginia Tech students Marika Ottman and Vy Nguyen received support from Rolls-Royce to pursue a placement with the Naked Scientists.

==Funders and supporters==
The Naked Scientists have received funding and awards from the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[Natural Environment Research Council]], the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC), Cambridge University including the Isaac Newton Trust, the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC), the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] and [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1638">In [[microeconomics]], a '''threshold population''' is the minimum number of people needed for a [[Service (economics)|service]] to be worthwhile.

In [[geography]], a threshold population is the minimum number of people necessary before a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] or service can be provided in an area. The concept is equivalent to the "range" in [[central place theory]] and [[retailing]], which delineates the [[Market (economics)|market]] area of a central place for a particular good or service, and is dependent on the [[Population density|spatial distribution]] of population and the willingness of [[consumer]]s to travel a given distance to purchase particular goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically a low-order shop (such as a grocer or newsagent) may require only 800 or so customers, whereas a higher-order store such as Marks and Spencer or Waitrose may need a threshold of 70,000 to be profitable, and a university may need 350,000 to be viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0034885.html Tiscali encyclopedia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012030055/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0034885.html |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thresholds may also be linked to the spending power of customers; this is most obvious in periodic markets in poor countries, where wages are so low that people can buy the goods or services only once in a while.

'''Twixter''' is a [[neologism]] that describes a new generation of [[United States|Americans]] who are trapped, in a sense, ''betwixt'' (between) [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]]. This Western neologism is somewhat analogous to the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term [[parasite single]].

==Behavior==
Twixters are typically young adults who live with their parents or are otherwise not independent financially. If they are employed, they often have [[Precariat|unsteady and low-paying jobs]]. They may have recently left university or high school, or recently embarked on a career.

==Media coverage==
''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' published an article called "Twixter Generation: [[Young adult (psychology)|Young Adult]]s Who Won't Grow Up", about Twixters in January 2005, putting this relatively obscure demographic in the spotlight.&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Grow Up? Not So Fast|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1018089,00.html|accessdate=4 October 2012|newspaper=Time|date=16 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article focused on upper- and middle-class Twixters whose parents could support them. The article made no distinction between people who lived on their own with their parents' help and people who lived with their parents, nor did it mention lower-class Twixters similar to ''[[NEET]]''s and ''[[freeter]]s'' in other societies.

==Parallels in other societies==
The emergence of twixters is not entirely new, as it is similar to social phenomena observed in other industrialized societies. Since the 1980s and 1990s, [[Japan]] has seen the growth of a [[parasite single]] or "[[freeter]]" segment of the youth population who live at home and work at undemanding jobs. The ''Hodo-Hodo [[zoku]]'' are employees who avoid [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] to minimize stress and maximize free time. Likewise, in Europe since the 1990s, there has been a growing number of ''[[NEET]]'', those "''N''ot engaged in ''E''ducation, ''E''mployment, or ''T''raining".

In October 2007, former [[List of Italian Ministers of Economy and Finance|Minister of Economy and Finance]] of [[Italy]] [[Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa]] called people in their twenties and still living with their families ''bamboccioni'' ("big, dummy boys"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_ottobre_04/padoa_bamboccioni.shtml «Mandiamo i bamboccioni fuori di casa» . Corriere della Sera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; stirring controversy within the Italian media. Newspapers received numerous letters from readers personally taking offense and pointing out that he knew little about the situation of a considerable part of twenty-something Italians, who live on approximately €&amp;nbsp;1,000 per month and cannot afford to leave their parents’ house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beppegrillo.it/2007/10/il_bamboccione.html Il bamboccione&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181412/http://www.beppegrillo.it/2007/10/il_bamboccione.html |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar case is also seen in Spain, with the term ''[[:es:Mileurista|mileurista]]'' to describe the youth who live with €&amp;nbsp;1,000 salary (''mil euros'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/portada/generacion/mil/euros/elpdompor/20051023elpdmgpor_1/Tes Article in] ''[[El País]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greece]], the minimum salary is €&amp;nbsp;700 and the [[Media_in_Greece#Mass_media|Greek media]] popularized the term the "€700 generation". This generation evolved in circumstances leading to the [[Economy_of_Greece#2010-2011_debt_crisis|Greek debt crisis]] and participated in the [[2010–2011 Greek protests]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15117098,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

On a site that touches the lower slopes of the lush [[Hanthana mountain range]], University of Peradeniya is known for its natural environment.{{fact|date=July 2018}} It has inspired intellectuals like [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Ediriweera Sarachchandra]], Sri Lanka's premium playwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1604/16040710.htm |title=Symposium: Sri Lanka's Culture Experience – Between Home and the World |publisher=Frontline |year=1999 |accessdate=2011-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092341/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1604/16040710.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is in the [[Central Province of Sri Lanka|Central Province]], 8&amp;nbsp;km from the sacred city of [[Kandy]] (the historic capital of the last kingdom of Sri Lanka) and about 110&amp;nbsp;km from [[Colombo]]. A tourist attraction, [[Botanical Garden of Peradeniya]] is close by.

The university spans nearly 700 hectares in the Mahaweli flood plain. Most of the area remains afforested. Climate around the university is mild, and the temperature fluctuates between 18 and 30 degrees Celsius.

The main entrance to the university is through [[Galaha]] road. The [[Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya|Faculty of Engineering]] is on one side of the [[Mahaweli River]] and all other faculties are on the other side. The Akbar bridge links the two banks of the river. Considered as a marvel of civil engineering, it was designed by late [[Professor|Prof.]] A. Thurairajah (Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, 1975–77 and 1982–85) and built by the first batch of the faculty, in the year of its inception.

The Sarasavi Uyana railway station is on campus. Another bridge known as Yaka Paalama links the railway to the other bank. Daily shuttle bus services operate from Kandy to Galaha junction and Kandy to the university.

A separate subcampus was established in 1968 at Mahailuppallama, [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North Central province]] for the Faculty of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pdn.ac.lk/agri/history/ | title=Faculty of Agriculture sub campus | publisher=Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya | year=2008 | accessdate=2010-05-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127165951/http://www.pdn.ac.lk/agri/history/ | archivedate=27 November 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate residential facilities are provided to this subcampus.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The proposal for the establishment of [[University of Ceylon]], the first university of Sri Lanka (the predecessor of University of Peradeniya) goes back to 1899.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; But no progress was seen until the formation of Ceylon University Association in 1906 under the guidance of Sir [[Ponnambalam Arunachalam]], [[Sir]] [[James Peiris]] and Sir [[Marcus Fernando]]. Its request for a European-style university in Sri Lanka was partially granted by the [[British Ceylon|British rulers]] with the formation of Ceylon University College on 1 January 1921.

The [[University Council]], through which the administration of the Ceylon University College was done, appointed committees to plan the academic activities of a future university.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; It made suggestions to build the university in Bullers Road (now Bauddhaloka Mawatha) in Colombo, but it was disputed by politicians. To resolve the conflict, the then [[Governor]] [[Hugh Clifford]] appointed a committee headed by Justice M.T. Akbar on 20 December 1926. It suggested that the proposed university should be unitary, residential and outside Colombo. Another committee was appointed in 1928 with Sir Walter Buchanan-Riddel as chairman. It proposed a site at [[Aruppola]], in the Dumbara Valley close to [[Kandy]]. [[Dr.]] S.C. Paul and Andreas Nell pointed out disadvantages in the site and proposed a larger one at Peradeniya.

In 1938 the government acquired the plot and developed an area about 150 hectares (out of 700 hectares) to create the University Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.island.lk/2009/04/29/midweek3.html | title=Cambridge by the Mahaweli: Peradeniya University | publisher=The Island | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the site was acquired, no plans were made to establish the university until 1941. With the arrival of Sir [[Ivor Jennings]], as the second principal of the Ceylon University College, establishment plans were put into effect. He stressed the urgent need to move the university to Peradeniya to the Minister of Education [[C. W. W. Kannangara]] and took the initiative in the process. Thus he is considered the forefather of the University of Peradeniya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/ivorj.html | title=First Vice Chancellor of University of Ceylon | publisher=Rootsweb | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1942 to 1952===

In 1942, the [[University of Ceylon]] was created as the first unitary, residential and autonomous university in Sri Lanka with its seat in Peradeniya, amalgamating Ceylon University College and the Medical College into a single unit with 55 academic staff members, 904 students in four faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://acu.studylink.com/display/provider/provider-info.html?pid=pid-mm-01-sri014 | title=University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka: The Association of Commonwealth Universities | publisher=[[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-05-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160317/http://acu.studylink.com/display/provider/provider-info.html?pid=pid-mm-01-sri014 | archive-date=16 July 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.pdn.ac.lk/history.htm | title=Historical Roots | publisher=[[University of Peradeniya library]] | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-05-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818010829/http://www.lib.pdn.ac.lk/history.htm | archivedate=18 August 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But due to [[World War II]], the construction of buildings started in 1946. Until then, the lectures and laboratory classes were conducted in the buildings obtained from the [[Ceylon University College]] and the [[Ceylon Medical College]] in Colombo.

Consultants Sir [[Patrick Abercrombie]] and Clifford Holliday did the planning and layout of the university complex. The first phase of work constituted only the development of the left bank. The building of a bridge across the [[Mahaweli River]], later known as the 'Akbar bridge', was planned by [[Professor|Prof.]] A Thurairajah. Transfer of the first batch of students, students from the Departments of Law and Agriculture and the third and fourth year students of the Department of Veterinary Science, from Colombo to Peradeniya took place in 1949. Another major move took place in 1952, with the transfer of staff and students of the [[Faculty of Arts, University of Peradeniya|Faculties of Arts and Oriental Studies]], together with the [[University of Peradeniya library|Main Library]] and the University Administration. This movement on 6 October 1952 marks the official establishment of University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. At the initial stages, vice chancellor Jennings wanted to model British universities, but met with the resistance of students who opposed the changes.&lt;ref name="kandy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/03/31/fea05.asp | title=Kandy in 1940s and 50s... | publisher=Daily News | year=2009 | accessdate=2011-01-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117130651/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/03/31/fea05.asp | archivedate=17 January 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1952 to 1972===
[[File:A Bridge Inside UoP.JPG|thumb|right|A bridge inside the university.]]
Although the buildings at Peradeniya were established in 1952, the official ceremony for its inception was held on 20 April 1954, with the participation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The Sri Lankan government was keen to postpone the ceremony until Queen Elizabeth II could participate. Her visit was delayed by the death of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]. [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] also participated in the event. He declared the university opened:
{{cquote|You have remarked Mr. Chancellor, that it is not easy to open a university, because once established it is always open. However, like the shopkeepers of London during the bombing, I can declare this place to be "more open than usual..."}}
Sections of the University of Ceylon, functioned in Colombo and Peradeniya acted as campuses of the same university until 1967. In 1967, these campuses were split into two. The section in Peradeniya was known as the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, while the section in Colombo was known as University of Ceylon, Colombo.

===1972 to 1978===
[[File:UoP in May.jpg|thumb|left|The university in spring, the Senate building.]]
By the University Act No. 1 of 1972, four{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} universities functioned a —  Peradeniya, [[University of Colombo|Colombo]], [[Vidyodaya University|Vidyodaya]] and [[University of Kelaniya|Vidyalankara]] and the [[University of Moratuwa|Ceylon College of Technology, Katubedda, Moratuwa]] became five constituent campuses of a single structure — the University of Sri Lanka. It had one vice chancellor and five presidents for five campuses. Under this designation, University of Ceylon - Peradeniya became the University of Sri Lanka - Peradeniya Campus. This designation prevailed until 1978.

=== 1978 to the present ===
Under the Universities Act No. 16, 1978, the University of Sri Lanka was split into six independent, autonomous institutions as University of Peradeniya, [[University of Colombo]], [[University of Sri Jayewardenepura]], [[University of Kelaniya]], [[University of Moratuwa]] and [[University of Jaffna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Universities Act - Part XX |url=http://www.ugc.ac.lk/si/policy/universities-act/46.html |publisher=[[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act brought back some of the central features of the Ceylon University Ordinance of 1942 such as the senates, the councils and courts.

==Governance and administration==
The University of Peradeniya operates under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985. It is a [[Public university|state university]] and the undergraduate study is 100% [[Free education|free]]. Therefore, it depends on the government for much of its annual grant, which is provided by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission (UGC)]]. Due to this, its administration is heavily influenced by the UGC. The administration is based upon that of the former [[University of Ceylon]] consisting of a dual structure of bodies: the Council (formally known as the [[University Court]] which is the governing body) and the [[Academic Senate]] (academic affairs).

==Criticism==

===Ragging===
The university has been criticized for its high level of [[Ragging in Sri Lanka|ragging]] with several incidents grabbing national headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groundviews.org/2009/11/30/ragging-in-our-universities-a-symptom-or-a-disease/|title=Ragging in our universities: A symptom or a disease?|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the death of S.

==Popular culture==
[[File:Uni trees.jpg|thumb|left|Serene road inside university]]

The University of Peradeniya holds a central position in classical university education, which has made it the setting for many dramas, films, songs, poems, novels and other cultural works in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/11/02/fea03.html | title=Sarath Amunugama's ''Maname Mathakvi'' The Return to Peradeniya | publisher=The Sunday Observer | year=2003 | accessdate=2010-06-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181539/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/11/02/fea03.html | archivedate=30 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book Review: Peradeniya-Memories of a University. Edited by K.M. de Silva and Tissa Jayatillaka.

Movies like [[Gamini Fonseka]]'s ''Saagarayak Meda'' (In the middle of an ocean) and Sugathapala Senarath Yapa's ''[[Hanthane Kathawa]]'' (The story of Hanthana) are directly based on University of Peradeniya.

UoP is featured in novels: [[Siri Gunasinghe]]'s ''Sevanella'' (The shadow) and [[Gunadasa Amarasekara]]'s ''Ek Sathya Kathawak'' (One true story). Groundbreaking dramas like [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Ediriweera Sarachchandra]]'s ''Maname'' (1957) and ''Sinhabahu'' (1960) were first directed and played there.&lt;ref name="kandy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.island.lk/2004/03/21/featur07.html | title=Celebrating Creativity: Applause at the Wendt | publisher=The Island | year=2007 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sarachchandra's novel ''Heta Echchara Kaluvara Nae'' (Tomorrow is not that dark), an entire chapter is dedicated to describe the beauty of the university.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4224">The '''user illusion''' is the illusion created for the user by a [[human-computer interface|human–computer interface]], for example the [[desktop metaphor|visual metaphor of a desktop]] used in many [[graphical user interfaces]]. The phrase originated at [[Xerox PARC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Tognazzini|authorlink=Bruce Tognazzini|title=Tog on Software Design|isbn=0-201-48917-1|year=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKBQAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Philosophy of mind|philosophers of mind]] have argued that [[consciousness]] is a form of user illusion. This notion is explored by [[Tor Nørretranders]] in his 1991 Danish book ''Mærk verden'', issued in a 1998 English edition as ''The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor Nørretranders|authorlink=Tor Nørretranders|title=The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size|isbn=0-670-87579-1|year=1998|publisher=Viking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwMwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced the idea of [[exformation]] in this book.  Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has also embraced the view that human consciousness is a "user-illusion."&lt;ref&gt;"Human consciousness is unlike all other varieties of animal consciousness in that it is a product in large part of cultural evolution . . . creating thereby a cognitive architecture unlike the ‘bottom-up’ minds of animals. . . . [T]his architecture furnishes each of us with . . . a user-illusion” (Daniel C. Dennett, ''From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds'' (2017), p. 370).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this picture, our experience of the world is not immediate, as all sensation requires processing time. It follows that our conscious experience is less a perfect reflection of what is occurring, and more a simulation produced unconsciously by the brain. Therefore, there may be phenomena that exist beyond our peripheries, beyond what consciousness could create to isolate or reduce them.

== Criticism ==
Critics of the idea of consciousness being a device for justifying preconceptions argue that such a device would consume [[nutrient]]s without producing any useful results, since it would not change the outcome of any decisions. These critics argue that the existence of  [[social insect]]s with extremely small brains [[falsifiability|falsifies]] the notion that social behavior requires consciousness, citing that insects have too small [[brain]]s to be conscious and yet there are observed behaviors among them that for all functional intents and purposes match those of complex social cooperation and manipulation (including hierarchies where each individual has its place among [[paper wasp]]s and [[Jack Jumper]] [[ant]]s and [[honey bee]]s sneaking when they lay eggs). These critics also argue that since social behavior in insects and other extremely small-brained animals have [[convergent evolution|evolved multiple times independently]], there is no evolutionary difficulty in simple reaction sociality to impose selection pressure for the more nutrient-consuming path of consciousness for sociality. These critics do point out that other evolutionary paths to consciousness are possible, such as critical evaluation that enhances plasticity by criticizing [[fallibility|fallible]] notions, while pointing out that such a critical consciousness would be quite different from the justificatory type proposed by Nørretranders, differences including that a critical consciousness would make individuals more capable of changing their minds instead of justifying and persuading.&lt;ref&gt;How the body shapes the way we think: A new view of intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information Processing in Social Insects: Claire Detrain, Jean L.

'''Yene''' are small wooden statues found throughout the [[Leti Islands]], in the southeastern part of the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku archipelago]] in eastern [[Indonesia]]. Yene are believed to act as a vessel where the ancestor spirit would reside temporarily before departing to the land of the dead.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten voorouderbeeld TMnr 1468-167a.jpg|thumb|left|This yene, seated on a western-style chair, may have indicated that the owner had converted to Christianity after a contact with the Westerners.]]Three kinds of statues are found throughout the [[Maluku Islands]]: Statues of ancestors; statues of progenitors (linked to the origin and foundation of the descendants), and statues of the cosmos (heaven and earth) represented as male and female, respectively.{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}}

In the [[Leti Islands]], yene are small-sized statues of the ancestors, usually depicted seated. The statues represent deceased family members.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/316114 |title=Ancestor Figure (Yene) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=November 8, 2017 |website=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=November 8, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posture of the yene indicates the gender of the deceased. Male ancestors are shown in a [[squatting position]], while females are shown with crossed-legs.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Yene statues have been recorded since the 17th century, with some showing signs of contact with the west. Some male ancestors statues show a squatting figure on top of a western-style chair, which may indicate that the deceased has been converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}}

At places where a [[Caste|caste system]] existed, leti statues also indicate the rank of the deceased. Members of the highest caste are represented with jewelry, such as earrings and headgear that look like bishops' mitres. Lower caste yene are usually represented without jewelry or complex ornaments. Feather ornamentation indicates the deceased was a warrior.

==Function==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten voorouderbeeld TMnr A-1033.jpg|thumb|right|A yene of a female ancestor, depicted with the legs crossed.]]
The yene functioned as a sort of temporary vessel for the spirit of the deceased before they depart to the land of the dead. The Leti Islanders believed that a human has both a physical body and an abstract "shadow", somewhat comparable to a soul or mind. The "shadow" is believed to persist even after death. After death, his or her "shadow" wanders for a few days in the village before it leaves for the land of the dead, which is said to be situated on an uninhabited island, such as a reef or a cape, not far from the world of the living. 

The yene sculpture allowed the relatives of the departed to communicate with the departed spirit, either for consultation on important matters or to be given offerings during annual ceremonies.{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}} The Leti society are strongly dependent on the ancestor spirits for many things, such as fertility. Generally the yene statues are offered [[betel|sirih]] and [[areca nut|pinang]]. Sometimes [[palm wine]] is combined with the offering.{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}} 

Yene sculptures are arranged in the attic of house of Leti Islanders. The spirits are thought to reach the attic through specially-fitted hatches in the facade.{{sfn|de Jonge|van Dijk|1995}}

The '''Zimmerwald Observatory''' ({{lang-de|'''Observatorium Zimmerwald'''}}) is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] owned and operated by the AIUB, the Astronomical Institute of the [[University of Bern]]. Built in 1956, it is located at [[Zimmerwald]], 10 kilometers south of [[Bern]], Switzerland.

Numerous [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s have been discovered by [[Paul Wild (Swiss astronomer)|Paul Wild]] (1925–2014) at Zimmerwald Observatory, most notably comet [[81P/Wild]], which was visited by NASA's [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust space probe]] in 2004. The [[main belt]] asteroid [[1775 Zimmerwald]] has been named after the location of the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi#top |title=1775 Zimmerwald (1969 JA) |work=[[JPL]] – Small-Body Database Browser |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1-meter aperture ZIMLAT telescope was inaugurated in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ZIMLAT Telescope |url=http://cmslive3.unibe.ch/unibe/philnat/aiub/content/zimmerwald/the_zimlat_telescope/index_eng.html |work=Universität Bern, Astronomisches Institut, Zimmerwald Observatory |date=3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
