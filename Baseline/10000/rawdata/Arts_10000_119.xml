The decade of the '''1910s in film''' involved some significant films.

==Events==
The 1910s saw the origins of [[Hollywood]] as the centre of the American film industry relocated from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[California]]. By 1912, major motion-picture companies had set up production near or in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Lewis. ''The Rise of the American Film'' Harcourt Brace, New York, 1930; p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, most motion picture patents were held by Thomas Edison's [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] in New Jersey, and filmmakers were often sued to stop their productions. To escape this, filmmakers began moving out west, where Edison's patents could not be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Hollywood, California|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3871.html|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the weather was ideal and there was quick access to various settings. Los Angeles became the capital of the film industry.&lt;ref name="Mintz, S. 2013"&gt;Mintz, S., and S. McNeil. "Hollywood as History." Digital History. N.p., 2013. Web. 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hollywood-Studios-1922.jpg|right|thumb|Hollywood movie studios, 1922]]

During the [[First World War]] the film industries of Europe were devastated, and Hollywood replaced the French and Italian firms as the most popular film makers in the world.

During the '''20th century''' there was a huge increase in the variety of [[music]] that people had access to. Prior to the invention of mass market [[gramophone record]]s (developed in 1892) and [[radio broadcasting]] (first commercially done ca. 1919–20), people mainly listened to music at live [[Classical music]] concerts or [[musical theatre]] shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early [[phonograph]] players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using [[sheet music]], which required the ability to sing, play, and read music. These were skills that tended to be limited to [[middle class|middle-class]] and [[upper class|upper-class]] individuals. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of [[song]]s and musical pieces from around the globe. This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of [[Classical music]] [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[opera]]s that they would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region.

[[Sound recording]] was also a major influence on the development of [[popular music]] genres, because it enabled recordings of [[song]]s and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including [[vinyl record]]s, [[compact cassette]]s, [[compact disc]]s (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, [[digital audio]] recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the [[Internet]], using [[file sharing]] of [[digital audio]] recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arditi|first1=David|title=iTunes: Breaking Barriers and Building Walls|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007766.2013.810849|website=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|publisher=Informa UK Limited|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[multitrack recording]] in 1955 and the use of [[audio console|mixing]] had a major influence on [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], because it enabled [[record producer]]s to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Allan. ''Cultural Production in and Beyond the Recording Studio''. Routledge, 2014. (Multitrack recording and mixing made the recording "...studio a tool of musical composition" in which producers could "...create a reality which could not actually exist" in a live performance. p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[sound recording]] and [[audio engineering]] technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the [[Musique concrète]] (1949) and [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; (1955) schools of electronic composition. In the 1970s, [[African-American]] [[hip hop music]]ians began to use the [[phonograph|record turntable]] as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive "[[scratching]]" effects by manipulating a [[vinyl record]] on the turntable.

In Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as [[Berlioz]] and [[Mahler]], the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. [[Saxophone]]s were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras  generally include a [[string section]], [[woodwinds]], [[brass instruments]], [[percussion]], [[piano]], [[celesta|celeste]], [[harp]](s),&lt;ref name="classical-orchestra-description-page"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Classical Orchestra Description Page|url=http://www.classiccat.net/iv/orchestra.info.php|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other instruments called for occasionally, such as [[electric guitar]]&lt;ref&gt;Lagnella, David. ''The Composer's Guide to the Electric Guitar''. Mel Bay Publications, 2003. (Ex. Composers Tim Brady, Steve Mackey, Rhys Chatham, René Lussie, Glenn Branca, Scott Johnson and Eliot Sharp used the electric guitar in their chamber works and orchestral works, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electric bass]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker-Hall, Helen. ''Music by Black Women Composers: A Bibliography of Available Scores''. Center for Black Music Research, 1995. (Ex. Composer Margaret Harris-Schofield wrote ''Piano Concerto No. 2'' in 1971, scored for solo piano, full orchestra, electric bass and drums. p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of [[altered chord]]s and [[extended chord]]s in 1940s-era [[Bebop jazz]]. The development of powerful, loud [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]]s in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of [[jazz]] and [[rock music]] to create [[jazz fusion]]). As well, composers and musicians used new [[music technology (electric)|electric]], [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices]]. In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[house music]] were created largely with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. Faster modes of transportation such as [[jet flight]] allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.

===Modernism===
{{Main article|Modernism (music)}}
In the early 20th century, many composers, including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], and [[Edward Elgar]], continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century. However, [[modernism]] in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important [[Modernism (music)|modernists]] were [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Claude Debussy]], and post-[[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]], who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration.&lt;ref name="Botstein 2001."&gt;Botstein 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], and [[Franz Schreker|Schreker]] were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and [[Charles Ives|Ives]] was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality.&lt;ref name="Botstein 2001."/&gt; Composers such as [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], and [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] combined classical and jazz idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wooten|first1=Roy|title=Classical Music Meets American Jazz|url=http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807163225/http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 August 2016|website=National Museum of African American Music|publisher=National Museum of African American Music|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
{{Main article|Nationalism (music)}}
Late-Romantic and modernist nationalism was found also in British, American, and Latin-American music of the early 20th century. Composers such as [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Alberto Ginastera]], [[Carlos Chávez]], [[Silvestre Revueltas]], and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] used folk themes collected by themselves or others in many of their major compositions.

===Microtonal music===
{{Main article|Microtonal music}}
In the early decades of the 20th century, composers such as [[Julián Carrillo]], [[Mildred Couper]], [[Alois Hába]], [[Charles Ives]], [[Erwin Schulhoff]], [[Ivan Wyschnegradsky]] turned their attention to [[quarter tone]]s (24 equal intervals per octave), and other finer divisions. In the middle of the century composers such as [[Harry Partch]] and [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] explored [[just intonation]]. In the second half of the century, prominent composers employing microtonality included [[Easley Blackwood, Jr.]], [[Wendy Carlos]], [[Adriaan Fokker]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Ezra Sims]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].

===Neoclassicism===
{{Main article|Neoclassical music}}
A dominant trend in music composed from 1923 to 1950 was neoclassicism, a reaction against the exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism which revived the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles. There were three distinct "schools" of neoclassicism, associated with [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Similar sympathies in the second half of the century are generally subsumed under the heading "[[Postmodern music|postmodernism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Whittall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental music===
{{Main article|Experimental music}}
A compositional tradition arose in the mid-20th century—particularly in North America—called "experimental music". Its most famous and influential exponent was [[John Cage]] (1912–1992).&lt;ref&gt;Grant 2003, 174&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cage, "an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen",&lt;ref&gt;Cage 1961, 39&lt;/ref&gt; and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action.&lt;ref&gt;Mauceri 1997, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the composers who influenced [[John Cage]] were [[Erik Satie]] (1866–1925), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874–1951) and [[Henry Dixon Cowell]] (1897–1965).

===Minimalism===
{{Main article|Minimal music}}
Minimalist music, involving a simplification of materials and intensive repetition of motives began in the late 1950s with the composers [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]]. Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Reich, Glass, and [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]]. Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like [[Arvo Pärt]], [[Henryk Górecki]] and [[John Tavener]] working in the ''[[holy minimalism]]'' variant. For more examples see ''[[List of 20th-century classical composers]]''.

===Contemporary classical music===
{{Main article|Contemporary classical music}}

Contemporary classical music can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].&lt;ref&gt;Botstein "[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]" §9: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term  may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many composers working in the early 21st century were prominent figures in the 20th century. Some younger composers such as [[Oliver Knussen]], [[Wolfgang Rihm]], [[Georg Friedrich Haas]], [[Judith Weir]], [[George Benson]], [[Richard Barrett (composer)|Richard Barrett]], [[Simon Bainbridge]], [[John Luther Adams]], [[Toshio Hosokawa]], [[Bright Sheng]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Tan Dun]], [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[Philippe Manoury]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]],  [[Hanspeter Kyburz]], [[James MacMillan]], [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]], [[Thomas Adès]], [[Marc-André Dalbavie]], [[Unsuk Chin]], [[Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf]], and [[Michael Daugherty]] did not rise to prominence until late in the 20th century. For more examples see ''[[List of 21st-century classical composers]]''.

==Electronic music==
[[File:Stockhausen 1991 Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in the electronic-music studio of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]], Cologne in 1991]]
{{Main article|Electronic music}}

For centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using [[music technology#Mechanical|mechanical music technologies]], such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taut gut or metal strings ([[string instruments]]), constricting vibrating air ([[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] and [[Brass instrument|brass]]) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds ([[percussion instrument]]s). In the early twentieth century, [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic devices]] were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration. As early as the 1930s, composers such as [[Olivier Messiaen]] incorporated electronic instruments into live performance. While [[sound recording]] technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of [[popular music]], new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well. The [[musique concrète]] (French: “concrete music”), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and his associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musique concrète – Musical composition technique|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/musique-concrete|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following [[World War II]], some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology. Electronic music was embraced by composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Ernst Krenek]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Herbert Brün]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]]. In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic [[soundtrack]]s. Major rock groups that were early adopters of synthesizers include [[The Moody Blues]], [[The Beatles]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Everett, ''The Foundations of Rock: from "Blue suede shoes" to "Suite: Judy blue eyes"'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-531023-3}}, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Monkees]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Lefcowitz, ''The Monkees Tale'' (San Francisco CA: Last Gasp, 1989), {{ISBN|0-86719-378-6}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Doors]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Pinch and F. Trocco, ''Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-674-01617-3}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk music==
{{Main article|Folk music}}
Folk music, in the original sense of the term as coined in the 18th century by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], is music produced by communal composition and possessing dignity, though by the late 19th century the concept of ‘folk’ had become a synonym for ‘nation’, usually identified as peasants and rural artisans, as in the [[Merry England|Merrie England movement]] and the [[Gaelic revival|Irish and Scottish Gaelic Revivals]] of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk music was normally shared and performed by the entire community (not by a special class of expert or professional performers, possibly excluding the idea of amateurs), and was transmitted by word of mouth ([[oral tradition]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nettl|first1=Bruno|title=Folk Music|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/folk-music|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, folk music was also borrowed by composers in other genres. Some of the work of [[Aaron Copland]] clearly draws on American folk music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaron Copland, 1900–1990: His Music Taught America About Itself|url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/people/Aaron_Copland.html|website=ManyThings.org|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important work on registering traditional [[Music of Southeastern Europe|tunes of the Balkanic region]] was that of [[Béla Bartók]] since it is probably the first composer who was interested in recording audios as well as analysing them from an ethnological point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Béla Bartók The Musical Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 2 (Apr., 1947), pp. 240–257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluegrass music===
{{Main article|Bluegrass music}}

Bluegrass music is a form of [[American roots music]], and a related genre of [[country music]]. Influenced by the music of [[Appalachia]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cantwell, ''Bluegrass Breakdown:  The Making of the Old Southern Sound'' (University of Illinois Press, 2002), pgs 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Bluegrass has mixed roots in [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Folk music of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Music of Wales|Welsh]],  and [[Folk music of England|English]]&lt;ref&gt;Musicologist [[Cecil Sharp]] collected hundreds of folk songs in the Appalachian region, and observed that the musical tradition of the people "seems to point to the North of England, or to the Lowlands, rather than the Highlands, of Scotland, as the country from which they originally migrated. For the Appalachian tunes...have far more affinity with the normal English folk-tune than with that of the Gaelic-speaking Highlander."

Olive Dame Campbell &amp; Cecil J. Sharp, ''English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians, Comprising 122 Songs and Ballads, and 323 Tunes'', G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1917, pg xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of [[African-Americans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Tennessee folklore sampler: selections from the Tennessee folklore society | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z90XdzMKE0C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=i'm+working+on+a+building+song&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=flZ7TvlDiqK2B9vqse4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=i'm%20working%20on%20a%20building%20song&amp;f=false| chapter = Field Recordings of Southern Black Music | last = Nemerov | first = Bruce | pages = 323–324 | year = 2009 | publisher = Univ. of Tennessee Press | accessdate = 2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; through incorporation of [[jazz]] elements.

Settlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in [[Appalachia]] during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands. These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish [[ballad]]s—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish [[reel (dance)|reel]]s, which were accompanied by a fiddle.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Ted Olson, "Music — Introduction".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109–1120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the [[British Isles]]. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as "[[Pretty Saro]]", "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]", "[[The Cuckoo (song)|Cuckoo Bird]]" and "[[House Carpenter]]", come from [[England]] and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically.&lt;ref name="cuckoo"&gt;{{cite news|title=The beauty and mystery of ballads|last=Goldsmith|page=G5|first=Thomas|date=February 6, 2005 |work=[[Raleigh News &amp; Observer|The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[The Twa Sisters]], also come from [[England]]; however, the lyrics are about Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''English Fairy Tales'', [[s:English Fairy Tales/Binnorie|transcript]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as "Leather Britches", and "[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]", have Scottish roots.&lt;ref&gt;Cecelia Conway, "Celtic Influences".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee, 2006), p. 1132.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dance tune [[Cumberland Gap (folk song)|Cumberland Gap]] may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad [[Bonnie George Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;Song notes in ''Bascom Lamar Lunsford: Ballads, Banjo Tunes, and Sacred Songs of Western North Carolina'' [CD liner notes]. Smithsonian Folkways, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in [[England]] there is an old ballad known as "[[A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me]]", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as "I Wish My Baby Was Born".&lt;ref&gt;the version performed by Tim Eriksen, Riley Baugus and Tim O'Brien for the Cold Mountain Soundtrack was based on this song and is lyrically identical to it&lt;/ref&gt;

In bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform  [[accompaniment]]; this is especially typified in tunes called [[Breakdown (music)#Bluegrass|breakdowns]]. This is in contrast to [[old-time music]], in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid [[tempo]]s and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex [[chord change]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A short History of Bluegrass Music|url=http://renoandharrell.com/content/short-history-bluegrass-music|website=Reno &amp; Harrell|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. [[Traditional bluegrass]] has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being [[Bill Monroe]]. [[Progressive bluegrass]] groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock &amp; roll. Examples include [[Cadillac Sky]] and [[Bearfoot (American band)|Bearfoot]]. "[[Bluegrass gospel]]" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses [[Christian]] lyrics, soulful three- or four-part [[harmony]] singing, and sometimes the playing of [[instrumentals]]. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as [[The Grascals]] and [[Mountain Heart]], bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: "[[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Baptists|Baptist]]. It's [[blues]] and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billmonroe.com/music/ "Bill Monroe: The Father of Bluegrass"], billmonroe.com, retrieved 17 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera==
{{Main article|Opera#Contemporary, recent, and modernist trends}}

In the early years of the century, [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] [[chromatic harmony]] was extended by opera composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] (''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', 1905; ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', 1906–1908; ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', 1910; ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', 1912; ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'', 1917), [[Claude Debussy]] (''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'', 1902), [[Giacomo Puccini]] (''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', 1904; ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'', 1910; ''[[Il trittico]]'', 1918), [[Ferruccio Busoni]] (''[[Doktor Faust]]'', 1916, posthumously completed by his student [[Philipp Jarnach]]), [[Béla Bartók]] (''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', 1911–17), [[Leos Janáček]] (''[[Jenůfa]]'', 1904; ''[[Destiny (Janáček)|Osud]]'', 1907; ''[[Kát´a Kabanová]]'', 1919-1921) and [[Hans Pfitzner]] (''[[Palestrina (opera)|Palestrina]]'', 1917).

Further extension of the chromatic language finally broke with tonality and moved into the style of [[atonal music]] in the early operas of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (''[[Erwartung]]'', 1909; ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'', 1912) and his student [[Alban Berg]] (''[[Wozzeck]]'', 1925), both of whom adopted [[twelve-tone technique]] for their later operas: Schoenberg's ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', and Berg’s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''. Neither of these operas were completed in their composers’ lifetimes, however, so that the first completed opera using the twelve-tone technique was ''[[Karl V]]'' (1938) by [[Ernst Krenek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sitsky|first1=Larry|title=Music of the Twentieth-century Avant-garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313296895|page=238|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgDJKVXraE0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=first+completed+opera+using+the+twelve-tone+technique+was+Karl+V&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TTID7SQzJP&amp;sig=vVRed7jJhbOWH034rXGx4s3YF2I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyl8iGj6TNAhUJ3mMKHa9zBiwQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20completed%20opera%20using%20the%20twelve-tone%20technique%20was%20Karl%20V&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most important operas of the twenties and thirties were composed by the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'', 1928 and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Ledi Makbet Mtsenkovo Uyezda]]'' [Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District], 1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{Riding, Alan. Eyewitness Companions: Opera: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the neoclassicism that became fashionable in the 1920s is represented by Stravinsky's [[opera buffa]] ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922) and his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927). Later in the century his last opera, ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951), also marks the end of the neoclassical phase of his compositions. Other operas of this period by composers identified as neoclassicists include [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]'' (1938), [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Voina y Mir (opera)|Voina y Mir]]'' (War and Peace, 1941–1943), [[Bohuslav Martinu]]'s ''[[Julietta aneb snár]]'' (1937) and [[Francis Poulenc]]'s ''[[Les mamelles de Tirésias]]'' (1945).{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the sixties, it should be noted, the [[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]] opera, ''[[Die Soldaten]]'' (1965), had a great impact.{{Clarify|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--Big box-office success, was it? Or did it cause riots in cities across the globe?--&gt;   

One of the most particular{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--Is this meant in the sense of "peculiar", "exacting", or what?--&gt; operas of the seventies was ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'', by György Ligeti. It deals with the subject of mortality through irony and collage.

The most internationally accepted post–World War II composer of operas was Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]] (''[[Peter Grimes (opera)|Peter Grimes]]'', 1945; ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'', 1946; ''[[Albert Herring (opera)|Albert Herring]]'', 1947; ''[[Billy Budd (opera)|Billy Budd]]'', 1951; ''[[Gloriana]]'', 1953; ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]'', 1954; ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', 1960; ''[[Owen Wingrave]]'', 1970; ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]'', 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twentieth-Century Opera|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/entertainment/opera-twentieth-century-opera.html|website=Infoplease|publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--Links to a secondary link to the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article "Opera Glass".

Popular music includes [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] tunes, [[ballad]]s and singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilliland 1969, show 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship (particularly, the relative value) of classical music and popular music is a controversial question. [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Neat divisions between "folk" and "popular", and "popular" and "art", are impossible to find... arbitrary criteria [are used] to define the complement of "popular". "Art" music, for example, is generally regarded as by nature complex, difficult, demanding; "popular" music then has to be defined as "simple", "accessible", "facile". But many pieces commonly thought of as "art" ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Hallelujah Chorus]]'', many [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] songs, many [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[aria]]s) have qualities of simplicity; conversely, it is by no means obvious that the [[Sex Pistols]]' records were "accessible", [[Frank Zappa]]'s work "simple", or [[Billie Holiday]]'s "facile".&lt;ref&gt;Middleton 1990, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Polka===
{{Main article|Polka}}
The polka, which first appeared in Prague in 1837, continued to be a popular form of dance music through the 20th century, especially in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and areas of the United States with a large population of central-European descent. A particularly well-known 20th-century example is [[Jaromír Vejvoda]]’s ''Modřanská polka'' (1927), which became popular during World War II in Czechoslovakia as "Škoda lásky" ("A Waste of Love"), in Germany as the ''Rosamunde-Polka'', and among the allied armies as the ''[[Beer Barrel Polka]]'' (as a song, known as "Roll out the Barrel"). In the United States, the "Eastern style" Polish urban polka remained popular until about 1965. Polka music rose in popularity in Chicago in the late 1940s after [[Walter Jagiello|Walter ‘Li’l Wally’ Wallace Jagiello]] created "[[Hunky Culture|honky]]" polka by combining the Polish-American rural polka with elements of Polish folksong and ''[[krakowiak]]''. A later, rock-influenced form is called "dyno" polka.&lt;ref&gt;Černušák, Lamb, and Tyrrell 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alexander Sarcophagus''' is a late 4th century BC [[Hellenistic]] stone [[sarcophagus]] adorned with [[bas-relief]] carvings of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_lLQXxS7HhEC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=ancient+Greek+Alexander+Sarcophagus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BtYYT63oOcaAtQbr_qjjDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20Greek%20Alexander%20Sarcophagus&amp;f=false ''Ancient Greece: From the Archaic Period to the Death of Alexander the Great''], Britannica Educational Publishing, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is remarkably well preserved and has been celebrated for its high aesthetic achievement. It is considered the outstanding holding of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Istanbul Museum numbers 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Discovery and interpretation===
[[File:Ayaa Necropolis, Sidon.png|thumb|left|Cross-section of the Ayaa Necropolis. The Alexander sarcophagus is bottom middle.]]
The Alexander Sarcophagus is one of four massive carved sarcophagi, forming two pairs, that were discovered during the excavations conducted by [[Osman Hamdi Bey]], an Ottoman of Greek descent and [[Yervant Voskan]], an Ottoman of Armenian descent, at the [[necropolis]] near [[Sidon]], [[Lebanon]] in 1887. Originally thought&lt;ref&gt;Studniniczka ''Achäologische Jahrbook'' '''9''' (1894), pp 226ff; F. Winter, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been the sarcophagus of [[Abdalonymus]] (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the [[Battle of Issus]] (333)&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Beazley and Bernard Ashmole, (''Greek Sculpture and Painting'' 1932, p. 59, fig. 134), [[Margarete Bieber]] ("The Portraits of Alexander" ''Greece &amp; Rome'', Second Series, '''12'''.2, Alexander the Great [October 1965], pp. 183–188) and [[Karl Schefold]] (''Der Alexander-Sarkophag'' [Frankfort/Berlin] 1968)  maintain this opinion; Schefold's is the modern monograph from which more recent opinion departs; its many photographs are by Max Seidel.&lt;/ref&gt; it was demonstrated convincingly by [[Karl Schefold]]&lt;ref&gt;"Convincingly": [[Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway]]'s review in the ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''73'''.4 (October 1969), p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been made before Abdalonymus's death, its still-classical manner uninfluenced by the style of [[Lysippos]]. Waldemar Heckel argues that the sarcophagus was made for [[Mazaeus]], a Persian noble and governor of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heckel|first1=Waldemar|title=Mazaeus, Callisthenes and the Alexander Sarcophagus|journal=Historia|date=2006|volume=55|issue=4|page=385-396}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schefold, six [[Ionians|Ionian]] sculptors' hands have been distinguished, working in an [[Attica|Attic]] idiom,&lt;ref&gt;Schefold 1968, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Miller the sarcophagus was produced probably by a [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] workshop, in this case working at Sidon.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oGXMMD5rXBQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=ancient+Greek+Alexander+Sarcophagus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6dcYT5DvMcSi-ga63rWpCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20Greek%20Alexander%20Sarcophagus&amp;f=false ''Athens and Persia in the Fifth Century BC: A Study in Cultural Receptivity''], Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The sarcophagus is constructed of [[Penteliko Mountain|Pentelic marble]] retaining traces of its [[polychrome|polychromy]], in the form of a [[Greek temple]].

The carvings on one long side of the piece depict Alexander fighting the Persians at the [[Battle of Issus]].  Volkmar von Graeve has compared the motif to the famous [[Alexander Mosaic]] at Naples, concluding that the iconography of both derives from a common original, a lost painting by [[Philoxenos of Eretria]].&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar von Graeve, ''Der Alexandersarkophag und seine Werkstatt'' (Berlin) 1970; not all readers were convinced: see  Christine Mitchell Havelock's review in ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''76'''.1 (January 1972), pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander is shown mounted, wearing a lionskin on his head, and preparing to throw a spear at the Persian cavalry.  The "historicity" of the figures accepted by von Graeve seems to Karl Schefold to be less stressed than the mythic content of battle and royal hunt, but some scholars believe that a second mounted [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] figure near the center represents [[Hephaestion]], Alexander's older close friend. A third mounted Macedonian figure is often identified as [[Perdiccas]].

The opposite long side shows Alexander and the Macedonians hunting [[lion]]s together with Abdalonymus and the Persians.

The short ends lead the eye towards the mythic lion hunt: one short end portrays a scene in which Abdalonymus is hunting a panther; the other short end depicts a battle, perhaps the [[Battle of Gaza (312 BC)|Battle of Gaza]], in which case the pediment above that end would be showing the murder of Perdiccas. The [[pediment]] on the lid above shows Abdalonymus in battle.

The ''' All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society''' ('''AIFACS''') is an independent arts organisation in [[India]], founded in [[Delhi]] in 1928. In the decade after Indian independence, many of its functions were transferred to three national academies: [[Lalit Kala Akademi]], [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] and [[Sahitya Akademi]] for the fields of visual arts, theatre arts and literature. 

AIFACS organises art exhibitions and makes awards to artists across the country. Among the most prominent artists exhibited in the 1940s were [[Amrita Sher-Gil]], [[Sailoz Mookherjea]] and [[Manishi Dey]]. Many other followed in the long history of the AIFACS.

Its most prestigious awards include the Kala Shree, Kala Vibhushan and Kala Ratna, inaugurated in 1988. Twelve awards are given in each of these grades every three years. The highest award is the Kala Samrat.

The Society also published a newsletter several times a year, and older editions are posted on the society's website since 2010.

'''''Annunciation''''' is a 1603-1605 painting by [[El Greco]], produced as part of a contract to provide four paintings for the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad in [[Illescas, Toledo]], where it still hangs, with three others from the same set (''[[The Virgin of Charity (El Greco)|Charity]]'', ''[[Coronation of the Virgin (El Greco, Illescas)|Coronation of the Virgin]]'' and ''[[Nativity (El Greco)|Nativity]]''), whilst the fifth is now in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] (''[[Marriage of the Virgin (El Greco)|Marriage of the Virgin]]'').

It is a simplification of the composition used by the artist for the ''Annunciation'' on the [[Doña María de Aragón Altarpiece]].

[[File:San Vitale Ravenna.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2]]
The '''Basilica of San Vitale''' is a church in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]], and one of the most important surviving examples of early Christian [[Byzantine art]] and [[Byzantine architecture|architecture]] in Europe. The Roman Catholic Church has designated the building a "basilica", the honorific title bestowed on church buildings of exceptional historic and ecclesial importance, although it is not of [[Basilica|architectural basilica]] form. It is one of eight Ravenna structures inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].

==History==
[[File:Emilia Ravenna4 tango7174.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The interior of the dome, with Baroque frescoes from the late 18th century.]]
The church was begun by Bishop Ecclesius in 526, when Ravenna was under the rule of the [[Ostrogoths]] and completed by the 27th Bishop of Ravenna, [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximian]], in 547 preceding the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna]].

The construction of the church was sponsored by Julius Argentarius, a banker and architect, of whom very little is known, except that he also sponsored the construction of the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] at around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rivoira, Giovanni| first = Giovanni Teresio | title = Lombardic Architecture: Its Origin, Development and Derivatives, Vol. 1| publisher =William Heinemann | location= London | year = 1910 | pages=64–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (A [[donor portrait]] of Julius Argentarius may appear among the courtiers on the Justinian mosaic.) The final cost amounted to 26,000 ''solidi'' (gold pieces).&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner and Mamiya. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Julian originated in the eastern part of the Byzantine Empire, where there was a long-standing tradition of public benefactions.

The central vault used a western technique of hollow tubes inserted into each other, rather than bricks. This method was the first recorded structural use of terra-cotta forms, which later evolved into modern [[structural clay tile]]. The [[ambulatory]] and gallery were vaulted only later in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Krautheimer | first = Richard | year = 1986 | title = Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture | page = 234 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, CT | edition = 4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WXwX7fQ2DkUC&amp;dq | isbn = 978-0-300-05294-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baroque]] frescoes on the dome was made between 1778 and 1782 by S. Barozzi, [[Ubaldo Gandolfi|U. Gandolfi]] and [[Jacopo Guarana|E. Guarana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismo.ra.it/binary/turismo_ravenna_new/arte_monumenti/svitale.1102598750.pdf Basilica of S.

The church has an octagonal plan. The building combines [[Roman architecture|Roman elements]]: the dome, shape of doorways, and stepped towers; with [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine elements]]: polygonal apse, capitals, narrow bricks, and an early example of [[flying buttress]]es. The church is most famous for its wealth of Byzantine [[mosaics]], the largest and best preserved outside of [[Constantinople]]. The church is of extreme importance in Byzantine art, as it is the only major church from the period of the Emperor [[Justinian I]] to survive virtually intact to the present day. Furthermore, it is thought to reflect the design of the [[Chrysotriklinos|Byzantine Imperial Palace Audience Chamber]], of which nothing at all survives. The belltower has four bells, the tenor one dates to the 16th century. According to legends, the church was erected on the site of the martyrdom of [[Saint Vitalis (disambiguation)|Saint Vitalis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kleiner, Fred| first = Fred S. |author2=Christin J.

==Mosaic art==

The central section is surrounded by two superposed [[ambulatory|ambulatories]]. The upper one, the ''matrimoneum'', was possibly reserved for married women. A series of mosaics in the lunettes above the [[triforium|triforia]] depict sacrifices from the Old Testament:&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner and Mamiya. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; the story of [[Abraham]] and [[Melchizedek]], and the Sacrifice of [[Isaac]]; the story of [[Moses]] and the [[Burning Bush]], [[Jeremiah]] and [[Isaiah]], representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the story of [[Abel]] and [[Cain]]. A pair of angels, holding a medallion with a cross, crowns each lunette. On the side walls the corners, next to the mullioned windows, have mosaics of the [[Four Evangelists]], under their symbols (angel, lion, ox and eagle), and dressed in white. Especially the portrayal of the lion is remarkable in its ferocity.

The cross-ribbed vault in the [[presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] is richly ornamented with mosaic festoons of leaves, fruit and flowers, converging on a crown encircling the [[Lamb of God]]. The crown is supported by four [[angel]]s, and every surface is covered with a profusion of flowers, stars, birds and animals, including many [[peacock]]s. Above the arch, on both sides, two angels hold a disc and beside them a representation of the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem. They symbolize the human race (Jerusalem representing the Jews, and Bethlehem the Gentiles).

All these mosaics are executed in the Hellenistic-Roman tradition: lively and imaginative, with rich colors and a certain perspective, and with a vivid depiction of the landscape, plants and birds. They were finished when Ravenna was still under [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Gothic]] rule. The apse is flanked by two chapels, the ''[[prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]'' and the ''[[diaconicon]]'', typical for Byzantine architecture.

Inside, the intrados of the great [[triumphal arch]] is decorated with fifteen mosaic medallions, depicting [[Jesus Christ]], the twelve [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Saint Gervasius]] and [[Saint Protasius]], the sons of Saint Vitale. The [[theophany]] was begun in 525 under bishop Ecclesius. It has a great gold fascia with twining flowers, birds, and horns of plenty. Jesus Christ appears, seated on a blue globe in the summit of the vault, robed in purple, with his right hand offering the martyr's crown to Saint Vitale. On the left, Bishop Ecclesius offers a model of the church.

=== Justinian and Theodora panels ===

At the foot of the [[apse]] side walls are two famous mosaic panels, completed in 547.  On the right is a mosaic depicting the East Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]], clad in [[Tyrian purple]] with a golden halo, standing next to court officials, [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Bishop Maximian]], [[Scholae Palatinae|palatinae]] guards and deacons. The halo around his head gives him the same aspect as Christ in the dome of the apse, but is part of the tradition of rendering the imperial family with haloes describe by Ernst [[Kantorowicz]] in the [[King's Two Bodies]].  Justinian himself stands in the middle, with soldiers on his right and clergy on his left, emphasizing that Justinian is the leader of both church and state of his empire. The later insertion of the Bishop Maximian's name above his head suggests that the mosaic may have been modified in 547, replacing the representation of the prior bishop with that of the Maximian.

The gold background of the mosaic shows that Justinian and his entourage are inside the church. The figures are placed in a V shape; Justinian is placed in the front and in the middle to show his importance with Bishop Maximian on his left and lesser individuals being placed behind them. This placement can be seen through the overlapping feet of the individuals present in the mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner and Mamiya. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', pp. 333, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another panel shows [[Empress Theodora]] solemn and formal, with golden halo, crown and jewels, and a group of court women as well as [[eunuchs]]. The Empress holds the Eucharistic vessel for wine, and her panel differs from that of Justinian in having a more complex background, with a fountain, cupola, and lavish hangings.

The '''Birds Mosaic''' decorates a floor dated to the sixth century, located about 350 meters north of [[Damascus Gate]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The inscription at the head of the mosaic, as well as its artistic style, indicate that it was made by [[Armenians|Armenian]] artists.

==Location and discovery==

The mosaic is located in an old building, outside Damascus Gate, near the beginning of [[Street of the Prophets|HaNeviim street]]. This building is located in what was once the Jewish neighborhood [[Kirya Ne'emana]], which was destroyed during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]], and Arab houses were built on its ruins. This mosaic is one of four Armenian mosaics from the Byzantine period which were discovered in this part of Jerusalem, and it seems we can learn from this about the activity of the Armenian community in that period.

The mosaic was discovered in 1894 in the process of building the foundation for a house. The Turkish authorities requested that the archaeologists [[Frederick J. Bliss]] and [[Archibald Dickie]], who were working at the time on [[Mount Zion]], to take upon themselves the excavation work. The development work slightly damaged the edges of the mosaic, and as soon as it was discovered the work ended, and the process of uncovering and preserving the mosaic began. A small cave was discovered under the southeast part of the mosaic, including human bones and oil lights, which were dated to the Byzantine period. When the Armenian inscription was revealed, the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] expressed interest in purchasing the house, and eventually did purchase it, out of desire to emphasize the importance and centrality of the Armenian community in Byzantine Jerusalem. To this day, the mosaic is considered one of the most important sites in the history of the Armenian community in the city. As of 2009, entrance to the site is possible only by coordination with the Patriarchate.

==Dating and identification==
About 1000 mosaic floors have been discovered in the land of Israel. Most have been dated to the [[Byzantine]] period, between the years 450 and 640, when Muslims conquered the area and church art declined. Most of the mosaics adorned the floors of Greek or Armenian churches.

This mosaic covers an area of about 4 by 7 meters. It has been almost fully preserved, including a full Armenian inscription which states "To the memory and redemption of all the Armenians, whose names are known only to God". This inscription seems to indicate that the mosaic decorated the floor of a memorial chapel for the dead, a common feature of Armenian churches in the Byzantine period. Apparently the cave which was discovered under the mosaic served as part of the chapel, and perhaps it is the burial place of those Armenians "whose names are known only to God". Based on the inscription and the mosaic style, it was dated to around the year 550, since beginning in this period there are indications of Armenian presence in Jerusalem. The [[Armenian alphabet]] was created only in 404, so the mosaic cannot be any earlier than this.

==Description and analysis==
[[File:Armenian mosaic and inscr at Jerusalem.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Partial view with inscription at top.]]
The mosaic includes many figures of birds, which are inscribed in 39 round medallions formed from images of grape vines. The mosaic is bounded by a colorful "braided" frame. This is a symmetric mosaic, where elements on the right side are "reflected" to the left, so every bird on the right side has a twin on the left side, except those on the central axis. Therefore, most of the birds are facing the central axis. The birds lack "depth " and perspective: while Greek and Roman mosaic art involved perspective and three-dimensional depiction, Byzantine mosaic art which developed in Israel in the 5th century was influenced by Eastern art which tended towards "flattening" of images and division of the area into squares or medallions.

The mosaic's head is at the entrance to the room, where an [[amphora]] is displayed with peacocks on either side. The amphora with peacocks is a common motif in Byzantine mosaic art in Israel, which can also be found in the old church in [[Nahariya]] or the Byzantine church in [[Sebastopol]]. Thin, round grape vines extend from the mouth of the amphora to create the framework of the 39 medallions. Many grape leaves and clusters branch off of the vines, and are scattered around the mosaic. Interwoven grape vines are another common motif in Byzantine mosaic floors in Egypt, including in synagogues from the period, such as in [[Gaza Synagogue|Gaza]] and [[Maon Synagogue|Maon]]. It seems that the artists of the period thus continued the Roman mosaic tradition.

The birds have been identified by scholars as a variety of species found in Israel, including pigeons, geese, storks, swallows, partridge, pheasants, and more. Armenian mosaic artists extensively used natural motifs, such as trees, flowers, birds, and other animals. The motifs are therefore a clear characteristic of Armenian art in general, and to this day Armenian ceramics, for example, are characterized by natural designs.

The subject of the mosaic, according to many scholars, is the memory of the dead by the living, and the passage from this world to the afterlife. The inscription at the head of the mosaic indicates that the chapel was intended to preserve the memory of the deceased, and the entire mosaic comes, then, to strengthen the connection between the worlds. According to this approach, one may see the caged bird as a symbol of the soul encaged in the body, which separates it from the body-free souls in the afterlife. The conch, which appears above the amphora on the central axis of the mosaic, is a motif taken from ancient Greek art, where it symbolizes a holy place or royalty. Perhaps this is a symbol of "the kingdom of heaven". In addition, the eagle (or vulture) which looks backwards, unlike the other birds, perhaps symbolizes the separation from the dead and their memory. The large amphora, grape vines, and two peacocks are also motifs from the afterlife, as archaeologist [[Michael Avi-Yonah]] wrote about the synagogue in Maon in the southern West Bank: "The amphora and tendrils represent the [[Garden of Eden]], and the peacocks on either side represent immortality."

==Comparison to the Birds Mosaic in Caesarea==

In 1950, [[Birds Mosaic (Caesarea)|a mosaic]] was discovered in [[Caesarea]], which likewise included many depictions of birds within medallions. This mosaic was originally identified as a church, but later excavations in 2004 led to the conclusion that it was the courtyard of a palace from the late Byzantine period.

Despite the great similarity in terms of style and material between the two mosaics, there is no further connection between them. The Jerusalem mosaic is small, the medallions are separated by grape vines, the birds face the central axis, an the building was religious. In contrast, the Caesarea mosaic is almost three times larger, the medallions have a stone border, all the birds face to the left, and the building was private. In addition, it is unknown who created the Caesarea mosaic, and there is no indication that the artists were Armenian.

'''''Bobby''''' is a 2006 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Emilio Estevez]], and starring an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Joy Bryant]], [[Nick Cannon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Spencer Garrett]], [[Helen Hunt]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]], [[Heather Graham]], [[Elijah Wood]] and Estevez himself. The screenplay is a [[fiction]]alized account of the hours leading up to the June 5, 1968 [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|shooting]] of U.S. Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in the kitchen of the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]] following his win of the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Democratic presidential primary]] in California.

==Plot synopsis==
The film recreates the ambiance of the era and invokes the hopes inspired by Kennedy through the use of actual broadcast and newsfilm footage of the [[United States Senate|senator]] intercut with dramatic sequences involving mostly fictional characters. It uses an ensemble plot device similar to that employed in the 1932 film ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', and by [[Robert Altman]] in ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]''.

The characters include John Casey, a retired hotel doorman who spends his days playing chess with his friend Nelson in the lobby; Diane, who is marrying her friend William with the hope his marital status will have him [[Military deployment|deployed]] to a [[military base]] in [[Germany]] rather than the [[Vietnam War|battlefields]] of [[Vietnam]] when his [[tour of duty]] begins; Virginia Fallon, an alcoholic singer whose career is on the downswing, her put-upon husband/manager Tim, and her agent Phil; Miriam Ebbers, a beautician who works in the hotel salon, and her husband Paul, the hotel manager, who is having an affair with [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] operator Angela; food and beverage manager Daryl Timmons, whose racist attitude gets him fired; [[African American]] [[sous chef]] Edward Robinson and [[Mexican American]] [[busboy]]s José and Miguel; hotel coffee shop waitress Susan; Jimmy and Cooper, campaign volunteers who are sidetracked by an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]] trip they take with the help of drug dealer Fisher; married socialites and campaign donors Samantha and Jack; campaign manager Wade and staffer Dwayne, who is in love with Angela's colleague, Patricia; and [[Czechoslovakian]] reporter Lenka Janáčková, who is determined to get an interview with Kennedy. 

At the end of the film, Kennedy is shot by [[Sirhan Sirhan]] after giving his acceptance speech, and is cradled and protected by Jose until help arrives. As Kennedy's speech "[[On the Mindless Menace of Violence]]," delivered in 1968 to the [[City Club of Cleveland|City Club]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], is played over the aftermath, it is revealed that Samantha, Daryl, Cooper, Jimmy and William are among those injured by Sirhan's wild firing. Sirhan is apprehended, while Kennedy is rushed into an ambulance (as are the others eventually), and everyone else is moved by the events that have just taken place. Closing titles reveal that Kennedy died of his injuries the following morning with his wife [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel]] at his side, and the other victims of the shooting survived.

==Production==

===Development===
In ''Bobby: The Making of an American Epic'', screenwriter/director [[Emilio Estevez]] discusses the problems he had developing his script. Suffering from [[writer's block]], he checked into a motel in [[Pismo Beach]] where he hoped, free from interruption, he could make some headway with his writing. While talking to the woman working at the front desk, he discovered she had been in the Ambassador Hotel on the evening Kennedy was shot, and later married two young men to help them avoid the draft. Estevez used her experience to mold the character of Diane, and the rest of the story fell into place.

The five other characters "shot" in the assassination scene do not coincide with the five actual victims&amp;mdash;William Weisel of [[ABC News]], Paul Schrade of the [[United Auto Workers]] union, Democratic Party activist Elizabeth Evans, Ira Goldstein of the Continental News Service and 17-year-old Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900110-3,00.html |title=A Life On The Way To Death |work=TIME |date=1968-06-14 |accessdate=2018-01-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501101804/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C900110-3%2C00.html |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other character based on a real person is busboy José, who represents Juan Romero, the young man who was photographed cradling Kennedy's body immediately after he was shot. The character of José has tickets to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] game in which [[Don Drysdale]] is expected to set the record of six consecutive [[shutout]]s, but is obliged to work a double shift, forcing him to miss the game. Drysdale did in fact achieve his sixth shutout on June 4, 1968, and was congratulated by Kennedy during the victory speech he delivered just before being shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Don_Drysdale_1936 |title=Don Drysdale at |publisher=Baseballlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116155328/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Don_Drysdale_1936 |archivedate=2012-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

==Release==

After an initial [[Film premiere|premiere]] at the NUIG Student Cinema at the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]], the film premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was shown at the [[Deauville Film Festival]], the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]], the [[Vienna International Film Festival]], the [[London Film Festival]], and [[American Film Institute|AFI Fest]] before going into limited release in the US on November 17, 2006, and a wide release in the subsequent week.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Playing on two screens, it grossed $69,039 during its opening weekend. It eventually earned $11,242,801 in North America and $9,461,790 in other territories for a worldwide box office of $20,704,591.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt;

==Reception==
''Bobby'' has an approval rating of 46% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 170 reviews; the average score is 5.6 out of 10. The consensus states, "Despite best intentions from director Emilio Estevez and his ensemble cast, they succumb to a script filled with pointless subplots and awkward moments working too hard to parallel contemporary times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1162559-bobby/|title=Bobby|website=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also has a score of 54 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 31 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bobby|title=Bobby|website=Metacritic.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that despite the director's "large and honorable task" and "entirely admirable" intentions, "The actors seem more like 'very special guest stars' than like real, 1968-vintage Americans... Some of the stories feel too obviously melodramatic, while others are vague to the point of inscrutability. In the Vietnam- and drug-related plots, the point is hammered home too hard... while other narratives wind toward no discernible point at all. Nonetheless the ambition behind ''Bobby'' is large and serious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/movies/17bobb.html|title=Bobby - Review - Movies|first=A. O.|last=Scott|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Crust of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "an ambitious film drenched in sincerity and oozing with nostalgia that, despite the energy provided by its title icon via archival footage, falls flat dramatically in nearly every other way. It aspires for the [[Robert Altman|Altmanesque]] interplay of ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' or ''[[Short Cuts]]'' but instead feels like one of those '70s disaster epics such as ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' or ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', in which a star-studded cast endures melodramatic story lines as the audience awaits the inevitable momentous event and tries to guess who will be around at the finish . . . It's easy to become swept up in the palpable enthusiasm Estevez shows toward his subject, but the pedestrian and overly expositional dialogue of the film's characters proves to be as stifling as the excerpts from Kennedy's speeches are stirring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makinen |first=Julie |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-bobby17nov17,0,7778372.story |title= Los Angeles Times' review |publisher=Calendarlive.com  |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Young of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said of Estevez, "Stepping up as writer and director in a way he never has before, [he] successfully pulls together a complexly designed narrative," and added the film "carries an eerie topicality that makes many of its insights instantly click."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117931460.html|title=Review of Bobby - Variety.com|date=12 April 2008|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412140503/http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117931460.html|archivedate=12 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armond White]] of ''[[New York Press]]'' wrote that the film "has a humane sweetness", and that it "literally and vividly unites different ethnic groups, labor strata and social castes" in a way that "is not schematic—its exactitude and believability has a Tocquevillian brilliance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypress.com/article-15091-healing-with-hope.html Healing with Hope], Armond White, ''New York Press'', December 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Persall of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' graded the film C, calling it "a misguided jumble of too much fiction, few facts and zero speculation" and Estevez "a mediocre filmmaker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/11/22/Floridian/_Bobby__is__a_misnome.shtml |title= St. Petersburg Times'review |publisher=SPTimes.com  |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Medved]], who was in the Ambassador ballroom (20 feet from the podium) the night Kennedy was shot, awarded the film three out of four stars and called it "intriguing but imperfect." He added, "Emilio Estevez gets most of the feelings of the occasion right. But, the melodramatic, multi-character format proves somewhat uneven and distracting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/bobby.doc]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] said, "Estevez writes and directs with lots of passion, not so much subtlety . . . [He] wants the movie to be on the level of a Robert Altman film like ''Nashville'' but falls short."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&amp;subsec=BOBBY|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080924205145/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&amp;subsec=BOBBY|deadurl=yes|title=At the Movies|date=24 September 2008|archivedate=24 September 2008|website=Archive.is|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film one star and called it "trite fiction" and a work of "insipid ineptitude." He ranked it among the worst films of 2006, as did Lou Lumerick of the ''[[New York Post]]'', who dubbed it an "ambitious, but utterly wrong-headed trivialization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/9740235/review/12583294/bobby |title=''Rolling Stone'' review |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bookberry''' (Букбери) is a chain of [[bookstores]] based in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], and with stores in that city and in [[Yekaterinburg]]. 

The chain was launched by private investors in 2003, with 36% of its shares owned by [[Alexander Mamut]] (also a shareholder in [[Ingosstrah]], and [[Corbina Telecom]], a [[Golden Telecom]] subsidiary); a further percentage split equally between [[Roman Lola]], [[Dmitry Kushaev]] and [[Maxim Scherbakov]], and the rest by [[Waterstone’s]] founder, [[Tim Waterstone]].

In February 2008, a company controlled by [[Oleg Deripaska]], Rainko, bought a controlling stake, buying out Lola, Kushaev and Scherbakov entirely.  

By late 2008, the chain comprised 13 stores (up from 10 in late 2005), located in large [[shopping malls]] and on a number of major streets.  The CEO departed in January 2009, and by March 2009, five stores were closed, including the last-opened, on Tverskaya Street. 

On Monday 2 March 2009, the company applied for bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref&gt;Moscow Times, Moscow: 3 March 2009, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyriac K. Pullapilly''' is a [[Royal Society of Arts|Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts]], a former priest of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] and an emeritus professor of history at [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College, Indiana]].

==Biography==
Cyriac Pullapilly was born in [[South India]]. He was ordained in 1948, and completed his undergraduate studies at the St. Joseph Apostolic seminary, which at its time, was the second-largest seminary in the world. While attending the seminary, he wrote for a missionary publication called ''Home Field''. He also was part of the anti-communist movement in his college and wrote various publications critical of the communist government which controlled the legislature in his state.&lt;ref name="suburbanite"&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Priest from India views East, West|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/54969033/|accessdate=2016-10-05|agency=Suburbanite Economist|date=August 3, 1960|page=15 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he founded the Semester Around the World Program, where [[University of Notre Dame]] and Saint Mary's College, Indiana, students travelled the world and studied in India.

He has a multi-disciplinary approach to his studies and has published works on a broad range of subjects. His research has been supported by the [[Fulbright Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and in 2006 – the year in which he was admitted to the Royal Society of Arts – he held a visiting academic post at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has also established his own publishing company and produced an "inclusive-language" edition of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Queen to honor educator: Royal Society of Arts to induct SMC prof |first=Kim |last=Abeel |date=October 9, 2006 |publisher=The Observer |location=Notre Dame, IN |url=http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/2.2754/queen-to-honor-educator-1.264092#.UT5LZvnbBBl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page=xxxv |title=Asia in the Making of Europe: East Asia |first1=Donald Frederick |last1=Lach |first2=Edwin J. |last2=Van Kley |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-22646-765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife are both Indian immigrants to the United States, raising their children in [[South Bend, Indiana]]. Pullapilly is the father of filmmaker [[Gita Pullapilly]].&lt;ref name="NYT2009"/&gt;

An only child, Pullapilly's parents were initially reluctant to let him become a priest. Around 1960, he expressed interest in missionary work but said that he did not have the time.&lt;ref name="suburbanite"/&gt;

'''Dance Theater Workshop''', colloquially known as '''DTW''', was a [[New York City]] performance space and service organization for dance companies that operated from 1965 to 2011. Located as 219 [[19th Street (Manhattan)|West 19th Street]] between [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh]] and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth]] Avenues in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], DTW was founded in 1965 by Jeff Duncan, Art Bauman and Jack Moore as a choreographers' collective.  In 2002 DTW opened its new Doris Duke Performance Center, which contains the 192-seat Bessie Schönberg Theatre.

From 1975-2003, DTW was led by [[David R. White]], Executive Director and Producer. Under White's leadership, DTW became one of the most influential contemporary performing arts centers and artist incubators in the United States and abroad, responsible for identifying and nurturing some of the most important dance and other performing artists of our time, including: Bill T. Jones, Mark Morris, Susan Marshall, Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Irwin, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, Annie-B Parson and Paul Lazar, Donald Byrd and John Jasperse, among many others.

In 2011, DTW merged with the [[Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]] to become '''New York Live Arts'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorklivearts.org/about/about.php "About"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927050632/http://www.newyorklivearts.org/about/about.php |date=2011-09-27 }} on the New York Live Arts website&lt;/ref&gt;  The move was prompted by a need for financial security, with the dance company coming in as the more financially secure organization of the two &amp;ndash; DTW took on a considerable amount of debt in building its new facility.

==Scope==
More than 200 concerts and exhibits by some 70 contemporary dance, theater, music, visual and video artists were sponsored annually by Dance Theater Workshop.

==Artists==
Such notable artists as [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]], [[David Gordon (choreographer)|David Gordon]], [[Bill T. Jones]], Laura Dean, [[Susan Marshall (choreographer)|Susan Marshall]], Ron Brown, Donald Byrd, H.T. Chen, David Dorfman, Doug Elkins, Molissa Fenley, [[Whoopi Goldberg]], Lawrence Goldhuber, Margaret Fisher, Janie Geiser, [[Bill Irwin]], LadyGourd Sangoma, [[Ralph Lemon]], Bebe Miller, Michael Moschen, [[David Parsons (dancer)|David Parsons]], Lenny Pickett, Merián Soto, Pepón Osorio, [[Paul Zaloom]] and hundreds of others found an early artistic home at Dance Theater Workshop.

'''David Darryl Galloway''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSA}} (born 5 May 1937) is an American novelist, curator, journalist and academic. A graduate of [[Harvard University]], he is the founding curator of the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], a longtime contributor to the [[The International Herald Tribune|''International Herald Tribune'']], an emeritus professor at the [[Ruhr University Bochum]] and a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. He currently resides in both France and Germany.

==Early life==
David Galloway was born on 5 May 1937 in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]]. In 1955 he enrolled in Harvard University, where he was mentored by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr]].&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, Joyce, David D. Galloway, Patrick Morrisey, Nina Sutton, and Michael Bayley. New Writers. London: J. Calder, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read, Herbert, and David D. Galloway. Pioneering in Art Collecting. [Buffalo]: Albright-Knox Art Gallery, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There Galloway met [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]] student Sally Gantt, whom he married in 1959, relocating to the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] where their son was born two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, Joyce, David D. Galloway, Patrick Morrisey, Nina Sutton, and Michael Bayley. New Writers. London: J. Calder, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
David Galloway first worked as a publications editor for the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;Read, Herbert, and David D. Galloway. Pioneering in Art Collecting. [Buffalo]: Albright-Knox Art Gallery, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the United States, he taught at [[Trinity College Dublin]] and the [[University of Sussex]], freelancing as a journalist for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Poe, Edgar Allan, and David D. Galloway. Selected Writings of Edgar Allan Poe: Poems, Tales, Essays and Reviews;. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 Galloway returned to the U.S. to assist in founding the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland|New Gallery]] (later renamed the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland]]).&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, David D., and John S. Whitley. Ten Modern American Short Stories;. London: Methuen, 1968. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to Germany in 1972 after being appointed as chairman of [[American studies]] at the newly established Ruhr University Bochum, meanwhile publishing his first novel, ''Melody Jones'', to wide critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, David D. Melody Jones. London: J. Calder, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, David D. Edward Lewis Wallant. Boston: Twayne, 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

While teaching at the Ruhr University, Galloway lectured extensively throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East, including regular visits to the [[Iran-America Society]] in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkenstaedt, Thomas. Anglistenspiegel. Augsburg: [s.n.], 1977. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 he first met [[Farah Pahlavi]], [[Shahbanu|Empress consort of Iran]], whose staff was preparing to open the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Empress’ coronation. Galloway was hired as chief curator and with his staff assembled what is widely considered the most important collection of Western art outside of the Western world, including pieces by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Andy Warhol]], exhibited alongside works by Iranian artists such as [[Parviz Tanavoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Dehghan, Saeed Kamali. “Former queen of Iran on assembling Tehran's art collection.” The Guardian. 1 August 2012: Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Kim. “Picasso is hiding in Iran.” Los Angeles Times. 19 September 2007: Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months before the [[Iranian Revolution]], Galloway left Tehran for [[Wuppertal]], Germany, to resume his professorship in [[Bochum]]. While visiting [[Forcalquier]], France, he purchased the town’s former episcopal residence, known as the Maison de Chapitre, which he transformed into an informal retreat for artists and students.&lt;ref&gt;Haug, Uli. La Maison de Chapitre. Cologne: Haug, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Galloway began writing for the ''International Herald Tribune''. Throughout his many years at the paper, he maintained a close professional relationship with artists including [[Pina Bausch]], [[Keith Haring]], [[Yoko Ono]] and Andy Warhol, contacts much coveted by his editors. Alongside his journalism, Galloway published three more novels: ''A Family Album'', ''Lamaar Ransom: Private Eye'' and ''Tamsen''.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, David D. Tamsen. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Ruhr University in 2002, Galloway served as a guest curator at venues including the [[Venice Biennale]] and the [[Moscow Museum of Modern Art]] while continuing to write for ''[[Art in America]]'', ''[[ARTnews]]'' and the ''IHT''.&lt;ref&gt;Puzenkov, Georgiĭ, David D. Galloway, and Ekaterina Degotʹ. George Pusenkoff: Mona Lisa Travels. Waldenbuch: Museum Ritter, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogge, Claudia, and David Galloway. Claudia Rogge: A Retrospective. Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he opened exhibitions at both [[Art Basel|Art Basel in Miami Beach]] and the [[Kunsthalle Wien]] of paintings by singer [[Marilyn Manson]].&lt;ref&gt;Manson, Marilyn, and David Lynch. Marilyn Manson &amp; David Lynch: Genealogies of Pain. Vienna: Kunsthalle Wien, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a career spanning some fifty-five years, David Galloway has contributed to over a hundred books on the subjects of art, design, literature and architecture, while curating, reporting and teaching worldwide. He has been a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts since 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, David. Barbara Nessim: An Artful Life. New York: Abrams, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7028">[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic and most popular graphic design tools.]]

'''Design tools''' are objects, media, or computer programs, which can be used to [[design]]. They may influence the process of production, expression and perception of design ideas&lt;ref&gt;Jane Anderson: ''Architectural Design'', Basics Architecture 03, Lausanne, AVA academia, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-940411-26-9}}, p. 40 &lt;/ref&gt; and therefore need to be applied skillfully.&lt;ref&gt;Christof Ehrlich: The Construction of the Idea and its Tools, in: Design - Creativity and Materialization. Cottbus, 1999, ISSN 1434-0984.&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Objects==
New ideas can come by way of experimenting with tools and methods. Some designers explore ideas using pencil and paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws &amp; Lectures]. retrieved 31-01-2011&lt;/ref&gt; Others use many different mark-making tools and resources from computers to sculpture as a means of inspiring creativity. Traditionally, objects like pencil, compass, ruler, drawing triangle have been considered design tools and have been used to characterize design and designers.&lt;ref&gt;Elke Krasny: The Making of Architecture, Graz, 2011, at: http://www.elkekrasny.at/en/archives/tag/architektur-beginnt-im-kopf-the-making-of-architecture &lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the success of traditional design tools such as pencil and paper is that these tools can be used without any special knowledge and their usage facilitates a continuous flow of thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;PETRUSCHAT, Jörg (2001): Bemerkungen zum Zeichnen, in: form+zweck, Heft 18, pp. 70 – 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The appropriate development and presentation tools can substantially change how an audience perceives a project. The [[medium (communication)|media]] used for design can be divided in two categories, visual and verbal. Conventionally, in areas like [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], or [[graphic design]], visual media are considered more important than verbal media. In other areas like [[engineering]], the use of verbal design media may be prevalent. 

===Visual===
Visual design tools are, for example, gesture, sketch, drawing, scale model, perspective drawing, photograph, film, video. [[Eugene S. Ferguson]]'s 1977 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', entitled "The mind's eye: Nonverbal thought in technology", is credited for clarifying the role of [[visual reasoning]] in the thinking process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard S. Becker]] ''Telling About Society.'' 2007. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In this article he reasoned that "Thinking with pictures is an essential strand in the intellectual history of technological development."&lt;ref name="ESF 1977"&gt;Ferguson, Eugene S. "[http://cgt101.tech.purdue.edu/info/art01_Ferguson_1977.pdf The mind's eye: Nonverbal thought in technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318155344/http://cgt101.tech.purdue.edu/info/art01_Ferguson_1977.pdf |date=2014-03-18 }}." ''Science'' 197.4306 (1977): 827&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes his article with the following statement:
:''Much of the creative thought of the designers of our technological world is nonverbal, not easily reducible to words; its language is an object or a picture or a visual image in the mind. It is out of this kind of thinking that the clock, printing press, and snowmobile have arisen. Technologists, converting their nonverbal knowledge into objects directly (as when an artisan fashioned an American ax) or into drawings that have enabled others to build what was in their minds, have chosen the shape and many of the qualities of our man-made surroundings. This intellectual component of technology, which is non-literary and non-scientific, has been generally unnoticed because its origins lie in art and not in science.&lt;br&gt;As the scientific component of knowledge in technology has increased markedly in the 19th and 20th centuries, the tendency has been to lose sight of the crucial part played by nonverbal knowledge in making the "big" decisions of form, arrangement, and texture, that determine the parameters within which a system will operate.''&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Eugene S. (1977, p. 835); Cited in: Becker (2007, p. 167-8)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work claims Ferguson that visual reasoning is a widely used tool used in creating technological artefacts. There is ample evidence that visual methods, particularly drawing, play a central role in creating artefacts.

===Verbal===
Verbal design tools are, for example, metaphor, description, discussion, critique, theory, algorithm, calculation, program. 

==Computer programs==
[[Computer]] programs have many functions which can be discussed in terms of design tools. One of the most widely used design tools is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]], or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables designers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[Digital Mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows designers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

There is some debate whether computers enhance the creative process of design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com], topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid production from the computer allows many designers to explore multiple ideas quickly with more detail than what could be achieved by traditional hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]] on paper, moving the designer through the creative process more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; However, being faced with limitless choices does not help isolate the best design solution and can lead to endless iterations with no clear design outcome. A designer may use [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] to explore multiple or complex ideas quickly&lt;ref&gt;Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] Retrieved 3-19-2008&lt;/ref&gt; without the distractions and complications of software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9871">The '''Dialogue of Pessimism''' is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n dialogue between a master and his servant that expresses the futility of human action. It has parallels with biblical [[wisdom literature]].

==Text and dating==
The Dialogue is a loosely poetic composition in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], written soon after 1000 BC in Mesopotamia. It was discovered in five different clay tablet manuscripts written in the [[cuneiform]] script. The text is well-preserved, with only 15 of its 86 lines being fragmentary.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro, 1992: 251f&lt;/ref&gt; Two textual versions seem to survive, as a [[Babylon]]ian tablet is substantially different from [[Assyria]]n versions.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Its likely Akkadian title was ''arad mitanguranni'', the repeated phrase at the beginning of every stanza.&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 103f; Lambert, 144; Hurowitz, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and style==
The Dialogue of Pessimism takes the form of a dialogue between a master and his slave valet. In each of the first ten stanzas the master proposes a course of action, for which the slave provides good reasons. Each time, however, the master changes his mind and the slave provides equally good reasons for not pursuing that course of action. The courses of action are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I. Driving to the palace
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
II. Dining
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
III. Hunting
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IV. Marriage (“building a house” in Speiser)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
V. Litigation (this is the most fragmentary stanza)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
VI. Leading a revolution (“commit a crime” in Speiser)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
VII. Sexual intercourse
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
VIII. Sacrifice
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IX. Making investments (“plant crops” in Speiser)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
X. Public service
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A sample of the Dialogue is (Master ''Slave''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slave, listen to me! ''Here I am, master, here I am!''
&lt;br /&gt;I want to make love to a woman! ''Make love, master, make love!''
&lt;br /&gt;''The man who makes love forgets sorrow and fear!''
&lt;br /&gt;O well, slave, I do not want to make love to a woman.
&lt;br /&gt;''Do not make love, master, do not make love.''
&lt;br /&gt;''Woman is a real pitfall, a hole, a ditch,''
&lt;br /&gt;''Woman is a sharp iron dagger that cuts a man’s throat.''
&lt;br /&gt;(Stanza VII, lines 46–52) &lt;ref&gt;Translations from Bottéro, 253–257, after Lambert. Another translation is given in Speiser, who provides extensive annotations on text and translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stanza XI is substantially different:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slave, listen to me! ''Here I am, master, here I am!''
&lt;br /&gt;What then is good?
&lt;br /&gt;To have my neck and yours broken,
&lt;br /&gt;or to be thrown into the river, is that good?
&lt;br /&gt;''Who is so tall as to ascend to heaven?''
&lt;br /&gt;''Who is so broad as to encompass the entire world?''
&lt;br /&gt;O well, slave! I will kill you and send you first!
&lt;br /&gt;''Yes, but my master would certainly not survive me for three days.'' &lt;ref&gt;A similar prediction is made in [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Quentin Durward]]'', where, in [http://www.online-literature.com/walter_scott/quentin-durward/29/ chapter 29], the astrologer secures his own safety by predicting to Louis XI that the king would die 24 hours after the astrologer’s own death.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;(Lines 79–86)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dialogue is limited to two people (unlike, for instance, [[Plato]]’s dialogues), as is common in ancient Middle-Eastern wisdom literature. In the scribal tradition of Mesopotamian literature, one learns by verbal instruction and reflective reading, not by debate.&lt;ref&gt;Denning-Bolle, 230&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that it may have been a dramatic text, performed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 105; Denning-Bolle, 232&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a set of abstract or universal principles to be applied to every situation, the slave employs concrete images and instances.&lt;ref&gt;Denning-Bolle, 226, 229; Bottéro observes several times that the Mesopotamian mind did not formulate abstract or universal principles but, rather, employed sometimes exhaustive lists of instances and examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue stands consciously in the continuum of Mesopotamian literature. Line 76 quotes a line at the beginning and the end of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. Lines 86–87 quote an ancient [[Sumer|Sumerian]] saying.&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 104f&lt;/ref&gt; Lines 62–69 may allude to a part of the Great Hymn to [[Shamash]] (lines 118–127).&lt;ref&gt;Hurowitz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The Dialogue falls into the philosophical area of [[theodicy]]. Interpretation of the Dialogue is divided. Some see it as a statement of life's absurdity, because there are no definitive right and wrong choices or reasons for action. The final stanza is therefore a logical outcome of this quandary, the choice of non-existence over existential futility.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 139-142; Hartley, 353f&lt;/ref&gt; An opposing interpretation takes its cue from the slave's final cheeky retort, seeing the Dialogue as social satire, where the servile yet cheeky slave exposes the vacillation and unproductiveness of his aristocratic master through conflicting and clichéd answers.&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 103–105&lt;/ref&gt; Religious satire is also present in comments about the behaviour of the gods.

Parallels with the second-millennium Mesopotamian text ''[[Ludlul bēl nēmeqi|Monologue of the Righteous Sufferer]]'' (also known as "I will praise the Lord of Wisdom") and the biblical [[Ecclesiastes|Book of Ecclesiastes]] suggest a third interpretation. The universe is indeed enigmatic and human actions seemingly meaningless, yet the gods hold the secrets of the universe (revealed in the slave's comment about heaven and earth in Stanza XI). Rather than suggesting death out of despair, the master wants the slave to enter before him into death so that he can ask the gods. The slave’s final satirical rejoinder parries his master's suggestion. The Dialogue's purpose is partly satirical and partly serious, and its end is to remind readers that the gods control the destinies, which are unknown to us.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro, 259–267&lt;/ref&gt; The wise man, like the slave, reserves judgement and assesses possibilities in the face of life’s ambiguities, albeit while retaining his sense of humour.&lt;ref&gt;Denning-Bolle, 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels with the Old Testament==
There is a thematic parallel between the Dialogue of Pessimism and the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament. The affirmations and their negations given by the Dialogue's slave are similar to the list of actions and their opposites given in Ecclesiastes 3:1-9 ("a time to be born and a time to die..."). Ecclesiastes, like the Dialogue, has been the subject of pessimistic and optimistic interpretations, and is also amenable to the interpretation that the incomprehensibility of the universe and human life point to our limitations and the transcendent knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro, 260–262&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some parallels and contrasts with the [[Book of Job]]. Like the Dialogue, Job also considers death as an option in the face of life's contradictions (Job 3:2–13), although he never contemplates suicide. Moreover, Job does not conclude on a note of death: rather, that theme was more present at the outset. The use of irony and satire to probe life's mysteries also feature in both the Dialogue and Job (e.g. Job 9:39–31).&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, 353f&lt;/ref&gt;

A proverb appearing at the end of the dialogue, "who is so tall as to ascend to the heavens? who is so broad as to encompass the entire world?" has several biblical parallels, among which are the opening verse of the proverbs of Agur (Proverbs 30:1); Deuteronomy 30:11-14; Job 11:7-9; and Job 28:12-18.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 430; Samet 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
'''Egyptian temples''' were built for the official worship of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] and in commemoration of the [[pharaoh]]s in [[ancient Egypt]] and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of [[ritual]]s, the central functions of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]]: giving [[Sacrifice|offerings]] to the gods, reenacting their [[Egyptian mythology|mythological]] interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold ''[[maat]]'', the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties to a host of priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to [[prayer|pray]], give offerings, and seek [[oracle|oracular]] guidance from the god dwelling within.

The most important part of the temple was the [[sanctuary]], which typically contained a [[cult image]], a statue of its god. The rooms outside the sanctuary grew larger and more elaborate over time, so that temples evolved from small shrines in late [[Prehistoric Egypt]] (late fourth millennium&amp;nbsp;BC) to large stone edifices in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (c. 1550–1070&amp;nbsp;BC) and later. These edifices are among the largest and most enduring examples of [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian architecture]], with their elements arranged and decorated according to complex [[sacred architecture|patterns of religious symbolism]]. Their typical design consisted of a series of enclosed halls, open courts, and entrance [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] aligned along the path used for festival processions. Beyond the temple proper was an outer wall enclosing a wide variety of secondary buildings.

A large temple also owned sizable tracts of land and employed thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, and despite their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority.

Temple-building in Egypt continued despite the nation's decline and ultimate [[Egypt (Roman province)|loss of independence]] to the [[Roman Empire]] in 30&amp;nbsp;BC. With the [[Christianity in Egypt|coming of Christianity]], traditional Egyptian religion faced increasing persecution, and [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|temple cults died out]] during the fourth through sixth centuries AD. The buildings they left behind suffered centuries of destruction and neglect. At the start of the nineteenth century, a [[Egyptomania|wave of interest]] in ancient Egypt swept Europe, giving rise to the discipline of [[Egyptology]] and drawing increasing numbers of visitors to the civilization's remains. Dozens of temples survive today, and some have become world-famous [[Tourism in Egypt|tourist]] attractions that contribute significantly to the modern [[Economy of Egypt|Egyptian economy]]. Egyptologists continue to study the surviving temples and the remains of destroyed ones as invaluable sources of information about ancient Egyptian society.

[[File:Seti before Amun.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Relief showing an ornately dressed Egyptian man reaching toward a male figure on a pedestal|[[Low relief]] of [[Seti I]] performing rituals for the god [[Amun]]]]
[[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[temple]]s were meant as places for the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most commonly used to describe the temple building, ''ḥwt-nṯr'', means "mansion (or enclosure) of a god".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spencer|1984|pp=22, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[divine presence]] in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through [[ritual]]. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature. They were therefore a key part of the maintenance of ''[[maat]]'', the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining ''maat'' was the entire purpose of [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was the purpose of a temple as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was credited with divine power himself,{{refn|Many Egyptologists, such as [[Wolfgang Helck]] and Dietrich Wildung, have argued that the Egyptians did not believe their kings were divine. Nevertheless, the divinity of the king is constantly emphasized in official writings: the products of the royal court and religious establishment. Therefore, regardless of whether ordinary Egyptians believed in it, the king's divine nature is key to the ideology of the Egyptian temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haeny|1997|pp=126, 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} the [[pharaoh]], as a [[sacred king]], was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of ''maat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt made it impossible for him to do so in all cases, and most of the time these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=8, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the pharaoh delegated his authority, the performance of temple rituals was still an official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests. The participation of the general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited. Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place in private and community [[shrine]]s, separate from the official temples. As the primary link between the human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=103, 111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each temple had a principal deity, and most were dedicated to other gods as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all deities had temples dedicated to them. Many demons and [[Household deity|household gods]] were involved primarily in magical or private religious practice, with little or no presence in temple ceremonies. There were also other gods who had significant roles in the cosmos but, for uncertain reasons, were not honored with temples of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those gods who did have temples of their own, many were venerated mainly in certain areas of Egypt, though many gods with a strong local tie were also important across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even deities whose worship spanned the country were strongly associated with the cities where their chief temples were located. In [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|Egyptian creation myths]], the first temple originated as a shelter for a god—which god it was varied according to the city—that stood on the mound of land where the process of creation began. Each temple in Egypt, therefore, was equated with this original temple and with the site of creation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reymond|1969|pp=323–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the primordial home of the god and the mythological location of the city's founding, the temple was seen as the hub of the region, from which the city's patron god ruled over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=19–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharaohs also built temples where offerings were made to sustain their spirits in the [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife|afterlife]], often linked with or located near their tombs. These temples are traditionally called "[[mortuary temple]]s" and regarded as essentially different from divine temples. In recent years some Egyptologists, such as Gerhard Haeny, have argued that there is no clear division between the two. The Egyptians did not refer to mortuary temples by any distinct name.&lt;ref name="Haeny 89"&gt;{{harvnb|Haeny|1997|pp=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The phrase "mansion of millions of years" is often taken as the Egyptian term for a mortuary temple. In several instances the Egyptians used this phrase to refer to sacred buildings that are not generally regarded as "mortuary", such as [[Luxor Temple]] and the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]] at Karnak.&lt;ref name="Haeny 89"/&gt; Patricia Spencer suggests that the term applied to "any temple in which the cult of the king was observed, even if the temple was dedicated, in the first instance, to the chief god of the area."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spencer|1984|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} Nor were rituals for the dead and rituals for the gods mutually exclusive; the symbolism surrounding death was present in all Egyptian temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of gods was present to some degree in mortuary temples, and the Egyptologist [[Stephen Quirke]] has said that "at all periods royal cult involves the gods, but equally... all cult of the gods involves the king".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|1997b|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, certain temples were clearly used to commemorate deceased kings and to give offerings to their spirits. Their exact purpose is not fully understood; they may have been meant to unite the king with the gods, elevating him to a divine status greater than that of ordinary kingship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haeny|1997|pp=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the difficulty of separating divine and mortuary temples reflects the close intertwining of divinity and kingship in Egyptian belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and administrative===
Temples were also key centers of economic activity. The largest of them required prodigious resources and employed tens of thousands of priests, craftsmen, and laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple's economic workings were analogous to those of a large Egyptian household, with servants dedicated to serving the temple god as they might serve the master of an estate. This similarity is reflected in the Egyptian term for the temple lands and their administration, ''pr'', meaning "house" or "estate".&lt;ref name="Spencer 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Spencer|1984|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the temple's supplies came from direct donations by the king. In the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], when Egypt was an [[empire|imperial power]], these donations often came out of the spoils of the king's [[Military of ancient Egypt|military]] campaigns or the tribute given by his client states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king might also levy various taxes that went directly to support a temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katary|2011|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other revenue came from private individuals, who offered land, [[Slavery in Ancient Egypt|slaves]], or goods to temples in exchange for a supply of offerings and priestly services to sustain their spirits in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nome deities with offerings.JPG.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Relief showing two kneeling people carrying trays piled with plants, jars of liquid, and food|[[Sunk relief]] of personified [[Nome (Egypt)|province]]s of Egypt bearing offerings for the temple god&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Much of a temple's economic support came from its own resources. These included large tracts of land beyond the temple enclosure, sometimes in a completely different region than the temple itself. The most important type of property was [[Ancient Egyptian agriculture|farmland]], producing grain, fruit, or wine, or supporting herds of livestock. The temple either managed these lands directly, rented them out to farmers for a share of the produce, or managed them jointly with the royal administration. Temples also launched expeditions into the desert to collect resources such as salt, honey, or wild game, or to mine precious minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|pp=372–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some owned fleets of ships with which to conduct their own trade across the country or even beyond Egypt's borders. Thus, as [[Richard H. Wilkinson]] says, the temple estate "often represented no less than a slice of Egypt itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=50, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a major economic center and the employer of a large part of the local population, the temple enclosure was a key part of the town in which it stood. Conversely, when a temple was founded on empty land, a new town was built to support it.&lt;ref name="Kemp 661"&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|1973|pp=661, 666–667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All this economic power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. Their employees, even the priests, were subject to the state [[corvée]] system, which conscripted labor for royal projects.&lt;ref name="Katary 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Katary|2011|pp=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could also be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes. [[Harkhuf]]'s trading expedition in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished,&lt;ref name="Katary 4"/&gt; and the mortuary temples of the [[Theban Necropolis]] in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at [[Deir el-Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.&lt;ref name="Katary 4"/&gt;

The royal administration could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand. Thus, a king might increase the income of the temples of a god he favored, and mortuary temples of recent rulers tended to siphon off resources from temples to pharaohs long dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|pp=392–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most drastic means of controlling the temple estates was to completely revise the distribution of their property nationwide, which might extend to closing down certain temples. Such changes could significantly alter Egypt's economic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temples were thus important instruments with which the king managed the nation's resources and its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|pp=389, 394–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the direct overseers of their own economic sphere, the administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed a challenge to the authority of a weak pharaoh,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=169–170, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is unclear how independent they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|2006|pp=297–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt became a Roman province]], Roman officials sought to limit temples' power and independence. Temples were made to either pay rent to the government for the land they owned or surrender that land to the state in exchange for a government stipend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monson|2012|pp=136–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their cults became tightly regulated, less self-supporting, and dependent on government donations&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfurter|1998|pp=27, 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various small sources of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagnall|1993|pp=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Early development===
The earliest known shrines appeared in prehistoric Egypt in the late fourth millennium&amp;nbsp;BC, at sites such as [[Sais, Egypt|Saïs]] and [[Buto]] in [[Lower Egypt]] and [[Nekhen]] and [[Qift|Coptos]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Most of these shrines were made of perishable materials such as wood, reed matting, and [[mudbrick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verner|2013|pp=511–515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the impermanence of these early buildings, later [[art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] continually reused and adapted elements from them, evoking the ancient shrines to suggest the eternal nature of the gods and their dwelling places.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3100–2686&amp;nbsp;BC), the first pharaohs built funerary complexes in the religious center of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] following a single general pattern, with a rectangular [[adobe|mud brick]] enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1997|pp=32, 258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686–2181&amp;nbsp;BC) that followed the Early Dynastic Period, royal funerary monuments greatly expanded, while most divine temples remained comparatively small, suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized the cult of the divine king more than the direct worship of deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deities closely connected with the king, such as the sun god [[Ra]], received more royal contributions than other deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goedicke|1978|pp=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ra's temple at [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] was one of the great religious centers of the age, and several Old Kingdom pharaohs built large [[Egyptian sun temple|sun temples]] in his honor near their [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|pp=84–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the small provincial temples retained a variety of local styles from Predynastic times, unaffected by the royal cult sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|2006|pp=113–114, 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pyramide Djedkare Isesi 3.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Drawing of a pyramid surrounded by a wall. A building with many rooms extends from one side of the pyramid, and at the opposite end of the building a causeway extends out of the frame.|Reconstruction of an Old Kingdom pyramid temple, with causeway leading out to the valley temple]]
The expansion of funerary monuments began in the reign of [[Djoser]], who built his complex entirely of stone and placed in the enclosure a step pyramid under which he was buried: the [[Pyramid of Djoser]]. For the rest of the Old Kingdom, tomb and temple were joined in elaborate stone pyramid complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near each pyramid complex was a town that supplied its needs, as towns would support temples throughout Egyptian history. Other changes came in the reign of [[Sneferu]] who, beginning with his first pyramid at [[Meidum]], built pyramid complexes symmetrically along an east–west axis, with a valley temple on the banks of the [[Nile]] linked to a pyramid temple at the foot of the pyramid. Sneferu's immediate successors followed this pattern, but beginning in the late Old Kingdom, pyramid complexes combined different elements from the axial plan and from the rectangular plan of Djoser.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehner|1997|pp=18–19, 230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; To supply the pyramid complexes, kings founded new towns and farming estates on undeveloped lands across Egypt. The flow of goods from these lands to the central government and its temples helped unify the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehner|1997|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rulers of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055–1650&amp;nbsp;BC) continued building pyramids and their associated complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehner|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, like the one at [[Medinet Madi]], show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a [[sanctuary]] lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Kingdom===
[[File:Pylons and obelisk Luxor temple.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Pair of trapezoidal stone towers flanking a passage, beyond which a row of columns is visible. In front of the towers are several large statues and an obelisk.|Entrance pylon of [[Luxor Temple]], one of the major New Kingdom temples&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|1997|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With greater power and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070&amp;nbsp;BC), Egypt devoted still more resources to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and they controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth. Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spalinger|1998|pp=245, 247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important god of the time was [[Amun]], whose main cult center, the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]] at [[Karnak]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose [[High Priests of Amun|high priests]] may have wielded considerable political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=52, 174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many temples were now built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and pylon gateways oriented along the path used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their mortuary temples. Without pyramids to build around, mortuary temples began using the same plan as those dedicated to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|pp=29–33, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the New Kingdom, Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] promoted the god [[Aten]] over all others and eventually abolished the official worship of most other gods. Traditional temples were neglected while new Aten temples, differing sharply in design and construction, were erected. But Akhenaten's revolution was reversed soon after his death, with the traditional cults reinstated and the new temples dismantled. Subsequent pharaohs dedicated still more resources to the temples, particularly [[Ramesses II]], the most prolific monument-builder in Egyptian history.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 24"/&gt; As the wealth of the priesthoods continued to grow, so did their religious influence: temple oracles, controlled by the priests, were an increasingly popular method of making decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharaonic power waned, and in the eleventh century BC a military leader, [[Herihor]], made himself High Priest of Amun and the de facto ruler of [[Upper Egypt]], beginning the political fragmentation of the [[Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070–664&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|2006|pp=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the New Kingdom crumbled, the building of mortuary temples ceased and was never revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rulers of the Third Intermediate Period, such as those at [[Tanis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verner|2013|pp=334–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; were buried within the enclosures of divine temples, thus continuing the close link between temple and tomb.&lt;ref name="Gundlach 379"&gt;{{harvnb|Gundlach|2001|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later development===
In the Third Intermediate Period and the following [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell to a series of outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Sauneron 183"&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such group, the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Kushite pharaohs]] of the eighth and seventh centuries&amp;nbsp;BC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their [[Kingdom of Kush|native land of Nubia]], beginning a long tradition of sophisticated [[Nubian architecture|Nubian temple]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|pp=46, 308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid this turmoil, the fortunes of various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.&lt;ref name="Sauneron 183"/&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Gaspa - Dendara, mammisi romano (7).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Small stone building surrounded by half-walls and columns with elaborate capitals|Roman-era [[mammisi]] at [[Dendera Temple]]]]
Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finnestad|1997|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples focused more on popular religious activities such as oracles, [[Animal worship|animal cults]], and prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|pp=65, 308}}&lt;/ref&gt; New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate [[column]] styles, and the ''[[mammisi]]'', a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold 1999, pp. 282–286, 298&lt;/ref&gt; Though the characteristics of the late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] kings who [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|ruled as pharaohs]] for nearly 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Roman Empire|Rome]] conquered the Ptolemaic kingdom in 30&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Roman emperor]]s took on the role of ruler and temple patron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the temples' wealth and political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfurter|1998|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many temples in Roman Egypt continued to be built in Egyptian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including some that were dedicated to Egyptian gods—such as the temple to [[Isis]] at Ras el-Soda—were built in a style derived from [[Roman architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naerebout|2007|pp=524–529, 545–547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple-building continued into the third century&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monson|2012|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the empire weakened in the [[crisis of the third century]], imperial donations to the temple cults dried up, and almost all construction and decoration ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagnall|1993|pp=261, 267–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cult activities at some sites continued, relying increasingly on financial support and volunteer labor from surrounding communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfurter|1998|pp=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries, [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christian emperors]] issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lavan|2011|pp=xxii–xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christians attacked and destroyed temples, as in the plundering of the [[Serapeum]] and other temples in [[Alexandria]] in AD 391 or 392.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hahn|Emmel|Gotter|2008|pp=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hahn|2008|pp=344, 353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through some combination of Christian coercion and loss of funds, temples ceased to function at various times. The last temple cults died out in the fourth through sixth centuries&amp;nbsp;AD, although locals may have venerated some sites long after the regular ceremonies there had ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|pp=398–409, 423–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Many temples were abandoned during or before the third century, although mentions of priests in [[papyrus]] texts show that some cults continued to exist until at least the 330s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagnall|1993|pp=261–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple of Isis at Philae, at Egypt's southern frontier with Nubia, was the last fully functioning temple. Scholars have traditionally believed, based on the writings of [[Procopius]], that it was closed in about AD 535 by a military expedition under [[Justinian I]]. Jitse Dijkstra has argued that Procopius' account of the temple closure is inaccurate and that regular religious activity there ceased shortly after the last date inscribed at the temple, in AD 456 or 457.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|pp=421–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene Cruz-Uribe suggests instead that during the fifth and early sixth centuries the temple lay empty most of the time, but that Nubians living nearby continued to hold periodic festivals there until well into the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cruz-Uribe|2010|pp=505–506}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}

==Construction==
{{further information|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[File:Ägyptisch-Hethitischer Friedensvertrag Karnaktempel.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A stone wall that has eroded so that the joints between blocks are exposed. The blocks have straight edges but uneven shapes.|Stone construction in a temple wall]]
Temples were built throughout [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], as well as at Egyptian-controlled [[oasis|oases]] in the [[Libyan Desert]] as far west as [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]], and at outposts in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] such as [[Timna valley|Timna]]. In periods when Egypt dominated Nubia, Egyptian rulers also built temples there, as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=100, 233, 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Egyptian towns had a temple,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in some cases, as with mortuary temples or the temples in Nubia, the temple was a new foundation on previously empty land.&lt;ref name="Kemp 661"/&gt; The exact site of a temple was often chosen for religious reasons; it might, for example, be the mythical birthplace or burial place of a god. The temple axis might also be designed to align with locations of religious significance, such as the site of a neighboring temple or the rising place of the sun or particular stars. The Great Temple of [[Abu Simbel]], for instance, is aligned so that twice a year the rising sun illuminates the statues of the gods in its innermost room. Most temples were aligned toward the Nile with an axis running roughly east–west.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 36"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=36–37, 226}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Because the axis was aligned at 90 degrees from the river's generally north–south flow, irregularities in the Nile's course meant that the orientation did not always conform to true directions.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 36"/&gt;|group="Note"}}

An elaborate series of foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating it to its patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king as part of his religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it was the work of hundreds of his subjects, conscripted in the [[corvée]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction process for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing one, could last years or decades.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[stonemasonry|use of stone]] in Egyptian temples emphasized their purpose as eternal houses for the gods and set them apart from buildings for the use of mortals, which were built of mudbrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early temples were built of brick and other perishable materials, and most of the outlying buildings in temple enclosures remained brick-built throughout Egyptian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=19, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stones used in temple construction were [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]], which are common in Egypt; stones that are harder and more difficult to carve, such as [[granite]], were used in smaller amounts for individual elements like [[obelisk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=27, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone to build a temple might be quarried nearby or shipped on the Nile from [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|quarries]] elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple structures were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=109–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most periods, walls and other structures were built with large blocks of varying shape.&lt;ref name="Arnold 120"&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In their earliest stone constructions the Egyptians made small blocks shaped like mud bricks. Large blocks were typical of all other periods, except in the [[Amarna period]], when temples to the Aten were built with small, standardized ''[[talatat]]'' blocks, possibly to speed up construction.&lt;ref name="Arnold 120"/&gt; Ptolemaic and Roman temples were built in regular courses, with the blocks within each course cut to the same height.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} The blocks were laid in courses, usually without [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=115–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps built of varying materials such as mud, brick, or rough stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=80–81, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[rock-cut architecture|cutting chambers in living rock]], workers excavated from the top down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, [[relief]]s were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface.&lt;ref name="Robins 20"&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|1986|pp=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliefs were then decorated with [[gilding]], [[inlay]], or paint.&lt;ref name="Uphill"&gt;{{harvnb|Uphill|1973|pp=730–731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments with some kind of adhesive, possibly [[natural gum]].&lt;ref name="Robins 20"/&gt;

Temple construction did not end once the original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures. On rare occasions this may have been because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, but in most cases the reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, as happened at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and decoration==
[[File:SFEC AEH -ThebesNecropolis-2010-RamsesIII045-3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Rectangular stone building from above, with courtyards and pylons at the front and the remains of walls at the back. A rectangular wall and the foundations of other buildings surround the main building.|The temple of [[Ramesses III]] at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]], surrounded by the remains of subsidiary structures]]
Like all [[ancient Egyptian architecture]], Egyptian temple designs emphasized order, symmetry, and monumentality and combined geometric shapes with stylized organic motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2001|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of temple design also alluded to the form of the earliest Egyptian buildings. [[Cavetto cornice]]s at the tops of walls, for instance, were made to imitate rows of palm fronds placed atop archaic walls, and the [[grade (slope)|batter]] of exterior walls, while partly meant to ensure stability, was also a holdover from archaic building methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|pp=28, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple ground plans usually centered on an axis running on a slight incline from the sanctuary down to the temple entrance. In the fully developed pattern used in the New Kingdom and later, the path used for festival processions—a broad avenue punctuated with large doors—served as this central axis. The path was intended primarily for the god's use when it traveled outside the sanctuary; on most occasions people used smaller side doors.&lt;ref name="Assmann 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical parts of a temple, such as column-filled [[hypostyle hall]]s, open [[peristyle]] courts, and towering entrance [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]]s, were arranged along this path in a traditional but flexible order. Beyond the temple building proper, the outer walls enclosed numerous satellite buildings.  The entire area enclosed by these walls is sometimes called the ''[[temenos]]'', the sacred precinct dedicated to the god.&lt;ref name="Dunand 79"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple pattern could vary considerably, apart from the distorting effect of additional construction. Many temples, known as [[hypogea]], were cut entirely into living rock, as at Abu Simbel, or had rock-cut inner chambers with masonry courtyards and pylons, as at [[Wadi es-Sebua]]. They used much the same layout as free-standing temples but used excavated chambers rather than buildings as their inner rooms. In some temples, like the mortuary temples at [[Deir el-Bahari]], the processional path ran up a series of terraces rather than sitting on a single level. The Ptolemaic [[Temple of Kom Ombo]] was built with two main sanctuaries, producing two parallel axes that run the length of the building. The most idiosyncratic temple style was that of the Aten temples built by Akhenaten at [[el-Amarna]], in which the axis passed through a series of entirely open courts filled with altars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|pp=44–51, 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional design was a highly symbolic variety of [[sacred architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a greatly elaborated variant on the design of an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home.&lt;ref name="Spencer 17"/&gt; Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was equated with the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's ''[[Egyptian soul#Ba|ba]]'', or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ''ba'' came to inhabit its [[mummy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=38, 43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world.&lt;ref name="Assmann 31"/&gt; Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the world itself. The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across the sky, and the sanctuary for the [[Duat]] where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus equated with the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos and the place where that order was continually renewed.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 76"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inner chambers===
The temple's inner chambers centered on the sanctuary of the temple's primary god, which typically lay along the axis near the back of the temple building, and in pyramid temples directly against the pyramid base. The sanctuary was the focus of temple ritual, the place where the divine presence manifested most strongly. The form in which it manifested itself varied. In Aten temples and [[Egyptian sun temple|traditional solar shrines]], the object of ritual was the sun itself or a ''[[benben]]'' stone representing the sun, worshipped in a court open to the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|pp=64–65, 88, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many mortuary temples, the inner areas contained statues of the deceased pharaoh, or a [[false door]] where his [[ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#bꜣ (personality)|bꜣ]] ("personality", Egyptological ''ba'') was believed to appear to receive offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1997|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edfu naos.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Small room with a cabinet-like structure near the back|Shrine in the [[cella]] of the [[Temple of Edfu]]]]
In most temples, the focus was the [[cult image]]: a statue of the temple god which that god's ''ba'' was believed to inhabit while interacting with humans.{{refn|No surviving statues of deities are known for certain to have been cult images, although a few have the right characteristics to have served that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozloff|2001|pp=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} The sanctuary in these temples contained either a [[Shrine|naos]], a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]] containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay at the very back of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.&lt;ref name="Assmann 31"/&gt;

Subsidiary chapels, dedicated to deities associated with the primary god, lay to the sides of the main one. When the main temple god was male, the secondary chapels were often dedicated to that god's mythological consort and child. The secondary chapels in mortuary temples were devoted to gods associated with kingship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=70, 82, 178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other rooms neighbored the sanctuary. Many of these rooms were used to store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings were given to the deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor.&lt;ref name="Dunand 79"/&gt; Finally, in the exterior wall at the back of the temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.&lt;ref name="Teeter 77"&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2011|pp=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halls and courts===
[[File:SFEC EGYPT ESNA 2006-012.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Large, shadowy room filled with tall, thick columns. The column capitals are shaped like stylized flowers.|Hypostyle hall of [[Esna Temple]]]]
Hypostyle halls, covered rooms filled with columns, appear in temples throughout Egyptian history. By the New Kingdom they typically lay directly in front of the sanctuary area.&lt;ref name="Arnold 113"&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|pp=113, 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; These halls were less restricted than the inner rooms, being open to laymen at least in some cases.&lt;ref name="Teeter 77"/&gt; They were often less dark as well: New Kingdom halls rose into tall central passages over the processional path, allowing a [[clerestory]] to provide dim light. The epitome of this style is the [[Great Hypostyle Hall]] at Karnak, whose largest columns are {{convert|69|ft|m|0}} tall. In later periods, the Egyptians favored a different style of hall, where a low screen wall at the front let in the light.&lt;ref name="Arnold 113"/&gt; The shadowy halls, whose columns were often shaped to imitate plants such as [[Lotus (plant)|lotus]] or [[papyrus]], were symbolic of the mythological marsh that surrounded the primeval mound at the time of creation. The columns could also be equated with the pillars that held up the sky in Egyptian cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the hypostyle hall were one or more [[peristyle]] courts open to the sky. These open courts, which had been a part of Egyptian temple design since the Old Kingdom, became transitional areas in the standard plan of the New Kingdom, lying between the public space outside the temple and the more restricted areas within. Here the public met with the priests and assembled during festivals. At the front of each court was usually a [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]], a pair of trapezoidal towers flanking the main gateway. The pylon is known from only scattered examples in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but in the New it quickly became the distinctive and imposing façade common to most Egyptian temples. The pylon served symbolically as a guard tower against the forces of disorder and may also have been meant to resemble the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] for "horizon", underscoring the temple's solar symbolism.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 60"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The front of every pylon held niches for pairs of flagpoles to stand. Unlike pylons, such flags had stood at temple entrances since the earliest Predynastic shrines. They were so closely associated with the presence of a deity that the hieroglyph for them came to stand for the Egyptian word for "god".&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 60"/&gt;

===Enclosure===
Outside the temple building proper was the temple enclosure, surrounded by a rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties in the fourth century BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of invasion by the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egyptian vignettes luxor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Vaulted brick buildings|Brick storehouses at the [[Ramesseum]]]]
The walls enclosed many buildings related to the temple's function. Some enclosures contain satellite chapels dedicated to deities associated with the temple god, including [[mammisi]]s celebrating the birth of the god's mythological child. Sacred lakes found in many temple enclosures served as reservoirs for the water used in rituals, as places for the priests to ritually cleanse themselves and as representations of the water from which the world emerged.&lt;ref name="Dunand 79"/&gt;

[[Mortuary temple]]s sometimes contain a palace for the spirit of the king to whom the temple was dedicated, built against the temple building proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mortuary Temple of Seti I]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] incorporates an unusual underground structure, the [[Osireion]], which may have served as a symbolic tomb for the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanatoria]] in some temples provided a place for the sick to await healing dreams sent by the god. Other temple buildings included kitchens, workshops, and storehouses to supply the temple's needs.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 74"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially important was the ''[[wikt:pr ꜥnḫ|pr ꜥnḫ]]'' "house of life", where the temple edited, copied, and stored its religious texts, including those used for temple rituals. The house of life also functioned as a general center of learning, containing works on non-religious subjects such as history, geography, [[Egyptian astronomy|astronomy]], and [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=132–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these outlying buildings were devoted to more mundane purposes than the temple itself, they still had religious significance; even [[granary|granaries]] might be used for specific ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 74"/&gt;

Through the enclosure ran the processional path, which led from the temple entrance through the main gate in the enclosure wall. The path was frequently decorated with [[sphinx]] statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which was linked to the pyramid temple by the processional causeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|pp=227, 252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decoration===
{{further information|Art of ancient Egypt}}
[[File:SFEC-MEDINETHABU-2009-11-14-0008.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Stone doorway whose jambs and lintels are covered with images and hieroglyphs in relief. The reliefs are painted various colors.|Decoration on doorframes and ceilings at Medinet Habu]]
The temple building was elaborately decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculpture, all with religious significance. As with the cult statue, the gods were believed to be present in these images, suffusing the temple with sacred power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols of places in Egypt or parts of the cosmos enhanced the mythical geography already present in the temple's architecture. Images of rituals served to reinforce the rituals' magical effect and to perpetuate that effect even if the rituals ceased to be performed. Because of their religious nature, these decorations showed an idealized version of reality, emblematic of the temple's purpose rather than real events.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gundlach|2001|pp=369, 371–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the king was shown performing most rituals, while priests, if depicted, were secondary. It was unimportant that he was rarely present for these ceremonies; it was his broader role as intermediary with the gods that mattered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=28, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important form of decoration is relief.&lt;ref name="Gundlach 371"&gt;{{harvnb|Gundlach|2001|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relief became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finnestad|1997|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were free-standing [[stela]]e erected within the enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hölzl|2001|pp=320–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian artists used both bas relief and [[sunken relief]]. Bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken relief. Sunken relief was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone and when the builders wanted to finish quickly.&lt;ref name="Robins 20"/&gt; It was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in bright sunlight.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 43"/&gt; Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors,&lt;ref name="Robins 20"/&gt; and Ptolemaic temples were especially colorful, using unusual colors such as purple as accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some temples, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or [[Egyptian faience|faience]] substituted for paint.&lt;ref name="Uphill"/&gt;

Temple decoration is among the most important sources of information on Ancient Egypt. It includes calendars of festivals, accounts of myths, depictions of rituals, and the texts of hymns. Pharaohs recorded their temple-building activities and their campaigns against the enemies of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Gundlach 371"/&gt; The Ptolemaic temples go further to include information of all kinds taken from temple libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finnestad|1997|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration in a given room either depicts the actions performed there or has some symbolic tie to the room's purpose, providing a great deal of information on temple activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interior walls were divided into several [[register (art)|registers]]. The lowest registers were decorated with plants representing the primeval marsh, while the ceilings and tops of walls were decorated with stars and flying birds to represent the sky.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 76"/&gt; Illustrations of rituals, surrounded by text related to the rituals, often filled the middle and upper registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts and exterior walls often recorded the king's military exploits. The pylon showed the "smiting scene", a motif in which the king strikes down his enemies, symbolizing the defeat of the forces of chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text on the walls was the formal [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic script]]. Some texts were written in a "cryptographic" form, using symbols in a different way than the normal conventions of hieroglyphic writing. Cryptographic text became more widespread and more complex in Ptolemaic times. Temple walls also frequently bear written or drawn [[graffiti]], both in modern languages and in ancient ones such as [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], the form of Egyptian that was commonly used in Greco-Roman times. Although not part of the temple's formal decoration, graffiti can be an important source of information about its history, both when its cults were functioning and after its abandonment. Ancient graffiti, for instance, often mention the names and titles of priests who worked in the temple, and modern travelers often inscribed their names in temples that they visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graffiti left by priests and pilgrims at Philae include the [[Graffito of Esmet-Akhom|last ancient hieroglyphic text]], inscribed in AD 394, and the last one in Demotic script, from AD 452.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monumental sculpture|Large, free-standing sculpture]] included [[obelisk]]s, tall, pointed pillars that symbolized the sun. The largest of them, the [[Lateran Obelisk]], was more than {{convert|118|ft|m|0}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|pp=62, 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were often placed in pairs in front of pylons or elsewhere along the temple axis. Statues of the king, which were similarly placed, also reached colossal size; the [[Colossi of Memnon]] at the [[mortuary temple of Amenhotep III]] and the statue of Ramesses II at the [[Ramesseum]] are the largest free-standing statues made in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also figures of gods, often in sphinx form, that served as symbolic guardians of the temple. The most numerous statues were votive figures donated to the temple by kings, private individuals, or even towns to gain divine favor. They could depict the god to whom they were dedicated, the people who donated the statue, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozloff|2001|pp=242–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most essential temple statues were the cult images, which were usually made of or decorated with precious materials such as gold and [[lapis lazuli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple needed many people to perform its rituals and support duties. Priests performed the temple's essential ritual functions, but in Egyptian religious ideology they were far less important than the king. As temple decoration illustrates, all ceremonies were, in theory, acts by the king, and priests merely stood in his place. The priests were therefore subject to the king's authority, and he had the right to appoint anyone he wished to the priesthood. In fact, in the Old and Middle Kingdoms most priests were government officials who left their secular duties for part of the year to serve the temple in shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the priesthood became more professional, the king seems to have used his power over appointments mainly for the highest-ranking positions, usually to reward a favorite official with a job or to intervene for political reasons in the affairs of an important cult. Lesser appointments he delegated to his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] or to the priests themselves. In the latter case, the holder of an office named his own son as his successor, or the temple clergy conferred to decide who should fill an empty post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=43–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priestly offices were extremely lucrative and tended to be held by the wealthiest and most influential members of Egyptian society,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1986|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Roman economic reforms reduced the temples’ resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monson|2012|pp=218–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, little is known about what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of [[Ritual purification|ritual purity]] in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be [[celibacy|celibate]], but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=35–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the [[Third Intermediate Period]]. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and the most important of these consorts, the [[God's Wife of Amun]], even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doxey|2001|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the head of the temple hierarchy was the high priest, who oversaw all the temple's religious and economic functions and in the largest cults was an important political figure. Beneath him might be as many as three grades of subordinate priests who could substitute for him in ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2011|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these higher ranks were full-time positions from the New Kingdom onward, the lower grades of priesthood still worked in shifts over the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doxey|2001|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas many priests did a variety of menial tasks, the clergy also contained several ritual specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=60, 70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent among these specialized roles was that of the [[lector priest]] who recited hymns and spells during temple rituals, and who hired out his magical services to laymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritner|1993|pp=220, 232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides its priests, a large temple employed singers, musicians, and dancers to perform during rituals, plus the farmers, bakers, artisans, builders, and administrators who supplied and managed its practical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ptolemaic era, temples could also house people who had sought [[Right of asylum|asylum]] within the precinct, or [[recluse]]s who voluntarily dedicated themselves to serving the god and living in its household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=306–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major cult, therefore, could have well over 150 full or part-time priests,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janssen|1978|pp=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; with tens of thousands of non-priestly employees working on its lands across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers contrast with mid-sized temples, which may have had 10 to 25 priests, and with the smallest provincial temples, which might have only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some priests' duties took them beyond the temple precinct. They formed part of the entourage in festivals that traveled from one temple to another, and clergies from around the country sent representatives to the national [[sed festival]] that reinforced the king's divine power. Some temples, such as those in the neighboring cities of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and [[Letopolis]], were overseen by the same high priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At certain times there was an administrative office that presided over all temples and clergies. In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers. In the reign of [[Thutmose III]] the office passed from the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it for much of the New Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=176–177, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans established a similar office, that of the high priest for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monson|2012|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious activities==

===Daily rituals===
The daily rituals in most temples included two sequences of [[sacrifice|offering]] rites: one to clean and dress the god for the day, and one to present it with a meal. The exact order of events in these rituals is uncertain and may have varied somewhat each time they were performed. In addition, the two sequences probably overlapped with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=41–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; At sunrise, the officiating priest entered the sanctuary, carrying a candle to light the room. He opened the doors of the shrine and prostrated himself before the god's image, reciting hymns in its praise. He removed the god from the shrine, clothed it (replacing the clothes of the previous day), and anointed it with oil and paint.&lt;ref name="Dunand 90"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point the priest presented the god's meal, including a variety of meats, fruits, vegetables, and bread.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2001|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The god was believed to consume only the spiritual essence of this meal. This belief allowed the food to be distributed to others, an act that the Egyptians called the "reversion of offerings". The food passed first to the other statues throughout the temple, then to local funerary chapels for the sustenance of the dead, and finally to the priests who ate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Englund|2001|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The quantities even for the daily meal were so large that only a small part of it can have been placed on the offering tables. Most of it must have gone directly to these secondary uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janssen|1978|p=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}

Temple artwork often shows the king presenting an image of the goddess [[Maat]] to the temple deity, an act that represented the purpose of all other offerings.&lt;ref name="Dunand 90"/&gt;{{refn|The king may have presented a real figurine of Maat to the deity, or the temple reliefs depicting the act may have been purely symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}

Other offering rituals took place at noon and at sunset, though the sanctuary was not reopened.&lt;ref name="Dunand 90"/&gt; Some ceremonies other than offerings also took place daily, including rituals specific to a particular god. In the cult of the sun god [[Ra]], for instance, hymns were sung day and night for every hour of the god's journey across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ceremonies acted out in ritual the battle against of the forces of chaos. They might, for instance, involve the destruction of models of inimical gods like [[Apep]] or [[Set (deity)|Set]], acts that were believed to have a real effect through the principle of ''[[heku|ḥkꜣ]]'' ([[Egyptian language#Egyptological pronunciation|Egyptological pronunciation]] ''heka'', Coptic: {{Script/Coptic|ϩⲓⲕ}} ''hik'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/entry.cgi?entry=5753&amp;super=2277|title=Coptic Dictionary Online|website=corpling.uis.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) "[[magic (supernatural)|magic]]".&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

In fact, the Egyptians believed that all ritual actions achieved their effect through ḥkꜣ.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|1967|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a fundamental force that rituals were meant to manipulate. Using magic, people, objects, and actions were equated with counterparts in the divine realm and thus were believed to affect events among the gods.&lt;ref name="Ritner 247"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritner|1993|pp=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the daily offering, for instance, the cult statue, regardless of which deity it represented, was associated with [[Osiris]], god of the dead. The priest performing the ritual was identified with [[Horus]], the living son of Osiris, who in mythology sustained his father after death through offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; By magically equating himself with a god in a myth, the priest was able to interact with the temple deity.&lt;ref name="Ritner 247"/&gt;

===Festivals===
On days of particular religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spalinger|2001|p=521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their timing was based on the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian civil calendar]], which most of the time was far out of step with the astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spalinger|1998|pp=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 95"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=92–94, 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SFEC-RAMSES-II-TEMPLE-2009-130 c.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Relief showing rows of men carrying poles that support a model boat|Priests carrying a festival barque in a relief from the Ramesseum]]
Festival ceremonies entailed reenactment of mythological events or the performance of other symbolic acts, like the cutting of a sheaf of wheat during the harvest-related festival dedicated to the god [[Min (god)|Min]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|1967|pp=25, 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these ceremonies took place only within the temple building, such as the "union with the sun disk" festival practiced in the Late Period and afterwards, when cult statues were carried to the temple roof at the start of the New Year to be enlivened by the rays of the sun. In festivals that involved a procession, priests carried the divine image out from the sanctuary, usually in its model barque, to visit another site. The barque might travel entirely on land or be loaded onto a real boat to travel on the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verner|2013|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the god's visit varied. Some were tied to the ideology of kingship. In the [[Opet Festival]], an extremely important ceremony during the New Kingdom, the image of Amun from Karnak visited the form of Amun worshipped at [[Luxor Temple]], and both acted to reaffirm the king's divine rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|1997|pp=158, 174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other celebrations had a [[ancient Egyptian funerary practices|funerary character]], as in the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], when Amun of Karnak visited the mortuary temples of the [[Theban Necropolis]] to visit the kings commemorated there, while ordinary people visited the funerary chapels of their own deceased relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2011|pp=66–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may have centered on [[hieros gamos|ritual marriages]] between deities, or between deities and their human consorts, although the evidence that ritual marriage was their purpose is ambiguous. A prominent example is a festival in which an image of [[Hathor]] from the [[Dendera Temple complex]] was brought annually to visit the [[Temple of Edfu]], the temple of her mythological consort [[Horus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stadler|2008|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These varied ceremonies were united by the broad purpose of renewing life among the gods and in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|1967|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gods involved in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so it is likely that the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janssen|1978|pp=513–514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred animals===
[[File:Apis bull on coffin.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a bull on a platform. The bull has a yellow disk and a pair of feathers between its horns.|The [[Apis (deity)|Apis]]]]
Some temples kept sacred animals, which were believed to be manifestations of the temple god's ''ba'' in the same way that cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a year to the lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the [[Apis (deity)|Apis]], a [[sacred bull]] worshipped as a manifestation of the  [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphite]] god [[Ptah]], and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Late Period, a different form of worship involving animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god. These animals were not regarded as especially sacred, but as a species they were associated with the god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god [[Thoth]], for instance, could be depicted as an [[ibis]] and as a [[baboon]], and both ibises and baboons were given to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ray|2001|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Dunand and Zivie-Coche, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the [[Serapeum of Saqqara]] where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|Smith|1997|pp=116–120, 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oracles===
By the beginning of the New Kingdom, and quite possibly earlier, the festival procession had become an opportunity for people to seek [[oracle]]s from the god. Their questions dealt with subjects ranging from the location of a lost object to the best choice for a government appointment. The motions of the barque as it was carried on the bearers' shoulders—making simple gestures to indicate "yes" or "no", tipping toward tablets on which possible answers were written, or moving toward a particular person in the crowd—were taken to [[divination|indicate the god's reply]].&lt;ref name="Kruchten"&gt;{{harvnb|Kruchten|2001|pp=609–611}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Greco-Roman period, and possibly much earlier, oracles were used outside the festival, allowing people to consult them frequently. Priests interpreted the movements of sacred animals or, being asked questions directly, wrote out or spoke answers that they had supposedly received from the god in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfurter|1998|pp=148–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priests' claim to speak for the gods or interpret their messages gave them great political influence and provided the means for the High Priests of Amun to dominate Upper Egypt during the Third Intermediate Period.&lt;ref name="Kruchten"/&gt;

===Popular worship===
Although they were excluded from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=107, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to interact with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.&lt;ref name="Lesko 337"&gt; {{harvnb|Lesko|2001|pp=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naophorus MAN Napoli Inv1068.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Statue of a kneeling man holding a box containing a small male figure|Votive statue of a man donating a shrine containing a figure of [[Osiris]]]]
Unable to address the cult image directly, laymen still attempted to convey their prayers to it. At times they related messages to priests to deliver to the temple deity; at other times they expressed their piety in the parts of the temple that they could access. Courts, doorways, and hypostyle halls might have spaces designated for public prayer.&lt;ref name="Teeter 77"/&gt; Sometimes people directed their appeals to the royal colossi, which were believed to act as divine intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More private areas for devotion were located at the building's outer wall, where large niches served as "chapels of the hearing ear" for individuals to speak to the god.&lt;ref name="Teeter 77"/&gt;

The Egyptians also interacted with deities through the donation of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae.&lt;ref name="Lesko 337"/&gt; Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving portions of the temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, so many of these statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=62–64, 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2011|pp=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Festival processions offered a chance for laymen to approach and perhaps even glimpse the cult image in its barque, and for them to receive portions of the god's food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the key rituals of any festival still took place within the temple, out of public sight, Egyptologist Anthony Spalinger has questioned whether the processions inspired genuine "religious feelings" or were simply seen as occasions for revelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spalinger|1998|pp=245, 249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the oracular events during festivals provided an opportunity for people to receive responses from the normally isolated deities, as did the other varieties of oracle that developed late in Egyptian history. Temples eventually became a venue for yet another type of divine contact: dreams. The Egyptians saw dreaming as a means of communion with the divine realm, and by the Ptolemaic period many temples provided buildings for [[incubation (ritual)|ritual incubation]]. People slept in these buildings in hopes of contacting the temple god. The petitioners often sought a magical solution to sickness or infertility, but at other times they simply sought an answer to a question, receiving the answer through a dream rather than an oracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=119–120, 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After abandonment==
After their original religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying to erase the remnants of ancient Egyptian religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|1997|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some temple buildings, such as the ''mammisi'' at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were [[Christianized sites|adapted into churches]] or other types of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|pp=405–406, 427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of [[Khnum]] at [[Elephantine]], while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|pp=420–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=27–29, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limestone was especially useful as a source of [[lime (material)|lime]], so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|1997a|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=29, 102, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation changed dramatically with the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]] in 1798, which brought with it a [[Commission des Sciences et des Arts|corps of scholars]] to examine the surviving ancient monuments. The results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient Egypt throughout Europe. In the early nineteenth century, growing numbers of Europeans traveled to Egypt, both to see the ancient monuments and to collect Egyptian antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many temple artifacts, from small objects to enormous obelisks, were removed by outside governments and private collectors. This wave of [[Egyptomania]] resulted in the rediscovery of temple sites such as Abu Simbel, but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=103, 126, 179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoveries of the period made possible the [[decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and the beginnings of [[Egyptology]] as a scholarly discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=xi, 160–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karnak45.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction work on a pylon at [[Karnak]], from whose interior ''[[talatat]]'' blocks from the [[Amarna Period]] are being retrieved&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 2000 7, 240–242"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=7, 240–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Nineteenth-century Egyptologists studied the temples intensively, but their emphasis was on collection of artifacts to send to their own countries, and their slipshod excavation methods often did further harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly the antique-hunting attitude toward Egyptian monuments gave way to careful study and preservation efforts. The government also took greater control of archaeological activity as Egypt's independence from foreign powers increased.

Yet even in recent times the ancient remains have faced threats. The most severe was the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]] in the 1960s, which threatened to submerge the temples in what had been Lower Nubia beneath the newly formed [[Lake Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=250–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major effort by the [[United Nations]] disassembled some of the threatened monuments and rebuilt them on higher ground, and the Egyptian government gave several of the others, such as the [[Temple of Dendur]], [[Temple of Taffeh]], and [[Temple of Debod]], as gifts to nations that had contributed to the preservation effort. Nevertheless, several other temples vanished beneath the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=219–220, 230, 242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are dozens of sites with substantial temple remains,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000}}, Pt. V, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; although many more once existed, and none of the major temples in Lower or [[Middle Egypt]] are well preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|1997|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that are well preserved, such as Karnak, Luxor, and Abu Simbel, draw tourists from around the world and are therefore a key attraction for the [[tourism in Egypt|Egyptian tourist industry]], which is a major sector of the [[economy of Egypt|Egyptian economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Egypt State Information Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three temple sites—Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis, Memphis and its Necropolis, and the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae—have been designated by [[UNESCO]] as [[List of World Heritage Sites in Egypt|World Heritage Sites]]. The Egyptian government is working to balance the demands of tourism against the need to [[Historic preservation|protect ancient monuments]] from the harmful effects of tourist activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] work continues as well, as many temple remains still lie buried and many extant temples are not yet fully studied. Some damaged or destroyed structures, like the temples of Akhenaten, are even being reconstructed. These efforts are improving modern understanding of Egyptian temples, which in turn allow better understanding of ancient Egyptian society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 2000 7, 240–242"/&gt;

The '''''Heures de Charles d'Angoulême''''' is a [[book of hours]] commissioned in the late 15th century by [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], father of king [[Francis I of France]]. It is now in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, under the number Latin 1173.

The book contains full-page miniatures mostly painted by [[Robinet Testard]], many of which have been adapted from, and inspired by, engravings, including sixteen prints by [[Israhel van Meckenem]] which have been glued onto the vellum and overpainted. The book is notable for both the quality of its art, and its various methods of incorporating prints, which testifies to the "complex history of interchanges between printed materials and manuscript illumination during the later fifteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, pp.4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Letter R from folio52r.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|One of the [[historiated initial|inhabited letter]]s from the manuscript's unusual Ave Maria (folio 52r)]]
A [[book of hours]] is a manuscript designed for personal devotion and was popular in the Middle Ages. This illuminated work made for [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]] by the painter [[Robinet Testard]] is an unusual volume and is more comprehensive than just a set of devotions.  The artist seems to understand his sponsor's character. As well as its devotional purpose, the book seems designed to entertain, to arouse curiosity (f. 52v), to amuse (ff 3r, 4v and 5r), to satisfy the sponsor's aesthetic sense (ff. 16v and 26v), to encourage his pastoral feelings (f. 20v), to encourage his chivalrous instincts (f. 2v) and even to flatter him (f. 41v).&lt;ref name=Moleiro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.moleiro.com/fr_LHCA_LHEVIII_LHEIV_III_16.pdf |title=Les Heures de Charles d'Angoulême |author= |date= |work=Catalogue |publisher=M. Moleiro |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The folios most concerned with personal devotion, the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Christ]] (f. 106v), were in fact the work of the engraver [[Israhel van Meckenem]], subsequently coloured by Testard with his characteristic luminous hues. Other work by painters such as [[Jean Bourdichon]] were included and may demonstrate Testard's honesty, his admittance that his talents were insufficient for the task. He also introduced some profane elements such as sexual encounters (ff. 4v and 20v), mythology (f. 41v) and chivalry (f. 53v). The text is entirely in [[Latin]], and the book can be interpreted as being the antithesis of a book of hours, or even an anti-book of hours.&lt;ref name=Moleiro/&gt; 

Some important pages include; the animated scene of the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]]; the mysterious image showing the death of the [[centaur]]; the moral scene "Combat between Virtue and Vice"; the political scene "Death of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]"; the picture of "the Spider King and his daughter Madame [[Anne de Beaujeu]]"; and [[George of Cappadocia]], a legendary scene which is more appropriate to a [[chivalric romance]] than a book of hours.&lt;ref name=Moleiro/&gt;

|[[Christ Pantocrator]] and the [[Tetramorph]]

This miniature is adapted by Testard from an engraving by van Meckenem, itself a copy of an [[:File:Maître E. S. Saint Jean Baptiste et l'agneau de Dieu L. 149.jpg|earlier 1466 print]] by [[Master E. S.]] The original print features John the Baptist in the centre, whom Testard has replaced with Christ amongst angels. Surrounding, the four symbols of the evangelists are arranged in a [[Latin cross]]: John's eagle (top), the winged lion of Mark (left), the bull of Luke (right), and Matthew's angel (bottom). The other medallions show the four doctors of the Church: [[Jerome]] with lion (top left); [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory]] (top right), [[Augustine]] (bottom right), and Ambrose (bottom left).

Testard largely keeps to original composition, which may have been a design for a [[paten]]. He has made some alterations to the faces and postures of the other characters, and added four prophets to the corners, skillfully extending and elaborating the foliate motifs to unify the image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/516c1f3a66be7 Lepape]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Annunciation to the shepherds]]: country dance

A scene of a country dance which at first seems unconnected to this part of the book of hours. Closer examination reveals it to be a combination of religious and picturesque elements: a shepherd in the background points to an angel in the sky who is accompanied by a [[Speech scroll|phylactery]] bearing the words of the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/516c1f990f7dd Hermant]&lt;/ref&gt;

|Death and the Centaur

Testard has been influenced here by Netherlandish printmaker [[Master I. A. M. of Zwolle]]'s ''Battle of Two Men with a Centaur'', to which he introduces [[Death (personification)|Death]], a lion and a [[Wild man|wild-woman]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation of this scene is problematic. Typically understood to represent a [[Centaur]] battling the [[Lapiths]], a purely mythological tale and unusual subject for use in the "Office for the Dead", Belkin posits that this contest between man and beast is "symbolic of the struggle against dark forces. The Centaur and the wild woman form a single unit—the personification of vice in terms of Christian allegory. The private nature of the Book of Hours leads one to infer that Charles used the allegory of the struggle with the Vices for his own political vendetta against his rivals, conveying in this enigmatic miniature his bitter enmity towards those who had wronged him."&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]

17 [[Historiated initial|historiated letters]] on a background of gold which spell "Ave Maria, gracia ple[na]" from the first chapter of Luke. This is the reading for the [[Feast of the Annunciation]] (March 25)

The first letter is copied from the alphabet of [[Master E. S.]] (itself inspired by the late-14th century pattern-book by {{illm|Giovannino de' Grassi|it}}). Testard seems to have modeled the rest of the letters upon another woodblock alphabet of around 1464 from Flanders or the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/5640868159100 Lepape] Two incomplete prints of  the 1464 alphabet series are in the British Museum, [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1349441&amp;partId=1 B,10.1–23] and 1947,0724.1–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Diagram for calculating the date of Easter

On the reverse of the Ave Maria is a diagram for [[Computus|calculating the date of Easter]]. Originally, "the vivid colours of the concentric circles behind the diagram must have stood out more clearly against the cream-coloured parchment [however] one of the components used to make the golden ground of the Ave Maria, probably silver, has gone rusty and seeped deep into the parchment". The main spoke, pointing up, features a sequence of nineteen Roman numerals representing years in the [[Metonic cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/56408458d0169 Hermant]&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Saint George and the Dragon]] (I. M.)

A print by van Meckenem, lightly coloured by Testard, depicting St George, patron saint of chivalry and military orders across medieval Europe. "The choice of this dragon-slaying saint rather than [[St Michael]], the patron saint of the crown of France from Louis XI onwards, was probably the result of a desire to disassociate Charles from the king of France".

Testard leaves the original print largely unaltered except for the conical hat and veil of the princess which he has replaced with a turban reflecting contemporary fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moleiro.com/en/books-of-hours/the-hours-of-charles-of-angoulme/miniatura/56408477a4322 Lepape]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Labarum of Constantine the Great.svg|thumb|Labarum of Constantine I, displaying the "Chi-Rho" symbol above.]]
The '''labarum''' ({{lang-el|λάβαρον}}) was a ''[[vexillum]]'' (military standard) that displayed the "[[Chi-Rho]]" symbol &lt;big&gt;[[☧]]&lt;/big&gt;, a [[christogram]] formed from the first two [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] of the word "[[Christ]]" ({{lang-el|ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ}}, or Χριστός) — ''[[Chi (letter)|Chi]]'' (χ) and ''[[Rho (letter)|Rho]]'' (ρ).&lt;ref&gt;In [[Unicode]], the Chi-Rho symbol is encoded at U+2627 (☧), and for [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] at U+2CE9 (⳩).&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used by the [[Roman Emperors|Roman emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]]. Since the vexillum consisted of a flag suspended from the crossbar of a cross, it was ideally suited to symbolize the [[crucifixion of Christ]].

Ancient sources draw an unambiguous distinction between the two terms "labarum" and "Chi-Rho", even though later usage sometimes regards the two as synonyms. The name labarum was applied both to the original standard used by Constantine the Great and to the many standards produced in imitation of it in the [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] world, and subsequently.

==Etymology==
Beyond its derivation from Latin ''labarum'', the etymology of the word is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;H. Grégoire, "L'étymologie de 'Labarum'" ''Byzantion'' '''4''' (1929:477-82)&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford English Dictionary offers no further derivation from within Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Hoad, T. F. ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' (repr. 1996) {{ISBN|0-19-283098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some derive it from Latin /labāre/ 'to totter, to waver' (in the sense of the "waving" of a flag in the breeze) or ''laureum [vexillum]'' ("laurel standard").&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;Kazhdan, p. 1167&lt;/ref&gt; An origin as a loan into Latin from a Celtic language or [[Basque language|Basque]] has also been postulated. There is a traditional Basque symbol called the [[lauburu]]; though the name is only attested from the 19th century onwards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_oeh&amp;view=frontpage&amp;Itemid=413&amp;lang=eu |title=Orotariko Euskal Hiztegia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher=Euskaltzaindia |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the motif occurs in engravings dating as early as the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name="Camille"&gt;M. Camille Jullian in his preface to ''La tombe basque'', according to [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/87432?idi=en&amp;clave=87432&amp;op=4&amp;primR=21&amp;regs=10&amp;EIKVOGEN=lauburu&amp;pos=29&amp;epi=64714#mrc1 Lauburu: La swástika rectilínea] (Auñamendi Entziklopedia).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision of Constantine==
[[Image:As-Constantine-XR RIC vII 019.jpg|thumb|300px|A coin of Constantine (c. AD 337) showing a depiction of his labarum spearing a serpent.]]
On the evening of October 27, 312 AD, with his army preparing for the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]], the emperor [[Constantine I]] claimed to have had a vision which led him to believe he was fighting under the protection of the [[Abrahamic God|Christian God]].

[[Lactantius]] states that, in the night before the battle, Constantine was commanded in a dream to "delineate the heavenly sign on the shields of his soldiers". Obeying this command, "he marked on their shields the letter X, with a perpendicular line drawn through it and turned round thus at the top, being the cipher of Christ". Having had their shields marked in this fashion, Constantine's troops readied themselves for battle.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, [http://orderofcenturions.org/documents/lactantius.html ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors'', chapter 44.5].&lt;/ref&gt;

From Eusebius, two accounts of a battle survive. The first, shorter one in the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' leaves no doubt that God helped Constantine but does not mention any vision. In his later ''Life of Constantine'', Eusebius gives a detailed account of a vision and stresses that he had heard the story from the emperor himself.&lt;ref&gt;Harries, p. 110 - text and footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this version, Constantine with his army was marching somewhere (Eusebius does not specify the actual location of the event, but it clearly is not in the camp at Rome) when he looked up to the sun and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words ''Ἐν Τούτῳ Νίκα''. The traditionally employed Latin translation of the Greek is ''[[in hoc signo vinces]]''&amp;mdash; literally "In this sign, you will conquer." However, a direct translation from the original Greek text of Eusebius into English gives the phrase "By this, conquer!"&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, p. 183. Quoting Eusebius, "About the time of the midday sun, when the sky was just turning, [Constantine] said he saw with his own eyes, up in the sky and resting over the sun, a cross-shaped trophy formed from light, and a text attached to it which said, 'By this conquer'" (Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine'', trans. Averil Cameron and S. G. Hall (Oxford, 1999), I.28-32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harries, p. 109-111&lt;/ref&gt;

At first he was unsure of the meaning of the apparition, but the following night he had a dream in which Christ explained to him that he should use the sign against his enemies. Eusebius then continues to describe the labarum, the military standard used by Constantine in his later wars against [[Licinius]], showing the Chi-Rho sign.&lt;ref&gt;Gerberding and Moran Cruz, 55; cf. Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those two accounts have been merged in popular notion into Constantine seeing the Chi-Rho sign on the evening before the battle. Both authors agree that the sign was not readily understandable as denoting Christ, which corresponds with the fact that there is no certain evidence of the use of the letters chi and rho as a Christian sign before Constantine. Its first appearance is on a Constantinian silver coin from c. 317, which proves that Constantine did use the sign at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  He made extensive use of the Chi-Rho and the labarum later in the conflict with Licinius.

The vision has been interpreted in a solar context (e.g. as a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|solar halo]] phenomenon), which would have been reshaped to fit with the Christian beliefs of the later Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, P. (2003) ''The Vision of Constantine'', Journal of Roman Archaeology, Vol. 16, pp. 240-245&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate explanation of the intersecting celestial symbol has been advanced by George Latura, which claims that Plato's visible god in ''Timaeus'' is in fact the intersection of the Milky Way and the Zodiacal Light, a rare apparition important to pagan beliefs that Christian bishops reinvented as a Christian symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Latura, G. "Plato’s Visible God: The Cosmic Soul Reflected in the Heavens." '''Religions''' 2012, 3, 880-886. http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/3/3/880&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eusebius' description of the labarum==
[[Image:Konstantin den stores labarum, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|Constantine's labarum, with a [[Chi Rho|wreathed Chi Rho]] from an antique silver medal]]

"A Description of the Standard of the Cross, which the Romans now call the Labarum."
"Now it was made in the following manner. A long spear, overlaid with gold, formed the figure of the cross by means of a transverse bar laid over it. On the top of the whole was fixed a wreath of gold and precious stones; and within this, the symbol of the Saviour’s name, two letters indicating the name of Christ by means of its initial characters, the letter P being intersected by X in its centre: and these letters the emperor was in the habit of wearing on his helmet at a later period. From the cross-bar of the spear was suspended a cloth, a royal piece, covered with a profuse embroidery of most brilliant precious stones; and which, being also richly interlaced with gold, presented an indescribable degree of beauty to the beholder. This banner was of a square form, and the upright staff, whose lower section was of great length, of the pious emperor and his children on its upper part, beneath the trophy of the cross, and immediately above the embroidered banner."

"The emperor constantly made use of this sign of salvation as a safeguard against every adverse and hostile power, and commanded that others similar to it should be carried at the head of all his armies."&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine, Chapter XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconographic career under Constantine==
[[Image:Maiorina-Vetranio-siscia RIC 281.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Coin of [[Vetranio]], a soldier is holding two labara. Notably, they differ from the labarum of Constantine in having the Chi-Rho depicted on the cloth rather than above it, and in having their staves decorated with [[Phalera (military decoration)|phalerae]] as were earlier Roman military unit standards.]]
[[Image:Consular diptych Probus 406.jpg|thumb|right|The emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] holding a variant of the labarum - the Latin phrase on the cloth means "In the name of Christ [rendered by the Greek letters XPI] be ever victorious."]]
The labarum does not appear on any of several standards depicted on the [[Arch of Constantine]], which was erected just three years after the battle. If Eusebius' oath-confirmed account of Constantine's vision and the role it played in his victory and conversion can be trusted, then a grand opportunity for the kind of political propaganda that the Arch was built to present was missed. Many historians have argued that in the early years after the battle, the Emperor had not yet decided to give clear public support to Christianity, whether from a lack of personal faith or because of fear of religious friction. The arch's inscription does say that the Emperor had saved the ''[[res publica]]'' &lt;small&gt;INSTINCTV DIVINITATIS MENTIS MAGNITVDINE&lt;/small&gt; ("by greatness of mind and by instinct [or impulse] of divinity"). Continuing the iconography of his predecessors, Constantine's coinage at the time was inscribed with solar symbolism, interpreted as representing ''[[Sol Invictus]]'' (the Unconquered Sun), [[Helios]], [[Apollo]], or [[Mithras]], but in 325 and thereafter the coinage ceases to be explicitly pagan, and Sol Invictus disappears. And although Eusebius' ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiae]]'' further reports that Constantine had a statue of himself "holding the sign of the Savior [the cross] in his right hand" erected after his victorious entry into Rome, there are no other reports to confirm such a monument.

Historians still dispute whether Constantine was the first [[Christian]] Emperor to support a peaceful transition to Christianity during his rule, or an undecided pagan believer until middle age, and also how strongly influenced he was in his political-religious decisions by his Christian mother [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]].

As for the labarum itself, there is little evidence for its use before 317.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, JH, p. 104: "What little evidence exists suggests that in fact the labarum bearing the chi-rho symbol was not used before 317, when Crispus became Caesar..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of Constantine's second war against Licinius in 324, the latter developed a superstitious dread of Constantine's standard. During the attack of Constantine's troops at the [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]] the guard of the labarum standard were directed to move it to any part of the field where his soldiers seemed to be faltering. The appearance of this talismanic object appeared to embolden Constantine's troops and dismay those of Licinius.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; At the final battle of the war, the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]], Licinius, though prominently displaying the images of Rome's pagan pantheon on his own battle line, forbade his troops from actively attacking the labarum, or even looking at it directly.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine felt that both Licinius and [[Arius]] were agents of Satan, and associated them with the serpent described in  the [[Book of Revelation]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#12:9|12:9]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine and the Christian empire'' by Charles Matson Odahl 2004 {{ISBN|0-415-17485-6}} page 315&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine represented Licinius as a snake on his coins.&lt;ref&gt;''A Companion to Roman Religion'' edited by [[Jörg Rüpke]] 2011 {{ISBN|1-4443-3924-9}} page 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius stated that in addition to the singular labarum of Constantine, other similar standards (labara) were issued to the Roman army.  This is confirmed by the two labara depicted being held by a soldier on a coin of [[Vetranio]] (illustrated) dating from 350.

==Later usage==
[[Image:Wurzach St Verena Kirchenfahnen Taufstein.jpg|thumb|left|Modern ecclesiastical labara (Southern Germany).]]
[[Image:Monomacho's crown - circa 1042 Budapest.JPG|thumb|right|The emperor [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] (centre panel of a Byzantine enamelled crown) holding a miniature labarum]]
A later Byzantine manuscript indicates that a jewelled labarum standard believed to have been that of Constantine was preserved for centuries, as an object of great veneration, in the imperial treasury at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Lieu and Montserrat p. 118. From a Byzantine life of Constantine (BHG 364) written in the mid to late ninth century.&lt;/ref&gt; The labarum, with minor variations in its form, was widely used by the Christian Roman emperors who followed Constantine.

A miniature version of the labarum became part of the imperial regalia of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rulers, who were often depicted carrying it in their right hands.

The term "labarum" can be generally applied to any ecclesiastical banner, such as those carried in religious processions.

"The Holy Lavaro" were a set of early national Greek flags, blessed by the Greek Orthodox Church. Under these banners the Greeks united throughout the [[Greek revolution|Greek Revolution]] (1821), a war of liberation waged against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Labarum also gives its name ([[Labaro]]) to a suburb of [[Rome]] adjacent to [[Prima Porta]], one of the sites where the 'Vision of Constantine' is placed by tradition.

''Ghosts of Fear Street'' is a younger version of the ''Fear Street'' series, aimed at children ages 8 to 12. In every book, a 12-year-old child (sometimes with their friends or family) has a terrifying adventure in Fear Street, a small street in the town of Shadyside which is known by the kids in the books to have lots of ghosts and monsters. Every book has a different monster and child. The series was released by the [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] imprint [[Aladdin Paperbacks]], and lasted for thirty-six books, released from 1996 to 1998. In August 2009, Simon &amp; Schuster, under their Children's Publishing imprint, began to reissue the books in special two-in-one editions.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Hide-and-Shriek-and-Whos-Been-Sleeping-in-My-Grave/R-L-Stine/e/9781416991342/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being published under Stine's name, the books were in fact [[Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the copyright page, Emily James wrote book 1, while Stephen Roos wrote book 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mammoth spear thrower''' is a [[spear thrower]] in the form of a [[mammoth]], discovered at the [[rock shelter]] of [[Montastruc, Tarn-et-Garonne]], France. It is from the late [[Magdalenian]] period and around 12,500 years old. It now forms part of the [[Henry Christy|Christy Collection]] in the [[British Museum]] (Palart 551), and is normally on display in Room 2.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/s/mammoth_spear_thrower.aspx Spear thrower carved as a mammoth.] British Museum 2011. Retrieved 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 7 February – 26 May 2013 it was displayed in the exhibition at the British Museum ''Ice Age Art: Arrival of the Modern Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ice_age_art.aspx Ice Age Art: Arrival of the Modern Mind]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The spear thrower was carved from a reindeer antler and depicts a mammoth with a hole for an eye which probably held a bone or stone insert originally. The hook has been repaired after the antler from which it was carved broke. The tusks of the mammoth appear on each side but have mostly been lost due to damage. It is about 12&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

The mammoth is produced in low-relief on both sides of the object. When it was discovered, the broken tail hook had already been repaired. This was achieved by drilling a hole through the mammoth shape, just in front of the broken hook - and inserting in another piece of antler (Sieveking 1987, 65).

Spear throwers were first used in western Europe about 20,000 years ago and enabled hunters to launch spears with more force and speed than if they threw just by hand. It was common for them to be decorated with animal carvings.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

Other types of spear throwers include the perforated batons, which are also often decorated. A wonderful [[Baton fragment (Palart 310)|example]] from La Madeleine can be seen at the British Museum in Room 2.

'''''Mound of Butter''''' is a [[still life]] painting of a mound of [[butter]], by the 19th-century French [[Realism (arts)|realist]] painter [[Antoine Vollon]] made between 1875 and 1885. The painting is in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington D.C.]], with the ''[[New York Times]]'' calling it one of "Washington’s Crown Jewels".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/impressionism-masters-shine-in-intimate-setting-at-the-legion-of-honor/Content?oid=2752862 |title=Impressionism masters shine in intimate setting at The Legion of Honor |last=Gallagher |first=Lauren |date=April 3, 2014 |website=The San Francisco Examiner |access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/01/16/arts/0116-COLLECTIONS_9.html|title=Washington's Crown Jewel|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2009|website=www.nytimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painter==
Throughout his career, Vollon was best known as a painter of [[still life]]s, this including his [[landscape art|landscape]]s and [[figure painting|figure]]s. He was part of the French Realist movement, and in his lifetime achieved celebrity status, earning a number of prestigious awards such as the [[Legion of Honor]], and declared "the Chardin of his day" (alluding to the French master of still life paintings, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]]). In the late nineteenth century, Vollon's paintings maintained popularity, and thus many of his works are in private collections today. French writer [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]] and fellow American painter [[William Merritt Chase]], for example, collected his various artworks.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildenstein.com/exhibits/vollon/|title=Antoine Vollon : A Painter's Painter|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.wildenstein.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224222256/http://www.wildenstein.com/exhibits/vollon/|archive-date=24 Dec 2014|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vollon was a member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], and his works were present at the [[Paris Salon]] for over thirty years, together with other realist [[French painters]] like [[Charles-François Daubigny]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] and [[Eugène Boudin]], but Vollon is not quite as celebrated or remembered today as his other French Realist colleagues such as Corot and Fantin-Latour.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Painting==
The painting is a great example of Vollon's [[still life]] art, depicting a mound of butter, coloured in rich, deep yellow colour (presumably from the [[carotene]] of the fresh plants that [[grazing]] [[cows]] commonly eat on [[Field (agriculture)|barn fields]]). At the time when Antoine Vollon lived, it was usual to purchase the butter from the farmer, handmade. 

Typically, after milking, the cream is to be collected, [[churned]] and the butter lumps are [[knead|kneaded]] by hand or worked with a spatula to get rid of the [[moisture]] from it, because the high amounts of buttermilk would shorten its [[food conservation|storage life]]. Back then, butter was usually stored wrapped in a [[cheesecloth]], in a cool place. In the painting, the butter mound's cloth is falling loosely over a couple of [[egg]]s beside it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE3DC1E30F937A15751C1A9629C8B63|title=Art in Review; Antoine Vollon|last=|first=|date=December 24, 2004|website=www.nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting also has thick marks layered on top of the artist's [[brush]]-work, probably meant to illustrate the marks after the [[butter knife]] was used to spread butter with; or the [[wooden]] [[spatula]], used to spread the butter with and also used in producing the butter. Kitchen scenes, [[food preparation]], and depiction of everyday objects were a usual subject for still lifes in Vollon's time.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1938534 |title= Mound of Butter: Antoine Vollon |publisher=The Art of JAMA |accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norman Adams''' (October 3, 1933 in Walla Walla, Washington – July 4, 2014) was an American commercial artist and illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fred Adams Oct. 3, 1933 — July 4, 2014|url=http://union-bulletin.com/news/2014/jul/07/fred-adams/|accessdate=18 September 2015|agency=union-bulletin|date=7 July 2014}}  {{dead link|date=April 2016}}(not available in wayback machine due to robots.txt)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mantle Fielding's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Opitz, Editor|first=Glenn B.|title=Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of american Painters, Sculptors &amp; Engravers|year=1987|publisher=Apollo Book|location=Poughkeepsie, NY|isbn=0-938290-04-5|page=1047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Norman began to draw and paint when he was still a child. He collected pictures from every type of magazine and book he could find and then found ways of improving them. He was especially captivated by the ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' realism of artists like [[William Harnett]], [[John F. Peto]] and [[John Haberle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

He studied art at the Los Angeles Art Center School in the early 1950s.  While he was in Los Angeles he spent months painting a portfolio in which he used his ''trompe l'oeil'' [[realism (arts)|realism]] to convince the managers of the largest illustration agencies in NY that he could do what no other artist/illustrator could. The three largest agencies in NY wanted to hire him. He chose to work for the Charles E Cooper Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmanart.org/html/charles_e__cooper_studio.html |title=CEC |publisher=Atmanart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While Norman was working in NY he met his idol Robert Fawcett at a [[Society of Illustrators]] exhibition.
 
Like most established Illustrators at the time Norman Adams considered [[Robert Fawcett]] to be: "The Illustrator's Illustrator."  When Norman Adams finally met Robert Fawcett, he, Fawcett, was so impressed with Adams' paintings that he considered Norman to be a Babe Ruth of Illustration, perhaps because Norman worked for the "New York Yankees" of Illustration at the time: the "preeminent" Charles E Cooper Studio.

Another more obvious reason Fawcett might have referred to Norman as Cooper's Babe Ruth was his versatility. When Norman was working for Cooper only Don Crowley could paint realistically enough to be versatile. All of Cooper's other Illustrators, like Murray Tinkelman, Coby Whitmore, James Bama … were too specialized to be versatile. Not only were they specialized but they were specialized for so long that they would not do jobs outside their “specialty.”

What separated Norman's paintings from others was the “trompe l'oeil” detail he routinely put into his paintings. It was this extra detail that made his paintings stand out, especially to professions like Cooper and Fawcett.

Illustrators took for granted that it was a waste of time to put detail into their originals that would be lost in the published reproduction. Norman also knew this, but what he did not take for granted: although much of the “trompe l'oeil” detail he put into his originals would be lost in reproduction, it was this detail that  would get him new jobs that other illustrators would not get. It was all these additional jobs that made him Cooper's “Babe Ruth.”

Norman Adams' illustrations included works for [[Reader's Digest]], [[Boys' Life]], [[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]],  [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]], [[TV Guide]], [[Saturday Evening Post]], [[True Magazine]], [[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]], [[Sports Afield]], [[Field and Stream]], [[Business Week]], [[Cabela's]], Medical Economics, and other paperback covers. He also authored a textbook now in its 30th Edition, ''Drawing Animals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Animals-Anniversary-Norman-Adams/dp/0823013669 |title=Drawing Animals: 30th Anniversary Edition: Norman Adams, Joe Singer: 9780823013661: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the magazines started to fail the Charles E Cooper Studio had to downscale. This prompted Norman Adams to join an elite group of illustrators at Artists Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmanart.org/html/artists_associates.html |title=ArtistAssoc |publisher=Atmanart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 Lenox hired him to do a very limited edition Lenox Collection of 12 unique plates that were released in 1982 called ''The American Wildlife Plates by Norman Adams.'' In the mid-1980s Norman Adams was given an opportunity to paint for the 1988 Minnesota Wildlife Art Show. His work was a life-sized Golden Eagle in a Grand Canyon setting. For years he sold his wildlife and animal paintings in [http://www.trailsidegalleries.com/ galleries] in Scottsdale, Arizona,  and Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

'''Nuvolo''' (born Giorgio Ascani, October 12, 1926 – October 10, 2008) was an [[list of Italian painters|Italian painter]], pioneer of pictorial techniques applied to [[screen printing]] and [[computer graphics]].

[[File:Nuvolo Cuciti a macchina.jpg|thumb|Nuvolo Cuciti a macchina]]

==Biography and works==

===Early life===
Nuvolo was born on October 12, 1926 in [[Città di Castello]], one of the major centers for typographic industry in Italy. His parents involved him in their printing workshop early in his life.
The nickname “Nuvolo” (cloud) was given to him during the Second World War, when as teenage partisan his peers compared his quick appearances to a sudden cloud in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Corà, Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine, Città di Castello, 2005, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young artisan in the first years after the war, he soon showed manual dexterity in various fields, from decoration to set design, and gradually he focused his attention on silkscreen and its potential uses, working either in his family workshop or at the local graphic arts school, where he found teachers who fostered his disposition toward exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Iori “Per una serigrafia empatica” in B.Corà Nuvolo la pittura e l’atelier di grafica, Città di Castello, 1992 and B.Corà Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine, Città di Castello, 2005, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Rome with Alberto Burri===
In 1949, Nuvolo moved to Rome, at the suggestion of his friend and fellow countryman [[Alberto Burri]]. Nuvolo primarily became Burri's collaborator at his [[Via Margutta]] studio,  matching his work as an advertising artist with a first series of screen printing, the first foray into the field of visual arts.

Although silk screen tools were very poor at the times, he was the first in Italy, to adopt this technique for artistic goals. He created abstract figures by silk screen, utilizing dichromate gel, adopted from the rotogravure printing technique.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Iori, ibidem&lt;/ref&gt;

If in such graphic experiments he was initially influenced by his friend’s matter research, Nuvolo would soon find his own creative autonomy in this medium as an innovator himself.

===The “informal” climate===
Working as an aid for Burri, Nuvolo got more and more in touch with a group of informal painting artists who characterized that decade. He associated with the (short lived) "Gruppo Origine", founded between 1949 and 1950 and formed by [[Corrado Cagli]], [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]], [[Mario Balocco]], [[Ettore Colla]] and Burri himself, sharing an interest for new materials to connect to painting and a progressive departure from the use of paintbrush.

===The “serotipie”===
Around the middle of the Fifties, the quality of silk screens improved and helped Nuvolo to achieve new results in terms of printing and graphic experimentation: in 1954, “Arti Visive”, innovative art journal (alternitavely directed by Ettore Colla and by poet and Biblicist [[Emilio Villa]] along with his brother Ascanio Ascani), displayed his first official works on its covers and within its pages.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Tagliaferri, Il clandestino vita e opere di Emilio Villa, Roma, 2004, pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

The name “Serotipie” was coined by Emilio Villa, who found a new artistic meaning for the silk screen abstract works, not intending them as reproduction series but unique printing works, made by an industrial tool and elaborated by acrylic and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Tagliaferri, ibidem&lt;/ref&gt;
Interested on the role of causality in arts, similar to [[Pollock]]’s [[dripping]], and focusing on various fields like physic, astronomy and mathematics, Nuvolo gave a new status to silk screen tool and its artistic potential.&lt;ref&gt;"serotipia is to be intended as painting made by the tool of serigraphy, or silscreen, but inside the limits of the unique specimen, uncopyable” E. Villa exhibition catalogue Mostra di serotipie di Lorri e Nuvolo, Roma, Libreria "Al ferro di cavallo", 1958, page unnumbered&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silk screen paintings and collages===
In 1956 Nuvolo married Liana Baracchi and together they organized an atelier for graphic arts which flourished for more than fifty years, first in Rome and then moving to his native Città di Castello in the Early Eighties.
Silk screen printing became the starting point for a vast array of artistic applications extending into many different fields over the years such as weaving, graphic arts, digital graphics and video art, considered by the author as a private field of research and expression, more than as elements for the marketing of art.
As the critic Bruno Corà wrote, “the Mondrian and Burri lesson found Nuvolo as exponent of principles so able to create an additional zone of poetic sensibility between the Cartesian rigor of the Dutch and the epic and dramatic nature of the Italian”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Corà Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine, Città di Castello, 2005, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sewing machine production===
Applying a small motor to a simple Vigorelli sewing machine, Nuvolo started a new cycle of spatial construction in the early Sixties. Textiles and fabrics led to unexpected geometric solutions “mixing – as the critic [[Gillo Dorfles]] wrote – the precedent experiences of [[Patchwork]] and [[Ready Made]]”&lt;ref&gt;Gillo Dorfles, ''Ultime tendenze nell'arte d'oggi: dall'informale al concettuale'', Milano, 1973, pp. 38-50&lt;/ref&gt; in the series “Tensioni” (Tensions), “Diagrammi” (Diagrams) and “Daini” (Deers).

===New frontiers in serigraphy===
In the decade from 1967 to 1977, the formal conjunctions of the “Oigrog” series,(with the anagrammatic title of the artist's name “Giorgio”), established a new serigraphic series based on the principles of fluid mechanics. The author used nitro colors giving life to psychedelic figures “simultaneously archetypical and android, as a last dynasty of golems produced by arts”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Corà, ''Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine'', Città di Castello, 2005, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
The “Modulari” of 1969/1971 defined a new dynamic progression in symmetrical secularity of photographs created with silk screen.

===Digital production===
A new formal concept based on vector mathematics was introduced to Nuvolo by the developing of Informatics in the early Eighties, supported by his sons Giorgio, photographer and Paolo, computer technician.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Iori “Per una serigrafia empatica” in B. Corà ''Nuvolo la pittura e l’atelier di grafica'', Città di Castello, 1992 pp. 313-316 and B. Corà ''Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine'', Città di Castello, 2005, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;
In “Alpha 39” (1987/89) series he used binary code, forging a scientific approach which led to the “Aftermandelbrot” series (1989/1992), following the fractal  theories of [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] forcing it through a combination of “guided errors”, deviations to the formula by computer, which created a proliferation of images by colors related to numerical values.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Corà, ''Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine'', Città di Castello, 2005, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

This computer graphics production led to the work created in the Nineties with the cycles of “Circuiti” (Circuits), “Dittici e Trittici” (Diptychs and Triptychs),  “Enantiomorfi” (Enantiomorphs), “Omogeni”, till the last “Turbolenze” (Turbulences) of 1998 and “Legni Collage” (Wood collage) of 2002. The various applications of the “Genesi” (Genesis) cycle, started around 1994, which combined a particular manual intervention and a deeply pondered dialogue with video and sound based on the symphonies of [[Bach]].

==Main exhibitions and collaborations==
[[File:Nuvolo New York.jpg|thumb]]
The first personal exhibition by Nuvolo was held in 1955 at the roman Gallery “Le Carrozze”, presented by the poet Emilio Villa. In the same year Corrado Cagli organized the second show in Florence, as the painter began to participate in various collective exhibitions with the coeval innovators of Informal paintings like Cagli himself, Burri, [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]], [[Giulio Turcato]], Mirko, [[Edgardo Mannucci]], [[Carla Accardi]], Achille Perilli and [[Piero Dorazio]]. 
He participated to important festivals such as the [[Rome Quadriennale]] and the Premio Lissone, which led him to the attention of [[Lucio Fontana]] and the innovators in Milan, as well as beginning a lifetime collaboration with [[Ettore Colla]].

Nuvolo's innovative activity was also encouraged by [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who bought some of his works at “La Tartaruga” Gallery in Rome, for both her US and Italian collections. Around 1967 he started a long and important collaboration in the field of graphic arts with many contemporary artists like Corrado Cagli, [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]] and Alberto Burri, who came back to work with him after many years for the chromatic cycle “Sestante” in the Mid-Eighties.

In 2002 he returned to produce the “esoedizioni” with various authors and critics exposing the works at the XVIII Century typography "Grifani Donati" in his hometown, alongside the collaborator Marco Baldicchi.&lt;ref&gt;Titles of the new editions of “esoedizioni” for the publishing house “I libri di AIEUO”, Città di Castello: B. Corà ''Avviso ai naviganti, Nuvolo, Turbolenze'' (2002), A. Iori, ''Sei lettere e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2003), A. Leveque ''Ciò che sente un uomo e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2003), V. Nocchi, ''Sulla pensabilità dell’origine. Riflessione in margine a “Genesi” e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2003), M. Diacono, C''os’è una poesia e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2004), M. Napolitano, ''Due poesie e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2004), A. Tagliaferri ''Una materia controversa e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2003), M. Baldicchi, ''Appunti di viaggio e cinque invenzioni di Nuvolo'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate fifty years of his activity [[Perugia]] and his hometown Città di Castello hosted an articulated exhibition encompassing a complete monographic study of his art by the critic Bruno Corà, “Nuvolo, the painting space between order and chaos”.

In 2017 Di Donna Galleries in New York announced "Nuvolo and Post-War Materiality 1950 – 1965", an exhibition curated by [[Germano Celant]] focusing Nuvolo’s role in "radically redefining traditional notions of painting and sculpture by exploiting the physical properties of raw materials using unmediated processes"&lt;ref&gt;''Nuvolo and Post-War Materiality 1950 – 1965'' exhibition catalogue p. 3 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; in the "cuciti a macchina", "daini", and "diagrammi" series, contextualized by works by European and American artists as [[Burri]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Cy Twombly]], Ettore Colla, [[Pietro Consagra]], [[Jean Fautrier]], Addie Herder, [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Manolo Millares]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], Angelo Savelli, [[Salvatore Scarpitta]], Toti Scialoja.

==Teaching==
In 1977, after some years of teaching in the schools of arts in and outside Rome he won the Chair of Painting Arts at the Academy of Fine Arts of Perugia, where he became director from 1979 to 1984.
Under his guidance the athenaeum reached a new way in teaching and promoting arts so that many important contemporary artists were invited to and actively collaborated with the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Iori “Per una serigrafia empatica” in B.Corà ''Nuvolo la pittura e l’atelier di grafica'', Città di Castello, 1992, and B.Corà ''Nuvolo lo spazio pittorico tra caos e ordine'', Città di Castello, 2005, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Nuvolo Archive==
When the artist passed away in his hometown on December 2008, Nuvolo was already entered in the small circle of contemporary arts innovators and today his works are found in the collections of some of the major museums of Italy, France, Israel and United States.

In 2015 the family of the artist founded the “Nuvolo Archive” and donated some of his main works to the [[Pinacoteca Comunale, Città di Castello]], which now sit amongst the rich historic and artistic heritage of the city.

[[Image:Pelliotcave2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Paul Pelliot]] examines manuscripts in [[Mogao Caves|cave 17]]]]

The '''''Old Tibetan Chronicle''''' is a collection of narrative accounts and songs relating to Tibet's [[List of emperors of Tibet|Yarlung dynasty]] and the [[Tibetan Empire]]. The three manuscripts that comprise the only extant copies of the Chronicle are among the [[Dunhuang Manuscripts]] found in the early 20th century in the so-called "hidden library" at the [[Mogao Grottoes]] near [[Dunhuang]], which is believed to have been sealed in the 11th century CE. The ''Chronicle'', together with the [[Old Tibetan Annals]] comprise Tibet's earliest extant history.&lt;ref&gt;Dotson (2009), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
An enormous number of early manuscripts in a variety of languages were collected by [[Aurel Stein]] and [[Paul Pelliot]] at the famous sealed-up Library Cave (no. 17) of the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang and sent back to London and Paris respectively. The ''[[Dunhuang manuscripts]]'' in the Tibetan language include the Old Tibetan Chronicle, which was probably compiled in the early 9th century, and the [[Old Tibetan Annals]], which have been described as "the first and single most important documents available on early Tibetan history."&lt;ref&gt;"Forward" by Per Sørensen in (Dotson (2009), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Old Tibetan Chronicle'' is extant in two manuscripts in the [[Paul Pelliot|Pelliot]] Collection at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, and some manuscript fragments. The main scroll comprises Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287. The Tibetan text is written on the blank verso sides of panels pasted together from Chinese scrolls. In the first critical edition of Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287, Jacques Bacot and Charles Toussaint considered them to be represent separate texts and referred to Pelliot tibétain 1286 as "Principautés anciennes et généalogie des rois," but following the suggestion of [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]], both are now considered to be two parts a single original manuscript and can be referred to together as the Old Tibetan Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): pp.124–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, two folios from a single original manuscript, Pelliot tibétain 1144 and IOL Tib J 1375, overlap with narratives found in the Chronicle, though differing in certain details.

== Contents ==
The ''Old Tibetan Chronicle'' is a composite text of various lists, narratives and bardic songs arranged to form a single account of the reigns of the [[List of emperors of Tibet|Tibetan emperors]]. As the list of the Tibetan emperors found in the narrative ends with U Dumten ('U'i dum brtan), later known as [[Langdarma]], the ''Chronicle'' must have been compiled during or soon after the reign of this emperor, that is, in the 840s.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 124-5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] has argued that this composition was made in [[Dunhuang]] itself rather than Central Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronicle begins with a series of lists - of marriage alliances, principalities, emperors and ministers. The list of emperors is prefaced by an account of the descent of the first emperor [[Nyatri Tsenpo]] (gNya'-khri bTsan-po) from heaven, and ends with an account of the death of [[Drigum Tsenpo]], the first mortal in the line. After this the Chronicle narrates the overthrow of the prince Zingpoje - this narrative is also represented in the fragmentary Version II of the Chronicle. The narrative then continues with an account of the following Tibetan emperors before coming to the reign of [[Songtsen Gampo]] (r. c.605–649). This section actually concentrates on the activities of the minister [[Khyungpo Pungse]]. The Chronicle then continues with a narrative of the following emperors, before coming to [[Trisong Detsen]] (r. 756-c.800), in which his victory over the rival Tibetan king Lig Myi-rhya is celebrated. The Chronicle then returns to the reign of an earlier emperor [[Tridu Songtsen]] (676-704), and his victory over a claim to rule Tibetan by the Gar clan.

The Chronicle does not offer a comprehensive account of the history of Tibet. This is partly because of the nature of its composition from earlier narratives and songs. It has also been argued by [http://www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/~clio/html/ligeti/liglife.htm Lajos Ligeti] and [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] that the material in the Chronicle represents the interests of specific Tibetan clans, namely the Dba' and Myang clans (Ligeti adds the Mnon and Tshe-spong clans as well).&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 136–7&lt;/ref&gt; In this it is comparable to another early Tibetan historical text, the [[Testament of Ba]], which represents the interests of the Dba' clan. Contradicting later Tibetan Buddhist histories, neither the ''Annals'' nor the ''Chronicle'' make any mention of Buddhism in the reign of [[Songtsen Gampo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianart.com/articles/heller2/preface.html "Preface to the Asianart.com edition of this article."] By Amy Heller, Jan 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Chronicle'' does say that, during the reign of king  [[Trisong Detsen]] (Khri srong lde brtsan- ruled from 755 to 797 or 804 CE), "The incomparable religion of the Buddha had been received and there were [[vihara]]s (monasteries) in the centre as well as the borderlands of the country."&lt;ref&gt;Bacot, Thomas and Toussaint (1940-1946), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with chronology==
It has been clear since the Chronicle was first published that there are problems with its chronology. The victory over Lig Myi-rhya is narrated in the section on [[Trisong Detsen]], yet in the victory song and the following narrative the emperor named is [[Songtsen Gampo]], who ruled over a century earlier. Furthermore, the Chronicle ends in the reign of  [[Tridu Songtsen]] (676-704), which should come between [[Songtsen Gampo]] and [[Trisong Detsen]]. There are two main theories regarding this anachronism. Ariane Macdonald and Yoshiro Imaeda have argued that the problems with chronology arose because the Chronicle was composed from a variety of different sources.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald and Imaeda (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] on the other hand has argued that the scroll of Pelliot tibétain 1287 was cut up and rearranged some time after it was originally written, and the chronological problem results from this. He suggests that this later cutting and pasting may have been done specifically in order to associate the conquest of Lig Myi-rhya with the emperor [[Trisong Detsen]], pointing out that the [[Bonpo]] historical tradition also makes that association.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 135–6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osseus Labyrint''' is an experimental [[art]]s entity which has been working in multiple disciplines and forms of [[Media (arts)|media]] since 1989.

The group describes its work as "a manifestation of accumulated data from billions of years of evolving and recombining of matter and energy." Founded and directed by Hannah Sim and Mark Steger, Osseus Labyrint has inhabited extreme, remote, conventional, and self-made environments. The group's work has been presented live and broadcast throughout the USA, Canada, Mexico, England, Scotland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and over the World Wide Web.

The pair has found much fame through their work with the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]]; they have appeared in Tool's music video "Schism" and live on stage at many of Tool's concerts. Osseus Labyrint has also appeared as a pair in the film [[Men in Black II]] doing the same "interpretative dance" seen in the "Schism" music video.

'''Parametricism''' is a style within contemporary [[avant-garde architecture]], promoted as a successor to [[post-modern architecture]] and [[modern architecture]]. The term was coined in 2008 by Patrik Schumacher, an architectural partner of [[Zaha Hadid]] (1950-2016).
&lt;ref name=aj&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/patrik-schumacher-on-parametricism-let-the-style-wars-begin/5217211.fullarticle |title=Patrik Schumacher on parametricism - 'Let the style wars begin' |last1=Schumacher |first1=Patrik |date=6 May 2010 |website=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/ |publisher= |access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parametricism has its origin in parametric design, which is based on the constraints in a [[parametric equation]].&lt;ref name=coyne&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richardcoyne.com/2014/01/18/whats-wrong-with-parametricism/ |title=What’s wrong with parametricism

Aspects of parametricism have been used in [[urban design]], [[architectural design]], [[interior design]] and [[furniture design]]. Proponents of parametricism have declared that one of the defining features is that "Parametricism implies that all elements of the design become parametrically variable and mutually adaptive."&lt;ref name=agency&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parametricism.agency/ |title=PARAMETRICISM |date=9 October 2015 |website=www.parametricism.agency/ |publisher=ArchAgenda |access-date=25 December 2015 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226081700/http://www.parametricism.agency/# |archive-date=2015-12-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schumacher, parametricism is an [[autopoiesis]], or a self-referential system, in which all the elements are interlinked and an outside influence that changes one alters all the others."&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cornell.edu/arch5302sp15/2015/05/20/the-autopoiesis-of-architecture-patrik-schumachers-parametricism-and-theory/ |title="THE AUTOPOIESIS OF ARCHITECTURE" PATRIK SCHUMACHER’S PARAMETRICISM AND THEORY |first=Katerina|last=Eleini|date=20 May 2015 |website=http://blogs.cornell.edu/|publisher=Cornell |access-date=25 December 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!---text previously in this article, from a source that failed citation. "Its most conspicuous outward characteristic is a complex and dynamic curvilinearity accentuated by a swarm-like proliferation of continuously differentiated components. Beyond such obvious surface features one can identify a series of new concepts and methods that are so different from the repertoire of both traditional and modern architecture that one is justified in speaking of the emergence of a new paradigm within architecture. The shared concepts, formal repertoires, tectonic logics and computational techniques that characterize this work are indeed engendering the formation of a new [[Architectural style|style]]."&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Patrik, Parametricism - The Parametric Paradigm and the Formation of a New Style.&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;

Parametricism rejects both homogenization (serial repetition) and pure difference (agglomeration of unrelated elements) in favor of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] and [[correlation]] as key compositional values. The aim is to build up more spatial [[complexity]] while maintaining legibility, i.e. to intensify relations between spaces (or elements of a composition) and to adapt to contexts in ways that establish legible connections.  This allows architecture to translate the complexity of contemporary life processes in the global [[Post-Fordist]] [[network society]].

==History==
Parametricism emerged as a theory-driven avant-garde design movement in the early 1990s, with its earliest practitioners - [[Greg Lynn]], Jesse Reiser, [[Lars Spuybroek]], [[Kas Oosterhuis]] among many others – harnessing and adapting the then new [[digital animation]] software and other advanced computational processes that had been introduced within architecture much earlier by pioneers like [[John Frazer (architect)|John Frazer]] and [[Paul Coates (architect)|Paul Coates]], but that only spread to make an impact within [[avant-garde]] architecture in the last 10–15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Greg. "CCA - Archeology of the Digital."&lt;/ref&gt; Schumaker has said that he believes the work of [[Frei Otto]] (1925 - 2015)  is a precursor of Parametricism, as Frei "used physical processes as simulations and design engines to 'find' form rather than to draw conventional or invented forms. The inherent lawfulness of the engaged physical processes produced a combination of complexity, rigor and [[elegance]] that was otherwise unattainable. The power and beauty of this approach was striking."&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Patrik. "11. Parametricism - The Parametric Paradigm and the Formation of a New Style." p.619&lt;/ref&gt;

Early instances of proto-Parametricism, as manifest through the prolific generation of innovative designs and radical experiments within the transitional styles of [[Deconstructivism]] and [[Folding (architecture)|Folding]] - including the work of the discipline’s discourse leaders such as [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Wolf D. Prix]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], and [[Daniel Libeskind]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Phillip. "Deconstructivist Architecture - Museum of Modern Art - Fact Sheet."&lt;/ref&gt; - were later radicalized by younger practitioners who matured in the context of these early practices, and stabilized the discipline around prolonged research programmes thriving on emerging digital technologies, and culminating in the emergence of Parametricism.

Parametricism co-evolved with the global shift from the Modernist era of [[Fordism]] ([[mass production]]) to the [[Post-Fordist]] era ([[mass customization]]) of contemporary global society, and continues to evolve in an increasingly complex and fluid network of global societal communication systems. Parametricism offers advantages over styles that cannot (because they were never intended to) resonate and respond to the complexity and rapid fluidity of today’s society. Despite the persistence of styles such as [[modernism]], [[minimalism]], [[postmodernism]], [[historicism]] and [[deconstructivism]], a hard core of continuous innovation in research and building has stabilized around the new heuristics of Parametricism, and is continuing to proliferate the new style in academic and practice domains worldwide.

==[[Heuristics]]==
Parametricism offers functional and formal heuristics based on set of general abstract rules distilled from a very complex ecosystem of sustained avant-garde design research that spans over twenty five years of continuous innovative communication. Parametricism achieves elegance in both senses of the word – it is unified (compact) and beautiful (vital).

===Functional heuristics===
The functional heuristics of Parametricism include both Negative Principles and Positive Principles that have evolved since the mid-1990s across many projects worldwide, and that together constitute unifying heuristics. The Negative Principles include the avoidance of functional stereotypes (i.e. prescriptive program typologies), and the avoidance of segregative functional zoning (i.e. impermeable separation spaces according to single function allocation). The Positive Principles include the networking of parametric activity/event scenarios, and the communication of all spaces, activities and events.

===Formal heuristics===
Similar to the Functional heuristics, there are unified Formal heuristics distinguishing Parametricism from other styles of architecture. The Negative Principles include the avoidance of rigid forms that lack malleability; the avoidance of simple repetition that lacks variety; and the avoidance of collage of isolated and unrelated elements that result in a lack of order. The Positive Principles include the intelligent information-rich deformation of soft forms; differentiation of all systems through gradients, thresholds and singularities; and interdependent correlation of all systems.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Patrik. "11. Parametricism - The Parametric Paradigm and the Formation of a New Style." p.657&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto Parametricism (1952-1992)===
Throughout his career, [[Frei Otto]] conducted research focused on constructing light-weight, tensile structures through form-finding physical models that performed analog "material computation". This work is regarded as the precursor to Parametricism. His design for the [[Olympic Stadium, Munich]], built for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], is a celebrated example of highly innovative lightweight tent construction, designed in collaboration with the architect [[Günther Behnisch]].

Beyond the discursive paradigm shifts that led to the emergence of Parametricism, the ambition of the early built projects (1993-2008) was focused on adapting and innovating manufacturing and construction processes, upgrading the discipline's capacity to translate complex digital designs into constructible material assemblies.

One of the earliest built examples, [[Lars Spuybroek]]'s (NOX-Magazine) Water Pavilion (1993-1997), was the first building to utilize sensors throughout the interior, creating an interactive environment (also known as [[responsive architecture]]) where light and sound could be transformed by visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Osness, B.

Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://brettosness.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/finalhtwo0_small.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was praised by the renowned architecture critic Charles Jencks as "yet to be surpassed" in his book The New Paradigm of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;

One of the early examples of a project designed from the outset in three-dimensional computer model is Kas Oosterhuis' Saltwater Pavilion (Gold Award 1997 for innovative recreational projects, Zeeuwse Architectuurprijs 1998, nomination Mies van der Rohe Award 1998). "The delineation of the form is laid down in the digital genes of the design that hold the germ of life. The first idea is the genetic starting point for all subsequent steps in the development. We no longer accept the domination of platonic volumes, the simplistic geometry of cube, sphere, cylinder and cone as the basic elements of architecture.".&lt;ref&gt;Oosterhuis, K. (n.d.). Salt Water Pavilion and Hydra sensorium. Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://www.onl.eu/?q=projects/salt-water-pavilion&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most critically acclaimed and stylistically defining of the earliest projects is the Yokohama International Passenger Terminal (1995-2002), designed by [[Foreign Office Architects]], FOA, headed by [[Farshid Moussavi]] and [[Alejandro Zaera-Polo]]. The project was praised for its "inventive architectural methodology and socially conscious thinking". The project broke new ground, both formally and socially, enriching a prominent shared urban space.&lt;ref&gt;AD Classics: Yokohama International Passenger Terminal / Foreign Office Architects (FOA).

Another notable early example is a project designed by [[Greg Lynn]] (FORM), Douglas Garofalo (Garofalo Architects) and Michael McInturf (Michael McInturf Architects) using vector-based animation software (1999). This addition of a 1500-seat sanctuary on the roof of a renovated laundry factory was part of its conversion to the New York Presbyterian Church in Queens, New York (1999.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lynn: Korean presbyterian church, new york.

Among the most celebrated and stylistically defining of the early built projects is the [[Phaeno Science Center]] in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects starting in 2000. The building opened to the public in 2005, and has been described as a "hypnotic work of architecture - the kind of building that utterly transforms our vision of the future." It won a 2006 RIBA European Award,&lt;ref&gt;RIBA European Award winners 2006. (n.d.).

A later example is the 21-story concrete shell tower 0-14 in Dubai, UAE (2007), designed by Reiser + Umemoto. The structural shell creates a unique lace-like facade is modulated for variable light and views. The one meter space between the shell and main enclosure creates natural air movement that cools the glass facade. This is a very early example of the environmental design benefits that are achieved by applying the adaptive heuristics of Parametricism. The building's load-bearing concrete shell eliminates the need for internal columns and load-bearing walls.&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, J. (n.d.). RUR Architecture PC.

===Parametricism 1.0 (2009-2014)===
The most complex and important built projects designed in the style of Parametricism were completed after the global financial crisis of 2008.

[[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]'s Dalian International Conference Center in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning]], China, was completed in 2012. It has become "an instantly recognizable landmark" and "centerpiece of emerging Central Business District in the city of Dalian, bringing a parametric design to the edge of the Bay of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Dalian International Conference Center.

The [[Louis Vuitton Foundation]] was designed by [[Frank Gehry|Gehry Partners]] between 2006-2014. It is considered "a catalyst internationally for innovation in digital design and construction, setting a new standard for the use of advanced digital and fabrication technologies". The web-hosted, parametric, intelligently adaptable three-dimensional digital model enabled a team of over 400 people to contribute to it.&lt;ref&gt;Fondation Louis Vuitton / Gehry Partners. (2014, October 13). Retrieved May 12, 2015, from http://www.archdaily.com/555694/fondation-louis-vuitton-gehry-partners/&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest of these projects is [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]], designed by Zaha Hadid Architects with [[Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers|Samoo]], a major [[urban development]] landmark in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. The project resulted in the 2010 designation of Seoul as the [[World Design Capital]]. The most innovative state-of-the-art fabrication techniques were used in shaping the "45,000 aluminium panels of varying sizes and curvatures". The back-lit facade, "described by the designers as 'a field of pixilation and perforation patterns'...[transforms] from a solid entity by day into an animated light show by night".&lt;ref&gt;Zaha Hadid's Dongdaemun Design Park &amp; Plaza opens in Seoul.

===Parametricism 2.0 (2015- )===
In a 2014 debate between [[Michael Hansmeyer]] and Patrik Schumacher of [[Zaha Hadid Architects|ZHA]], part of "The New How" lecture series hosted by [[Alejandro Zaera-Polo]] at [[Princeton University]] School of Architecture, Schumacher introduced "Parametricism 2.0", the "upgraded" and now fully matured "Parametricism with parameters that matter".&lt;ref&gt;Patrik Shumacher and Michael Hansmeyer - F'14 SoA Lecture Series, "The New How" (112414).

==Outlook==
Parametricism is a global architectural style that has converged rather than being invented. In Patrick Schumacher's view, parametricism is architecture's answer to our computationally powered network society, representing a paradigmatic shift in architecture after the collapse of the hegemonic style of Modernism, in response to the global shift from the Modernist era of Fordism (mass production) to the Post-Fordist era (mass customization). The style continues to evolve in an increasingly complex and fluid network of global communications. Parametricism evolves with the advancing computational design and fabrication technologies. e.g. multi-agent computational systems, genetic algorithms and robotic fabrication. However, it is imperative to state that the emergence of a new style does not occur solely as the outcome of innovation in the technological arena. "The intelligence that is able to invent and think through such correlations is prior to its computational implementation. And, to a limited extent there can be "computation without computers".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patrikschumacher.com/Texts/On%20Parametricism_.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ProofRefute.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of ''Proofs and Refutations'' by [[Imre Lakatos]].]]
'''''Proofs and Refutations''''' is a 1976 book by philosopher [[Imre Lakatos]] expounding his view of the progress of [[mathematics]]. The book is written as a series of [[Socratic dialogue]]s involving a group of students who debate the proof of the [[Euler characteristic]] defined for the [[polyhedron]]. A central theme is that [[definition]]s are not carved in stone, but often have to be patched up in the light of later insights, in particular failed [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s. This gives mathematics a somewhat experimental flavour. At the end of the Introduction, Lakatos explains that his purpose is to challenge [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism in mathematics]], and to show that [[informal mathematics]] grows by a logic of "proofs and refutations".

==Synopsis==
Many important logical ideas are explained in the book. For example, the difference between a [[counterexample]] to a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] (a so-called 'local counterexample') and a counterexample to the specific conjecture under attack (a 'global counterexample' to the Euler characteristic, in this case) is discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lakatos|1976|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakatos argues for a different kind of textbook, one that uses heuristic style. To the critics that say such a textbook would be too long, he replies: 'The answer to this pedestrian argument is: let us try.'

The book includes two appendices.  In the first, Lakatos gives examples of the heuristic process in mathematical discovery.  In the second, he contrasts the deductivist and heuristic approaches and provides heuristic analysis of some 'proof generated' concepts, including [[uniform convergence]], [[bounded variation]], and the [[Outer measure|Carathéodory definition]] of a measurable set.

The pupils in the book are named after letters of the Greek alphabet.

== Method ==

Though the book is written as a narrative, an actual method of investigation, that of "proofs and refutations", is developed. In Appendix I, Lakatos summarizes this method by the following list of stages:

# Primitive conjecture.
# Proof (a rough thought-experiment or argument, decomposing the primitive conjecture into subconjectures).
# "Global" counterexamples (counterexamples to the primitive conjecture) emerge.
# Proof re-examined: the "guilty lemma" to which the global counter-example is a "local" counterexample is spotted. This guilty lemma may have previously remained "hidden" or may have been misidentified. Now it is made explicit, and built into the primitive conjecture as a condition. The theorem - the improved conjecture - supersedes the primitive conjecture with the new proof-generated concept as its paramount new feature.

He goes on and gives further stages that might sometimes take place:

&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proofs of other theorems are examined to see if the newly found lemma or the new proof-generated concept occurs in them: this concept may be found lying at cross-roads of different proofs, and thus emerge as of basic importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hitherto accepted consequences of the original and now refuted conjecture are checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counterexamples are turned into new examples - new fields of inquiry open up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Publication history==
The 1976 book has been translated into more than 15 languages worldwide, including Chinese, Korean, Serbo-Croat and Turkish, and went into its second Chinese edition in 2007.

==Impact on teaching==
A number of mathematics teachers have implemented Lakatos' method of proofs and refutations in the classroom, when teaching other mathematical topics.&lt;ref&gt;Fatih Karakus &amp; Mesut Bütün; ''Examining the Method of Proofs and Refutations in Pre-Service Teachers Education'', Bolema vol. 27 no.45 Rio Claro Apr. 2013.[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-636X2013000100011&amp;script=sci_arttext]&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been applied to the analysis and presentation  of problem  solving in mechanics

'''Reader-response criticism''' is a school of [[literary theory]] that focuses on [[Reading (process)|the reader]] (or "[[audience]]") and their experience of a [[literary work]], in contrast to other schools and theories that focus attention primarily on the author or the content and [[mode (literature)|form]] of the work.

Although literary theory has long paid some attention to the reader's role in creating the meaning and experience of a literary work, modern reader-response criticism began in the 1960s and '70s, particularly in the US and Germany, in work by [[Norman Holland]], [[Stanley Fish]], [[Wolfgang Iser]], [[Hans-Robert Jauss]], [[Roland Barthes]], and others.  Important predecessors were [[I. A. Richards]], who in 1929 analyzed a group of [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] undergraduates' misreadings; [[Louise Rosenblatt]], who, in ''Literature as Exploration'' (1938), argued that it is important for the teacher to avoid imposing any "preconceived notions about the proper way to react to any work"; and [[C. S. Lewis]] in ''[[An Experiment in Criticism]]'' (1961).

Reader-response theory recognizes the reader as an active agent who imparts "real existence" to the work and completes its meaning through interpretation.  Reader-response criticism argues that literature should be viewed as a performing art in which each reader creates their own, possibly unique, text-related performance.   It stands in total opposition to the theories of [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]] and the [[New Criticism]], in which the reader's role in re-creating literary works is ignored.  New Criticism had emphasized that only that which is within a text is part of the meaning of a text.  No appeal to the authority or [[authorial intentionality|intention of the author]], nor to the [[psychology]] of the reader, was allowed in the discussions of orthodox New Critics.

==Types==
There are multiple approaches within the theoretical branch of reader-response criticism, yet all are unified in their belief that the meaning of a text is derived from the reader through the reading process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cahill M | year = 1996 | title = 'Reader-response criticism and the allegorizing reader' | url = | journal = Theological Studies | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 89–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lois Tyson endeavors to define the variations into five recognized reader-response criticism approaches whilst warning that categorizing reader-response theorists explicitly invites difficultly due to their overlapping beliefs and practices.&lt;ref name=Tyson&gt;Tyson, L (2006) ''Critical theory today: a user-friendly guide'', 2nd edn, Routledge, New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Transactional reader-response theory''', led by Louise Rosenblatt and supported by Wolfgang Iser, involves a transaction between the text's inferred meaning and the individual interpretation by the reader influenced by their personal emotions and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt; '''Affective stylistics''', established by Fish, believe that a text can only come into existence as it is read; therefore, a text cannot have meaning independent of the reader.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt; '''Subjective reader-response theory''', associated with David Bleich, looks entirely to the reader's response for literary meaning as individual written responses to a text are then compared to other individual interpretations to find continuity of meaning.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt; '''Psychological reader-response theory''', employed by Norman Holland, believes that a reader’s motives heavily affect how they read, and subsequently use this reading to analyze the psychological response of the reader.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt; '''Social reader-response theory''' is Stanley Fish's extension of his earlier work, stating that any individual interpretation of a text is created in an interpretive community of minds consisting of participants who share a specific reading and interpretation strategy.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt; In all interpretive communities, readers are predisposed to a particular form of interpretation as a consequence of strategies used at the time of reading.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt;

An alternative way of organizing reader-response theorists is to separate them into three groups: those who focus upon the individual reader's experience ("individualists"); those who conduct [[psychological]] experiments on a defined set of readers ("experimenters"); and those who assume a fairly uniform response by all readers ("uniformists").  One can therefore draw a distinction between reader-response theorists who see the individual reader driving the whole experience and others who think of literary experience as largely text-driven and uniform (with individual variations that can be ignored).  The former theorists, who think the reader controls, derive what is common in a literary experience from shared techniques for reading and interpreting which are, however, individually applied by different readers.  The latter, who put the text in control, derive commonalities of response, obviously, from the literary work itself. The most fundamental difference among reader-response critics is probably, then, between those who regard individual differences among readers' responses as important and those who try to get around them.

===Individualists===
In the 1960s, David Bleich’s pedagogically inspired literary theory entailed that the text is the reader’s interpretation of it as it exists in their mind, and that an objective reading is not possible due to the symbolization and resymbolization process.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt; The symbolization and resymbolization process consists of how an individual’s personal emotions, needs and life experiences affect how a reader engages with a text; marginally altering the meaning.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt; Bleich supported his theory by conducting a study with his students in which they recorded their individual meaning of a text as they experienced it, then response to their own initial written response, before comparing it with other student’s responses to collectively establish literary significance according to the classes "generated" knowledge of how particular persons recreate texts.&lt;ref name=Tyson /&gt; He used this knowledge to theorize about the reading process and to refocus the classroom teaching of literature.

[[Michael Steig]] and [[Walter Slatoff]] have, like Bleich, shown that students' highly personal responses can provide the basis for critical analyses in the classroom. [[Jeffery Berman teacher|Jeffrey Berman]] has encouraged students responding to texts to write anonymously and share with their classmates writings in response to literary works about sensitive subjects like drugs, suicidal thoughts, death in the family, parental abuse and the like.  A kind of [[catharsis]] bordering on therapy results.  In general, American reader-response critics have focused on individual readers' responses.  American [[magazine]]s like [http://www.reading.org/publications/journals/rrq/index.html ''Reading Research Quarterly''] and others publish articles applying reader-response theory to the teaching of literature.

In 1961, C. S. Lewis published ''[[An Experiment in Criticism]]'', in which he analyzed readers' role in selecting literature.  He analyzed their selections in light of their goals in reading.

In 1967, [[Stanley Fish]] published ''Surprised by Sin'', the first study of a large literary work (''[[Paradise Lost]]'') that focused on its readers' experience. In an appendix, "Literature in the Reader", Fish used "the" reader to examine responses to complex sentences sequentially, word-by-word. Since 1976, however, he has turned to real differences among real readers.  He explores the reading tactics endorsed by different critical schools, by the literary professoriate, and by the [[legal profession]], introducing the idea of "[[interpretive communities]]" that share particular modes of reading.

In 1968, [[Norman Holland]] drew on [[psychoanalytic]] psychology in [http://fulltext10.fcla.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?&amp;c=psa&amp;idno=UF00003033&amp;format=text ''The Dynamics of Literary Response''] to model the literary work.   Each reader introjects a fantasy "in" the text, then modifies it by [[defense mechanism]]s into an interpretation.  In 1973, however, having recorded responses from real readers, Holland found variations too great to fit this model in which responses are mostly alike but show minor individual variations.

Holland then developed a second model based on his case studies [http://palmm.fcla.edu/psa/psaTitleList.html ''5 Readers Reading''].  An individual has (in the brain) a core identity theme (behaviors then becoming understandable as a theme and variations as in music).  This core gives that individual a certain style of being—and reading.  Each reader uses the physical literary work plus invariable codes (such as the shapes of letters) plus variable [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]s (different "interpretive communities", for example) plus an individual style of reading to build a response both like and unlike other readers' responses.  Holland worked with others at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]], Murray Schwartz, [[David Willbern]], and [[Robert Rogers (educator)|Robert Rogers]], to develop a particular teaching format, the "Delphi seminar," designed to get students to "know themselves".

===Experimenters===
[[Reuven Tsur]] in [[Israel]] has developed in great detail models for the expressivity of [[poetic meter|poetic rhythms]], of [[metaphor]], and of word-sound in [[poetry]] (including different actors' readings of a single line of [[Shakespeare]]).  [[Richard Gerrig]] in the U.S. has experimented with the reader's state of mind during and after a literary experience.  He has shown how readers put aside ordinary knowledge and values while they read, treating, for example, criminals as heroes.  He has also investigated how readers accept, while reading, improbable or fantastic things ([[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]"), but discard them after they have finished.

In Canada, [[David Miall]], usually working with [[Donald Kuiken]], has produced a large body of work exploring [[emotion]]al or "affective" responses to literature, drawing on such concepts from ordinary criticism as "[[defamiliarization]]" or "[[foregrounding]]". They have used both experiments and new developments in [[neuropsychology]], and have developed a [[questionnaire]] for measuring different aspects of a reader's response.

There are many other experimental psychologists around the world exploring readers' responses, conducting many detailed experiments. One can research their work through their professional organizations, the [http://www.psych.ualberta.ca/IGEL/ International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature and Media], and [http://www.science-of-aesthetics.org International Association of Empirical Aesthetics], and through such psychological indices as PSYCINFO.

Two notable researchers are Dolf Zillmann and [[Peter Vorderer]], both working in the field of [[communication studies|communications]] and [[media psychology]]. Both have theorized and tested ideas about what produces emotions such as [[suspense]], [[curiosity]], [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] in readers, the necessary factors involved, and the role the reader plays. Jenefer Robinson, a researcher in emotion, has recently blended her studies on emotion with its role in literature, music, and art.

===Uniformists===

[[Wolfgang Iser]] exemplifies the German tendency to theorize the reader and so posit a uniform response. For him, a literary work is not an object in itself but an effect to be explained.  But he asserts this response is controlled by the text.  For the "real" reader, he substitutes an implied reader, who is the reader a given literary work requires.  Within various polarities created by the text, this "implied" reader makes expectations, meanings, and the unstated details of characters and settings through a "wandering viewpoint".   In his model, the text controls. The reader's activities are confined within limits set by the literary work.

Another important German reader-response critic was [[Hans-Robert Jauss]], who defined literature as a [[dialectic]] process of production and [[Reception theory|reception]] (''Rezeption''—the term common in Germany for "response").  For Jauss, readers have a certain mental set, a "horizon" of expectations (''Erwartungshorizont''), from which perspective each reader, at any given time in history, reads. Reader-response criticism establishes these [[horizons of expectation]] by reading literary works of the period in question.

Both Iser and Jauss, and the ''Constance School'' they exemplify, return reader-response criticism to a study of the text by defining readers in terms of the text. In the same way, [[Gerald Prince]] posits a "narratee", [[Michael Riffaterre]] posits a "superreader", and [[Stanley Fish]] an "informed reader."  And many text-oriented critics simply speak of "the" reader who typifies all readers....

==Objections==
Reader-response critics hold that in order to understand a text, one must look to the processes readers use to create meaning and experience. Traditional text-oriented schools, such as [[formalism (literature)|formalism]], often think of reader-response criticism as an [[anarchic]] [[subjectivism]], allowing readers to interpret a text any way they want. Text-oriented critics claim that one can understand a text while remaining immune to one's own culture, status, [[Personality psychology|personality]], and so on, and hence "objectively."

To reader-response based theorists, however, reading is always both [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]. Some reader-response critics (uniformists) assume a bi-active model of reading: the literary work controls part of the response and the reader controls part.  Others, who see that position as internally contradictory, claim that the reader controls the whole transaction (individualists). In such a reader-active model, readers and audiences use amateur or professional procedures for reading (shared by many others) as well as their personal issues and values.

Another objection to reader-response criticism is that it fails to account for the text being able to expand the reader's understanding. While readers can and do put their own ideas and experiences into a work, they are at the same time gaining new understanding through the text. This is something that is generally overlooked in reader-response criticism.

==Extensions==

Reader-response criticism relates to psychology, both [[experimental psychology]] for those attempting to find principles of response, and [[psychoanalytic psychology]] for those studying individual responses.  Post-[[behaviorist]] psychologists of reading and of [[perception]] support the idea that it is the reader who makes meaning. Increasingly, [[cognitive psychology]], [[psycholinguistics]], neuroscience, and [[neuropsychoanalysis]] have given reader-response critics powerful and detailed models for the aesthetic process. In 2011 researchers found that during listening to emotionally intense parts of a story, readers respond with changes in [[heart rate variability]], indicative of increased activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Intense parts of a story were also accompanied by increased brain activity in a network of regions known to be involved in the processing of fear, including [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wallentin M,, Nielsen AH, Vuust P, Dohn A, Roepstorff A, Lund TE |title=Amygdala and heart rate variability responses from listening to emotionally intense parts of a story |journal=NeuroImage|volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=963–73 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.077 |pmid=21749924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it rests on psychological principles, a reader-response approach readily generalizes to other arts: [[film|cinema]] ([[David Bordwell]]), music, or visual art ([[E. H. Gombrich]]), and even to history ([[Hayden White]]). In stressing the activity of the reader, reader-response theory may be employed to justify upsettings of traditional interpretations like [[deconstruction]] or [[cultural criticism]].

Since reader-response critics focus on the strategies readers are taught to use, they may address the [[teaching]] of reading and literature. Also, because reader-response criticism stresses the activity of the reader, reader-response critics may share the concerns of [[feminist theory|feminist]] critics, and critics of Gender and Queer Theory and Post-Colonialism.

'''''Rosa Bonheur''''' is an 1898 painting by [[Anna Elizabeth Klumpke]]. The portrait of the French artist [[Rosa Bonheur]] has been in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] since 1922.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosa Bonheur|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11348|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
Bonheur was an artist whom Klumpke "had long admired."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/22.222/|title=Rosa Bonheur {{!}} Anna Klumpke {{!}} 22.222 {{!}} Work of Art {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two artists had been corresponding for some time prior to 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rosa-Bonheur|title=Rosa Bonheur {{!}} French painter|last=Kuiper|first=Kathleen|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klumpke was persuaded by a conversation with members of the Douglas Miller family to ask to paint Bonheur.{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|pp=27-28}} On September 14, 1897, Klumpke wrote to Bonheur, asking if she might paint her portrait.
{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|p=28}} On March 31, 1898, Bonheur responded, "I am at your disposal, dear mademoiselle, for the portrait."{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|p=30}}

Kumpke started work on the oil on canvas portrait in June 1898. Klumpke wrote that she "was delighted that Rosa Bonheur had offered of her own accord to pose in women's clothes."{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|p=31}} Bonheur would not pose for Klumpke every day, saying that she "can't stand long sittings."{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|p=33}} During the times she posed for Klumpke, the two artists talked about art and literature, told stories, and discussed religion and morality.{{Sfn|Klumpke|2001|pp=37-38}} Klumpke's work on the painting was also dictated by Bonheur, who wanted the younger artist to follow her suggestions about sketching and artwork.{{Sfn|Tamboukou|2010|pp=69-70}} &lt;!--The art historian?--&gt; Maria Tamboukou writes that the interplay of conversation and sittings for the creation of the painting show Bonheur to be "a woman in love" with Klumpke.{{Sfn|Tamboukou|2010|p=70}}

==Description and interpretation==
The work depicts French painter [[Rosa Bonheur]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrinne|first=Tee A.|date=January 1998|title=Reviews: Lesbian Biography|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=20015&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Lambda Book Report|volume=6|issue=6|pages=27|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klumpke was also a biographer for Bonheur's life and work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bonheur is depicted sitting at her easel and wearing her medal of the [[Legion of Honour|Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bonheur is wearing a long [[frog (fastening)|frogged]] coat and a stiff white collar.{{Sfn|Hird|1904|p=78}} In her hand is a drawing and on the easel is the beginning of a painting of three horses.{{Sfn|Dwyer|2004|pp=73-74}} The expression of Bonheur's face "hovers between the pensive and the provocative," according to &lt;!--the art historian?--&gt; Britta C. Dwyer.{{Sfn|Dwyer|2004|p=74}}

Klumpke remained with Bonheur in France as her companion.  On Bonheur's death in 1899, the year after the portrait was competed, Klumpke inherited Bonheur's home and studio at the [[Château de By]] near [[Fontainebleau]]. The painting was owned by Klumpke and her sister and agent, [[Dorothea Klumpke|Dorothea Roberts]], until 1922.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In that year, Klumpke gifted the work to the Met.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Plot==
Balakrishna ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is an economically disadvantaged but multi-talented dancer, adept at the Indian classical dances of [[Kuchipudi]], [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathak]], etc. Fondly called Balu, his simple and very honest soul does not permit him to attain professional success in the commercial world that requires a certain level of moral laxness. Madhavi ([[Jaya Prada]]), a wealthy young woman and a dance patron, notices his talent and acts as his benefactress, helping him secure an opportunity to participate in a high-level classical dance festival.

Balu's aging mother passes away from the afflictions of poverty two days before the performance. Balu, who was very attached to her, is emotionally devastated and fails to participate in the dance festival. Madhavi nevertheless, gives him support and encouragement and sets him on the mend. Balu gradually develops a fondness for Madhavi as their relationship grows. He hides his love for her, but eventually picks up the courage to express it. Balu discovers that, while Madhavi shares his feelings, she is a married woman separated from her husband. The husband later returns to unite Madhavi and Balu, but Balu decides to sacrifice his love showing respect for the institution of marriage.

The years pass, and Balu, a disappointed man, has become an inconsolable alcoholic and a newspaper journalist/art critic. Meanwhile, Madhavi's husband dies, and she hears about Balu's condition. In a bid to revive his will to live and his passion for his art, she tends to his medical needs through his friend Raghu ([[Sarath Babu]]) and solicits Balu to be the dance master for her daughter, Sailaja ([[SP Sailaja]]).

The film ends with Sailaja's stage performance with Balu watching her in a wheelchair, his health having completely deteriorated dies. Raghu is seen taking him away quietly, without interrupting the performance. Madhavi follows him with an umbrella covering Balu from the rain.

==Production==
Kamal and [[R. C. Sakthi]] wanted to make a film on a subject, about a dancer who was an alcoholic, which they named "Anupallavi", when K. Viswanath approached him with a similar subject, Kamal felt he had to do the film. On the sets of the film, Gopi Krishna, one of the choreographers, insisted that Kamal should train for at least a month. Kamal was one of the top stars of the time, doing multiple shifts, and had to find the time. Kamal said it was the "greatest sacrifice from my side".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/enriching-cinema-kamal-style/article6506926.ece|title=Enriching cinema, Kamal style|author=BARADWAJ RANGAN|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playback singer S. P.

'''Sant'Andrea a San Donnino''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] parish church in the San Donnino neighborhood of the town limits of [[Campi Bisenzio]], located on the Via Pistoiese just west of [[Florence]], in the region of [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]].  Adjacent to the church is a small art Museum.
 
==History==
[[File:Giovanni di francesco del cervelliera, crocifisso del 1455 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|Crucifix at main altar by Giovanni di Francesco del Cervelliera]]
A church at the site was erected in the 11th century along the route linking Florence to [[Pistoia]]. The church was dedicated to St Andrew the apostle. The first documentation we have of the building are from 1276, and until the 18th-century, the church was subsidiary to the parish of [[San Martino a Brozzi]]. 

A major reconstruction occured in 1365; however, the church underwent a number of refurbishments over the centuries under the patronage of the Mazzinghi and Tornaquinci families. The church was once surrounded by an orchard. In the 19th century the facade loggia was re-erected. But by 1919, the church was used as a warehouse for agricultural products. In 1934, the church restoration began under the engineer Alfredo Barbacchi. During World War II, the bell-tower was razed, damaging the rear of the church. The church suffered during the [[1966 flood of the Arno]]; this led to the removal of many of the works of art, including frescoes to the adjacent museum. To add to the injury, the bell-tower and walls were affected by an accidental fire in 5 April 1979. 

The interior of the church is more sparse now with some of the works moved to the ''Museo di Arte Sacra di San Donnino a Campi Bisenzio'', located in the adjacent cloister. 

==Artworks in Church and Museum==
The holy water font (15th) century is sculpted in marble. The baptismal font is modern. A wall altar with a stone arch has 15th-century frescoes of the ''Baptism'' by [[Davide Ghirlandaio]] and a ''Madonna and Saints'' by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]. The main tabernacle dates from the 15th-century. The main altar was a painted 15th-century crucifix by [[Giovanni di Francesco]]. A door on the right opens to the sacristy. on the right wall is a 15th-century triptych, depicting an ''Annuciation with Saints Eustache and Anthony Abbott'' by the school of Dal Ponte. The museum displays the 15th-century stone pulpit. An altarpiece depiction ''God the Father with Angels'' (1480) and an ''Enthroned Madonna and Child'' by [[Giovanni Botticini]]. A fresco depicts ''Saints Sigismond and Albert'' (1520) attributed to the school of [[Raffaellino del Garbo]]. The museum also has a ''Madonna of the Rosary with Saints'' attributed to [[Matteo Rosselli]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comune.campi-bisenzio.fi.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/3339 Comune of Campi Bisenzio], entry on church.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] worked on numerous film projects that were never completed.

==''The Burning Secret'' and ''Natural Child''==
In 1956, after the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (M.G.M.) studio turned down a request from Kubrick and his producer partner [[James B. Harris]] to film ''Paths of Glory'', MGM then invited Kubrick to review the studio's other properties. Harris and Kubrick discovered [[Stefan Zweig]]'s novel ''The Burning Secret'', in which a young baron attempts to seduce a young Jewish woman by first befriending her twelve-year-old son, who eventually realizes the actual motives of the baron. Kubrick was enthusiastic about the novel and hired novelist [[Calder Willingham]] to write a screenplay; however, [[Production Code]] restrictions hindered the realization of the project.&lt;ref name="Cocks2004_151"&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks 2004, p. 151.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The script, once thought to be lost, was found in 2018 and is nearly completed to be developed by film-makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/15/stanley-kubrick-lost-screenplay-burning-secret-found|title=Lost Stanley Kubrick screenplay, Burning Secret, is found 60 years on|work=theguardian|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|accessdate=July 15, 2018|date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick had previously expressed interest in adapting a Willingham novel ''Natural Child'', but was also prevented by the Production Code on that occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks 2004, p. 149.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Napoleon''==
{{commons category|Napoleon (Stanley Kubrick's unrealized film)}}
After the success of ''2001'', Kubrick planned a large-scale [[biographical film]] about [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name="Mason2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=The greatest movie Stanley Kubrick never made|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/10/04/napoleon/|work=Salon|publisher=Salon Media Group, Inc|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Darryl Mason|date=5 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He "tried to see every film that was ever made on the subject," including [[Abel Gance]]'s ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'' and the Soviet film series ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'', neither of which he liked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Film Director as Superstar | author-first= Joseph | author-last= Gelmis | year= 1970 |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=Garden City, New York|page= 298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also conducted research, read books about the French emperor, and wrote a preliminary screenplay which has since become available on the internet. With the help of assistants, he meticulously created a card catalog of the places and deeds of Napoleon's inner circle during its operative years. Kubrick scouted locations, planning to film large portions of the film on location in France, in addition to the use of United Kingdom studios. The director was also going to film the battle scenes in Romania and had enlisted the support of the [[Romanian army]]; senior army officers had committed 40,000 soldiers and 10,000 cavalrymen to Kubrick's film for the paper costume battle scenes.

In a conversation with the [[British Film Institute]], Kubrick's brother-in-law [[Jan Harlan]] stated the film was set to enter production with [[David Hemmings]] as the title figure Napoleon (later, that role went to [[Jack Nicholson]]) and [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Kubrick's preference for the character [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]]. In notes that Kubrick wrote to his financial backers, preserved in the book ''The Kubrick Archives'', Kubrick expresses uncertainty in regard to the progress of the Napoleon film and the final product; however, he also states that he expected to create "the best movie ever made."&lt;ref name="Castle2009"&gt;[[#Castle2009|Castle 2009.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Napoleon'' was eventually canceled due to the prohibitive cost of location filming, the [[Western world|Western]] release of [[Sergei Bondarchuk]]'s epic film version of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'' (1968), and the commercial failure of Bondarchuk's Napoleon-themed film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' (1970). A significant portion of Kubrick's historical research would influence ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975), the storyline of which ends in 1789, approximately fifteen years prior to the commencement of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

In March 2013 [[Steven Spielberg]] announced his intention to create, in conjunction with Kubrick's family, a television miniseries based on Kubrick's screenplay.&lt;ref name="BBCSpielberg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21652878 |title=Spielberg to develop Kubrick's Napoleon for TV |accessdate=2013-03-03|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, [[HBO]] announced that they will produce a miniseries based on Kubrick's screenplay with [[Cary Fukunaga]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Nick|title=Is Stanley Kubrick’s Legendary ‘Napoleon’ Headed to HBO with Cary Fukunaga Directing?|url=http://collider.com/stanley-kubrick-napoleon-hbo-cary-fukunaga/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, French opera singer and actor [[David Serero (opera singer)|David Serero]] adapted the screenplay for the stage, in New York, in which he stars as Napoleon.&lt;ref name=BWW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/NAPOLEON-By-Stanley-Kubrick-To-Be-Presented-For-The-First-Time-On-Stage-20180802|title=NAPOLEON By Stanley Kubrick To Be Presented For The First Time On Stage|first=BWW News|last=Desk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc-2.com/story/38823780/david-serero-to-star-as-napoleons-title-role-in-napoleon-by-stanley-kubrick-the-greatest-movie-never-made-in-a-world-premiere-staged-adaptation|title=David Serero to star as Napoleon's title role in|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiere.fr/Cinema/News-Cinema/Le-Napoleon-de-Stanley-Kubrick-arrive-enfin--au-theatre|title=Le Napoléon de Stanley Kubrick arrive enfin … au théâtre|date=13 August 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was scheduled to open August 23.&lt;ref name=BWW/&gt;

==''Aryan Papers''==
In 1976, Kubrick sought out a film idea that concerned the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and tried to persuade [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] to contribute an original screenplay. Kubrick requested a "dramatic structure that compressed the complex and vast information into the story of an individual who represented the essence of this man-made hell." However, Singer declined, explaining to Kubrick, "I don't know the first thing about the Holocaust."&lt;ref name="CocksEtAl2006_196"&gt;[[#CocksEtAl2006|Cocks et al 2006, p. 196.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cocks2004"&gt;[[#Cocks2004|Cocks 2004.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Kubrick nearly entered the production stage of a film adaptation of [[Louis Begley]]'s ''[[Wartime Lies]]'', the story of a boy and his aunt as they are in-hiding from the Nazi regime during the Holocaust—the first-draft screenplay, entitled ''Aryan Papers'', was penned by Kubrick himself. ''Full Metal Jacket'' co-screenwriter [[Michael Herr]] reports that Kubrick had considered casting [[Julia Roberts]] or [[Uma Thurman]] as the aunt; eventually, [[Johanna ter Steege]] was cast as the aunt and [[Joseph Mazzello]] as the young boy. Kubrick traveled to the Czech city of [[Brno]], as it was envisaged as a possible filming location for the scenes of [[Warsaw]] during wartime, and cinematographer Elemér Ragályi was selected by Kubrick to be the director of photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scarlett Johansson feltűnően butuska kislány volt|url=http://www.origo.hu/filmklub/blog/interju/exkluziv/20120424-interju-ragalyi-elemer-operatorrel-az-ajto-szabo-istvan-scarlett-johansson.html|work=[origo] filmklub|publisher=Minden jog fenntartva|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Gyárfás Dóra|language=Hungarian|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick's work on ''Aryan Papers'' eventually ceased in 1995, as the director was influenced by the 1993 release of Spielberg's Holocaust-themed film ''[[Schindler's List]]''. According to Kubrick's wife Christiane an additional factor in Kubrick's decision was the increasingly depressing nature of the subject as experienced by the director. Kubrick eventually concluded that an accurate Holocaust film was beyond the capacity of cinema and returned his attention to the ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' film project.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/19/wolf-door-kubrick.html |last1=Cocks |first1=Geoffrey |title=(Review of) The wolf at the door: Stanley Kubrick, history &amp; the Holocaust (review) |date=2 March 2006 |work=Screening the past |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117232805/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/19/wolf-door-kubrick.html |accessdate=20 November 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archivedate=January 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Shadow on the Sun''==
In the early [[1960s in film|1960s]], Kubrick, a keen listener of [[BBC Radio]], heard the [[Radio drama|radio serial drama]] ''Shadow on the Sun''; written by Gavin Blakeney, ''Shadow on the Sun'' is a work of science fiction in which a virus is introduced to earth through a meteorite landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dear weekend Over to you|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/apr/03/weekend7.weekend1|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 April 2004|author=Madeline Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianRonson2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Citizen Kubrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/27/features.weekend|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 March 2004|author=Jon Ronson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when Kubrick was looking for a new project, the director became reacquainted with ''Shadow on the Sun''. Kubrick purchased screen rights from Blakeney in [[1988 in film|1988]] for [[£]]1,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dear weekend Over to you|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/apr/03/weekend7.weekend1|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 April 2004|author=Madeline Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereon, Kubrick read and annotated a script before moving onto ''A.I. Artificial Intelligence''.&lt;ref name=GuardianRonson2004 /&gt; The tone of the unrealized project, as described by [[Anthony Frewin]] in ''The Kubrick Archives'', is a cross between ''[[War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[Mars Attacks!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castle, Alison, ed.2008|Castle, Alison, ed., pp. 517]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Lunatic at Large''==
On November 1, 2006, Kubrick's [[son-in-law]] Philip Hobbs announced that he would be shepherding a film treatment of ''Lunatic at Large''. Kubrick had commissioned the project for treatment from noir [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] novelist [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] in the 1950s, but it had been lost until Hobbs uncovered a manuscript following Kubrick's death.&lt;ref name="IMDBLunatic"&gt;{{cite web|title=New "Kubrick Film" To Be Made|url=http://imdb.com/news/sb/2006-10-31/#4|work=IMDb|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2011, this project is in development for future release, with the involvement of actors [[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Sam Rockwell]], and U.K. screenwriter Stephen R. Clarke.&lt;ref name="Kevin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financing Nears On 'Lunatic At Large'; 2 More Unmade Kubrick Projects Continue Toward Production|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/financing_nears_on_lunatic_at_large_2_more_unmade_kubrick_projects_continue|work=indiewire|publisher=A SnagFilms Co|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Kevin Jagernauth|date=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unreleased screenplays==
A number of screenplays that were written by Kubrick, who was either hired on a commission basis or was writing for his own projects, remain unreleased. One such screenplay is ''The German Lieutenant'' (co-written with Richard Adams), in which a group of German soldiers embark upon a mission during the final days of [[World War II]];&lt;ref name="Chiaventone"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Untitled Deadpool Column|url=http://www.tnmc.org/dp/0122031.shtml|work=TNMC|publisher=TNMC|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Frederick J. Chiaventone |author2=Jean-François Allaire}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time period when ''The German Lieutenant'' was planned as Kubrick's next production, the director explained his interest in making another war film:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... one of the attractions of a war or crime story is that it provides an almost unique opportunity to contrast an individual of our contemporary society with a solid framework of accepted value, which the audience becomes fully aware of, and which can be used as a counterpoint to a human, individual, emotional situation. Further, war acts as a kind of hothouse for forced, quick breeding of attitudes and feelings. Attitudes crystallize and come out into the open.&lt;ref name="Kubrick2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Kubrick|title=Stanley Kubrick: Interviews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOU9bIlnPHIC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2001|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-57806-297-3|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other examples of unreleased Kubrick screenplays are ''I Stole 16 Million Dollars,'' a fictionalized account of early 20th century Baptist minister turned safecracker Herbert Emmerson Wilson (the film was to be produced by [[Kirk Douglas]]' company "Bryna", despite Douglas' belief that the script was poorly written, and [[Cary Grant]] was approached for the lead role);&lt;ref name="IndieWire-Mar2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/the-lost-unmade-projects-of-stanley-kubrick-20130304?page=5 |title=The Lost &amp; Unmade Projects Of Stanley Kubrick |last1=Jagernauth |first1=Kevin |date=March 4, 2013 |work=The Playlist |publisher=IndieWire |accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a first draft of a script about the [[John S. Mosby|Mosby Rangers]], a Confederate guerrilla force that was active during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Ciment1982Clockwork "&gt;[[#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick was also interested in adapting to the screen ''[[Flowers in the Attic]]'' by [[V.C. Andrews]], but it was cancelled due for the explicit incestuous relationship between the two main characters.{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence to be found online, in print or on DVD supplemental features|date=September 2015}}

==Other projects==
[[Marlon Brando]] contacted Kubrick, asking him to direct a film adaptation of the Charles Neider western novel, ''The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones'', featuring [[Pat Garrett]] and [[Billy the Kid]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2003|p=50}}{{efn|This is disputed by Carlo Fiore, who has claimed that Brando had not heard of Kubrick initially and that it was he who arranged a dinner meeting between Brando and Kubrick.{{Sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=109–110}}}} Brando was impressed, saying that "Stanley is unusually perceptive, and delicately attuned to people. He has an adroit intellect, and is a creative thinker—not a repeater, not a fact-gatherer. He digests what he learns and brings to a new project an original point of view and a reserved passion".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=53}} The two worked on a script for six months, begun by a then unknown [[Sam Peckinpah]]. Many disputes broke out over the project, and in the end, Kubrick distanced himself from what would become ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-h1QgAACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-638445-8|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick was furious with Brando's casting of [[France Nuyen]], and when Kubrick had confessed to still "not knowing what the picture was about", Brando snapped "I'll tell you what it's about. It's about $300,000 that I've already paid [[Karl Malden]]".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=119}}}} Kubrick was then reported to have been fired and accepted a parting fee of $100,000,{{sfnm|1a1=Baxter|1y=1997|1p=120|2a1=Duncan|2y=2003|2p=53}} though a 1960 ''Entertainment Weekly'' article claims he quit as director, and that Kubrick had been quoted as saying "Brando wanted to direct the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ginna|first=Robert Emmett|title=The Odyssey Begins|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick's biographer LoBrutto states that for contractual reasons, Kubrick was not able to cite the real reason, but issued a statement saying that he had resigned "with deep regret because of my respect and admiration for one of the world's foremost artists".{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=164}}

Kubrick was offered to direct both ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) and ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' (1977), but declined, despite once saying in 1966 to a friend that he had long desired to "make the world's scariest movie, involving a series of episodes that would play upon the nightmare fears of the audience".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=302}}

Kubrick was fascinated by the career of Nazi filmmaker [[Veit Harlan]], his wife's uncle, and contemplated creating a film of the social circle that surrounded [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Although Kubrick worked on this project for several years, the director was unable to progress beyond a rough story outline.&lt;ref name="Dupont2001"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kubrick Speaks, Through Family's Documentary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/15/style/15iht-kubrick_ed2_.html|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 September 2001|author=Joan Dupont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umberto Eco]], in response to an offer from Kubrick regarding a film adaptation of Eco's 1988 novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'', declined due to his dissatisfaction with the film adaptation of his earlier novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''. Additionally, Eco sought the role of screenwriter but Kubrick was unwilling to cooperate. Following Kubrick's death, Eco stated that he regretted his initial decision.&lt;ref name="NaperstakEco2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Armani of literature|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/bliteratureb-umberto-eco-the-armani-of-literature/2007/12/13/1197135651584.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=15 December 2007|author=Ben Naparstek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the commencement of work for ''2001'', [[Terry Southern]] suggested the production of a high-budget pornographic film called ''Blue Movie'' to Kubrick; Southern proposed the film as an attempt to reinvent the genre. Kubrick decided against Southern's suggestion in the belief that he did not have the appropriate temperament for pornographic cinema; also, Kubrick did not think that he could sufficiently reinvent the genre to truly elevate it. At the same time, Southern had begun writing a novel, also entitled ''[[Blue Movie (novel)|Blue Movie]]'' (published in 1970), in which a highly regarded [[art film]] director named "Boris Adrian" attempts to create such a film—the book is dedicated to Kubrick.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baxter1997|Baxter 1997, pp. 194-195.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s sale of the film rights for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to [[United Artists]] in 1969, the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The Beatles]] considered a corresponding film project and approached Kubrick as a potential director; however, Kubrick turned down the offer, explaining to [[John Lennon]] that he thought the novel could not be adapted into a film due to its immensity.&lt;ref name="TolkienEncyl2006_15"&gt;[[#TolkienEncyl2006|Drout 2006, p. 15.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also interview in "Show" magazine vol. 1, Number 1 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual director of the film adaptation [[Peter Jackson]] further explained that a major hindrance to the project's progression was Tolkien's opposition to the involvement of the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-03-28/entertainment/rings.beatles_1_powerful-ring-gollum-beatles-plan?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Beatles plan for Rings film | work=CNN | date=2004-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick also considered adapting [[Patrick Süskind]]'s novel ''[[Perfume (novel)|Perfume]]'', which he had enjoyed; however, the idea was never acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baxter1997|Baxter 1997, pp. 332, 360.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was later adapted for the screen by [[Tom Tykwer]], as ''[[Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (film)|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perfume: The Story of a Murderer|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qh059|work=BBC Two|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubrick, searching for a project after ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'', considered adapting Robert Marshall's novel ''All the King's Men'', a dramatic account of a [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence service]] operation during World War II.&lt;ref name="Webster2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Webster|title=Love and Death in Kubrick: A Critical Study of the Films from Lolita Through Eyes Wide Shut|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bz_x37RSSqIC&amp;pg=PA245|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6191-2|pages=245–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marshall|title=All the King’s Men|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uTApfawgd8C|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=7 November 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4482-1056-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working with [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] on the story for ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'', Kubrick asked Watson for a pre-print copy of his ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' tie-in novel ''[[Inquisition (Warhammer 40,000)|Inquisitor]]''. Watson quotes Kubrick as saying, "Who knows, Ian? Maybe this is my next movie?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plumbing Stanley Kubrick|url=http://www.ianwatson.info/plumbing-stanley-kubrick/|accessdate=26 September 2014|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 2010 announcement about the development of the ''Lunatic at Large'' project, plans for the prospective production of two other unrealized Kubrick projects were also announced.&lt;ref name="Kevin" /&gt; As of August 2012, ''Downslope'' and ''God Fearing Man'' were in development by Philip Hobbs and producer Steve Lanning, in partnership with independent company Entertainment One (eOne). A press release described ''Downslope'' as an "epic Civil War drama", while ''God Fearing Man'' is the "true story of Canadian minister Herbert Emerson Wilson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eOne to Develop TV Projects DOWNSLOPE and GOD FEARING MAN Based on Screenplays by Stanley Kubrick|url=http://collider.com/stanley-kubrick-tv-downslope-god-fearing-man/|work=Collider.com|publisher=IndieClick Film Network|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=Matt Goldberg|date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2013, Anthony Frewin, Kubrick's assistant for many years, wrote in an article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'': "He [Kubrick] was limitlessly interested in anything to do with Nazis and desperately wanted to make a film on the subject." The article included information on another Kubrick [[World War II]] film that was never realized, based on the life story of Dietrich Schulz-Koehn, a Nazi officer who used the pen name "Dr. Jazz" to write reviews of German music scenes during the Nazi era. Kubrick had been given a copy of the [[Mike Zwerin]] book ''Swing Under the Nazis'' (the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Koehn) after he had finished production on ''Full Metal Jacket.'' However, a screenplay was never completed and Kubrick's film adaptation plan was never initiated (the unfinished ''Aryan Papers'' was a factor in the abandonment of the project).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Kubrick's Unmade Film About Jazz in the Third Reich|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/03/stanley-kubricks-unmade-film-about-jazz-in-the-third-reich/274225/|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=26 March 2013|author=James Hughes|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In between ''Eyes Wide Shut'' and ''A.I.'', Kubrick was interested in making a film, for children and young adults, based on [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s [[viking]] epic novel, ''[[Eric Brighteyes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx49KEJxUF0|title=The Stanley Kubrick Archive Oral History Project: Finding and Developing the Story|first=|last=SandpailMedia|date=25 April 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, long-time assistant of Kubrick's, Emilio D'Alessandro addressed that prior to his death, Kubrick was considering making a movie of [[Pinocchio]]. D'Alessandro said that Kubrick sent him to buy Italian books about Pinocchio. "He wanted to make it in his own because so many ''Pinocchios'' have been made. He wanted to do something really big… He said; 'It would [be] very nice if I could make children laugh and feel happy making this Pinocchio.'" (Kubrick eventually used [[A.I. Artificial Intelligence|the project based on Brian Aldiss short story]] as his "Pinocchio film.") D'Alessandro also stated that Kubrick's life-long fascination in World War II led to an interest in [[Battle of Monte Cassino|The Battle of Monte Cassino]]. D'Alessandro said, "Stanley said that would be an interesting film to make. He asked me to get hold of things … like newspaper cuttings and find out the distance from the airport, train stations. He had a friend who actually bombarded Monte Cassino during the war … It is horrible to remember those days. Everything was completely destroyed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murthi|first1=Vikram|title=Stanley Kubrick Was Preparing To Remake "Pinocchio" Before His Death|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/06/stanley-kubrick-pinocchio-remake-film-before-death-1201682889/|website=IndieWire|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alberge|first1=Dalya|title=Stanley Kubrick was planning children's film before his death|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/30/stanley-kubrick-childrens-film-death-pinocchio-eyes-wide-shut-spartacus|website=The Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Studio Art Quilt Associates''', abbreviated as '''SAQA''', is a leading non-profit advocacy group for [[Quilt Art |art quilts]] based in [[Hebron, Connecticut|Hebron]], [[Connecticut]], in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="The_Art_Quilt"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=The Art Quilt|last=Shaw|first=Robert|publisher=Hugh Lauter Levin Associates, Inc|year=1997|isbn=0-88363-325-6|location=|pages=79|doi=|id=|authorlink=}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

== Formation==

In the book, ''American Quilts: The Democratic Art, 1780-2007'', Robert Shaw states, "Contemporary quilts were rarely seen in major art publications or in museum and gallery exhibitions, and critical writing about unconventional quilts was almost nonexistent."&lt;ref name="Shaw2009"/&gt;

Shaw further writes, "Realizing that they could not wait for attention to come to them, artist-quiltmakers began to take matters into their own hands.  In 1989, California quiltmaker [[Yvonne Porcella]] founded Studio Art Quilt Associates, a nonprofit advocacy group dedicated to "serving artists working in the art quilt medium." SAQA sought to establish the place of artist-made quilts among contemporary fine art, to serve as a forum for the professional development of quilt artists, and to act as an informative resource for curators, dealers, art consultants, teachers, students, and collectors. An initial group of about fifty quilt artists contributed seed money and volunteered time to implement the founding of the organization, which continues to be a strong voice today".&lt;ref name="Shaw2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=American Quilts: The Democratic Art, 1780-2007|last=Shaw|first=Robert|publisher=Sterling Publishing|year=2009|isbn=1-4027-4773-X|location=|doi=|id=|authorlink=}} &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.322}}  

==Defining the Art Quilt==

In the past, SAQA had defined the art quilt as: "A contemporary art work exploring and expressing aesthetic concerns common to the whole range of visual arts, painting, printing, photography, graphic design, assemblage, and sculpture, which retains however through material or technique a clear relationship to the folk art quilt from which it descends".&lt;ref name="The_Art_Quilt" /&gt;

As of 2012, in response to a membership survey, SAQA has broadened the working definition of an art quilt to, "A creative visual work that is layered and stitched or that references this form of stitched layered structure".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine| last=Sider | first = Sandra| date = 2012| title = Thoughts from the President| url  = http://www.saqa.com/media/file/journal/IssueV22N1_Winter12.pdf | magazine   = SAQA Journal| location   = Hebron, Ct| publisher  = Studio Art Quilt Associates, Inc.| page = 2| access-date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exhibition Suiseki and Shangshi Prague 2011 2257.jpg|thumb|Suiseki and its wooden base at "Exhibition Suiseki and Shangshi" in Prague, 2011]]

{{nihongo|'''Suiseki'''|水石}} are small naturally occurring or shaped [[rock (geology)|rocks]] which are traditionally appreciated.  They are similar to [[Chinese scholar's rocks]].&lt;ref name="cousins244"&gt;Cousins, Craig. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7w-arIGpmfEC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=  ''Bonsai Master Class,'' p. 244].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chinese scholar's rocks influenced the development of ''suiseki'' in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Brokaw, Charles. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=T51TNiU9460C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=  ''The Temple Mount Code,'' p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of ''suiseki'' in Japan begins during the reign of [[Empress Suiko]].  The small objects were brought to Japan as gifts from the Chinese Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Corvello, Vincent T. and Yūji Yoshimura. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-87ZrlXIzAC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= ''The Japanese Art of Stone Appreciation: Suiseki and Its Use With Bonsai,'' p. 17].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Suiseki'' are usually presented in two different ways:

*The stone is provided with a wooden base (Daiza).
*The stone is placed in a waterproof tray or bowl of ceramic (suiban) or bronze (Doban).

These stones are not just any stones which can be found in nature; they must be expressive stones and have a special shape, color and texture to be categorized as ''suiseki''. There is a distinction between landscape and object stones. The former reflect landscapes such as mountains, lakes or rivers, while other stones have object shapes that resemble animals or sculptures.

The stones are of natural origin and are found in rivers, oceans and karst areas. They are not allowed to be reshaped. An exception is the cutting of stones to have a flat base, so they can be placed stably on a Daiza, suiban or Doban, to be displayed properly. This diminishes their value, in the eyes of purists.

==Evaluation==
The evaluation of ''suiseki'' recognizes subtlety of color, shape, markings and surface.  According to {{nihongo|Hideo Marushima|丸島秀夫|Marushima Hideo|1934-&amp;nbsp;}} in {{nihongo| ''The History of Suiseki in Japan''|日本愛石史|Nihon aisekishi|}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not a silly thing at all to enjoy a stone in a tray. I see the whole world in a tiny stone. Some objects in this world are huge, and others are small, and they come in all shapes, but they are not that different when you look at their essence.&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Felix G. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vgr2MAYajMIC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=  ''Suiseki: The Japanese Art of Miniature Landscape Stones,'' p. 40], citing {{nihongo|''The History of Suiseki in Japan''|日本愛石史|Nihon aisekishi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Popular types of ''suiseki'' suggest a mountain, a waterfall, an island, a thatched hut or an animal.&lt;ref name="cousins244"/&gt;

[[File:Masson automatic drawing.jpg|thumb|[[André Masson]]. ''Automatic Drawing''. (1924). Ink on paper, 9{{frac|1|4}} × 8{{frac|1|8}}" (23.5 × 20.6 cm). [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]
'''Surrealist automatism''' is a method of art-making in which the artist suppresses conscious control over the making process, allowing the unconscious mind to have great sway. Early 20th-century [[Dada]]ists, such as [[Hans Arp]], made some use of this method through chance operations. [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists, most notably [[André Masson]], adapted to art the [[automatic writing]] method of [[André Breton]] and [[Philippe Soupault]] who composed with it ''[[Les Champs Magnétiques]]'' (The Magnetic Fields) in 1919.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 45-46. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Automatic Message]]'' (1933) was one of Breton's significant theoretical works about automatism.

==Origins==
[[Automatic behavior|Automatism]] has taken on many forms: the automatic writing and [[automatic drawing|drawing]] initially (and still to this day) explored by the surrealists can be compared to similar or parallel phenomena, such as the non-idiomatic improvisation.
"Pure psychic automatism" was how André Breton defined Surrealism, and while the definition has proved capable of significant expansion, automatism remains of prime importance in the movement.

==Automatic drawing and painting==
{{anchor|Automatic drawing}} &lt;!--Automatic drawing redirects here --&gt;
Automatic drawing was pioneered by the English artist [[Austin Osman Spare]] who wrote a chapter, Automatic Drawing as a Means to Art, in his book, ''[[The Book of Pleasure]]'' (1913). Other artists who also practised automatic drawing later include, in France [[André Masson]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Jean Arp]] and [[André Breton]].

The technique of automatic drawing was transferred to [[painting]] (as seen in Miró's paintings which often started out as automatic drawings), and has been adapted to other media; there have even been [[automatism and the computer|automatic "drawings" in computer graphics]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] was also thought to have expressed a type of automatic drawing in his later work, and particularly in his etchings and lithographic suites of the 1960s.

'''Automatic drawing''' (distinguished from [[mediumistic automatism|drawn expression of mediums]]) was developed by the [[surrealist]]s, as a means of expressing the [[subconscious]]. In automatic [[drawing]], the [[hand]] is allowed to move "[[random]]ly" across the paper. In applying [[Randomness|chance]] and accident to mark-making, drawing is to a large extent freed of [[rationality|rational control]]. Hence the drawing produced may be attributed in part to the subconscious and may reveal something of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], which would otherwise be repressed. Examples of automatic drawing were produced by mediums and practitioners of the psychic arts. It was thought by some [[Spiritualist Church|Spiritualists]] to be a spirit control that was producing the drawing while physically taking control of the medium's body.

Most of the surrealists' automatic drawings were [[illusion]]istic, or more precisely, they developed into such drawings when representational forms seemed to suggest themselves. In the 1940s and 1950s the [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] group called [[Les Automatistes]] pursued creative work (chiefly [[painting]]) based on surrealist principles. They abandoned any trace of [[Representation (arts)|representation]] in their use of automatic drawing. This is perhaps a more pure form of automatic drawing since it can be almost entirely involuntary – to develop a representational form requires the [[conscious mind]] to take over the process of drawing, unless it is entirely [[accident]]al and thus incidental. These artists, led by [[Paul-Émile Borduas]], sought to proclaim an entity of [[universal value]]s and ethics proclaimed in their manifesto ''[[Refus Global]]''.

As alluded to above, surrealist artists often found that their use of "automatic drawing" was not entirely automatic, rather it involved some form of conscious intervention to make the image or painting visually acceptable or comprehensible, "...Masson admitted that his 'automatic' imagery involved a two-fold process of unconscious and conscious activity...."&lt;ref&gt;The Surrealists: Revolutionaries in art &amp; writing 1919–1935, Jemma Montagu, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surautomatism==
Some Romanian surrealists invented a number of [[surrealist techniques]] (such as [[cubomania]], [[Surrealist techniques|entoptic graphomania]], and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface) that purported to take automatism to an absurd point, and the name given, "[[surautomatism]]", implies that the methods "go beyond" automatism, but this position is controversial.

==Paul-Emile Borduas==
The notion of automatism is also rooted in the artistic movement of the same name founded by Montreal artist [[Paul-Emile Borduas]] in 1942; himself influenced by the [[Dadaist]] movement as well as André Breton. He, as well as a dozen other artists from Quebec's artistic scene, very much under restrictive and authoritarian rule in that period, signed the ''Global Refusal'' manifesto, in which the artists called upon North American society (specifically in the culturally unique environment of [[Quebec]]), to take notice and act upon the societal evolution projected by these new cultural [[paradigms]] opened by the Automatist movement as well as other influences in the 1940s.

==Contemporary techniques==
The [[computer]], like the [[typewriter]], can be used to produce [[automatic writing]] and [[Surrealist techniques|automatic poetry]]. The practice of automatic drawing, originally performed with pencil or pen and paper, has also been adapted to [[computer mouse|mouse]] and [[computer display|monitor]], and other automatic methods have also been either adapted from non-[[digital media]], or invented specifically for the computer. For instance, filters have been automatically run in some bitmap editor programs such as [[Photoshop]] and [[GIMP]], and computer-controlled brushes have been used to "simulate" automatism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verostko.com/gallery.html Pathway Studio Gallery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Grandview — a software application created in 2011 for the Mac — displays one word at a time across the entire screen as a user types, facilitating automatic writing.&lt;ref&gt;http://smarterbits.org/writing-with-grandview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israelis|Israeli]] composer [[Paul Ben-Haim|Paul Ben-Haim's]] '''Symphony no. 1''' is the first Eretz-Israel [[symphony]] and one of the most important works in the history of [[Music of Israel#Classical music|classical music in Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin_TAU.asp?From=Archive&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=DAV/1946/11/08&amp;EntityId=Ar02100&amp;ViewMode=HTML | last=Bronzaft | first=Moshe | title=Eretz Israel Composers: Paul Ben-Haim | journal=[[Davar]]|date=November 8, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Ben-Haim started composing the piece at the end of August 1939 and completed it at the end of June 1940. This is the period after his immigration to Israel, and the end of the days of the fall of France. The composition of the piece is about "the desire to compose a large-scale composition in the spirit of our people and country for our [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra|Eretz Israel Orchestra]]... the terrible rampage of the underworld forces must have had a powerful impact on my composition (at least on its first movement, and to some extent also on its last). Nevertheless, this composition is nothing but absolute pure music..."

== Structure ==

The piece has three movements:

# '''Allegro energico'''—according to Yehoash Hirschberg, the first theme, which is characterized by rhetorical expression of excitement and storm in the exposition, changes its nature into pastoral [[lyricism]]. The second theme, which is festive and wondering in exposition, becomes a military march. The movement is organized into long divisions, each of which features a climax, and decays slowly. The descending augmented second motive functions as an expression of lament and the pain of the Jewish prayer.{{cn|date=November 2014}}
# '''Molto calmo e cantabile'''—is based on a long melodic line presenting the movement's motif material. The final part of the theme is a quote from a traditional song motif of [[Persian Jews]] ''I shall lift my eyes to the mountains'', arranged by Ben-Haim for Bracha Tzfira in the beginning of April 1940.
# '''Presto con fuoco'''—above a constant [[tarantella]] rhythm are two contrasting ideas: a quote from the choir part of the first finale of Ben-Haim's great work ''Yoram'', followed by a [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[Hora (dance)|hora]] dance.

In ''The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia'', Gorsuch treats [[physician-assisted suicide]] and [[euthanasia]] as morally identical acts.&lt;ref name="JRE"/&gt; The scope of the book is limited to intentional killing by private persons, avoiding the complexities of considering the issue alongside the [[death penalty]] and warfare.&lt;ref name="JRE"/&gt; In the book, Gorsuch rejects commonly held views about autonomy, arguing that states should sometimes place "paternalistic constraints on the choices of its citizens."&lt;ref name="JRE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boer|first1=Theo A.|title=Recurring Themes in the Debate About Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|date=1 September 2007|volume=35|issue=3|pages=529–555|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9795.2007.00318.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9795.2007.00318.x/full|language=en|issn=1467-9795}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sharply criticizes judge [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], who wrote that government should not interfere with a person's decision to end their life. Gorsuch argues that Posner's view could require the legalization of [[consensual homicide]] and would lead to mass [[suicide pact]]s, [[duel]]s, and [[organ trade|organ sales]].&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt; Gorsuch further characterized assisted suicide as, "essentially a right to consensual homicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sltrib.com/home/4894718-155/ap-gorsuch-case-review-shows-hes?page=2 | title = AP: Gorsuch case review shows he’s no crusader on abortion | date= 2 February 2017 | accessdate = 4 February 2017 | publisher = ''Salt Lake Tribune'' | author = Larry Neumeister, Garance Bruke and Mitch Weiss }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the U.S. should "retain existing law [banning assisted suicide and euthanasia] on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong."&lt;ref name="Gorsuch 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gorsuch |first=N.M. |title=The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia |publisher=Princeton University Press |series=New Forum Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4008-3034-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwwqAgdREKoC |accessdate=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusation of plagiarism==

On April 4, 2017, [[Buzzfeed]] and ''[[Politico]]'' ran articles highlighting similar language occurring in ''The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia'' and an earlier law review article by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma, [[Indiana]]'s deputy [[attorney general]]. Academic experts contacted by ''Politico'' "differed in their assessment of what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Analysis {{!}} Neil Gorsuch’s 11th-hour plagiarism scare|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/05/neil-gorsuchs-11th-hour-plagiarism-scare/|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoganBizInside04042016"&gt;Bryan Logan (April 4, 2016) [http://www.businessinsider.com/neil-gorsuch-plagiarism-allegations-supreme-court-confirmation-2017-4 Neil Gorsuch is accused of plagiarism amid a heated Supreme Court confirmation fight], businessinsider.com; accessed April 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BresnanhanPolitico04042017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/gorsuch-writings-supreme-court-236891|title=Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors|publisher=politico.com|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Short Section In Neil Gorsuch's 2006 Book Appears To Be Copied From A Law Review Article|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/a-short-section-in-neil-gorsuchs-2006-book-appears-to-be|work=BuzzFeed|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorsuch's advisor at Oxford, John Finnis, stated, "The allegation is entirely without foundation.

'''''The Laundress''''' ({{lang-fr|La Blanchisseuse}}) is a 1761 [[genre painting]] by French artist [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725-1805).  Its development was influenced by  Dutch [[cabinet painting]] and the imagery of the laundress made popular through a literary style known as ''{{Interlanguage link multi|genre poissard|fr|3=Genre poissard}}''.  ''The Laundress'' was one of fourteen works exhibited by Greuze at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1761 and was part of the collection of Greuze's patron, [[Ange Laurent Lalive de Jully]]. The painting was mostly unknown for more than two centuries as it was purchased in 1770 by [[Gustaf Adolf Sparre]] and privately held in that Swedish art collection and rarely seen until it was acquired by the [[Getty Museum]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;[[Colin Bailey (museum director)|Bailey, Colin B.]] (2000). ''[http://www.getty.edu/publications/virtuallibrary/0892365641.html Jean-Baptiste Greuze: The Laundress]''. Getty Publications. {{ISBN|9780892365647}}. {{oclc|42810740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
French artist [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] was a late eighteenth century [[genre painter]] who was influenced by seventeenth century Dutch and Flemish artists.&lt;ref name="bf97"/&gt; He first exhibited at the Salon of 1755, receiving great attention for his genre painting ''Un Père de famille qui lit la Bible à ses enfàns'' (''Father Reading the Bible to His Children'').&lt;ref&gt;Hallam, John Stephen (2015). "[https://sites.google.com/a/plu.edu/paris-salon-exhibitions-1667-1880/salon-de-1755 Salon of 1755]." Paris Salon Exhibitions: 1667–1880. A History in Collage.  Retrieved August 28, 2015.  Note, this site is a continuation of [http://community.plu.edu/~hallamjs/biography/ research] Hallam did at Pacific Lutheran University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years previously, [[Denis Diderot]] began publishing the first modern form of art criticism, and became one of Greuze's admirers after they met in 1759. Greuze achieved even greater success at the Salon of 1761 with ''[[:File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze L'accordee de Village.jpg|L'Accordée de village]]''.&lt;ref name="bf97"&gt;Fredericksen, Burton (1997). "French School". In ''[http://www.getty.edu/publications/virtuallibrary/0892364289.html?qt=impressionism Masterpieces of the J. Paul Getty Museum: Paintings]''. Getty Publications. p. 81. {{ISBN|9780892364282}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greuze was considered one of the greatest painters of his time, but his popularity began to decline by the 1780s. After the [[French Revolution]] he lost everything and died penniless. Greuze was virtually forgotten by the art world for several centuries until his reemergence in the late twentieth century with the reappraisal of art from the [[Ancien Régime]].

==Development and exhibition==
Greuze likely began working on ''The Laundress'' sometime in July 1761, around the same time as ''L'Accordée de village''. In drawing upon Dutch and Flemish cabinet paintings, Greuze may have found inspiration in the style of [[Rembrandt]], and other artists and paintings such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]]'s ''The Kitchen Maid'' (1638), [[Gerrit Dou]]'s  ''Girl Chopping Onions'' (1646), [[Gabriël Metsu]]'s ''The Laundress'' (1650), and [[Jan Steen]]'s ''Girl Offering Oysters'' (1658-1660).&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fort"&gt;Fort, Bernadette (2007).

Greuze exhibited a total of fourteen paintings at the Salon in September 1761, including ''The Laundress'' and ''L'Accordée de village''.{{refn|name=rivers|group=note|For a list of all fourteen paintings Greuze submitted to the Salon of 1761, see Rivers, John (1913).

==Description==
[[File:The Laundress autograph replica Fogg Museum.jpg|thumb|Autograph replica of the original, [[Fogg Museum]]]]
A young [[maidservant]] bends over to wring out linen with her hands as she stares provocatively at the viewer with a sensual, flirting glance.  She appears unkempt, wearing clothes which cover her body and red [[Mule (shoe)|mules]] on her feet, but her ankle and foot are exposed suggesting a lack of sexual restraint.&lt;ref name="bf97"/&gt;  A ''marabout'', a kettle used for boiling water, is seated on a small table in the lower left frame.

==Provenance==
Greuze's patron, Ange-Laurent de La Live de Jully, was the original owner of the painting.  After he sold it in 1770, it passed through multiple Swedish collections for several centuries, including those of Count Gustaf Adolph Sparre, his wife Countess Amelie (Ramel) Sparre, their grandson Count Gustaf Adolf Frederik de la Gardie,  his father Count Jakob Gustaf de la Gardie, who without further issue sold the entire collection to Count Carl de Geer, who gifted the entire collection to his granddaughter Countess Elizabeth (von Platen) Wachtmeister, who first created the Wachtmeister family trust of paintings and had the original collection inventory from 1794 updated by the Swedish art historian Georg Göthe. Her grandson Count Gustav Axel Wachtmeister died in 1978, and the Wachtmeister Family trust began selling the paintings, selling the ''Laundress'' to the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1983.&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="getty1"&gt;"[http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/724/jean-baptiste-greuze-the-laundress-la-blanchisseuse-french-1761/?dz=#object-section-provenance-content Provenance]."

'''The Sir Misha Black Awards''' commemorate the life of [[Misha Black]], whose work played an important role in the development of design in Britain. They are given to individuals and institutions, to honour them in their role within design education.

There are two awards – the '''Sir Misha Black Medal for Distinguished Services to Design Education''' which is awarded to design educators from anywhere in the world, and the '''Sir Misha Black Award for Innovation in Design Education''', which is given to UK-based educational institutions, organisations or individuals.

Established by five founding bodies, the [[Design and Industries Association]], the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA), the Faculty of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI) at the [[Royal Society of Arts|RSA]], the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], and the [[College of Medallists]]. The awards are the only ones anywhere in the world that recognise design education.

The ceremony to present the Medal began life as a biennial event but has since become an annual date recognised within the design world calendar. Nominations for the awards are welcomed from anyone with knowledge and appreciation of the value of design education. Nomination forms can be found on the [http://www.mishablackawards.org.uk/nominations Sir Misha Black Awards website].[3]

==The Sir Misha Black Medal==

The Sir Misha Black Medal, first awarded in 1978, was created to honour individuals across the globe who, throughout their career, have made a significant contribution to design education. The Sir Misha Black Medal is awarded collaboratively by Britain’s leading design organisations. Recipients of The Sir Misha Black Medal are automatically enrolled in the [[College of Medallists]].  

==The Sir Misha Black Award==

The Sir Misha Black Award for Innovation in [[design education]], first awarded in 2001, was created to honour the exceptional work of a [[teacher]], [[team]], department, or course within educational establishments in the UK for innovation in design education. The award exists to acknowledge the collective excellence and leadership in design education within the United Kingdom that has long been held in high regard internationally, but has received little formal recognition. 

==The Awards Committee==

The [[committee]] comprises leading [[industry]] design educators and representatives of renowned associations. The current committee as of April 2014 includes:

Mary V. Mullin (Chairman) – The [[Design and Industries Association]], 
Professor [[Sir Christopher Frayling]] – [[College of Medallists]], 
Dr Nick de Leon – The [[Royal College of Art]], 
Professor [[Malcolm Garrett]] RDI, FISTD – The Faculty of [[Royal Designers for Industry]], 
Professor Geoffery Kirk RDI, FREng – [[Royal Academy of Engineering|The Royal Academy of Engineering]]
and 
Professor James Randle RDI, FREng – Special Advisor

'''The Wild Swans''' is a literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a [[princess]] who rescues her eleven brothers from a spell cast by an evil queen. The tale was first published on 2&amp;nbsp;October 1838 as the first installment in Andersen's ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]'' by C. A. Reitzel in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. It has been adapted to various media including ballet, television, and film.

==Synopsis==
[[File:The Wild Swans.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"The Wild Swans" by [[Arthur Gaskin]]]]

In a faraway kingdom, there lives a widowed king with his twelve children: eleven [[prince]]s and one [[princess]]. One day, he decides to remarry. He marries a wicked queen who was a [[witch]]. Out of spite, the queen turns her eleven stepsons into [[swan]]s (they are allowed to become human by night) and forces them to fly away. The queen then tries to bewitch their 15-year-old sister, Elisa, but Elisa's goodness is too strong for this, so the queen has Elisa [[banishment|banished]]. The brothers carry Elisa to safety in a foreign land where she is out of the reach of her stepmother.

There, Elisa is guided by the queen of the [[fairies]] to gather [[Urtica dioica|stinging nettles]] in graveyards to knit into shirts that will eventually help her brothers regain their human shapes. Elisa endures painfully blistered hands from nettle stings, and she must also take a [[vow]] of silence for the duration of her task, for speaking one word will kill her brothers. The king of another faraway land happens to come across the mute Elisa and falls in love with her. He grants her a room in his castle where she continues her knitting. Eventually he proposes to crown her as his queen and wife, and she accepts.

However, the [[Archbishop]] is chagrined because he thinks Elisa is herself a witch, but the king will not believe him. One night Elisa runs out of nettles and is forced to collect more in a nearby church graveyard where the Archbishop is watching. Ghoulish spirits that devour the bodies of the dead are also in the churchyard, and the archbishop believes that Elisa is in league with them.  He reports the incident to the king as proof of [[witchcraft]]. The statues of the [[saint]]s shake their heads in protest, but the Archbishop misinterprets this sign as confirmation of Elisa's guilt. The Archbishop orders to put Elisa on [[Witch-hunt|trial for witchcraft]]. She can speak no word in her defense and is sentenced to death by [[death by burning|burning at the stake]].

The brothers discover Elisa's plight and try to speak to the king but fail, thwarted by the rising sun. Even as the [[tumbril]] bears Elisa away to execution, she continues knitting, determined to keep it up to the last moment of her life. This enrages the people, who are on the brink of snatching and destroying the shirts when the swans descend and rescue Elisa. The people interpret this as a sign from Heaven that Elisa is innocent, but the [[executioner]] still makes ready for the burning. When Elisa throws the shirts over the swans, her brothers return to their human forms. (Unfortunately, the youngest brother has a swan's wing instead of an arm, as Elisa did not have time to finish one sleeve of his shirt.)  Elisa is now free to speak and tell the truth, but she faints from exhaustion, so her brothers explain. As they do so, the firewood around Elisa's stake miraculously takes root and bursts into flowers. The king plucks the topmost flower and presents it to Elisa, and they are married. And the youngest prince's wing becomes normal again.

'''Toba Khedoori''' (born 1964 in [[Australia]]) is an artist of [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] heritage, known primarily for highly detailed mixed-media paintings executed on large sheets of wax-coated paper.

==Biography==
Khedoori was born in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] of Jewish-Iraqi parentage and raised in [[Australia]], and currently lives and works in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She received her MFA from UCLA in 1994. She is the [[identical twin]] sister of artist [[Rachel Khedoori]].&lt;ref name="NYT Art in Review"&gt;Roberta Smith (March 05, 1999) [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/05/arts/art-in-review-rachel-khedoori.html "Art in Review; Rachel Khedoori"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
Characteristically, Khedoori's works have comprised intricate details, models or architectural renderings set within the broad expanses of waxed paper or linen. This delicate combination frequently necessitates close viewing which results, then, in the works filling the spectator's entire field of vision. In recent years, Khedoori's works have introduced inversions of the more usual black detail on white expanse, incorporated natural imagery and landscape, and also taken the form of dramatically smaller-scale works than those hitherto produced. Her most recent output has also moved from wax-on-paper into oil and canvas, with subject matter drawing influence from geometric sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corwin|first=William|title=Toba Khedoori|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=October 2012|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2012/10/artseen/toba-khedoori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toba Khedoori is represented by Regen Projects, Los Angeles and [[David Zwirner]], New York.

==Exhibitions==
Khedoori began exhibiting in 1993, and was shown early in her career at the 1995 [[Whitney Biennial]] exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1996/53/b350878.htm 12/30/96 A BEAUTIFUL MARKET FOR ART&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Khedoori has since had solo exhibitions at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], in the [[St. Louis Art Museum]], the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] in London, the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis, and the [[Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington D.C., among others. Khedoori's work is in the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Whitney Museum of Art]] in New York, as well as the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]. 
Her work will be included in the 53rd International [[Venice Biennale]], Venice 2009.

==Awards==
Khedoori was awarded a $500,000 [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.1038727/apps/s/content.asp?ct=1550399&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''translation convention''' is a [[film]]ic and [[television]] [[story-telling]] device in which the characters within a fictional story are heard or seen speaking not their [[native language]] but instead the [[language]] of the film's [[audience]], which is pretended to be their native languages. Sometimes, some or all of the characters speak with an [[accent (dialect)|accent]] that reflects the actual language spoken in the fictional or historical story setting.

This conceit has been used since the beginning of [[narrative]] [[sound film]]. It uses, among other things, a degree of [[suspension of disbelief]].

{{Expand French|Vénus et Adonis (Poussin)|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Vue_de_Grottaferrata_avec_Vénus_et_Adonis-_Poussin_-Montpellier.jpg|thumb]]
'''''Venus and Adonis''''' or '''''View of Grottaferrata with Venus, Adonis and a River Divinity''''' is a c.1626 painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], now in the [[Musée Fabre]] in Montpellier.

It was cut in two in the 18th century, with the larger right-hand part entering the [[Musée Fabre]]. The left part ended up with the Patti Birch Trust by 1991, on long-term loan to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Both halves were displayed together at the Metropolitan and then the Musée Fabre in 2008. At the end of 2009 the Montpellier Agglomération (guardian of the Musée Fabre) used two private donations to purchase the right part and reunite the painting. The complete painting was then exhibited at ''Nature et idéal : Le paysage à Rome 1600-1650'', a 2011 exhibition in the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris.

[[File:Vitae patrum von Heribert Rosweyde 1615.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the 1615 first edition of ''Vitae Patrum'' by [[Heribert Rosweyde]]]]The '''''Vitae Patrum''''' (literally '''''Lives of the Fathers''''', also called ''Lives of the Desert Fathers'') is an encyclopedia of [[hagiography|hagiographical]] writings on the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] of early Christianity.  The bulk of the original texts date from the third and fourth centuries.&lt;ref name="Leader2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Leader|title=The Badia of Florence: Art and Observance in a Renaissance Monastery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjS8j-6mf1UC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=30 December 2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35567-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitae-patrum.org.uk/|title=Vitae Patrum|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lives that were originally written in Greek were translated into Latin between the fourth and the seventh century. An Italian vernacular translation was made by Dominican friar [[Domenico Cavalca]] from [[Pisa]] at the beginning of the fourteenth century.
A printed edition, edited by the Jesuit [[Heribert Rosweyde]], was printed by Balthazar Moret in 1615. The book is a significant part of the much broader work, ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]''.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hippolyte Delehaye|title=The work of the Bollandists through three centuries, 1615-1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjoKxXmj6EC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=1922|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Vitae Patrum'' is based on extensive research by Rosweyde into all the available literature he could find on the early desert monastics. [[Hippolyte Delehaye]] described the work as "the epic of the origins of monasticism in Egypt and Syria, an epic unsurpassed in interest and grandeur." In the thirteenth century, a version of ''Vitae Patrum'' had been translated into Latin. It was such a popular book that numerous versions and editions were published, with extensive changes and variations in the stories. Rosweyde based his book on  twenty-three different versions of those earlier books, studying, dating, and classifying all the different versions and changes.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

Rosweyde's ''Vitae Patrum'' consists of ten books. Book I has the lives of sixteen saints under the title ''Vitae virorum'' and eleven saints under the title ''Vitae mulierum'', beginning with [[St. Paul the Hermit]] and [[St. Anthony of the Desert]], and including women saints such as [[The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot|Saint Mary the Harlot]]. Books II, ''Historia monachorum'', and III, ''Verba seniorum'' (Sayings of the Elders), are attributed to [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], who was later found to be only their translator. Book IV is a compilation of writings by [[Sulpicius Severus]] and [[John Cassian]]. Book V is another collection of ''Verba seniorum'' from Latin and Greek by [[Pelagius]].&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

Book VI and Book VII are further collections of ''Verba seniorum'' (Sayings of the Elders) by unknown Greek authors translated by John the subdeacon, possibly [[Pope John III]], and by [[Paschasius]]. Book VIII is a text that was previously known as ''The Paradise of Heraclides'', but which Rosweyde attributed to its real author, [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], and titled the ''[[Lausiac History]]''. Book IX is ''De Vitis Patrum'' by [[Theodoret]]. Book X is ''The Spiritual Meadow of Moschus''. Rosweyde wrote an introduction to each book.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

'''''We're Going on a Bear Hunt''''' is a 1989 children's [[picture book]] written by [[Michael Rosen]] and illustrated by [[Helen Oxenbury]]. It has won numerous awards and was the subject of a ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]]'' for "Largest Reading Lesson" with a book-reading attended by 1,500 children, and an additional 30,000 listeners online, in 2014.

==Plot and design==
Five children and their dog go out to hunt a bear. They travel through grass, a river, mud, a forest and a snowstorm before coming face to face with a bear in its cave. This meeting causes panic and the family run home, across all the obstacles, followed by the bear. Finally, the children lock the bear out of the house and all hide under the duvet saying "We're not going on a bear hunt again." At the end of the book, the bear is pictured trudging disconsolately on a beach at night, the same beach that is shown on a sunny day as the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]]. Most of the illustrations were painted in [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]].&lt;ref name="Channel 4 interview"/&gt; However, the six pictures of the children facing a new hazard are black and white drawings.

At each obstacle is an [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] description. Before each obstacle the children chant the refrain:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;We're going on a bear hunt.
We're going to catch a big one.
What a beautiful day!
We're not scared.&lt;/poem&gt;}}
followed by:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;We can't go over it.
We can't go under it.
Oh no!
We've got to go through it!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The children, the eldest of whom is sometimes mistaken for their father, are based on Oxenbury's own children. Likewise, the dog is based on her dog.&lt;ref name="How it was made"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/05/how-we-made-bear-hunt|title=How we made: Helen Oxenbury and Michael Rosen on We're Going on a Bear Hunt|last=Tims|first=Anna|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 November 2012|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the obstacles, apart from the river, are based on real life locations in England and Wales that Oxenbury knew.&lt;ref name="Channel 4 interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/interview-with-helen-oxenbury-for-were-goin-on-a-bear-hunt|title=Interview with Helen Oxenbury for We're Going on a Bear Hunt|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Étienne Souriau''' ({{IPA-fr|suʁjo|lang}}; April 26, 1892 &amp;ndash; November 19, 1979) was a French philosopher, best known for his work in [[aesthetics]].

Son of [[Paul Souriau]], he studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and received his ''[[agrégation|agrégation of philosophy]]'' in 1925. After teaching at the universities of [[Aix-en-Provence]] and [[Lyon]] he eventually became a professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he held a chair in aesthetics. He was the editor of the ''[[Revue d'esthétique]]'' and was elected to the [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]] in 1958. Recently, the works of [[Bruno Latour]] have reawoken interests on Souriau's oeuvre, specially his works on ontology and metaphysics regarding his theories of different modes of existence.
