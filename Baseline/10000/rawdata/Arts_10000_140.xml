An '''animal painter''' is an artist who specialises in (or is known for their skill in) the portrayal of animals.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' dates the first express use of the term "animal painter" to the mid-18th century: by English [[physician]], [[Natural history|naturalist]] and writer [[John Berkenhout]] (1726-1791).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/animal-painting |title=Animal painting |publisher=''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 20th century, ''wildlife artist'' became a more usual term for contemporary animal painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlandtrust.org/gallery/exhibitions/wildlife-art-20th-century |title=Wildlife Art of the 20th Century |publisher=[[Woodland Trust]] |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Especially in the 17th century, animal painters would often collaborate with other artists, who would either paint the main subject in a [[history painting|historical]] or mythological piece, or the [[Landscape painting|landscape]] background in a decorative one. [[Frans Snyders]], a founder of the Baroque animal painting tradition, often provided the animals, and also still lifes of food, for [[Peter Paul Rubens]]; a different landscape specialist might provide the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frans-Snyders |title=Frans Snyders |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dutch Golden Age]] such specialists tended to produce smaller genre paintings concentrating on their specialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gnrn/hd_gnrn.htm |title=Frans Snyders |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal painters came lower down in the [[hierarchy of genres]], but the best painters could make a very good living; many royal and aristocratic patrons were more interested in their subject matter than that of the more prestigious genres. Mainly in England, there were still more specialised painters from the 18th century who produced portraits of racehorses and prize specimens of livestock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10429771/Why-the-George-Stubbs-paintings-were-worth-saving.html |title=Why the George Stubbs paintings were worth saving |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in France animal subjects continued to be decorative [[Capriccio (painting)|capriccios]] often set around garden statuary.

In 2014 ''[[The Guardian]]'' nominated ''[[The Goldfinch (painting)|The Goldfinch]]'' (1654) by [[Carel Fabritius]] (1622-1654) as the finest animal portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/jun/27/top-10-animal-portraits-in-art |title=The top 10 animal portraits in art |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animalier==
[[Animalier]], as a collective plural noun, is a term used in [[antiques]] for small-scale sculptures of animals in particular (animalier bronzes), but also paintings of animals. Large numbers of these were produced - often mass-produced - in the 19th century in France and elsewhere. Many earlier examples can be found, but [[animalier]] sculpture became more popular, and reputable, in early 19th century Paris, with the works of [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1795-1875) - for whom the term was coined, decisively, by critics in 1831&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O110845/walking-lion-statuette-barye-antoine-louis/ |title=Walking lion |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and [[Christopher Fratin]] (1801-1864).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/collectables/30507/rise-of-the-animal-sculptures.html |title=Rise of the animal sculptures |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 19th-century, a taste for animal subjects was widespread among the middle-classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O171334/an-indian-panther-lying-down-statuette-barbedienne-ferdinand/ |title=An Indian panther lying down |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife conservation==
Many modern wildlife artists or art groups hold benefits to support [[wildlife conservation]], or participate in contests held by wildlife conservation organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the AFC |url=http://www.natureartists.com/ |publisher=Artists for Conservation |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''Art education in the United States''' reflects the social values of [[American culture]]. [[Apprenticeship]] was once the norm and the main sense, however with the democratization of education, particularly as promoted by educational philosopher [[John Dewey]], opportunities have greatly expanded. Elliot Eisner has been an influential advocate for the benefits of art in the schools.

Enrollment in art classes at the high-school elective level peaked in the late 1960s to the early 1970s with that period's emphasis on individuals expressing uniqueness. Currently "art [[magnet schools]]", available in many larger communities, use art(s) as a core or underlying theme to attract those students motivated by personal interest or with the intention of becoming a professional or commercial artist. It is widely reported that the arts are losing instruction time in school based upon budget cuts in combination with increasing test-based assessments of children which the federal government's [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB) act requires. The NCLB retains the arts as part of the "core curriculum" for all schools, it does not require reporting any instruction time or assessment data for arts education content or performance standards, which is reason often cited for the decline or possible decline of arts education in American public schools.

==Picture study movement, before 1930==
Art appreciation in America accelerated with the "picture study movement" in the late 19th century. The movement began to fade at the end of the 1920s.{{sfn|Eisner|2004}} Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as “Art in Daily Living”. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter (1986,Sept.) The Ecology of Picture Study, ''Art Education''[48-54].&lt;/ref&gt;

Picture study was made possible by the improved technologies of reproduction of images, growing public interest in art, the Progressive Movement in education, and growing numbers of immigrant children who were more visually literate than they were in English. The type of art included in the curriculum was from the Renaissance onward, but nothing considered “modern art” was taught. Often, teachers selected pictures that had a moral message. This is because a major factor in the development in aesthetics as a subject was its relationship to the moral education of the new citizens due to the influx of immigrants during the period. Aesthetics and art masterpieces were part of the popular idea of self culture, and the moralistic response to an artwork was within the capabilities of the teacher, who often did not have the artistic training to discuss the formal qualities of the artwork.

A typical Picture Study lesson was as follows: Teachers purchased materials from the Perry Picture Series, for example. This is similar to the prepackaged [[curriculum]] we have today. These materials included a teacher’s picture that was larger for the class to look at together, and then smaller reproduction approximately 2 ¾” by 2” for each child to look at. These were generally in black and white or sepia tone. Children would often collect these cards and trade them much like modern day baseball cards. The teacher would give the students a certain amount of information about the picture and the artist who created it, such as the picture’s representational content, artist’s vital statistics, and a few biographical details about the artist. These were all included in the materials so an unskilled teacher could still present the information to his or her class. Then the teacher would ask a few discussion questions. Sometimes suggestions for language arts projects or studio activities were included in the materials.

The picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States.

==Since World War II==
Since [[World War II]], artist training has become the charge of colleges and universities and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not need a college degree. Since that time the [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] and then the [[Master of Fine Arts]] became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, necessities facilitated by "the passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft-intensive schools like the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Lee Bontecou]], [[Al Held]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Donald Judd]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Cy Twombly]] and hundreds of others did or [[Black Mountain College]] as [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and others did or the [[Hans Hofmann]] School of Art in [[Greenwich Village]] whose students included [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Lee Krasner]] and [[Larry Rivers]] among others; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The [[School of Visual Arts]], [[Pratt Institute]], and [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and other art schools across the country like the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], and the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], as well as [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale]] had emerged as the leading American art academies; its alums included [[Roxy Paine]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Beverly Pepper]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[R.B. Kitaj]], [[Sylvia Plimack Mangold]], [[Elizabeth Peyton]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Peter Reginato]], [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Jason Rhoades]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Leon Golub]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Joan Jonas]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Michael Fried]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Jennifer Bartlett]], [[John Currin]], and [[Robert Mangold]], making it seem as if every hip artist in New York was obligated to have a college degree or an Ivy League degree".&lt;ref&gt;"How to Succeed in Art" by Deborah Solomon, New York Times Magazine. June 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This trend spread from the United States around the world.

Currently, the PhD in studio art is under debate as the new standard as the terminal degree in the arts. Although in 2008 there are only two United States programs offering a PhD in studio art, "10 universities offer the degree in Australia, and it is ubiquitous in the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and other countries. It is already expected for a teaching job in Malaysia".&lt;ref&gt;"Art Schools: A Group Crit," p. 108. Art In America, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As James Elkins, the chair of the department of art history, theory and criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago as well as the chair of the department of art history at the University of Cork in Ireland wrote in [[Art in America]], "By the 1960s the MFA was ubiquitous. Now the MFA is commonplace and the PhD is coming to take its place as the baseline requirement for teaching jobs".&lt;ref&gt;"Art Schools: A Group Crit," p. 109. Art In America, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in reference to teaching positions for studio art at the college level.  The PhD has been a standard requirement to be a professor of art education for many years.  In his forthcoming book, ''Artists with PhD's'', [[James Elkins (art critic)]] presents the opinion the PhD will  become the new standard, and offers the book as a resource for assessing these programs and for structuring future programs. However, the College Art Association still recognizes the MFA as the terminal degree, stating "At this time, few institutions in the United States offer a PhD degree in studio art, and it does not appear to be a trend that will continue or grow, or that the PhD will replace the MFA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=College Art Association |url=http://www.collegeart.org/guidelines/mfa.html |title=Standards and Guidelines &amp;#124; College Art Association &amp;#124; CAA &amp;#124; Advancing the history, interpretation, and practice of the visual arts for over a century |work=Collegeart.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discipline-based art education in the early 1980s==
Discipline-based art education (DBAE) is an educational program formulated by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] in the early 1980s.  DBAE supports a diminished emphasis on studio instruction, and instead promotes education across four disciplines within the arts: aesthetics, [[art criticism]], art history and art production. It does retain a strong tie to studio instruction with an emphasis on technique.&lt;ref&gt;Neperud, Ronald W.  ''Context, Content and Community in Art Education'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the objectives of DBAE are to make arts education more parallel to other academic disciplines, and to create a standardized framework for evaluation.  It was developed specifically for grades K-12 but has been instituted at other levels of education.  DBAE advocates that art should be taught by certified teachers, and that "art education is for all students, not just those who demonstrate talent in making art".&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs, Stephen Mark.  ''Readings in Discipline Based Art Education'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of DBAE is voiced from postmodern theorists who advocate for a more pluralistic view of the arts, and inclusion of a diverse range of viewpoints that may not be included in a standardized curriculum.

== History of art education provisions ==
In the 1970s, provisions for arts in education were limited, at the discretion of individual states. Local schools, school boards, and districts were the main actors in deciding whether arts education was provided. Where art education was offered, it consisted of exposure-based experiences with cultural organizations outside of the school and was not integrated into classroom curriculum. In the next couple decades, budget cuts as a result of fiscal crises heavily stripped school budgets to the point where positions for art teachers were essentially eliminated in order to retain core subjects. At this time, arts was seen as nonessential to the development of critical thinking and there did not exist a standard curriculum for teaching art in public schools. As such, provisions were scarce if at all present in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7249/mg702wf.9|title=Revitalizing Arts Education Through Community-Wide Coordination|date=2008|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833043061|editor-last=Bodilly|editor-first=Susan J.|edition=1|pages=9–24|editor-last2=Augustine|editor-first2=Catherine H.|editor-last3=Zakaras|editor-first3=Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the significance of an arts education emerged as data found academic performance improvements and socio-emotional and socio-cultural benefits, among other positive effects, stemming from the stimulative nature of the arts. Key players in advocating for and providing art education included a blend of public entities (school, government agencies, etc.), private organizations, and community centers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This emerging acknowledgement of the importance of art education was matched by a decline in provisions at the beginning of the 19th century. With the implementation of NCLB, public schools prioritized meeting Academic Performance Index (API) growth targets, downgrading the emphasis on non-core subjects. For example, in California public schools, while enrollment increased by 5.8% from 1999 to 2004, music education decreased by 50% in the same 5-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Music for All Foundation, 2004, ''The Sound of Silence – The Unprecedented Decline of Music Education in California Public Schools.'' Retrieved from https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/reports-and-data/legislation-policy/naappd/the-sound-of-silence-the-unprecedented-decline-of-music-education-in-california-public-schools-a&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, data from the Surveys of Public Participation in the Arts (SPAAs) showed that in 2008, 18-24 year olds were less likely to have had an arts education than in 1982. Low-income and low-performing public schools disproportionately struggled with this decline, and African-American and Latino students are generally less able to access the arts when compared to their White counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Rabkin, N., &amp; Hedberg, E. C. (2011). ''Arts education in America: What the declines mean for arts participation.'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://arts.gov/publications/arts-education-america-what-declines-mean-arts-participation&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings of drastic declines in art education provisions spurred efforts for reinvestment. The NEA declared goals including maximizing investment impact, collaboration with local education across levels of government, and offering guidance and leadership support for art education.&lt;ref&gt;HUDSON, A. (2014). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=99624574&amp;site=eds-live A New Vision for Arts Education]. ''Education Digest'', ''80''(4), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, funding for education in the United States comes from three levels; local level, state level and federal level. The whole system of education is kept in the hands of public sector for control and to avoid any mishandling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatisusa.info/education-in-usa/|title=Education in the U.S.|date=4 May 2013|accessdate=2012-01-01|publisher=What is USA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] began awarding Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula that helps students to better understand and retain academic information. One such model of education was created in 2006 by the Storytellers Inc. and ArtsTech (formerly Pan-Educational Institute). The curricula and method of learning is titled AXIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalaxis.org/ AXIS - Education Revolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== National organizations ==
The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is one of the many nationally recognized organizations promoting arts education in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/pub/ArtsLearning.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216181026/http://nea.gov/pub/ArtsLearning.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its formation in 1965, the NEA has led efforts in integrating the arts as a part of the core education for all K-12 students. These efforts include collaborating in state, federal, and public-private partnerships to solicit and provide funding and grants for programs in arts education. During the 2008 fiscal year, the NEA awarded over 200 grants totaling $6.7 million to programs that allow students to engage and participate in learning with skilled artists and teachers. The NEA has initiated a number of other arts education partnerships and initiatives, which include:

* The Arts Education Partnership (AEP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aep-arts.org Arts Education Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''AEP convenes forums to discuss topics in arts education, publishes research materials supporting the role of arts education in schools, and is a clearinghouse for arts education resource materials.''
* The Strategic National Arts Alumni Project (SNAAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snaap.indiana.edu/ |title=SNAAP: Strategic National Arts Alumni Project &amp;#124; Learning about the lives and careers of art graduates in America |work=Snaap.indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is ''an ongoing, online survey system will collect, track, and disseminate data on alumni, and will help institutions to better understand how students use arts training in their careers and other aspects of their lives.''
* The NEA Education Leaders Institute (ELI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=Request for Proposals, Education Leaders Institute, National Endowment for the Arts 
|url=http://www.nea.gov/grants/apply/RFP/RFP-ELI-6.pdf |accessdate=March 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225230514/http://www.nea.gov/grants/apply/RFP/RFP-ELI-6.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''convenes key decision makers to enhance the quality and quantity of arts education at the state level.  Each institute gathers teams of school leaders, legislators, policymakers, educators, professional artists, consultants, and scholars from up to five states to discuss a shared arts education challenge and engage in strategic planning to advance arts education in their respective states.''

There are a variety of other National organizations promoting arts education in the United States.  These include [[Americans for the Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/artseducation Americans for the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; which features major projects such as The Arts. Ask For More.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/Public_awareness ''Art. Ask For More.'']&lt;/ref&gt; national arts education public awareness campaign, Association for the Advancement of Arts Education, [[College Art Association]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org The College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[National Art Education Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naea-reston.org The National Art Education Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts integration==
{{Main|Arts integration}}
Arts integration is another and/or alternative way for the arts to be taught within schools.  Arts integration is the combining of the visual and/or performing arts and incorporating them into the everyday curriculum within classrooms. Learning in a variety of ways allows for students to use their eight multiple intelligences as described by theorist [[Howard Gardner]] in his ''Frames of Mind: Theory of Multiple Intelligences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28500715|title=Frames of mind : the theory of multiple intelligences|last=1943-|first=Gardner, Howard,|date=1993|publisher=Fontana|isbn=9780006862901|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=28500715}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligences]] include bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalist, and spatial.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, T. (2009) Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom.  Alexandria, Virginia:  ASCD.&lt;/ref&gt; Arts integration is especially important today when some schools no longer have or have small arts education programs due to significant budget cuts, including the federal budget agreement that took $12.5 million from the NEA, the United State's largest public arts funder, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harsell|first=Dana Michael|date=2013|title=My Taxes Paid for That?! or Why the Past Is Prologue for Public Arts Funding|jstor=43284282|journal=PS: Political Science and Politics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=74–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertrand Westphal''' is a French scholar and essayist born on May 10, 1962 in [[Strasbourg, France]].

==Career==
Westphal, a professor of [[comparative literature]] and [[literary theory]], has been teaching at the [[University of Limoges]] since 1998. He has been directing the « Human Spaces and Cultural Interactions » research team (EA 1087) since 2000.

He was a visiting professor at [[Texas Tech University]] (2005) and at the [[University of North Carolina Charlotte]] (2013-2015).

Westphal is the founder of [[Geocriticism]], a method of literary analysis and literary theory that incorporates the study of geographic space. After editing the first collective work on this topic (''La Géocritique mode d'emploi''), he published the essay ''La Géocritique. Réel, fiction, espace'' in 2007. In 2011, the book was translated into English (United States) under the title of ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'' by [[Robert Tally]], who has become one of the main promoters of this literary approach in the United States. Geocriticism lays the foundations of the homonymous theory, i.e. an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses on spatial representations.

In 2011, Westphal published the essay ''Le Monde plausible. Espace, lieu, carte'', which proposes a diachronic study of the models of spatial representation. In this book, he distinguishes open space and closed place and gives special value to maps. In 2013, ''Le Monde plausible'' was translated into English (United States) by Amy Wells under the title ''The Plausible World''.
A third volume, ''La Cage des méridiens. La littérature et l’art contemporain face à la globalisation'', published in March 2016, completes what appears to be a Geocriticism trilogy. This work examines the specific role of literature and contemporary art on a global scale and focuses on transcultural logics and decentering.

Westphal is the author of several other books, such as ''Roman et Evangile'' (2000) about the transposition, in a plain narratological sense, of episodes or characters drawn from the Gospels in the contemporary European novel. He is also the author of ''L’œil de la Méditerranée. Une odyssée littéraire'' (2005), which brings together a series of studies of Mediterranean places, and ''Austro-fictions. Une géographie de l’intime'' (2010), which explores the works of a dozen of contemporary Austrian writers.

The '''Cincinnati Art Club''' was formed in 1890 and is one of the oldest continually operating groups or collectives of artists in the United States.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Gelner|first=Pat|date=March 1990|title=Sharing information, support, and fun. (Cincinnati Art Club celebrates its centennial)|url=|journal=American Artist|volume=54|pages=48–51|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed for the purpose of “advancing the knowledge and love of art through education.” The Club achieves its mission through exhibitions, lectures, hands-on demonstrations, sketch and painting group work sessions, monthly critique sessions, maintenance of an art library and awarding of student scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cincinnatiartclub.com/index.html|title=Cincinnati Art Club|last=|first=|website=www.cincinnatiartclub.com|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Frank Duveneck 1874.gif|thumb|Frank Duveneck's presidency starting in 1896 is credited with attracting a large number of members to the club.]]
In the latter part of the 1800s a strong colony of working artists had established a small '[[Montmartre]]' on the upper end of [[Vine Street, Cincinnati|Vine Street]] in [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IusCAAAAMBAJ|title=June in Cincinnati|last=Bernstein|first=Maxine|date=June 1973|work=Cincinnati Magazine|publisher=Emmis Communications|page=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of artists gathered informally as the Cincinnati Sketch Club and had its origins in the studio of John Rettig in 1883. The loose collection of artists became the Cincinnati Art Club on 15 March 1890.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=E.S.|date=1 May 1900|title=The Cincinnati Art Club|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-25505544|journal=Brush and Pencil|volume=6|doi=|jstor=25505544|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first president was John Rettig and consisted of 14 members (which included a pet dog so the membership number wasn't an unlucky 13).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cincinnati.newspapers.com/clip/4646947/history_of_art_in_cincinnati_to_1915/|title=History of art in Cincinnati to 1915|last=|first=|date=9 May 1915|work=|newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer|page=63|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members were: Rettig, Clarence D. Bartlett, James McLaughlin, Edward S. Butler, Matthew A. Daly, Albert O. Elzner, Edward Johnson, Remmington Lane, Leon van Loo, Lewis C. Lutz, William A.

The club grew rapidly and within a year of its founding growing to 32 active members and 36 associate members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Initially the club was bohemian in nature and did not have a fixed abode and met in the homes or studios of members. The host of the meeting would become the owner of all sketches made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1907, the club moved to a new home in the Harrison building and was considered the most attractive home to artists in the Middle West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MONROE|first=WILL S.|date=28 February 1907|title=EDUCATIONAL INTELLIGENCE|journal=The Journal of Education|volume=65|issue=9 (1619)|pages=247|jstor=42810066}}&lt;/ref&gt; A club house was eventually purchased in 1923 on Third Street.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A regular constitution was adopted in 1892 “to advance the knowledge and love of art through exhibitions of works of art, lectures on subjects pertaining to art, and to promote social intercourse amongst its members.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The club became an advocate for artists and in 1908, the CAC President John Ritter submitted a letter which was presented at a congressional hearing on the arts tariff in Washington DC before the Ways and Means Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1908|title=American Art News, Vol. 7, no. 9|jstor=25590386|journal=American Art News|volume=7|issue=9|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was restricted to males until 1979 when women were allowed to become members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cincinnati.newspapers.com/clip/4654794/cincinnati_womens_art_club_with/|title=Women celebrate 100 years of brushes with greatness|last=Findsen|first=Owen|date=8 March 1992|work=|newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cB8DAAAAMBAJ|title=Cincinnati Magazine|last=Cooper|first=Catherine|date=January 1986|publisher=Emmis Communications|volume=19/4|page=186|language=en|issn=0746-8210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cinema of Transgression''' is a term coined by [[Nick Zedd]] in 1985 to describe a [[New York City]]-based [[underground film]] movement, consisting of a loose-knit group of like-minded artists using [[shock value]] and [[humor]] in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk | publisher=Routledge | last1=Sabin |first1=Roger | year=2002 | pages=69–72 | isbn=9780203448403 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u1cDUc9_LC4C&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key players in this movement were Zedd, [[Kembra Pfahler]], [[John Waters]], [[Tessa Hughes-Freeland]], [[Casandra Stark]], [[Beth B]], Tommy Turner, [[Richard Kern]], and [[Lydia Lunch]], who in the late 1970s and mid-1980s began to make [[no budget film|very low-budget films]] using cheap 8&amp;nbsp;mm cameras.

Zedd outlined his [[philosophy]] on the Cinema of Transgression in "The Cinema of Transgression Manifesto", published under the name Orion Jeriko in the [[zine]] ''[[The Underground Film Bulletin]]'' (1984–90).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feastofhateandfear.com/archives/zedd.html |title=The Cinema of Transgression Manifesto |last1=Zedd |first1=Nick |date=1985 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinema of Transgression continues to heavily influence underground filmmakers. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] showed a retrospective of the movement's work introduced by those involved in the production of the original video films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b83db7f51 | title=The Cinema of Transgression 1984–90. |last1=Zedd |first1=Nick |date=2000 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, reclusive British filmmaker [[Philip Goring]] passionately read the original [[manifesto]] written by Nick Zedd, from dawn to dusk, at [[Speakers' Corner]], Hyde Park, London, a long-standing haven of free speech where many of the world's great thinkers and activists have addressed the public.

'''Classical Realism''' refers to an artistic movement in late-20th and early 21st century in which [[drawing]] and [[painting]] place a high value upon [[skill]] and [[beauty]], combining elements of 19th-century [[neoclassicism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]].

==Origins==

[[Image:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. ''[[Pollice Verso]]'' (1872). Classical Realism traces its lineage from Gérôme.]]

The term "Classical Realism" first appeared as a description of literary style, as in an 1882 criticism of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;S. Birch, ''The Educational Times''. Vol. 35, No. 249, January 1, 1882, page 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage relating to the visual arts dates back to at least 1905 in a reference to [[Masaccio]]'s paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Arthur; Blacker; Carlos; Slater, William Albert. ''Paintings of the Louvre, Italian and Spanish'', Doubleday, 1905, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as the title of a contemporary but traditional artistic movement with Richard Lack (1928–2009), who was a pupil of Boston artist [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893–1981) during the early 1950s. Ives Gammell had studied with [[William McGregor Paxton]] (1869–1941) and Paxton had studied with 19th-century French artist, [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904). In 1967 Lack established Atelier Lack, a studio-school of fine art patterned after the ateliers of 19th-century Paris and the teaching of the Boston impressionists. By 1980 he had trained a significant group of young painters. In 1982, they organized a traveling exhibition of their work and that of other artists within the artistic tradition represented by Gammell, Lack and their students. Lack was asked by Vern Swanson, director of the [[Springville Museum of Art]], [[Springville, Utah]], (the exhibition's originating venue), to coin a term that would differentiate the realism of the heirs of the Boston tradition from that of other representational artists. Although he was reluctant to label this work, Lack chose the expression "Classical Realism." It was first used in the title of that exhibition: ''Classical Realism: The Other Twentieth Century''. The term, "Classical Realism", was originally intended to describe work that combined the fine drawing and design of the European academic tradition as exemplified by Gérôme with the observed color values of the American Boston tradition as exemplified by Paxton.

In 1985 Atelier Lack began publishing the ''Classical Realism Quarterly'', featuring articles written by Richard Lack and his students to educate and inform the public about traditional representational painting. In 1988 Lack and several associates founded The American Society of Classical Realism, a society organized to preserve and promote fine representational art. The ASCR functioned until 2005 and published the influential ''Classical Realism Journal'' and ''Classical Realism Newsletter.''

In a separate vein, another major contributor to the revival of traditional drawing and painting knowledge is the painter and  art instructor Ted Seth Jacobs (born 1927), who taught students at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] and the New York Academy of Art in New York City.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, Ted Seth.  ''Light for the Artist'',  Watson-Guptill Pubns (June 1988), {{ISBN|0-8230-2768-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage is rooted in the [[Académie Julian]], the Golden Age of Illustration in New York, and the School of Paris. In 1987 Ted Seth Jacobs created his own art school, L'Ecole Albert Defois in Les Cerqueux sous Passavant, France (49).  Many of Jacobs' students such as Anthony Ryder and Jacob Collins became influential teachers and acquired their own student following.&lt;ref name="ryder"&gt;Ryder, Anthony.  ''The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition'',  Watson-Guptill; 1st edition (June 1, 1999), {{ISBN|0-8230-0303-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and philosophy==

Classical Realism is characterized by love for the visible world and the great traditions of Western art, including [[Classicism]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]].  The movement's aesthetic is Classical in that it exhibits a preference for order, beauty, harmony and completeness; it is Realist because its primary subject matter comes from the representation of nature based on the artist's observation.&lt;ref name="lack"&gt;Gjertson, Stephen.  ''Richard F. Lack: An American Master'',  American Society of Classical Realism: 2001, {{ISBN|0-9636180-3-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists in this genre strive to draw and paint from  the direct observation of nature, and eschew the use of photography or other mechanical aids. In this regard, Classical Realism differs from the art movements of [[Photorealism]] and  [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]. Stylistically, classical realists employ methods used by both [[Impressionist]] and [[Academic art]]ists.

Classical Realist painters have attempted to restore curricula of training that develop a sensitive, artistic eye and methods of representing nature that pre-date [[Modern Art]].  They seek to create paintings that are personal, expressive, beautiful, and skillful.  Their subject matter includes all of the traditional categories within Western Art: [[figurative art|figurative]], landscape, portraiture, indoor and outdoor genre and [[still life]] paintings.

A central idea of Classical Realism is the belief that the [[Modern Art]] movements of the 20th century opposed the tenets and production of traditional art and caused a general loss of the skills and methods needed to produce it. Modernism was antagonistic to art as it was conceived by the Greeks, resurrected in the [[Renaissance]], and carried on by the academies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Panero|first=James|title=The New Old School|work=[[The New Criterion]]|volume=25|date=September 2006|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical Realist artists attempt to revive the idea of art production as it was traditionally understood: mastery of a craft in order to make objects that gratify and ennoble those who see them.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger:  "Why the Art World Is a Disaster", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, June 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This craftsmanship is then applied to drawing, painting or sculpting contemporary subjects which the artist observes in the modern world.

Like the 19th-century academic models from which it derives inspiration, the movement has drawn criticism for the premium placed upon technical performance, a tendency toward contrived and idealized depictions of the figure, and rhetorical overstatement when applied to epic narrative.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Maureen Mullarkey of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' referred to the school as "a contemporary style with retro appeal—like Chrysler's PT Cruiser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/nothing-left-to-hide/41413/|author=Maureen Mullarkey|title=Nothing Left To Hide|work=[[New York Sun]]|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==

The Classical Realist movement is currently sustained through art schools based on the [[Atelier Method]]. Many present-day academies and ateliers follow the [[Charles Bargue]] drawing course. Richard Lack is generally regarded as the founder of the contemporary atelier movement. His school, Atelier Lack, was founded in 1969 and became a model for similar schools.&lt;ref name="atelier"&gt;Aristedes, Juliette.  ''Classical Drawing Atelier: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Studio Practice'', Watson-Guptill Publications: 2006.  {{ISBN|0-8230-0657-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modern ateliers are founded with the goal of revitalizing art education by reintroducing rigorous training in traditional drawing and painting techniques, employing teaching methodologies that were used in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. These schools pass on a method of instruction which melds formal [[academic art]] training with the influence of the French [[Impressionists]].

Under the atelier model, art students study in the studio of an established master to learn how to [[drawing|draw]] and [[paint]] with realistic accuracy and an emphasis on rendering form convincingly. The foundation of these programs rests on an intensive study of the human figure, renderings of plaster casts of [[classical sculpture]], and the emulation of their instructors. The goal is to make students adept at observation, theory, and craft while absorbing classical ideals of beauty.&lt;ref name="atelier"/&gt;

Related to [[closet drama]], a '''closet screenplay''' is a screenplay intended not to be produced/performed but instead to be read by a solitary reader or, sometimes, out loud in a small group.

While any published, or simply read, screenplay might reasonably be considered a "closet screenplay," 20th- and 21st-century Japanese and Western writers have created a handful of film scripts expressly intended to be read rather than produced/performed. This class of [[prose fiction]] written in screenplay form is perhaps the most precise example of the closet screenplay.

This genre is sometimes referred to using a romanized [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[neologism]]: "Lesescenario (レーゼシナリオ)" or, following [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn’s romanization of Japanese]], sometimes “Rezeshinario.” A [[portmanteau]] of the German word ''Lesedrama'' ("read drama") and the English word ''scenario,'' this term simply means "closet scenario," or, by extension, "closet screenplay."&lt;ref&gt;''Sanseido's Concise Dictionary of [[Katakana]] Words''. Tokyo, [[Sanseido]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical interest==
Brian Norman, an [[assistant professor]] at [[Idaho State University]], refers to [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]'s ''[[One Day When I Was Lost]]'' as a "closet [[screenplay]]."&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Brian. “Reading a ‘Closet Screenplay’: Hollywood, James Baldwin’s Malcolms, and the Threat of Historical Irrelevance." ''[[African American Review]]'' 39.1-2 (Spring/Summer 2005): 10-18.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_1-2_39/ai_n15675152]&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was written for a project to produce a movie, but the project suffered a setback. After that, the script was published as a [[literary work]].

[[Lee Jamieson]]'s article "The Lost Prophet of Cinema: The Film Theory of [[Antonin Artaud]]"&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Lee. “The Lost Prophet of Cinema: The Film Theory of Antonin Artaud" ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' 44 (27 August 2007).[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2007/feature-articles/film-theory-antonin-artaud/]&lt;/ref&gt; discusses Artaud's three Lesescenarios (listed below) in the context of his "revolutionary film theory." And in ''French Film Theory and Criticism: 1907–1939'',&lt;ref&gt;Abel, Richard. ''French Film Theory and Criticism: 1907–1939'' (Princeton UP, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Abel lists the following critical treatments of several of the Surrealist "published scenario texts" (36) listed in the example section below:

* J. H. Matthews, ''Surrealism and Film'' (U of Michigan P, 1971), 51–76.
* Steven Kovács, ''From Enchantment to Rage: The Story of Surrealist Cinema'' (Associated UP, 1980), 59–61, 157–76.
* Linda Williams, ''Figures of Desire: A Theory and Analysis of Surrealist Film'' (U of Illinois P, 1981), 25–33.
* Richard Abel, "Exploring the Discursive Field of the Surrealist Film Scenario Text," ''Dada/Surrealism'' 15 (1986): 58–71.

Finally, in his article "Production's 'dubious advantage': Lesescenarios, closet drama, and the (screen)writer's riposte,"&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Quimby. January 2010. "Production's 'dubious advantage': Lesescenarios, closet drama, and the (screen)writer's riposte." [http://scriptjr.nl SCRIPTjr.nl] 1.1. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed November 21, 2009) [http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Quimby Melton outlines the history of the Lesescenario form, situates the genre in a historical literary context by drawing parallels between it and Western "[[closet drama]]," and argues we might consider certain instances of closet drama proto-screenplays. The article also argues that writing these sorts of "readerly" performance texts is essentially an act of subversion whereby (screen)writers work in a performance mode only to intentionally bypass production and, thereby, (re)assert narrative representation's textual primacy and (re)claim a direct (re)connection with their audience.

The comments section of Melton's article also has an ongoing discussion of the Lesescenario canon.[http://scriptjr.nl/issues/1.1/productions-dubious-advantage.php#comments] The list of examples below is based on "Production's 'dubious advantage,'" that discussion, and Melton's "Lesecenario Bibliography" at Google Docs.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Quimby. 6 February 2011. "Lesescenario Bibliography." Google Docs. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARA6WIHgRcNMZGM2OGJxNWhfMjlmeHh0NHZnbg&amp;hl=en&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed February 06, 2011) [https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARA6WIHgRcNMZGM2OGJxNWhfMjlmeHh0NHZnbg&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt; The bibliography contains additional critical works concerned with individual Lesescenarios and/or the canon at large.

'''''Confluence''''' is a [[land art]] [[sculpture]] by artists [[Robert Stackhouse]] and [[Carol Mickett]]. The work sits on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Art Center]] located in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]]. ''Confluence'' was installed as part of the Art Center's ARTSPARK initiative.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARKMap"&gt;{{cite web | author=Indianapolis Art Center | year= | title=Indianapolis Art Center Map | work=Artspark | publisher=Indianapolis Art Center | url=http://www.indplsartcenter.org/userfiles/File//ARTSPARK_Map.pdf | accessdate=4 April 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926223153/http://indplsartcenter.org/userfiles/File//ARTSPARK_Map.pdf | archivedate=26 September 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

''Confluence'' consists of 100 tons of [[Indiana limestone]] cascading in height in a 70-foot [[boat]]-like shape.&lt;ref name="IndianapolisSportsTravel"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Broad Ripple Village | work=Artspark | publisher=Indianapolis Sports &amp; Travel | url=http://indianapolis-sports-travel.com/broad-ripple-village/ | accessdate= 4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"&gt;{{cite web | author=Danison, Joy &amp; Sarah Preuschl | year= | title=Stone Souls | work=Cover Gallery | publisher=Indianapolis Woman | url=http://www.indianapoliswoman.com/archive.asp?r=\2004\aug\departments\artsculture\arts-culture1.txt | accessdate= 4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artAttack"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2007 |title=Art Attack. |journal=Parks &amp; Recreation |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=76 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=26159470&amp;site=ehost-live |accessdate=5 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of the artwork lies along the White River, further into the ARTSPARK.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARKMap"/&gt; Words are chiseled into the vertical stones with one statement reading "My soul has grown deep like the rivers."&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"/&gt;

==Creation==

Stackhouse and Mickett created the piece in residency at the Art Center during the summer of 2004.&lt;ref name="Nuvo"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2004 | title=Q&amp;A with Dave Thomas  | work=Arts | publisher=Nuvo Newsweekly | url=http://www.nuvo.net/gyrobase/qanda-with-dave-thomas/Content?oid=1203992 | accessdate= 4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation utilized motorized [[chisel]]s, gas-powered [[saw]]s and hammers to create the columns. Stackhouse oversaw the work on the vertical stones and Mickett handled the arranging of the bases. Visitors to the Art Center were encouraged to participate by being allowed to don goggles, dust masks and gloves to contribute to the creation process. This unique opportunity to participate in the creation process was described by Art Center vice president and programming director David Thomas as being "...such a great chance to connect with people in a meaningful way, to see how an artist like this thinks and works".&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"/&gt;

==Acquisition==

This piece was the first installation acquired for the Art Center's ARTSPARK which, designed by [[Michael Graves]], brings together art and nature.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARKMap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"/&gt; The artwork was a gift from Michael and Mary Ann Browning.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARKMap"/&gt;

==Information==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The mission of the Indianapolis Art Center is to engage, enlighten, and inspire our community by providing interactive art education, outreach to underserved audiences, support of artists, and exposure to the visual arts.'' - Indianapolis Art Center Mission Statement&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Mission | work=The Center | publisher=Indianapolis Art Center | url=http://www.indplsartcenter.org/About_Us/The_Center/Mission/ | accessdate=4 April 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620101658/http://indplsartcenter.org/About_Us/The_Center/Mission/ | archivedate=20 June 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stackhouse and Mickett aimed to create an artwork that integrated "the center's mission, to make it part of its place." ''Confluence'' also seeks to represent journeying, unity and the Art Center's relationship and placement on with the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]]. The words chiseled into the stones tell stories of these subjects with some being inspired by [[Langston Hughes]]' poem "[[The Negro Speaks of Rivers]]."&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"/&gt;

'''Confucian art''' is art inspired by the writings of [[Confucius]], and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings. Confucian art originated in [[China]], then spread westwards on the [[Silk road]], southward down to [[Northern and southern China|southern China]] and then onto [[Southeast Asia]], and eastwards through [[North China|northern China]] on to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. While it still maintains a strong influence within Indonesia, Confucian influence on western art has been limited. While Confucian themes enjoyed representation in Chinese art centers, they are fewer in comparison to the number of artworks that are about or influenced by [[Taoism|Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Religious Art|last=Karetzky|first=Patricia|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2014|isbn=9780739180587|location=Lanham, MD|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Confucius was elevated to the rank of Supreme Sage and the Uncrown King (''Su Wang''), Confucian art became identified with the art of Confucius in recognition to the sage's central position in the transmission of the Chinese ancient culture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Confucianism|last=Yao|first=Xinzhong|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415515221|location=Oxon|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable elements of this art are calligraphy of Confucian writings and thoughts, often contained within [[Confucian temple]]s and [[schools]], as well as whiteware ceramics and pottery related to Confucian religious and scholarly practices. In China, [[Chinese scholar's rocks]] were part of this tradition. As most importantly the [[Korean stone art]] which continues to this day. Themes and subjects usually include the depiction of prominent Confucian figures such as statesmen, poets, and painters, among others. These are the subjects, for instance, of the paintings of [[Zhang Lu (painter)|Zhang Lu]] (1464-1538). Artworks also reflected prevailing interests during the Confucian period such as [[chess]], music, and painting in addition to the depiction of the didactic pictorial narratives of the life of Confucius and the twenty-four paragons of [[filial piety]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Confucian art is demonstrated in the Six Classics: ''[[Classic of Poetry|The Book of Odes]]'', which describes the will; the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', which describes events; ''The Book of Ritual,'' which focuses on conduct; ''[[Classic of Music|The Book of Music]]'', which is about harmony; the ''[[I Ching|Book of Changes]]'' for the concept of the [[yin and yang]]; and, [[Spring and Autumn Annals|The Spring and Autumn Annals]], which describes titles and functions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Confucian art may also be distinguished between classical early period, neo-Confucianism, and post-modern Confucian art.

== Ancient Cultivation Stories: Confucius and Ran Qiu ==

Every one of Confucius' students had his own character. Some were modest and keen to learn; some were strong and argumentative; some were cowardly and slow to improve. However, Confucius would teach each student according to his nature guiding him along the way so that he/she may become a useful and talented person.

Ran Qiu was a very talented person. He really hoped to improve his political abilities and obtain the opportunity to be promoted to become a government official after learning from Confucius.

Officials in ancient times had to understand poetry, literature, ritual, and music, only when they had a good understanding of this knowledge could they work for the people. In order to improve on these abilities to become a government official, Ran Qiu followed Confucius as his teacher and diligently studied a variety of subjects and skills.

After some time, however, Confucius found that Ran Qiu had become idle and lazy and was no longer curious to understand and discuss the principles taught in the class. Therefore, one day after the class, Confucius asked Ran Qiu the reason for this.

Ran Qiu said, "It is not that I don't like the principles that you teach. It is just because I am lacking in ability!"

In fact, Ran Qiu thought that the principles that Confucius taught were too high and were different from what he had expected them to be. Ran Qiu had only planned to learn from Confucius the abilities necessary to become a government official. Then, with the help of Confucius' reputation, he would get the chance to start his political career. But when he came to Confucius's school, he found that the principles Confucius taught seemed to be apart from society. Though the ideals were high, it was not easy to follow them in practice.

Holding such thoughts, Ran Qiu started to become lazy and felt it was useless no matter how much more he learned. In addition, Ran Qiu also attributed his poor performance in the class to his own insufficient abilities. He thought that, since he was not capable enough, he would never be able to achieve the level that Confucius was teaching, so why did he need to study carefully?

Confucius however didn't think that Ran Qiu's declining performance was due to a lack of ability. Therefore, he told Ran Qiu, "Look at those people who don't have enough ability. They usually stop and give up halfway, whereas you draw a boundary in front of yourself to restrict you from moving forward. How can you make progress that way?"

After hearing what Confucius had to say, Ran Qiu was ashamed and lowered his head. Confucius continued, "Before you fully demonstrate your ability, you should not easily give up the effort to strive forward; you shouldn't feel so desperate about yourself so easily. As long as you try your best to do everything well, you will find that you have good potential!"

After Confucius had encouraged him, Ran Qiu was again full of confidence and resumed his usual earnest learning attitude. It was after this that Ran Qiu took note of Confucius' skills as a teacher!

'''''Cry Freedom''''' is a 1987 British-South African epic drama film directed by [[Richard Attenborough]], set in late-1970s  [[apartheid]] era [[South Africa]]. The screenplay was written by [[John Briley]] based on a pair of books by journalist [[Donald Woods]]. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist [[Steve Biko]] and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. [[Denzel Washington]] stars as Biko, while actor [[Kevin Kline]] portrays Woods. ''Cry Freedom'' delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.

The film was primarily shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] and in [[Kenya]] due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. As a film showing mostly in limited cinematic release, it was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.

A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Universal Pictures]] and Marble Arch Productions. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures cinematically, and by [[MCA Home Video]] for home media. ''Cry Freedom'' premiered in cinemas nationwide in the United States on 6 November 1987 grossing $5,899,797 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was at its widest release showing in 479 cinemas nationwide. It was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas.

South African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="nyTimesCryFreedom"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/28/world/pretoria-censors-to-let-cry-freedom-be-seen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Following a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[South Africa]], liberal journalist [[Donald Woods]] (Kevin Kline) seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet black activist [[Steve Biko]] (Denzel Washington). Biko has been officially [[banning order|''banned'']] by the [[South African government]] and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at [[King William's Town]]. Woods is formally against Biko's banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.

After speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by South African security forces. Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African government. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalize the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with [[Jimmy Kruger]] ([[John Thaw]]), the South African Minister of Justice in his house in [[Pretoria]] in an attempt to prevent further abuse by the security force. Kruger first expresses discontent over the actions of security force, however Woods is later harassed by security forces at his home. The security men that harass Woods insinuate that their orders to visit Woods came directly from Kruger.

Later, Biko decides to travel to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. En route, security forces stop his car and arrest him. He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1&amp;nbsp;020&amp;nbsp;km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.

Woods then works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko's body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now banned, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], disguised as a priest. His wife Wendy ([[Penelope Wilton]]) and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist [[Bruce Haigh]] ([[John Hargreaves (actor)|John Hargreaves]]), the [[British High Commission]] in Maseru, and the [[Government of Lesotho]], they are flown under [[United Nations Laissez-Passer|United Nations passports]] and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via [[Botswana]] to [[London]], where they were granted [[political asylum]].

The film's epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the government.

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|thumb|right|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa in the late 1970s.]]
The premise of ''Cry Freedom'' is based on the true story of [[Steve Biko]], the charismatic South African [[Black Consciousness Movement]] leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of [[Apartheid]]; and [[Donald Woods]], the [[Liberalism in South Africa|liberal]] white editor of the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered. In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the [[Black People's Convention]] working on social upliftment projects around Durban.&lt;ref name=aboutAfrican&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/stevebiko/a/bio-Biko.htm |title=Stephen Bantu (Steve) Biko |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student's Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognized under the Apartheid regime.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; Biko's political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt; The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody. The circumstances leading to Biko's death caused worldwide anger, as he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; As a result, the South African government banned a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organizations, especially those closely associated with Biko.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; The United Nations Security Council responded swiftly to the killing by later imposing an arms embargo against South Africa.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; After a period of routine harassment against his family by the authorities, as well as fearing for his life,&lt;ref name=BBCuk /&gt; Woods fled the country after being placed under house arrest by the South African government.&lt;ref name=BBCuk&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/1/newsid_2459000/2459845.stm 1978: Newspaper editor flees South Africa]. [[BBC]]. Retrieved 20 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Woods later wrote a book in 1978 entitled: ''[[Biko (book)|Biko]]'', exposing police complicity in his death.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt; That book, along with Woods's autobiography ''Asking For Trouble'', both being published in the UK, became the basis for the film.&lt;ref name=SouthAfricanHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/bios/biko-s.htm |title=Stephen Bantu Biko |publisher=South African History Online |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Principal filming took place primarily in the Republic of [[Zimbabwe]] because of the tense political situation in South Africa at the time of shooting. Other filming locations included [[Kenya]], as well as film studios in [[Shepperton, England|Shepperton]] and [[Middlesex, England]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Attenborough|Attenborough, Richard]] (Director).

Indiscriminate firing by police killed and injured hundreds of African schoolchildren during a protest march.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt;

===Music===
The original motion picture soundtrack for ''Cry Freedom'' was released by [[MCA Records]] on 25 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5E |title=Cry Freedom: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |accessdate=2010-06-15 |publisher=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features songs composed by veteran musicians [[George Fenton]], [[Jonas Gwangwa]] and Thuli Dumakude. At Biko's funeral they sing the hymn [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]].

Rita Kempley, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', said actor Washington gave a "zealous, Oscar-caliber performance as this African messiah, who was recognized as one of South Africa's major political voices when he was only 25."&lt;ref&gt;Kempley, Rita (6 November 1987).

But on a negative front, he noted how the film "promises to be an honest account of the turmoil in South Africa but turns into a routine cliff-hanger about the editor's flight across the border.

[[Janet Maslin]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw the film as "bewildering at some points and ineffectual at others" but pointed out that "it isn't dull.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2005">The '''Foundation for Asian American Independent Media''' is an arts education organization based in Chicago that focuses on Asian American art, history, and issues and hosts an annual Asian American Showcase.

== History ==
The Foundation for Asian American Independent Media (FAAIM) was founded in 1995 by journalist [[Ben Kim]], and musicians [[Sooyoung Park]] and [[William Shin]]. Known then as Fortune4, the organization’s first project was a New York Times- and MTV-lauded recording and subsequent tour of Asian American rock bands, entitled Ear of the Dragon. In 1996, the group created the Annual Chicago Asian American Showcase (the Showcase), the nation’s only film festival dedicated exclusively to Asian American film. Incorporated as a not-for-profit in 1999, FAAIM works with other cultural institutions in Chicago on Asian-American media and education.

Since 2001 [[Tim Hugh]] has been the Executive Director of FAAIM. Other members include [[Vincent Chung]] and [[Larry Lee (artist)|Larry Lee]].

== Asian American Showcase ==
The Asian American Showcase is an annual film festival based in Chicago originally held at the Film Center at SAIC (now called the Gene Siskel Film Center). The Asian American Showcase exhibits independent films created by or about Asian Americans, as well as other media such as writing and music.

'''French furniture''' comprises both the most sophisticated furniture made in [[Paris]] for king and court, aristocrats and rich upper bourgeoisie, on the one hand, and [[French provincial furniture]] made in the provincial cities and towns many of which, like [[Lyon]] and [[Liège]], retained cultural identities distinct from the metropolis. There was also a conservative artisanal rural tradition of '''French country furniture''' which remained unbroken until the advent of the railroads in the mid-nineteenth century.

==Provincial furniture==
Furniture made in provincial centers such as [[Blois]] and [[Orléans]] in the Loire valley, and at [[Lyon]] or [[Liège]] (Not part of France politically but within its cultural orbit), followed at some distance the design innovations that were initiated in the luxury trades of Paris, often with a time lag that could amount to decades.

Features typically associated with French Provincial furniture include [[cabriole leg]]s, and simple scalloped carving. Dining chairs often have a wheat pattern carving reflecting the country surroundings of the maker. The ladder back chair with a woven rush seat is the typical French Provincial dining chair. Finishes vary though common to all colours is the accumulation of polish or grime in the carving over time resulting in an aged patina and emphasis on the carving regardless of whether the furniture is painted or stained.

==Parisian furniture==
In the metropolitan [[culture of France]], ''French furniture'', connoting '''Parisian furniture''', embodies one of the mainstreams of design in the [[decorative arts]] of Europe, extending its influence from Spain to Sweden and Russia, from the late seventeenth century to the last craft traditions in workshops like [[Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann]], which came to an end only with the Second World War. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, French furniture of the classic period 1660-1815, has been collected as passionately by non-French ''amateurs'', with the English in the historical lead,&lt;ref&gt;Much of the French furniture in the Royal Collection was purchased by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], beginning with his furnishing of [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], London.&lt;/ref&gt; and has set record prices consistently, since the Hamilton Palace sale of 1882,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonancestor.com/newspaper/1882/0715/hamilton-palace-sale.htm The Hamilton Palace Sale]&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that it is represented in many national museums.

In Paris, an unbroken tradition of [[apprenticeship]], already fully formed when the design center for luxury furnishings shifted from [[Antwerp]] to Paris in the 1630s, was slowly disrupted by the [[Industrial Revolution]] after the mid-nineteenth century. Perhaps the last of the Parisian ''[[ébéniste]]s'' working from a traditional atelier was [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann]] (1879-1933).

==French royal furniture==
The grand tradition of '''French royal furniture''' received its impetus from the establishment of the ''[[Gobelins Manufactory|Manufacture royale des Gobelins]]'' under the organisation of the arts in the service of [[Louis XIV of France]] that was controlled and directed by his minister of finance, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]].  Favoured craftsmen would be eligible for premises in the galleries of the [[Palais du Louvre]], a practice that had been initiated on a small scale under [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]]. At the Gobelins, much more than [[tapestry]] was made for the furnishing of the royal palaces and the occasional ambassadorial gift: the celebrated silver furnishings for the ''[[Galerie des Glaces]]'' at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] was produced by silversmiths working to designs by [[Charles Le Brun]] at the Gobelins.
[[Image:Chateau de Talcy interieur 03.JPG|thumb|Mid-18th century "Louis XV" seat furniture, with integrated flowing lines, and a lacquer-veneered Parisian [[commode]], mounted in gilt bronze, ([[Château de Talcy]])]]
In Paris, the furniture trade was divided among [[Guild#European history|craft guild]]s with jealous regard for infringements. ''[[Menuisier]]s'' were solely occupied with carved furnishings, which included beds and all seat furniture, as they were for the carved ''[[boiserie]]s'' of the interiors they were destined to occupy. Carvers and [[gilding|gilders]] worked directly for them. ''[[Ébéniste]]s'', who drew their name from the [[ebony]] that they worked into cabinets that were carved in shallow relief and incorporated veneers of [[tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]] and [[ivory]], a specialty of Paris furniture in the mid-seventeenth century, retained their control over all carcase furniture that was intended to be veneered, often with elaborate [[marquetry]]. The bronze mounts that decorated these high-style case-pieces, from the 1660s to the abolition of guilds in the [[French Revolution]], was furnished, and even carried to the ébéniste's workshop by separate guilds of foundrymen.

[[File:LatzEncoignure.JPG|left|thumb|300px|An [[encoignure]] by royal cabinetmaker [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] circa 1750 is richly ornamented with [[marquetry]] and [[ormolu]].]] 
French furniture of the [[Ancien Régime]], often characterised by dealers and collectors by reign-names, as "[[Louis Quinze]] furniture", etc., can be seen as representative, even formative, manifestations of broader European styles: French Gothic furniture, of which so little has survived; French Renaissance furniture of the sixteenth century; Early Baroque furniture associated with Louis XIII, comparable to what was produced at Antwerp; sculptural and tectonic High Baroque furniture associated with Louis XIV; Rococo furniture, associated with the [[Régence]] and the reign of Louis XV; and Neoclassical furniture, associated with Louis XVI.

French furniture of the Revolution and the [[First French Empire]] is imbued with a more severe, self-consciously archaeological phase of [[Neoclassicism]], which began to lose its grip on styles in the 1830s, with Gothic and Rococo revivals, leading to the eclecticism of the [[French Second Empire]]. [[Art Nouveau]] provided one form of reaction to the battle of the [[historicism (art)|historicist styles]], and [[Modernism]] marked a more rigorous break with the past. [[Art Deco]] offered a decorative version of Modernism.

Since the Second World War, the manufacture of furniture in France, devolved from the prominence of the capital itself, has been part of the increasingly international world of [[industrial design]].

[[File:Angel Men (1413014127).jpg|thumb|right|One example of a gourmand scent is Thierry Mugler's ''A*Men''.]]

A '''gourmand fragrance''' is a [[perfume]] consisting primarily of synthetic edible ([[gourmand]]) notes, such as [[honey]], [[chocolate]], [[vanilla]] or [[candy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vosnaki, Elena. [http://www.fragrantica.com/news/The-Lure-of-Gourmand-Fragrances-Delicious-Indulgences-3986.html "Lure of Gourmand Fragrances: Delicious Indulgences"], ''Fragrantica.com'' Retrieved on 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Michael. ''Fragrances of the World'' [http://theposhpeasant.com/pages/helpfulscentguide.htm/ "Helpful Scent Guide"]''ThePoshPeasant.com''&lt;/ref&gt; These top and middle notes may be blended with non-edible base notes such as [[patchouli]] or [[musk]]. They have been described as olfactory desserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boisdejasmin.com/2011/08/olfactory_desserts_gourmand_fragrances.html |title=Olfactory Desserts : On Gourmand Fragrances « Bois de Jasmin |publisher=Boisdejasmin.com |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also called "foodie" fragrances and can be both feminine and masculine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Thierry Mugler]]'s ''[[Angel (perfume)|Angel]]'', launched in 1992, is credited as the first modern gourmand scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wischhover |first=Cheryl |url=http://fashionista.com/2013/02/thierry-muglers-angel-perfume-celebrates-20-years-in-the-us-a-look-back-at-the-scent-and-the-fashion-behind-it/ |title=Thierry Mugler’s Angel Perfume Celebrates 20 Years in the US: A Look Back at the Scent and the Fashion Behind It |publisher=Fashionista |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/fashion/02MUGLER.html|title=Thierry Mugler, a Designer Transformed|last=Wilson|first=Eric|date=2010-04-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional examples include Mugler's ''A*Men'', [[Lolita Lempicka|Lolita Lempicka's]] ''Lolita Lempicka'' and ''Au Masculin'', [[Hanae Mori|Hanae Mori's]] ''Butterfly'', [[Calvin Klein|Calvin Klein's]] ''Euphoria'', [[Burberry|Burberry's]] ''Brit for Men'', [[Rochas|Rochas']] ''Rochas Man'', [[Chopard|Chopard's]] ''Wish'' and [[Viktor &amp; Rolf|Viktor &amp; Rolf's]] ''Antidote''. 

The gourmand trend has steadily increased in popularity since 1992 but is not a new concept. In 1956, Edmond Roundnitska created ''Diorissimo'' to counter the contemporary preference for heavy and sweet notes which are common in gourmand perfumes.&lt;ref&gt;Robin.

Most gourmand scents, such as those in the form of bath products, perfume or cologne, are not intended for human consumption. Other gourmand scents are not only scented but flavoured, such as Amoretti's line of products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amoretti.com/amoretti/Edible%20Perfumes/19/1 |title=Amoretti® Ingredients and Flavors &amp;#124; Products |publisher=Amoretti.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202184125/http://www.amoretti.com/amoretti/Edible%20Perfumes/19/1 |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jessica Simpson]]'s discontinued ''Dessert Treats''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/desserttreatsrock/ |title=Dessert Treats Rock |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scented products include other forms such as lip glosses, dusting powders and lotions.

Gourmand is considered a subcategory of the modern family of fragrance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theperfumedcourt.com/fragrance_families.aspx The Perfumed Court: Fragrance families] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202092313/http://theperfumedcourt.com/fragrance_families.aspx |date=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gourmands may also work in combination with the fruity family of fragrance.

'''''Idle Woman''''' (Spanish: '''''La Perezosa''''') is a [[genre painting]] completed in [[oil on canvas]] by Peruvian painter [[Daniel Hernández Morillo]] in 1 [[Lima]], Peru.

==Background and creation==
[[Daniel Hernández Morillo]], a Peruvian student of itinerant Italian painter [[Leonardo Barbieri]], left his homeland for [[Europe]] in 1874. Although Europe was in the midst of an artistic renewal, Morillo remained influenced by the [[academic art]] movement and French [[rococo painting]]. This is reflected in the pastel tones and the lightness of ''Idle Woman'', which was completed in 1906.&lt;ref name="Google"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perezosa (Idle Woman) |publisher=Google Cultural Institute |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/perezosa-idle-woman/jAEkd6RCpUcwuQ |accessdate=20 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Oy9o5Cw1?url=http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/perezosa-idle-woman/jAEkd6RCpUcwuQ |archivedate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting is currently held by the [[Museo de Arte de Lima]], in [[Lima]], Peru.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt;

[[File:SNGCop 491.jpg|290px|thumb|right|Coins of King [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]] - 280&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
'''Illyrian coinage''' which began in the 6th century BC continued up to the 1st century of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule. It was the southern [[Illyrians]] who minted the first coins followed by the northern Illyrian during the Roman era. Illyrian coins have also been found in other areas apart from [[Illyria]], such ancient [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonia]], Italy, Greece, [[Asia Minor]] and Egypt.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Early coins==

The earliest Illyrian coins were probably minted by the Tyntenoi north of [[Lake Ohrid]] minted coins around 540&amp;nbsp;BC with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] legend [[Tynteni]]. Their silver coins reached Italy, [[Egypt]] and many parts of [[Asia]]. They belonged to the group of '[[Thraco-Macedonian]]' coinages of this period, and they bore the same emblems as the coins of [[Ichnae]] at the head of the [[Thermaic Gulf]]. Production ceased in the early 5th century BC, most likely in 475&amp;nbsp;BC when this period was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost with mainland Greece and relations with Ionia via the [[Danube]] valley slackened.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Macedonia: 550–336 BC by Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond, Guy Thompson Griffith, page 93 ^ The Cambridge ancient history: The fourth century BC by D. M. Lewis, John Boardman,1994, page 427, "The silver coinage of the Tynteni ceased early in the fifth century. The period after 475 was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Messapians]] in southern [[Italy]] minted coins in the early 5th century BC. They were an early imitation of the Greek coins from [[Magna Grecia]]. The cities which minted these early mints were Valesio, [[Brindisi]], [[Nardò]], [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]], Ugento, Grax and Samadi. Valesio struck silver coins, Nardò silver and bronze while from the 3rd century BC only bronze coins were issued. The coins feature Lapagus, an ancient [[Iapygian]] hero. Other features included [[Athena]], [[Heracles]] and [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Messapi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the Messapians, the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] tribe of the [[Derrones]] were also producing coins. These coins are traditionally dated to 500&amp;nbsp;BC – 450&amp;nbsp;BC. Frequent depictions on the coins attributed to the Derrones are Oxen and Corinthian helmets. Their god, Darr(h)on, was worshipped by Paionians and Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Derivation of the Greek Word Paean |author=Grace H. Macurdy |journal=Language|volume=6 |issue=4 |date=December 1930|pages=297–303 |jstor=409430 |doi=10.2307/409430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wildwinds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/thraco_macedonian_tribes/derrones/t.html|publisher=wildwinds.com|title=Thraco Macedonian Tribes, Derrones, ancient coins index with thumbnails - WildWinds.com|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paeonian kings dealt greatly and seriously with the minting coins. However this activity in terms of quality and appearance did not differ much from Greek coins. Even the Paeonians themselves at this time were becoming hellenized more and more and lost to a great degree their characteristic as a non-Greek people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Illyrian coins in Illyria were minted from the start of the 4th century BC in the [[List of ancient cities in Illyria|Illyrian city]] of [[Damastion]] and Daparria&lt;ref name="wildwinds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/illyria/damastion/i.html|publisher=wildwinds.com|title=Illyria, Damastion - Ancient Greek Coins - WildWinds.com|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrian tribe]] of the [[Dyestes]] under [[Bardylis]], which had been influenced by [[Hellenization]] to an extent. For about 200 years, this city minted silver coins with symbols imitating those of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] cities in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], as well as original symbols such as tongs of a metal smelter. The circulation of Damastion coins included [[Kosovo]], southern [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and the [[Adriatic]] coast from [[Shkodër]] to [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. The presence of silver mines around the city in ancient sources made it possible for the minting of coins in such a great abundance.

==Illyrian kings==
[[File:NBHM-Rezhantsi-Treasure-Silver-tetradrachms-of-Patraus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]]s dated back to the reign of Patraus.]]
The only kings to have minted coins bearing their names were [[Lycceius]], [[Patraus]], [[Audoleon]], [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]], [[Mytilus of Illyria|Mytilus]], [[Gentius]] and [[Ballaios]].

===Patraus===
The coinage of Patraus is remarkable. They have on the obverse a head of [[Apollo]], which may be in allusion to the king's name, Apollo being known under the name of Patraus. On the reverse of the coins is a horseman riding over an enemy, in allusion to triumphs over the Macedonians and an inscription of the king.&lt;ref&gt;The Coin collector's manual, or Guide to the numismatic student in the ... By Henry Noel Humphreys page92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audoleon===
The coins of Audoleon have a head wearing a Corinthian helmet on the obverse and on the reverse a horse stepping, very boldly executed and the inscription of the king.

===Monunius===
[[File:Silver stater, Apollonia, 340-280 BC.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]'s coin. A cow and a suckling calf. Reverse: double stellate pattern within dual linear border and the inscription A Π O Λ around.]] 
The first [[Dardani]]an king to have minted silver coins was [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]] in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, around 280&amp;nbsp;BC. He struck his coins in the Greek colony of [[Durrës]] and they differed only in having the jaw of a boar set over the cow, as a symbol of the royal Illyrian house. The coins also had the abbreviated inscription 'ΔYP' (for Durrës) to donate the place where they were minted, as well as showing royal sovereignty over the city. These coins have been found in great numbers in the Illyrian city of [[Gurazez|Gurëzeza]], and in the interior of [[Albania]] beyond [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. The Illyrian kingdom under Monunius extended as far as the [[Lyncestian]] Lakes, and from here Monunius could have intervened in the quarrel about the Macedonian throne, eventually turning into a claimant for it. This surely is the meaning of the minting of a second series of silver coins bearing his name and traditional Macedonian symbols, the head of [[Heracles]] on the face and on the reverse, Olympian [[Zeus]] sitting on his throne. That this, was a short lived dream of the Illyrian king is shown by the fact that so few coins were minted, so much that only one specimen is preserved today.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] 2005, p.114 {{ISBN|99943-672-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mytilus===
[[Mytilus of Illyria|Mytilus]], the successor of King Monunius, struck his coins 10 years later around 270&amp;nbsp;BC. His bronze coinage with the symbols of the city of [[Durrës]] in Albania bear his name. The coinage of Apollonia in the same period bore only his monogram, as well as symbols similar to those of the [[Aetolian League]].&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] 2005, {{ISBN|99943-672-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentius===
[[File:Face of King Gentius on Ancient Illyrian coin.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Gentius]] on a bronze coin.]]
The most productive conage is of [[Gentius]] who ruled from 181&amp;nbsp;BC. Two of his mints were located in [[Shkodra]], the ancient Illyrian capital at the time of his regn, and in [[Lezha]], both located in modern-day north-eastern Albania. His coins were also struck in [[Durrës]], where the royal title is absent from any silver coin, and the name Gentius, not uncommon to an Illyrian male, may belong not to the king but to a local magistrate. However, around 30 to 40 examples of bronze coins have been recorded with the legend 'King Genthios'. Upon his defeat by the Romans in 168&amp;nbsp;BC his treasury of 120,000 silver pieces were conveyed to [[Rome]].

===Ballaios===
[[File:Balajos.jpg|thumb|upright| King [[Ballaios]] on a bronze coin.]]
[[Ballaios]] reigned after the kingdom of Gentius was dissolved into the Roman Empire from around 167&amp;nbsp;BC – 135&amp;nbsp;BC. The abundance of the coinage of Ballaios in the region would suggest that he was a powerful and influential king although no literary of historical evidence of him exists. The coins of the well-known king Gentius are scarce in comparison to the coins of Ballaios. His silver issues are rare, but bronze coins (without the royal title) occur on [[Hvar]] in [[Croatia]], both in single finds and in hoards, and at [[Rhizon]], the ancient capital of Queen [[Teuta]], in a different series bearing the royal title. The coins of Ballaios were widely imitated in the region, sometimes so crudely that they are unintelligible. Ballaios struck coins in two cities: [[Hvar|Pharos]] and Rhizon. The weight of the bronze coins are between 1.0 and 4.5&amp;nbsp;g, while most of the documented specimens weigh between 2.0 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;g. The relativity great impact of the coinage of Ballaios is indicated by a large number of imitations of his coins. His coins are found in both the eastern Adriatic shores and frequently in Italy, which confirms the trade contacts between the two Adriatic coasts.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Épire, Illyrie, Macédoine: mélanges offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes|author1=Cabanes, P.|author2=Berranger, D.|author3=Centre de recherches sur les civilisations antiques|date=2007|publisher=Presses universitaires Blaise Pascal|isbn=9782845163515|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=I_kFU6h77ssC&amp;pg=PA129|page=129|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Illyria: An Archaeological Exploration|author1=Evans, A.|author2=Destani, B.D.|date=2006|publisher=I.

On the obverse of his coins a bust of the king facing left to right is depicted, while on the reverse [[Artemis]] (advancing or standing) is represented, with or without a torch and sometimes carrying one or two spears. It is significant that Ballaios also had [[silver]] coins minted, which indicates his wealth and power, since elsewhere in [[Dalmatia]], silver coinage is very rarely documented from the Greek and Illyrian mints.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"/&gt;

==City coins==

[[File:Monedha Labeate.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shkodër|Shkodra]]'s coin with the inscription: 'SKOΔRI-NΩN'.]]
The coins of ancient Lissus, modern-day [[Lezha]], with the legend 'LISSITAN' began with autonomous issues under the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] influences (211&amp;nbsp;BC – 197&amp;nbsp;BC). The coins were followed later by the issues of Gentius with a ship on the reverse and a third series from the period after the kings removal. Lissus minted coins on behalf of the community of the Lissians and minted a rare coin with an inscription over the head of an Illyrian god wearing a causia type hat. The face depicted on the Lissian coins was originally though to be of King [[Gentius]], although Albanian archaeologist, [[Hasan Ceka]] was proved it to by the head of the Illyrian sea god, [[Rodon (Illyrian god)|Rodon]]. The head of [[Artemis]] and an Illyrian shield is depicted on some Lissian coins. The Shkodra coins fall into three similar groups, the first and third with the legend 'SKODRI-NON' and the second with the legend of king Gentius. In the city of Rhizon a mint was established that issued several coinages. These incleded autonomous coinages of the town, in bronze, the royal coinage of king Ballaios, in silver and bronze, most probably, the coinage labeled “Coinage from the [[Bay of Kotor|Rhizonian Gulf]]”, which has been considered as the coinage of an alliance in which [[Rhizon]] played a part, in silver and bronze.

[[File:Daorson Coin.jpg|thumb|[[Daorson]] coin with a galley on the reverse.]]
The chronology of these coinages is still not defined with precision, primarily because the historical background of their issuance remains little known. There is hardly any mention in the literary sources of the town of Rhizon, and none of the king Ballaios. However, several features of these coinages - such as the characteristics of style, elements of inscription and iconography (especially the presence of the title “basileus” on the coinage of Ballaios, and the presence of a Macedonian shield on the “Coinage from the Rhizonian Gulf”), metrology, choice of coined metals, etc. – point to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE as the general chronological framework for the activity of the Rhizonian mint and for the successive issuance of the coinages of different issuing authorities there. Around [[Lake Scutari]] the [[Labeates]] issued a rare type of bronze coin, bearing the head of an Illyrian deity and a [[Liburnian warship]] with a dolphin swimming underneath. Between 217&amp;nbsp;BC and 84&amp;nbsp;BC the city of [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]] in Italy minted coins with the head of Lapagus, the ancient Iapygian hero. In [[Daorson]] the capital of the Daorsi in modern [[Bosnia]], 39 different coins (29 bearing the image of King [[Ballaios]] from 168&amp;nbsp;BC, and 9 with a Greek inscription and a boat image) have been discovered.&lt;ref name="coe" &gt;http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/regional/see/IRPPSAAH/PTA%20Ljubljana/BH_22-PTA-APPROVED_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Money was of immense importance to the Daorsi, ensuring the tribe's independence while also confirming their well developed business, cultural and trade links with other peoples.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illyrians|author=Wilkes, J.|date=1996|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780631198079|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&amp;pg=PA177|page=177|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Illyrian coins also appeare in other ancient cities especially those in the south of Illyria, such as in the Illyrian/Greek cities of [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Pelion (Chaonia)|Pelion]] and [[Olympe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John J.|title=The Illyrians|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1995|isbn=0-631-19807-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The koinon of the [[Bylliones]] centred on the city of [[Byllis]] minted its own bronze coins. The first coins came out around 270&amp;nbsp;BC and continued until 167&amp;nbsp;BC when the Romans dissolved the koinon.&lt;ref name="albca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1434|publisher=albca.com|title=www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1434|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9042">'''Jan Gaykema Jacobsz.''' (11 March 1798 – 16 July 1875) was a Dutch [[Painting|painter]], [[drawing|draughtsman]] and [[botanical illustrator]].

== Birth ==
Jan Gaykema Jacobsz. was born at the Wagenweg, in a part of the village of [[Heemstede]] that would be annexed in the 1830s into the town of [[Haarlem]]. His father Jacob Gaykema was descended from a line of [[carpenter]]s and [[Superintendent (construction)|construction superintendents]], who were originally medieval [[Freehold (law)|freeholders]] from the Dutch province of [[Friesland]]. Mother Anna Cornelia van Scherpenseel had a [[Gelderland]]/[[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] background. The infant was christened the same month at the protestant [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem|Grote or Bavokerk]] in Haarlem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bos-Bliek|Bos-Bliek, ''Onze voorouders II'']], passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Trained by different teachers, very likely including paternal uncle Haarlem house painter [[Joost Hendrik Hüne]], topographic artist [[Jan Pannebakker]] (1755-before 1834) and flower painter [[Wybrand Hendriks]] (1744-1831), he refined his art training also at the Haarlem society [[Kunstmin en Vlijt]], which would have been founded by the latter artist. After the years at Kunstmin en Vlijt (1816-1818), Jan worked for more than half a century as an art teacher and as a painter and draughtsman of plants in [[Leiden]], and the then village [[Leiderdorp]]. In the years 1824-1837, his paintings were shown at exhibitions of modern masters held in [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]] and Haarlem. During the first exhibition year, he exhibited in Haarlem, together with the at that time already very elderly Wybrand Hendriks.

== Marriage ==
[[File:Jan Gaykema Jacobsz signature.jpg|thumb|Signature under the birth certificate of his son Jan, Leiderdorp, 22 November 1833.]] Two years after the completion of his training, Jan Gaykema got married in Haarlem on 24 January 1821, to Maria Elisabeth van Zutphen, one of the daughters of a master house painter and glassmaker on the Lange Begijnestraat near the Grote or Bavokerk. After marriage, Jan and his wife settled in the city of Leiden. Maria Elisabeth would, in a period of twenty years, give birth to fourteen children, of which eight would reach maturity. In the years 1833-1854, Jan and his family lived at a [[pleasure garden]] in what was then Leiderdorp, just outside the Leiden [[gatehouse]] Marepoort, which he rented from a Leiden textile manufacturer. Back in Leiden, in an advertisement in the ''Leydsche Courant'' of October 1855, he offered his services to youth and probably also to adults as a teacher specialized in flower drawing and painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LYC/1855-10-08/edition/0/page/4 ''Leydsche Courant'', 8 October 1855, p. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body of work ==
[[File:Alstroemeria and Gypsophila by Gaykema.jpg|thumb|Study in pencil and watercolor of the [[Papaver somniferum]] and specimens of the [[Alstroemeria]], [[Gypsophila]] and an unidentified plant, neither with monogram nor signed, probably about 1865]] Images in private property and catalogue descriptions of oil paintings and botanical drawings inform us of his oeuvre as a botanical artist. Heritage institutions which have Gaykema's work in their collections are [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]] in Leiden,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioportal.naturalis.nl BioPortal] of [http://www.naturalis.nl Naturalis Biodiversity Center], [http://bioportal.naturalis.nl/nba/result?theme=arts Arts Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/kunst/tvb-t-285-meloenen Teylers Museum, nr TvB T 285].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gelders Archief]] in Arnhem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hoek|Gelders Archief, Family archives Hoek]], inv.nr 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illustrations for ''Kruidkunde'' ===
In 1839-1842 Gaykema made a series of botanical drawings for the scientific survey work on the [[botany]] and [[zoology]] of the [[Dutch East Indies]], published as ''Verhandelingen over de natuurlijke geschiedenis der Nederlandsche overzeesche bezittingen'' by the [[Natuurkundige Commissie voor Nederlands-Indië]] (Natural Sciences Commission for the Dutch East Indies). The volume ''Kruidkunde'',&lt;ref&gt;''Botanie'' on the first, ''Kruidkunde'' on the second title page, available in color at [https://archive.org/details/Verhandelingeno2Temm archive.org] or, with extra metadata, at [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/114730 Biodiversity Heritage Library].&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Pieter Willem Korthals]], contains illustrations of more than fifty, until then in [[Europe]] still unknown plants, for which Gaykema made the mostly [[Watercolor painting|watercolored]] drawings. Both the original drawings and  hand-coloured copies of the [[Lithography|lithographs]] are part of the collections of Naturalis, which donated images to the Dutch heritage web portal [[Het Geheugen van Nederland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/en/geheugen/results?query=j.+gaijkema&amp;coll=ngvn Het Geheugen van Nederland, name of creator = J. Gaijkema].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wikimedia Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Naturalis|Naturalis GLAM project]], category [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Icones_art_collection_at_Naturalis_Biodiversity_Center Icones art collection at Naturalis Biodiversity Center], search [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=ga*kema+naturalis work of Jan Gaykema]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illustrations for ''Annales'' ===
Fifteen years later, in 1859, Jan Gaykema was able to become the main illustrator of the new international magazine ''Annales d'horticulture et de botanique, ou Flore des jardins du royaume des Pays-Bas, et histoire des plantes cultivées et ornementales les plus intéressantes des possessions néerlandaises aux Indes orientales, en Amérique et du Japon''. This was a publication of the [[Koninklijke Nederlandsche Maatschappij tot Aanmoediging van den Tuinbouw]] (Royal Dutch Horticultural Society), edited by professor [[Willem Hendrik de Vriese]], the famous collector of Japanese plants nobleman dr [[Philipp Franz von Siebold|Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold]], and university [[head gardener]] [[Heinrich Witte]]. In its short period of existence Gaykema - whether or not he drew them from life in the Leiden [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]] - made nearly thirty colored plant drawings, of which the [[Ghent]] artist [[Louis-Constantin Stroobant]] (1815-1874) made engravings on stone, which were printed in color with the latest techniques by the company of this [[Lithography|lithographer]]. The printed text was provided by the Leiden printing company [[Luitingh-Sijthoff|A.W. Sijthoff]], which was still young at that time. After the death of professor De Vriese in 1862 the publication of the magazine was stopped.&lt;ref&gt;Published were vol. 1 (1858) until 5 (1862), of which vol. 2-4 are available in color at [https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%28%22Annales+d%27horticulture+et+de+botanique%22%29&amp;and%5B%5D=collection%3A%22NY_Botanical_Garden%22 archive.org] or, with extra metadata, at [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/3662 Biodiversity Heritage Library].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life’s end ==
Gaykema, while still working as an art teacher, died 77 years old, on 16 July 1875, at his home at Noordeinde 53, Leiden, near the corner with the Rapenburg. His remains were buried on the morning of 19 July, at the Leiden reformed cemetery Het Groote Bolwerk. Widow Maria Elisabeth outlived her husband by six years, and in 1881 died in [[Zoeterwoude]], a village adjacent to Leiden.

This is a list of the ''[[Imaginary Conversations]]'' of [[Walter Savage Landor]], a series of dialogues of historical and mythical characters. It follows the retrospective order and arrangement of the five-volume collection, chosen by Landor himself and to be found in his ''Collected Works''. These were then published separately (1883).

The original spelling and use of honorifics and titles is retained, but some names are made fuller in order to disambiguate.

==List==
===19th century===

*''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' ([[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]], 1863): written in prison in four months by a literary critic and radical, ''What Is To Be Done?'' advocates the creation of small socialist cooperatives based on the Russian peasant commune, but oriented toward industrial production. The author promoted the idea that the intellectual's duty was to educate and lead the laboring masses in Russia along a path to [[socialism]] that bypassed [[capitalism]]. The book inspired many [[Bolsheviks]], including [[Vladimir Lenin]], who wrote [[What Is To Be Done?|a pamphlet with the same title]] in 1901. However, it is not a masterwork of prose: Mark Schrad observed in ''Vodka Politics'' that "there is no real plotline or tension, and the environment and characters are stagnant.

*''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]'' ([[Bram Stoker]], 1911): a horror novel revolving around a remote area of England haunted by a gigantic worm. The novel was badly received by historians of the horror genre. [[H. P.

Lovecraft, ''Supernatural Horror in Literature''. Reprinted in Stephen Jones &amp; Dave Carson (eds.) ''The World's Greatest Horror Stories''. New York : Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 2004.  {{ISBN|9780760754665}} (p.45)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Les Daniels]] criticised the "clumsy style" of the novel, and expressed disappointment that the author of the acclaimed ''[[Dracula]]'' could also write what Daniels regarded as a poor novel.&lt;ref&gt;Les Daniels, ''Living In Fear: a history of horror in the mass media'', New York: Scribner, 1975, {{ISBN|0684143429}}, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  The horror critic R.S.

*''[[Mein Kampf]]'' ([[Adolf Hitler]], 1925): [[Autobiography]] and [[political treatise]] written in [[Landsberg Prison]] by [[Adolf Hitler]], then the leader of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]]. Hitler posits a [[Antisemitic canard|Jewish conspiracy]] to gain world leadership, speaks of the evils of [[communism]], [[Marxism]], [[parliamentary democracy]], and of the need of the German people to seize ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") from the [[Slavic peoples]] to the east. When Hitler gained control of Germany in the 1930s, the ideology expounded in ''Mein Kampf'' would lead to the [[Second World War]], the [[Holocaust]], and tens of millions of deaths.

He also suggested that the philosophy of Objectivism can be viewed as an extreme opposite to [[communism]] and said "In Rand’s newfangled way of thinking, selfishness, or at least rational self-interest, was no longer a terrible moral failing, but rather a great moral good.

'''The Liszt Collection''' contains over one million, generally nineteenth-century [[engraving]]s and images. The Liszt Collection is an international project to preserve a portrayal of history through contemporary engravings, articles and books. 

The Liszt Collection mainly covers Europe and the United States as well as other locations in the rest of the world, such as Canada, Australia, certain African countries, and South America and Asia.

The main areas of interest covered by the collection are history, society, art and culture. These areas are covered by showing geographical locations (towns, villages, counties and countries) as well as by showing various aspects of life in the nineteenth century. Ranging from topics such as politics, fashion in nineteenth-century France and social activities in the nineteenth-century German village to topics such as science, hiking in Switzerland, transport and coaches and trains crossing the country side.

In the mid-nineteenth-century [[wood engraving]] was used extensively for the speed and ease with which wood engravings could be produced. Engravings could be made within days of the event shown on the engraving. At this time very few (mainly American) painters could make a living selling their canvases and many turned to engraving to earn a living. Artists of the Liszt Collection’s engravings go from J. B. Allan,W. H. Bartlett and [[Thomas Bewick]] to [[Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum|R. Zogbaum]].

==The Liszt Lexicon==
The Liszt Collection offers an exceptional contribution to our world heritage.

This enriched content will be available, free of charge, for educational use.

==The Liszt Press==
The Liszt Collection houses an abundance of information in images and text about the nineteenth century. The information will be made available in books through the Liszt Press. The imprint will have a large list of books, focused and specialized.  Examples from the publishing list are; The Germans in Africa in 1884; Henry Landsdell, A Journey through [[Central Asia]], around 1880; British advertisements from 1884; Major Cavagnari and the rebellion in Cabul, Afghanistan 1879; The restoration of [[Ely Cathedral]] in 1856; The [[Valparaíso]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] Railway in 1856; General Sir Colin Campbell, 1856; [[East Lancashire Railway]], 1848; The French Republic’s Presidential Election in 1848; The Crimea in 1855, Bagtcheserai, The valley of Baidar and [[Woronzow]] Road; Visit of English Ships in 1855 to [[Japan]], Comprising The Sybille, Hornet and Bittern.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gizella-portrait.gif|thumb|A portrait of Gizella Schwarz in 1957 by Szikra János]] --&gt;[[File:Birth certificateweb.jpg|thumb|The birth certificate that saved Gizella Schwarz from the concentration camps¹]]
The Liszt collection’s roots lay in the [[Austria Hungary]] Empire where Gizella Schwarz (1877–1962), started to collect some ‘Liszt’ prints. These were portraits of Franz Liszt and woodcuts of the places where he lived and worked. However, her interest quickly broadened and Gizella bought prints of a great variety of subjects. Amongst many others these include butterflies and flowers, engravings of Budapest and Hungary, but also London, Paris and New York. 

On 15 October 1877, Károly Schwarz and Maria Habetler got a daughter, which they named Gizella. The baby was born in [[Körmend]], Hungary, where Gizella spent her childhood. Károly Schwarz owned the well known Schwarz Coffee House and here it was that the young Gizella met many interesting people. Körmend being a frequented stop for travellers on their way from [[Hungary]] to [[Austria]].

Gizella loved music and literature and spent her whole life reading. As family history has it, around 1880 in [[Budapest]] she even, as a little girl, met [[Franz Liszt]], the famous nineteenth-century composer. 

In 1939 she asked her birth certificate¹ from the Catholic Church in Körmend and by obtaining this certificate she saved herself from the concentration camps. The birth certificate is shown on the right and proves the validity of her origins being Roman Catholic. It is signed by the Vicar of Körmend which verifies the genuinity of the information. This is proven by his signature and stamp under the sentence: "That the certificate is in compliance with the original birth register of the Roman Catholic Church, and that I further strengthen this proof with my signature and official stamp." As it can be seen a red satisfactory tick has later been added, presumably by a German officer, to certify that her origins were indeed 'lawful'.

In 1957, Gizella was portrayed by Janos Szikra², at the age of 80, 4 years before her death.

Over the past hundred years the Liszt collection was gradually expanded and now houses over one million nineteenth-century engravings, prints and images and over two million articles.

==The Liszt Collection and image libraries==
For The Liszt Collection, a diversity of image libraries like, [[FotoLibra]], [[Alamy]], Album Archivo Fotográfico &lt;http://www.album-online.com/&gt;, Cultural Heritage Online/museum-images.com, Heritage Image Partnership Picture Library, TopFoto &lt; http://www.topfoto.co.uk/&gt; etc. offer a way of getting its collection online. The Liszt Collection is becoming a source of world heritage by the publication of the assets (image and text) as identifiable electronic publications, registered with a [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] (Digital Object Identifier) for permanent referencing and linking. One of the Liszt Collection's main aims is to be an eye-opener, showing a variety of cultures and regions, which will be now achieved through cooperating with the picture libraries.

After beginning a stage career in 1868, Litton became an [[actor-manager]] in 1871, producing plays for four years at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], including several by [[W. S. Gilbert]].  She also appeared in, and sometimes managed, other [[West End theatre]]s. In the late 1870s, Litton managed the theatre at the [[Royal Aquarium]], where she had some of her biggest acting successes, including as Lady Teazle in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' (1877), Lydia Languish in ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1878), Miss Hardcastle in ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' and Rosalind in ''[[As You Like It]]'' (both in 1879).

==Early life and career==
Litton was born in [[Hartington, Derbyshire|Hartington]], Derbyshire, but was raised in Lincolnshire, where her father Thomas Lowe was a clergyman.&lt;ref name=Banns/&gt; In 1868 she made her London stage debut at the [[Princess's Theatre]] as the title character in ''The Trial of Effie Deans'', a play by [[Dion Boucicault]], adapted from [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]''. She followed this with the leading role in Boucicault's ''Presumptive Evidence''.&lt;ref name=EraObit&gt;"Death of Miss Marie Litton", ''The Era'', 5 April 1884, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1868, at the opening of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], she played Mrs Cureton in a play by Alfred Thompson, ''On the Cards'', adapted from ''L'Escamoteur'' by Paulin Meunier.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Knight, Joseph, revised by J. Gilliland. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16790 "Litton, Marie"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 21 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; She next appeared there as Alice Renshaw in ''Uncle Dick's Darling'', by [[H. J. Byron]] (1869).  After this, she appeared for a year for Mrs Nye Chart at the [[Theatre Royal, Brighton]].&lt;ref name=DrawingRoom&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3TQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA443 "Miss Litton"], ''The Drawing Room'', March 1882, pp. 443–444&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1871 to 1874, Litton managed the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], beginning with a play by [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''[[Randall's Thumb]]''.&lt;ref name=DrawingRoom/&gt; She also produced Gilbert's ''[[Creatures of Impulse]]'', ''Great Expectations'' (adapted from the [[Dickens]] novel) and ''On Guard'', all in 1881, and ''[[The Happy Land]]'' and ''[[Haste to the Wedding#The Wedding March|The Wedding March]]'', both in 1873.&lt;ref name=DrawingRoom/&gt; Litton appeared in most of the plays that she produced, receiving favourable critical reviews for the "grace of manner" of her acting.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; At times during her tenure at the Court, she also appeared at the [[Haymarket Theatre]]; there she created the role of Zayda in Gilbert's ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873). She also briefly managed the [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre|Queen's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=DrawingRoom/&gt; She created the role of Caroline Effingham in Gilbert's ''[[Tom Cobb]]'' at the [[St James's Theatre]] in 1875, and played Mrs Montressor in ''Unequal Match'' by [[Tom Taylor]] at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boase&gt;Boase, Frederic. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_IVmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1500 "Litton, Marie"], ''Modern English Biography: I&amp;ndash;Q'' (Vol 2), Netherton and Worth, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal Aquarium and later years==
[[Image:ImperialTheatLondon.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Royal Aquarium Theatre, managed by Litton in the 1870s]]
Litton played Lady Teazle in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' (1877) at the [[Royal Aquarium]]'s theatre.&lt;ref name=EraObit/&gt; In 1878, she became the manager of that theatre (renamed the Imperial Theatre in 1879), succeeding her husband.&lt;ref name=EraObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boase/&gt; Her company there, which included the veteran actor [[Samuel Phelps]] and such other notable actors as [[Hermann Vezin]], [[Kyrle Bellew]] and [[Lionel Brough]], produced revivals of classic English comedies. There, she played Lydia Languish in ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1878) and Miss Hardcastle in ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1879) for a long run.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; She also produced there a revival of Gilbert's ''Great Expectations'' (1877),&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 257 and 605&lt;/ref&gt; the farce ''Fun in a Fog'' and ''Family Honour'' by Frank Marshall (both in 1878),&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 488 and 555&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Beaux' Stratagem]]'' by [[George Farquhar]] and ''The Poor Gentleman'' (1879).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 108, 131–32 and 392&lt;/ref&gt; She also played Olivia in ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' at the Imperial.&lt;ref name=Boase/&gt; She played Rosalind in ''[[As You Like It]]'' at the Imperial in 1879 before transferring to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], earning "universal" critical praise.&lt;ref name=DrawingRoom/&gt;

At the Gaiety in 1879, while still managing the Imperial, she managed the matinees, at which she played Peggy in [[David Garrick]]'s ''[[The Country Girl (1766 play)|The Country Girl]]''. Litton also briefly managed the new [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland and also toured the north with her Imperial company, but returned to the Drury Lane in 1881, playing Eve de Malvoisie in the melodrama ''Youth'' by [[Augustus Harris]] and Paul John Meritt. In 1882, she played the female lead in ''Son of the Soil'' and Daisy Bret in [[Herman Charles Merivale|Herman Merivale]]'s ''The Cynic'', among other works, and created the role of Vere Herbert in ''Moths'', an adaptation by [[Henry Hamilton (playwright)|Henry Hamilton]] of [[Ouida]]'s novel of the same name, at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]], her last major success.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; An obituary in ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' noted her generosity with aid, advice and friendly help to others in the theatrical profession and commented: "Her vivacity and versatility were associated with a refinement and intelligence commanding not only the admiration of playgoers, but the esteem and respect of all acquainted with her in private life."&lt;ref name=EraObit/&gt;

Litton had a long affair with the married theatre manager, William Wybrow Robertson (1831–1908), beginning by 1865, and after his wife died, they married in 1879.&lt;ref name=DrawingRoom/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boase/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Action against Truth", ''Standard'', 28 November 1878&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1882 Litton's health was declining with the cancer that would eventually kill her, and she was forced to retire, making only a few more appearances on stage. She moved with her husband and two children to [[Ascot, Berkshire]], and she died in [[South Kensington]], London, in 1884, at the age of 37.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Death of Marie Litton", ''Edinburgh Evening News'', 2 April 1884&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orthodox_pilgrim.jpg|thumb|An Eastern Orthodox woman in the [[Ukraine]] is seen wearing a dress and a [[Christian headcovering]].]]
The term '''modest fashion''' refers to a [[fashion]] trend of wearing less skin-revealing clothes. The exact interpretation of [[Modesty|'modest']] varies across cultures and countries.  There is no unambiguous interpretation as it is influenced by socio-cultural characteristics of each country. Beyond the various interpretations, all agree on the idea that modest fashion means loose clothing, comfortable dressing and covering of the body according to person's own comfort.

The term "modest" may have varied interpretations across religious boundaries and even within them. Commonalities can also exist; for example, many Christian, Jewish, and Muslim women practice the veiling of their head, with Christian women wearing a [[Christian headcovering|headcovering]], Jewish women wearing a [[tichel]], and Muslim women wearing a [[hijab]].&lt;ref name="Hunt2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Margaret|title=Women in Eighteenth Century Europe|date=11 June 2014|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|language=English|isbn=9781317883876|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“There’s a general misconception that modest clothing is inherently oppressive,” said Michelle Honig, an Orthodox Jewish fashion journalist and the keynote speaker during fashion month at [[New York University]] for the Meeting Through Modesty fashion symposium. “But if women in so-called ‘liberated countries’ still choose to cover their bodies, then they have made a choice. They have agency."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Modest fashion across religions expresses consensus that it should not be experienced as a limiting factor in style. Brands are churning out designs and collections that an orthodox Muslim, Jew, Christian, [[Hindu]] can wear in style. [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], [[H&amp;M]], and [[Uniqlo]] are just a few names that have entered the modest fashion segment, making clothes that cover most parts of the body while allowing women to experiment with the latest trends.{{when|date=August 2018}}

The '''Royal Architectural Institute of Canada''' ('''RAIC'''), also known since 2012 as '''Architecture Canada''', is a [[Canada|Canadian]] association that represents over 4,800 Canadian [[architect]]s, faculty, and graduates of Canadian schools of architecture. It acts as the voice for architecture and its practice in Canada and provides the national framework for the development and recognition of architectural excellence. The RAIC National Office is located in [[Ottawa]], Ontario.

==History==
RAIC was founded in 1907. It provided a country-level co-ordination among previously-existing provincial architectural groups.&lt;ref name="Crossman1987"&gt;Kelly Crossman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S-5WuEb2aQEC&amp;pg=PR15 Architecture in Transition: From Art to Practice, 1885-1906]''. McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP; 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-0604-6}}. p. 15–.&lt;/ref&gt; Through its journal, the organization provided information to its members about building practices and design considerations in Canada.&lt;ref name="WetherellKmet1991"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qu-WJBzJ4sIC&amp;pg=PA343 Homes in Alberta: Building, Trends, and Design, 1870-1967]''. University of Alberta; 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-88864-223-3}}. p. 343–.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, in anticipation of the confederation of Newfoundland with Canada. Architects there formed the Newfoundland Architects Association, which became a chapter of the RAIC.&lt;ref name="Mellin2011"&gt;Robert Mellin. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xhk6838sbmsC&amp;pg=PA260 Newfoundland Modern: Architecture in the Smallwood Years, 1949-1972]''. McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP; 17 October 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-3902-0}}. p. 260–.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After World War II, The RAIC made considerable efforts to develop connections and forums for collaboration between architects and members of related professions, including interior design, arts and crafts.&lt;ref name="Alfoldy2012"&gt;Sandra Alfoldy. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjYH3-zeFeQC&amp;pg=PA3 Allied Arts: Architecture and Craft in Postwar Canada]''. MQUP; 28 March 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-8682-6}}. p. 3–.&lt;/ref&gt; They also worked on developing standards of measurement in the building trades.&lt;ref name="Conferences1962"&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Building Research Institute. Conferences. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Methods of Building Cost Analysis: Report of a Program Held as Part of the BRI 1961 Fall Conferences]''. National Academies; 1962. NAP:15348. p. 61–.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000, a study of the organization's Journal showed that the publication had perpetuated gender-based stereotypes about the field of architecture.&lt;ref name="AdamsTancred2000"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=i8oVMPqR3BIC&amp;pg=PA36 Designing Women: Gender and the Architectural Profession]''. University of Toronto Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8219-0}}. p. 36–.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the RAIC signed on for [[the 2030 °Challenge]], which urges the global architecture community to adopt targets to ensure building practices are carbon-neutral by 2030.

The RAIC presents an annual festival of architecture for architects and members to network and earn continuing education credits; the 2017 festival was be held in [[Ottawa]]. The RAIC also administers a job board for members and the public.

'''Sergei Parajanov''' ({{lang-hy|Սերգեյ Փարաջանով}}; {{lang-ru|Серге́й Ио́сифович Параджа́нов}}; {{lang-ka|სერგო ფარაჯანოვი}}; {{lang-uk|Сергій Йо́сипович Параджа́нов}}; sometimes spelled '''Paradzhanov''' or '''Paradjanov'''; January 9, 1924 – July 20, 1990) was a Soviet [[film director]] and artist of Armenian descent who made significant contributions to Soviet cinematography through [[Ukrainian cinema|Ukrainian]], [[Georgian cinema|Georgian]], and [[Armenian cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0660886/ Sergei Parajanov, Biography at IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; He invented his own cinematic style, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of [[socialist realism]] (the only sanctioned art style in the USSR). This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films.

Although he started professional film-making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as "garbage". After directing ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' (renamed ''Wild Horses of Fire'' for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local (in [[Kiev]] and [[Yerevan]]) and federal ([[Goskino]]), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of [[rape]], [[homosexuality]] and [[bribery]]. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite a  pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release (he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a ''[[persona non grata]]'' in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing. Still, it required the help of influential Georgian actor [[Dodo Abashidze]] and other friends to have his last feature films greenlighted. His health seriously weakened by four years in labor camps and nine months in prison in Tbilisi, Parajanov died of [[lung cancer]] in 1990, at a time when, after almost 20 years of suppression, his films were being featured at foreign film festivals. 
In January 1988, he said in an interview, "Everyone knows that I have three Motherlands. I was born in Georgia, worked in Ukraine and I'm going to die in Armenia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/interview.html Parajanov Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;
Sergei Parajanov is buried at [[Komitas Pantheon]] in Yerevan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hush.am/index.php?route=product/hush&amp;grave_id=hush710d9f2e5366a40&amp;gcemetery=Komitas+Pantheon Parajanov's memorial tombstone at Komitas Pantheon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parajanov's films won prizes at [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]], [[Istanbul International Film Festival]], [[Nika Awards]], [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]], [[Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival]], [[São Paulo International Film Festival]] and others.

==Early life and films==
[[Image:ParajanovHouseTbilisi.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial plaque on the Parajanov family house in Tbilisi (7 Kote Meskhi St.)]]
Parajanov was born '''Sarkis Hovsepi Parajaniants''' (Սարգիս Հովսեփի Փարաջանյանց) to artistically gifted [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents, Iosif Paradjanov and Siranush Bejanova, in [[Tbilisi, Georgia]]. (The family name of Parajaniants is attested by a surviving historical document at the Sergei Parajanov Museum in Yerevan.)&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Paradzhanov and Zaven Sarkisian, ''Kaleidoskop Paradzhanov: Risunok, kollazh, assambliazh'' (Yerevan: Muzei Sergeiia Paradzhanova, 2008), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; He gained access to art from an early age. In 1945, he traveled to Moscow, enrolled in the directing department at the [[VGIK]], one of the oldest and highly respected film schools in [[Europe]], and studied under the tutelage of directors [[Igor Savchenko]] and [[Aleksandr Dovzhenko]].

In 1948 he was convicted of [[homosexuality|homosexual acts]] (which were illegal at the time in the Soviet Union) with a [[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] officer named Nikolai Mikava in Tbilisi. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released under an amnesty after three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segodnya.ua/news/851530.html Segodnya.ua]&lt;/ref&gt; In video interviews, friends and relatives contest the truthfulness of anything he was charged with. They speculate the punishment may have been a form of political retaliation for his rebellious views.

In 1950 Parajanov married his first wife, Nigyar Kerimova, in [[Moscow]]. She came from a [[Tatar|Muslim Tatar]] family and converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] to marry Parajanov. She was later murdered by her relatives because of her conversion. After her murder Parajanov left [[Russia]] for Kiev, [[Ukraine]], where he produced a few documentaries (''Dumka'', ''Golden Hands'', ''Natalia Uzhvy'') and a handful of narrative films: ''Andriesh'' (based on a fairy tale by the Moldovan writer [[Emilian Bukov]]), ''The Top Guy'' (a [[kolkhoz]] musical), ''Ukrainian Rhapsody'' (a wartime melodrama), and ''[[Flower on the Stone]]'' (about a religious cult infiltrating a mining town in the [[Donets Basin]]). He became fluent in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and married his second wife, Svitlana Ivanivna Shcherbatiuk, also known as Svetlana Sherbatiuk or Svetlana Parajanov, in 1956. Shcherbatiuk gave birth to a son, Suren, in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/suren.html Suren Parajanov]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Break from Soviet Realism==

[[Image:Sayat nova.jpg|thumb|left|Parajanov's muse, Georgian actress [[Sofiko Chiaureli]] in ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'']]

[[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' had an enormous impact on Parajanov's self-discovery as a filmmaker. Later the influence became mutual, and he and Tarkovsky became close friends. In 1965 Parajanov abandoned [[socialist realism]] and directed the poetic ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'', his first film over which he had complete creative control. It won numerous international awards and, unlike the subsequent ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'', was relatively well received by the Soviet authorities. The Script Editorial Board at Goskino of Ukraine praised the film for "conveying the poetic quality and philosophical depth of M. Kotsiubynsky’s tale through the language of cinema," and called it "a brilliant creative success of the Dovzhenko studio." Moscow also agreed to Goskino of Ukraine's request to release the film with its original Ukrainian soundtrack intact, rather than redub the dialogue into Russian for Soviet-wide release, in order to preserve its Ukrainian flavor.&lt;ref&gt;RGALI (Russian State Archive of Art and Literature), Goskino production and censorship files: f. 2944, op. 4, d. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; (Russian dubbing was standard practice at that time for non-Russian Soviet films when they were distributed outside the republic of origin.)

Parajanov departed Kiev shortly afterwards for his ancestors' homeland, [[Armenia]]. In 1969, he embarked on ''Sayat Nova'', a film that many consider to be his crowning achievement, though it was shot under relatively poor conditions and had a very small budget.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/hollo961.htm Sergei Parajanov – Interview with Ron Holloway, 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206074545/http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/hollo961.htm |date=2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet censors intervened and banned ''Sayat Nova'' for its allegedly inflammatory content. Parajanov re-edited his footage and renamed the film ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''. Critic Alexei Korotyukov remarked: "Paradjanov made films not about how things are, but how they would have been had he been God." {{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Mikhail Vartanov]] wrote in 1969 that "Besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionarily new until ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'' ...".&lt;ref name="Parajanov.com"&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/main.html Parajanov.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment and later work==

[[Image:Parajanov Tbilisi.JPG|thumb|left|Parajanov's monument in Tbilisi]]

[[File:Փարաջանով.jpg|thumb|Parajanov's statue in front of his museum in Yerevan]]

By December 1973, the Soviet authorities had grown increasingly suspicious of Parajanov's perceived subversive proclivities, particularly his bisexuality, and sentenced him to five years in a hard labor camp in [[Siberia]] for "a rape of a Communist Party member, and the propagation of pornography."&lt;ref name="mig.com.ua"&gt;[http://www.mig.com.ua/events.php?act=1&amp;cat=1057&amp;eventID=10849  ''Осужден за изнасилование члена КПСС'' (in Russian), ''Moskovskiy Komsomolets'', 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070810210559/http://www.mig.com.ua/events.php?act=1&amp;cat=1057&amp;eventID=10849 |date=2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days before Parajanov was sentenced, [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, asserting that "In the last ten years Sergei Paradjanov has made only two films: ''Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'' and ''The Colour of Pomegranates''. They have influenced cinema first in [[Ukraine]], second in this country as a whole, and third in the world at large. Artistically, there are few people in the entire world who could replace Paradjanov. He is guilty – guilty of his solitude. We are guilty of not thinking of him daily and of failing to discover the significance of a master." An eclectic group of artists, filmmakers and activists protested, to little avail, on behalf of Parajanov, among them [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Françoise Sagan]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Luis Buñuel]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and [[Mikhail Vartanov]].

Parajanov served four years out of his five-year sentence, and later credited his early release to the efforts of the [[France|French]] [[Surrealist]] poet and novelist [[Louis Aragon]], the Russian poet [[Elsa Triolet]] (Aragon's wife), and the American writer [[John Updike]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; His early release was authorized by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], presumably as a consequence of Brezhnev's chance meeting with Aragon and Triolet at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow. When asked by Brezhnev if he could be of any assistance, Aragon requested the release of Parajanov, which was effected by December 1977.&lt;ref name="mig.com.ua"/&gt;

While he was incarcerated, Parajanov produced a large number of miniature doll-like sculptures (some of which were lost) and some 800 drawings and collages, many of which were later displayed in [[Yerevan]], where the [[Sergei Parajanov Museum]] is now permanently located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/paradjanov_the_magnificent Frieze Magazine, Paradjanov the Magnificent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142206/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/paradjanov_the_magnificent/ |date=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The museum, opened in 1991, a year after Parajanov’s death, hosts more than 200 works as well as furnishings from his home in [[Tbilisi]].) His efforts in the camp were repeatedly compromised by prison guards, who deprived him of materials and called him mad, their cruelty only subsiding after a statement from Moscow admitted that "the director is very talented."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

After his return from prison to Tbilisi, the close watch of Soviet censors prevented Parajanov from continuing his cinematic pursuits and steered him towards the artistic outlets he had nurtured during his time in prison. He crafted extraordinarily intricate collages, created a large collection of abstract drawings and pursued numerous other avenues of non-cinematic art, sewing more dolls and some whimsical suits.

In February 1982 Parajanov was once again imprisoned, on charges of bribery, which happened to coincide with his return to Moscow for the premiere of a play commemorating [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] at the [[Taganka Theatre]], and was effected with some degree of trickery. Despite another stiff sentence, he was freed in less than a year, with his health seriously weakened.&lt;ref name="mig.com.ua"/&gt;

In 1985, the slow thaw within the [[Soviet Union]] spurred Parajanov to resume his passion for cinema. With the encouragement of various [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] intellectuals, he created the multi-award-winning film ''[[Legend of Suram Fortress]]'', based on a novella by [[Daniel Chonkadze]], his first return to cinema since ''Sayat Nova'' fifteen years earlier. In 1988, Parajanov made another multi-award-winning film, ''[[Ashik Kerib (film)|Ashik Kerib]]'', based on a story by [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. It is the story of a wandering minstrel, set in the [[Azeri]] culture. Parajanov dedicated the film to his close friend [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and "to all the children of the world".

Parajanov then attempted to complete his final project. He died of [[cancer]] in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]], on July 20, 1990, aged 66, leaving this final work, ''The Confession'', unfinished. It survives in its original negative as ''[[Parajanov: The Last Spring]]'', assembled by his close friend [[Mikhail Vartanov]] in 1992. [[Federico Fellini]], [[Tonino Guerra]], [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Alberto Moravia]], [[Giulietta Masina]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] were among those who publicly mourned his death.&lt;ref name="Parajanov.com"/&gt; They sent a telegram to Russia with the following statement: "The world of cinema has lost a magician".&lt;ref name="Parajanov.com"/&gt;

== Influences and legacy==
[[File:Sergei Parajanov's tombstone at Komitas Pantheon.jpg|thumb|upright|Parajanov's tombstone in [[Yerevan]]]]
Despite having studied film at the [[VGIK]], Parajanov discovered his artistic path only after seeing [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s dreamlike first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]''. Parajanov was highly appreciated by Tarkovsky himself in "[[Voyage in Time]]" ("Always with huge gratitude and pleasure I remember the films of Sergei Parajanov which I love very much. His way of thinking, his paradoxical, poetical... ability to love the beauty and the ability to be absolutely free within his own vision"), and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]] ("In the temple of cinema, there are images, light, and reality. Sergei Parajanov was the master of that temple"), [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Mikhail Vartanov]] ("Probably, besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionary new until Paradjanov's ''Color of Pomegranates''"), [[Federico Fellini]], [[Tonino Guerra]], [[Giulietta Masina]], [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Alberto Moravia]], [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/ See official page].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having many admirers of his art, his vision did not attract many followers. "Whoever tries to imitate me is lost", he reportedly said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/2014/2/article/parajanovs-influence-still-spreading-on-90th-anniversary/495366.html The Moscow Times]&lt;/ref&gt; However, directors such as [[Theo Angelopoulos]], [[Béla Tarr]] and [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]] share Parajanov's approach to film as a primarily visual medium rather than as a narrative tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/influences.html Parajanov Influence &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parajanov-Vartanov Institute]] was established in Hollywood in 2010 to study, preserve and promote the artistic legacies of Sergei Parajanov and [[Mikhail Vartanov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://institute.parajanov.com Parajanov-Vartanov Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141022052354/http://institute.parajanov.com/ |date=2014-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Anne's Column''' ({{lang-de|Annasäule}}) stands in the city centre of [[Innsbruck]] on ''[[Maria-Theresien-Straße, Innsbruck|Maria-Theresien-Straße]]''.

It was given its name when, in 1703, the last [[Bavaria]]n troops were driven from the [[Tyrol]] on [[St. Anne's Day]] (26 July), as part of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. In 1704, in gratitude, the ''[[Landstände]]'' vowed to build a monument commemorating the event.

The column was made by Trient sculptor, Cristoforo Benedetti, from red [[Kramsach]] marble. On the base are four statues of saints:
* in the north, [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]
* in the west, [[Cassian of Imola|Cassian]], patron saint of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen|Diocese of Bozen-Brixen]].
* in the east, [[Vigilius of Trent|Vigilius]], patron saint of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trento|Diocese of Trient]].
* in the south, [[Saint George]] with dragon and lance, then and since 2006, patron saint (now together with [[Saint Joseph]])
Towering above these four statues is the column with its statue of Mary as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]].

The column was consecrated on 26 July 1706 by [[Prince-Bishop]] Kaspar Ignaz, Count of Künigl. It has been restored several times over the centuries. In 1958, mainly for conservation reasons, the figure of Mary was replaced by a replica and the original was loaned to the [[Abbey of St. Georgenberg-Fiecht]], where it has been placed in a side chapel of the abbey church of Fiecht (near [[Schwaz]]) above Saint Mary's altar.

On 10 October 2009 the figures of saints on the base of the monument were also substituted; the originals are now on the first floor of the Altes Landhaus in Innsbruck.

'''''Still Life with Geraniums''''' is a 1910 oil on canvas painting by [[Henri Matisse]]. 

The oil painting is in the collection of [[Pinakothek der Moderne]], [[Munich, Germany]], to whom it was given in 1912, thus becoming, according to the museum, the first Matisse to enter a public collection.&lt;ref name=nyt-pin&gt;Butler, Desmond.

Retrieved 25 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Still Life with Geraniums'' was one of six paintings in the museum's collection to survive [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=nyt-pin/&gt;

Most of the animal sculptures reach considerable sizes. Some of them stand on pedestal. Sculptures made with great artistic mastery and expression are also met with besides schematically and roughly intagliated sheep and horse figures. Backs and sides of horses and sheep are covered with relief pictures of everyday life scenes, besides inscriptions. Inscriptions carved with [[Arabic script]] are also frequently found on headstones.&lt;ref name="Учение записки"/&gt;

==History of appearance and learning==

Pictures of alive beings in every form were restricted after occupation of the region by [[Arab people|Arabs]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Pictures of alive beings appeared in national arts again. It is considered that headstones were made in forms of sheep and horses beginning from the 15th century. These headstones are considered as an example of restriction of [[Islam]]ic [[dogma]]tics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Pictures of wild goats, deer, in some cases hunting scenes for these animals and sometimes everyday life episodes were also carved on stone sheep, besides the inscriptions.

[[File:Near the horse-gravestone in Shusha.jpg|thumb|300px|Stone sculpture of a horse in [[Shusha]] in [[Vasily Vereshchagin]]'s picture,1865]]
Firstly, a [[France|French]] [[geologist]] Frederic Dubois de Montpereux (1798 – 1850) mentioned about similar sculpture in “Voyage autour du Caucase”. There are materials in “Historie de la Societe nationale des l’antiquite” work of Perrot et Chipiez (Volume V, page 170). Then it was mentioned in works of [[Germans|German]] [[Archaeology|archeologist]] [[Arthur Milchhöfer]] “Archeologische Zeitung” of 1883, in “Bulletin de la Societe nationale des antiquares de France” in 1899 (balance of Turkish cemetery in [[Yerevan]] city) – “Report of Archeological Commission for 1898”. Letters in the southern semitic alphabet carved on sculpture of horse, found out near Dikh village of [[Kurdistan]] region, were opened by E.Y.Resler. A horse sculpture from Tselkinskiy district of [[Tiflis Governorate]] was also mentioned (I.P.Rostomov, [[Akhalkalaki]] uyezd in archeological relations).

In the 1920s, V.M.Sysoyev registered stone sculptures of horses and sheep in following points of [[Absheron peninsula]], on [[Muslim]] cemetery in Zikh village, in Kuturlu village of Kurdistan uyezd, in Muslim cemetery of [[Qarağac, Qubadli|Qarağac]] village of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Republic]], in Aznaburt, Azi (lower part), Vanand, Danagird (in [[Armenians|Armenian]] cemetery) of [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]]’s border, in [[Nakhchivan (city)]], Ananab village, in [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian church]] in [[Erzincan]], in Abidere, Balaburm Garidy, [[Lerik, Azerbaijan|Lerik]], [[Təngərud|Tangarud]], Eychara villages of [[Lankaran]] uyezd, during the working process on archeological map of [[Azerbaijan]].  Sysoyev also noted that, local residents of [[Ordubad Rayon|Ordubad]], Danagirt and Abrakunis find out these figures in ancient cemeteries, in mountains and other places, attach importance to them, frequently bring them from there and put on graves of their dears. An exemplar of stone sheep was also in park “in the square”, in [[Borjomi]], which was brought from outskirts. In 1925, this sheep was vanished and taken away by the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]], during flood of the river. Artistically created figure of sheep was in Barda village near [[Yevlakh]]. Fate of that sheep, a photo of which is kept in archive of the [[Azerbaijan State Museum of History]], is unknown at present.

In 1926, monuments in Urud village of [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur]] district were found out by archeologist A.K.Alakbarov, about which he briefly wrote the following sentences: “There are many sepulchral monuments with pictures of people and inscriptions on sides” in an ancient cemetery of Urud village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Y,Pchelina notes that (1932), such kind of monuments are popular in literature about the South Caucasus and usually are ascribed to [[Armenians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]]. She emphasizes headstones as “very rough sculptures” of sheep and horses made of gray stone in a cemetery near Yanig Yugoruk sanctuary (between Kizilav and Seyidlar villages on the Hakari river) and also in cemeteries of Shalva, [[Minkend]], Gara-Gishlag villages. Pchelina describes these sculptures also:

{| border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" style="margin:auto;"
|-
|  style="width:50%; background:#f6f6f6;"|
''Animals stand in a silent waiting pose. Sheep were carved especially roughly. These are almost stone bars, standing on two pedestals. Sometimes only head with hardly carved horns, which do not go beyond the flatness of temple, is carved by incisor. Lines of back and croup are given clearly. But legs are only drown and are not apart from the body, looking like a whole stone.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Swami Silver''' is the name given to a distinctive style of silverware that originated in the South Indian city of Madras (now known as Chennai) during the British rule. This style is characterized by figures of Hindu Gods and Goddesses. Variety of objects emerged in Swami Silver design. These included trays, tea sets, tankards, jugs, goblets, ewers, trophies, visiting card cases. Swami in the local Tamil language means God or deity and the term Swami Silver obviously originated from the proliferation of images of Gods and deities on these silver objects.

Swami Silver was pioneered and popularized by an English company, [[P.Orr &amp; Sons|P Orr and Sons]]. The Orr brothers, Peter and Alexander arrived in Madras from Scotland in 1843. They made their initial fortune by selling ice, before joining the watchmaker George Gordon &amp; Co. When Gordon retired in 1849, they took over the business and soon diversified into gold, diamonds and silverware. The jewelry business was suspended in 1944 at the height of World War –II and never recovered. The company went back to its original watch business and is currently under a new management.

The high quality workmanship of P Orr and Sons reached the zenith of its fame and reputation in 1875 and when the Prince of Wales visited India in 1876, they were commissioned to make special ceremonial gifts by various Maharajas.  Maharajas of Indore and Baroda got Swami tea services made, while Maharaja of Cochin commissioned a complete ensemble of Swami dessert service. In 1876, P Orr and Sons was designated as “Manufacturing Jewellers, Gold and Silversmiths to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, By Special Appointment”.

The silversmiths who worked in the atelier of P Orr and Sons were initially British, but soon Indian craftsmen were working side by side with them. Swami silver combined English form with Hindu motifs and is characterized by extraordinary attention to detail. The deities are depicted in exceptionally crisp high relief achieved by some brilliant ''repoussé''. The deities displayed include Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha, Hanuman, Lakshmi etc. Many of the Swami Silver pieces were monogrammed “ORR &amp; Sons, Madras.”, “P. Orr &amp; Sons of Madras,” or just “ORR”. 
 
Competition began emerging for P Orr and Sons, mainly in Bangalore and Tiruchirapalli. The first was Krishnaiah Chetty &amp; Sons in Bangalore. Though highly prized for its ornate design, Swami Silver had its share of critics in England for the excessive use of Hindu motifs. Omarsi Maoji of Kutch cashed in on this need for secular designs and their Swami Silver featured more of animals and birds and less of Gods.

==Trivia==
* On 20 September 1996 a shorter version of ''Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"'' was used by [[Twyla Tharp]]'s troupe in a ballet entitled "Heroes".
** "As I have been involved with the world of dance for many years I naturally mentioned the "Heroes" Symphony to the American Choreographer Twyla Tharp. Straight away she wanted "Heroes" for her new dance company, and soon after, we met with David. He immediately shared Twyla's enthusiasm and I found myself writing a symphonic score shortly to become a ballet." – Philip Glass, 1996 (from the ''"Heroes" Symphony'' liner notes).
* In 2006 ''Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"'' was used as the soundtrack for [[Marc Jacobs]] Fall / Winter 2006 fashion show.
* In 2007 "V2 Schneider" was used in the soundtrack for the [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] Fall / Winter 2007 fashion show. 
* Also in 2007 the [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]] Fall / Winter 2007 Menswear fashion show used a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of David Bowie's original 1977 version of "Heroes" with Philip Glass' 1996 version of "Heroes".
* On 24 March 2003 [[Aphex Twin]] released the compilation album ''[[26 Mixes for Cash]]'', which contained a further [[remix]] of Philip Glass' orchestral version of David Bowie's "Heroes", from ''Symphony No. 4 "Heroes"'', mixed with samples of Bowie's singing from the original 1977 Bowie single [["Heroes" (David Bowie song)|"Heroes"]].

'''Tim Lowly''' (born 1958 in Hendersonville, North Carolina) is a Chicago artist, musician, and teacher.  He is known for compassionate [[egg tempera]] pictures of children in mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Alan G. Artner, "Grabner Homes in on Subject Matter: Lanyon Exhibit Combines the Past with the Present, While Lowly Mixes Figures with Landscapes", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Thursday, May 27, 1999, section 5, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Tim Lowly was born Tim Grubbs.  From the age of three he lived in [[South Korea]], where his parents were [[Presbyterian]] [[missionaries]].  He learned piano and guitar and still plays and composes [[folk-rock]] music.  Lowly attended [[Calvin College]] in [[Grand Rapids]], Michigan, majoring in art.  He married Sherrie Rubingh in 1981, and rather than subordinate anyone's last name, they changed their surname to Lowly.&lt;ref name=Camper&gt;Fred Camper, "Temma Lowly and the Meaning of Life", ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', Friday, November 22, 2002, Vol. 32, no. 8, pp. 1, 14–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After a visit to Korea and Europe, Lowly took up the exacting [[renaissance]] art of [[egg tempera]] painting, in which egg yolk is mixed with pigment to make paint.

The Lowlys had a daughter, Temma, in 1985, who was brain-damaged and is frequently the subject of Mr. Lowly's paintings.  Lowly says, "Part of my fairly political agenda is to say that [[disabled]] children are a part of life.  These are not freaks.  What I'm saying is that we should advocate for eyes of compassion that see human beings as human beings, rather than separating them into the beautiful, the ugly, the normal, the freak."&lt;ref name=Camper/&gt;

Lowly has been awarded an Individual Artist Grant from the Michigan Council for the Arts in 1987 and Fellowships in Visual Art from the [[Illinois Arts Council]] in 1995 and 2005.  He teaches at [[North Park University]] in Chicago.

'''''Urushi-e''''' ({{lang|ja|漆絵}} "[[lacquer]] picture[s]") refers to three different types of [[Japanese art|Japanese artworks]]:&lt;ref&gt;Doshin, Sato, ''Shibata Zeshin: From Lacquer Arts to Painting'', Nezu Museum, Tokyo, 2012, p. IX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Richard, ''Images from the Floating World, the Japanese Print'', Dorset Press, New York, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[woodblock printing in Japan|Woodblock prints]] overpainted with a mixture of ink and animal glue to produce shiny areas resembling lacquer.
* Painting in lacquer on three-dimensional lacquer objects.
* Paintings painted with actual lacquer on paper or occasionally silk.

==Prints==
''Urushi-e'' woodblock prints were made using thick, dark black lines, and were sometimes hand-colored. The ink was mixed with an animal-based glue called ''[[nikawa]]'', which thickened it and gave it a lustrous shine, said to resemble lacquer. Most often, this was used not in creating the entire print, but only in enhancing a particular element, such as an [[Obi (sash)|obi]] or a figure's hair, to give it shine and make the image more luxurious overall.

Prints which include ''urushi-e'' elements are likely to also feature the use of [[mica]], metal dusts, and other elements which enhanced the appearance, quality and value of the works. The technique was most popular in the early 18th century, and can be seen in works by [[Okumura Masanobu]], [[Torii Kiyomasu]] and [[Torii Kiyonobu&amp;nbsp;I]], among many others.

==Paintings==
In painting, the term refers to the use of colored lacquers, produced by mixing pigments with clear lacquer. The use of colored lacquer for painting goes back to the prehistoric [[Jōmon period]], and became especially popular in the [[Nara period]] (8th century), when a great many works were made using red lacquer against a black background. Until the 19th century, however, the use of natural pigments restricted the colors accessible to artists to red, black, yellow, green, and light brown.

Artist [[Shibata Zeshin]] (1807-1891) is particularly famous for his innovations in this regard, and was perhaps the first to use lacquer not just as a decorative element (in painting boxes, furniture, and pottery) but as a medium for painted scrolls. Zeshin experimented extensively with various substances, which he mixed with lacquer to create a variety of effects, including simulating the appearance of various metals (iron, gold, bronze, copper), and imitating the appearance and texture of Western [[oil painting]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2249">[[File:Vassiliki ware with long neck archmus Heraklion.jpg|thumb|Long-neck Vasiliki ware "teapot", with characteristic mottled decoration.]]
'''Vasiliki wares''' are a distinctive type of [[Minoan pottery]] produced in [[Crete]] during the [[Minoan]] period, named for the finds around the town of [[Vasiliki, Lasithi]], although it was produced at other sites too. The vases include a reddish-brown wash applied unevenly to mimic stone vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=esSIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96 ''Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete''], Rodney Castleden&lt;/ref&gt;  The mottling was produced by uneven firing of the slip-covered pot, with the hottest areas turning dark. Considering that the mottling was controlled into a pattern, touching with hot coals was probably used to produce it.  There is also a style painted in a creamy white over the reddish-brown wash applied all over the body.

The first examples of Vasiliki Ware are to be found in East Crete during EM IIA period, but it is in the next period, EM IIB, that it becomes the dominant form among the fine wares throughout eastern and southern Crete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minoancrete.com/vasiliki.htm Minoan settlement of Vasiliki] minoancrete.com&lt;/ref&gt; Dating [[Minoan chronology|varies between scholars]], but the Early Minoan II period is generally thought to run between around 2600-2000 BC.

The typical long-spouted pots, with a relatively small top mouth, are often called "teapots" by archaeologists; another common shape is called the "egg-cup".

{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Cratère de Vix 0023.jpg|thumb|400px|The Vix [[Krater]], an imported Greek wine-mixing vessel found in the famous grave of the "Lady of Vix"]]
The '''Vix Grave''' is a [[tumulus|burial mound]] near the village of [[Vix, Côte-d'Or|Vix]] ({{IPA-fr|vi}}) in northern [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. The broader site is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Celts|Celtic]] complex from the Late [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and Early [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] periods, consisting of a fortified settlement and several burial mounds.

The grave of the ''Lady of Vix'', dating to circa 500 BC, had never been disturbed and thus contained remarkably rich grave offerings.  Known in French as the ''Trésor de Vix'', these included a great deal of jewellery and the "Vix [[krater]]", the largest known metal vessel from Western [[classical antiquity]], being 1.63 m (5'4") in height.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/ Vix-Musée-du-Pays-Châtillonnais: Trésor-de-Vix]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The sites are located near the village of Vix, about 6 km north of [[Châtillon-sur-Seine]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Côte-d'Or]], in northeastern Burgundy. The complex is centred on Mont Lassois, a steep flat-topped hill that dominates the area. It was the site of a fortified Celtic settlement, or [[oppidum]]. To the southeast of the hill, there was a 42-hectare [[necropolis]] with graves ranging from the Late [[Bronze Age]] via the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] Culture to Late [[La Tène culture|La Tène]]. Other finds indicate activity up to [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuerstensitze.de/1117_Mont_Lassois.html Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft "Early centralization and urbanization processes - On the Genesis and Development 'Early Celtic Princely Seats' : Mont Lassois]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sixth and fifth centuries BC, the Vix (or Mont Lassois) settlement appears to have controlled a major trading node, where the [[Seine]], an important riverine transport route linking eastern and western France, crossed the land route leading from the [[Mediterranean]] to northern Europe. Additionally, Vix is at the centre of an agriculturally rich plain.

== History of discovery ==
[[File:Cratère de Vix 0016.jpg|thumb|300px|Vix krater: Frieze of hoplites and four-horse chariots on the rim]]
Discovery of archaeological material in the area, originally by a locally based amateur, began in April 1930. Increasingly systematic work throughout the following decades revealed thousands of [[pottery]] sherds, [[Fibula, or ancient brooch|fibulae]], jewellery, and other bronze and iron finds. The famous burial mound with the [[krater]] was excavated in early 1953 by René Jouffroi. In 1991 new archaeological research on and around Mont Lassois began under the direction of Bruno Chaume. Since 2001 a programme of research titled “Vix et son environnement” began, uniting the resources of several universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/_upload/26c2729367f62a9eadcfc6e1005e88eb.pdf |title=Archéologie en Bourgogne: Vix (CÔTE-D’OR), Une Résidence Princière Au Temps De La Splendeur D’Athènes 2011 |access-date=2014-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714135846/http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/_upload/26c2729367f62a9eadcfc6e1005e88eb.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The oppidum of Mont Lassois ==
===Fortifications and architecture===
[[File:Vix palace late 6th century B.C..jpg|thumb|300px|Vix palace, late 6th century B.C.]]
[[File:Vix palace France, late 6th century B.C..jpg|thumb|300px|Vix palace, late 6th century B.C.]]
Excavation of the settlement on the summit of Mont Lassois revealed extensive fortifications, with ditches and walls up to 8 m thick. The walls were built in the ''[[Pfostenschlitzmauer]]'' technique, but also yielded nails of the type common in ''[[murus gallicus]]'' walls. Excavation inside the enclosure revealed a variety of buildings, including post houses, [[Grubenhaus|pit dwellings]], hearths, and storage units built on stilts. [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] work shows a large planned settlement, with a central, north–south axis and several phases of buildings.

===The "Palace of the Lady of Vix"===
In 2006, a remarkable architectural unit was discovered at the centre of the site. It is a large complex of two or three buildings, the main one measuring 35 by 21 m, with an estimated height of 12 m: the dimensions of a modern church. The large hall had an [[apse]] at the back and a front porch ''[[in antis]]''. Overall, the central unit resembles the [[megaron]] complex of early [[Greek architecture]]. Such a find is unprecedented in early Celtic Europe. Finds suggested domestic use or feasting uses. The structure has been described as the "Palace" of the Lady of Vix (''Palais de la Dame de Vix'').

===Finds===
The many individual finds from the Lassois oppidum clearly demonstrate the settlement's long and wide-ranging trade contacts, as well as its own role as an economic centre. The most common finds are shards of pottery, with more than 40,000 recorded to date. Many are local products, decorated with simple geometric motifs (checkerboard patterns) and occasional depictions of animals. There also have been finds of imported [[Attic]] [[black figure]] vases from Greece. Many [[amphorae]] and bowls could be identified as coming from the contemporary Greek-settled areas of southern France. The amphorae had been used for transporting wine.

Jewellery included [[fibula, or ancient brooch|fibulae]], commonly decorated with [[amber]] or [[coral]], earrings, beads, slate bracelets, and rings. Glass ornaments also were found. Some small bronze figurines found are probably of Mediterranean origin. Little weaponry has been found as yet, the majority of it [[projectiles]] and axes.

===Status===
Mont Lassois has all the features of a high-status settlement: large fortifications, the presence of a [[citadel]] and a lower town, rare and fine imported materials, as well as numerous rich burial mounds in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/_upload/26c2729367f62a9eadcfc6e1005e88eb.pdf |title=Archéologie en Bourgogne: Vix (CÔTE-D’OR), Une Résidence Princière Au Temps De La Splendeur D’Athènes 2011 |access-date=2014-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714135846/http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/_upload/26c2729367f62a9eadcfc6e1005e88eb.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The burial mounds==
=== The 1953 Vix Grave ===
[[File:Cratère de Vix 0009.jpg|thumb|250px|One of the krater's volute handles, each were supported by a rampant [[lion|lioness]]]]
The burial of "the Lady of Vix" took place around [[500 B.C.]] Although decomposition of the organic contents of the grave was nearly total, the gender of the individual buried has been interpreted as female: she is accompanied by many items of jewellery, but no weaponry. Her social status is not clear and other than "Lady," names such as, ''Queen'', ''Princess'', or ''Priestess of Vix'' have all been used in various articles involving conjecture. There can be no doubt of her high status, as indicated by the large amounts of jewellery. She was between 30 years and 35 years old at the time of her death.

====Burial and grave goods====
[[File:Gold_torque_1.jpg|thumb|300px|A unique 24 carat Celtic [[torc]], whose ends are adorned with winged horses on intricate [[filigree]] pedestals and lion paws, inspired by Etruscan, Scythian or Middle Eastern bestiary]]
The [[inhumation]] burial was placed in a 4m x 4m rectangular wooden chamber underneath a mound or [[tumulus]] of earth and stone which originally measured 42m in diameter and 5m in height.

Her body was laid in the freestanding box of a cart, or [[chariot]], the wheels of which had been detached and placed beside it. Only its metal parts have survived. Her jewellery included a 480&amp;nbsp;gram 24-carat gold [[torc]], a bronze torc, six fibulae, six slate bracelets, plus a seventh bracelet made of [[amber]] beads.

The grave also contained an assemblage of imported objects from [[Italy]] and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] world, all of them associated with the preparation of wine. They included the famous krater (see below), a silver [[phiale (libation vessel)|phiale]] (shallow bowl, sometimes seen as a local product), an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] bronze [[oinochoe]] (wine jug), and several drinking cups from [[Etruria]] and [[Attica]]. One of the latter was dated as c. 525 BC and represents the latest firmly dated find in the grave. It thus provides the best evidence, a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for its date. The vessels probably were placed on wooden tables or benches that did not survive.

====The Vix krater====
[[File:Vix krater.jpg|thumb|300px|Châtillon-sur-Seine |A [[Gorgon]] head is on the outside of each of the krater's two handles ]]
The largest and most famous of the finds from the burial is an elaborately decorated bronze [[volute]] [[krater]] of 1.63m (5'4") height and over 200kg (450lbs) weight. [[Krater]]s were vessels for mixing wine and water, common in the Greek world, and usually made of clay. The Vix krater has become an iconic object representing both the wealth of early Celtic burials and the art of Late [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Greek]] bronze work.

*The krater was made of seven or more individual pieces with [[Greek alphabet|alphabetical]] markings&lt;ref&gt;Cook, R. M. 1979. Three Conjectures. ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 99. 152-155.&lt;/ref&gt;, indicating that it probably was transported to Burgundy in pieces and assembled ''in situ''.
*The vase proper, made of a single sheet of hammered [[bronze]], weighs about 60kg. Its bottom is rounded, its maximum diameter is 1.27m, and its capacity is 1,100&amp;nbsp;litres. Its walls are only 1mm to 1.3mm thick. The krater was found crushed by the weight of the tumulus material above it. It had telescoped completely: the handles were found at the same level as the base. It was restored after excavation.
*Its foot is made of a single moulded piece, its diameter is 74cm, its weight 20.2kg. It received the rounded bottom of the main vase and ensured its stability. It is decorated with stylised plant motifs.
*The three handles, supported by rampant [[lion|lioness]]es, weighed about 46kg each. Each is a 55cm high [[volute]], each is elaborately decorated with a grimacing [[gorgoneion|gorgon]], a common motif on contemporary Greek bronzes.
*A frieze of [[hoplites]] decorates the neck of the vessel, which is made of a bronze ring inserted into the main vase and supporting the handles. It depicts eight chariots, each drawn by four horses and conducted by a charioteer (depicted smaller than the hoplites for reasons of space), each is followed by a single fully armed hoplite on foot. The frieze is an important example of early Greek bronze [[relief]] art, which has rarely survived.
*The lid was a hammered bronze sheet, weighing 13.8kg and shaped to fit the krater's opening. It is concave and perforated by multiple holes, probably because it also served as a strainer for purifying wine. A protrusion at its centre supports a 19cm statuette of moulded bronze, depicting a woman with one outstretched arm, which once may have held some object such as a [[Kottabos|plastinx]]. She wears a [[peplos]], the body-length [[Ancient Greek]] garment worn by women, and her head is covered by a veil. The statuette appears of a somewhat older style than figures on the rest of the vessel.

====Significance====
The enormous variety of apparently Mediterranean imports indicates wide-ranging trade connections; in particular, the Mediterranean material might have come to Vix with Greek or Etruscan traders. The wealth of imported luxury goods at Vix is, so far, unique in La Tène Europe. It has been suggested that the krater, the largest known Greek bronze vessel, should be seen in a context of high-status gift exchange connected with the trade of wine from the Mediterranean for raw materials from northern Europe.

====Exhibition and reconstruction====
A reconstruction of the grave and the original finds are on display in the museum at [[Châtillon-sur-Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/ Vix-Musée-du-Pays-Châtillonnais: Trésor-de-Vix]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further tumuli ===
Apart from this woman's grave (mound I), there are five further known large burial mounds in the area. Three of them have been excavated so far. 
*Mound II had a diameter of 33 m; its central chamber contained an urn with cremated human remains, dated by accompanying finds to c. 850 BC.
*The mound of [[La Butte (Vix)|La Butte]] probably dates to the mid-sixth century. As in its famous neighbouring grave, it contained a woman laid in a cart, or chariot, accompanied by two iron [[axe]]s and a gold bracelet.
*A third mound, at [[La Garenne (Vix)|La Garenne]], was destroyed in 1846. It, too, contained a cart, as well as an Etruscan bronze bowl with four [[griffin]] or [[lion|lioness]] handles. It is not known whether it contained skeletal remains.

===Statues===
In 1994, fragments of two stone statues, a warrior, and a figure of a woman, were discovered in a small enclosure.

In the area, as elsewhere in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]], the early [[Iron Age]] led to changes in social organisation, including a marked tendency toward the development of social [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. It seems that at the top of these hierarchies was an aristocracy that had developed in the context of the increasingly important trade in [[iron ore]] and [[iron]]. Whether they really were "princesses" or "princes" in a modern sense (i.e., a noble or religious aristocracy) or simply represented an economic or mercantile elite is still the subject of much discussion.

Evidence for these changed social conditions is seen in the richly equipped graves of this period, which stand in sharp contrast to the preceding habit of uniform simple urn burials. It is also seen in the changing settlement patterns of the region. Whereas large open settlements had previously served as central places, smaller enclosed settlements developed, often in locally prominent locations (so called [[Manorialism|manor]]s or ''princely sites''). Several of these sites are known from Late Hallstatt and Early La Tène Europe, for example, the burials at [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]] and [[Magdalenenberg]], the [[Heuneburg]] settlement and the [[Glauberg]] settlement and burial complex. 

Iron ores were far more widespread than the rarer materials needed to produce the previously dominant [[bronze]]: [[copper]], but especially, [[tin]]. Thus, economic success ceased to be determined simply by access to the raw materials, but started to depend on infrastructure and trade. The increasing economic surplus in well-situated places was invested in representative settlements (and fortifications), jewellery, and expensive imported luxury materials, a differentiation not previously possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4121">'''Warmed-over flavor''' is an unpleasant characteristic usually associated with [[meat]] which has been cooked and then refrigerated.  The deterioration of meat flavor is most noticeable upon reheating.  As cooking and subsequent refrigeration is the case with most [[convenience food]]s containing meat, it is a significant challenge to the [[Food processing|processed food]] [[Food industry|industry]]. The flavor is variously described as "rancid," "stale," and like "cardboard," and even compared to "damp dog hair."&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Frank, P. | title = Warmed-over flavor: a processing challenge | journal = Refrigerated &amp; Frozen Foods |date=March 2003 | volume = 2003 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-100074391.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Warmed-over flavor is caused by the [[oxidation|oxidative]] [[decomposition]] of [[lipids]] (fatty substances) in the meat into chemicals (short-chain [[aldehydes]] or [[ketones]]) which have an unpleasant taste or odor.  This decomposition process begins after cooking or processing and is aided by the release of naturally occurring [[iron]] in the meat.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;

==Appearance of warmed-over flavor==
The appearance of warmed-over flavor begins as lipids, primarily lipids from the [[cell membrane]] of cells in the meat, are attacked by [[oxygen]].  This process is aided by the release of [[iron]] from iron-containing proteins in the meat, including [[myoglobin]] and [[hemoglobin]].  The iron is released by the heat of cooking, or by mechanical grinding. The free iron then acts as a [[catalyst]], or promoter, of oxidation reactions.  The reactions break down some of the fats in the meat to form primary oxidation products.  These chemicals are not directly responsible for the objectionable taste.  Instead, they subsequently further decompose to secondary oxidation products including "[[alcohol]]s, [[acid]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[lactone]]s and [[unsaturated hydrocarbon]]s which produce the [warmed-over flavor]."  Many of these compounds, including [[pentanal]], [[hexanal]], [[pentylfuran]], [[2-pentylfuran]], [[2-octenal]] and [[2,3-octanedione]] have a strong odor and can be tasted at concentrations as low as 1 part per billion.&lt;ref name="Trout"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf00093a017 | title = Prevention of warmed-over flavor in cooked beef: effect of phosphate type, phosphate concentration, a lemon juice/phosphate blend, and beef extract | year = 1990 | last1 = Trout | first1 = G. R. | last2 = Dale | first2 = S. | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 665–669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Warmed-over flavor can be prevented by the addition of [[preservatives]] to processed meat.  Many of the preservatives are [[antioxidant]]s, ranging from [[tocopherol]]s (related to vitamin E) to [[plum]] juice to industrial additives such as [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA) and [[propyl gallate]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;  Other preservatives such as [[sodium pyrophosphate]] and [[sodium hexametaphosphate]] may work by binding iron and preventing it from catalyzing the chemical reactions which lead to warmed-over flavor; as these compounds are generally more soluble in water than the fat-soluble antioxidant preservatives, they may be more readily used to prevent oxidative decomposition in meat.&lt;ref name="Trout" /&gt; [[Nitrite]]s, a curing agent for meat, may prevent the development of warmed-over flavor by preventing the release of iron during cooking.&lt;ref name="Igene"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0308-8146(85)90099-8 | title = Mechanisms by which nitrite inhibits the development of warmed-over flavour (WOF) in cured meat | year = 1985 | last1 = Igene    | first1 = J. | last2 = Yamauchi | first2 = K.   | last3 = Pearson  | first3 = A.

The '''Young Actors Summer Institute''' is an arts enrichment summer programs in New England. Held annually since 2005 at the [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Trinity Repertory Company]], in Providence, Rhode Island, YASI is taught by the theater's resident acting company and education staff. Students are able to choose from a variety of different classes, including playwriting, painting and drawing, improvisation, Shakespeare, film and more.

== Structure ==
YASI takes place during the month of July and culminates in performances featuring [[scene (drama)|scene]], [[monologue]]s and musical theater selections. The program usually lasts five weeks, excluding weekends and holidays. The first week starts participants with age appropriate improv games and an "audition day"; and the last week is spent in [[rehearsal]] for a final showcase.

Normal days are divided into four elective blocks and one extended period of time used for mandatory [[scene study]], rehearsal or learning about the technical aspects of theater. The elective blocks are varied in subject matter and range from [[yoga]] to [[improvisation]] to playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Young Actors Summer Institute (YASI) 2011 Course Descriptions |publisher=Trinity Repertory Company |url=http://www.trinityrep.com/DownloadDocs/YASI_Course_Descriptions_2011.pdf |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the final showcase performances, there is also a full length production of a Shakepearean play done by the high school students in the 'YASI Shakes' program.

In the summer of 2011, a new mini camp was created called YASI Jr. YASI Jr. is a 5-day program giving kids too young for YASI a chance to experience what it's like to be at YASI.

== Participant Life ==
In addition to normal classes, many extra events occur. Musical or theatrical guests often come to perform. Every year, there has been a [[rock-paper-scissors]] tournament and a game called "[[Assassins (game)|Boom Roasted]]". There is also a Lip Sync Battle every year and the winner(s) get to smash a piece of art filled with cream.

=== Awards ===
There are daily prizes. These prizes are awarded to the attendees who have helped throughout the day in various ways such as cleaning up during lunch and snack, or helping the counselors and teaching artists. Prizes vary from day to day.

At the end of the program, special participants are recognized with induction to the Gryffindor club (an homage to [[Gryffindor]] of [[Harry Potter]]).
