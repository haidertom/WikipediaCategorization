[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 062.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grünewald's painting "[[The Mocking of Christ (Grünewald)|The Mocking of Christ]]" depicts Christ being lashed and abused.]]
The '''aestheticization of violence''' in high culture [[art]] or [[mass media]] has been the subject of considerable controversy and debate for centuries. In Western art, graphic depictions of the [[Passion of Christ]] have long been portrayed, as have a wide range of depictions of warfare by later painters and graphic artists. Theater and, in modern times, cinema have often featured battles and violent crimes, while images and descriptions of violence have always been a part of literature. Margaret Bruder states that the aestheticization of violence in film is the depiction of violence in a "stylistically excessive", "significant and sustained way" in which audience members are able to connect references from the "play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]" to artworks, [[genre]] conventions, cultural [[symbol]]s, or concepts.&lt;ref name="bruder"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |title= Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last= Bruder |first= Margaret Ervin |year= 1998 |publisher= Film Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington IN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040908094032/http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of representation==

===In high culture===
[[High culture]] forms such as [[fine art]] and [[literature]] have aestheticized violence into a form of autonomous art. In 1991, [[University of Georgia]] literature professor [[Joel Black]] stated that "(if) any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, certainly it is the act of murder". Black notes that "...if murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn be regarded as a kind of artist—a performance artist or anti-artist whose specialty is not creation but destruction" (1991: 14). This conception of an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] element of murder has a long history; in the 19th century, [[Thomas de Quincey]] wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everything in this world has two handles. [[Murder]], for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle... and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste."&lt;ref name="dequincey"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Quincey |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas de Quincey |title= On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts |url= http://supervert.com/elibrary/thomas_de_quincey |format= Zipped PDF download |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |year= 1827 |isbn= 1-84749-133-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In popular culture===
In addition to high culture aestheticizations of violence, mass media forms such as [[newspaper]] and [[television]] news reporting have produced sensationalized reports on [[crime]] and warfare. [[Maria Tatar]]'s book ''Lustmord: Sexual Murder in [[Weimar Germany]]'' analyzes murders in pre-Hitler Germany and their artistic representations, investigating "the chilling motives behind representations that aestheticize violence, and that turn the mutilated female body into an object of fascination".&lt;ref name="pupress"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |title= Additional Reviews and/or Endorsements for Tatar, M.: Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |date= 2007-04-30 |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060906023727/http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |archive-date= 2006-09-06 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baath Party Headquarters, Baghdad (3148598572).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bombed-out remains of the Baath Party Headquarters in Baghdad.]]
Lilie Chouliaraki's article, "The aestheticization of suffering on television" (2006), analyzes "an example of war footage in order to trace the ways in which the tension between presenting airwar as an 'objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation". For example, Chouliaraki argues that the "bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary [[narrative]] that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime [[spectacle]] (Boltanski). She says that the "aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a [[tableau vivant]]", producing an "aestheticization of suffering [that] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage".&lt;ref name="chouliaraki"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chouliaraki |first= Lilie |authorlink=  |coauthors=  |year= 2006 |title= The aestheticization of suffering on television |journal= Visual Communication |volume= 5 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–285 |doi= 10.1177/1470357206068455 |url= http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021152/http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-28 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In films ====
A number of filmmakers from the 20th century have used aestheticized depictions of violence. According to James Fox, filmmaker [[Donald Cammell]] "...looked upon violence as an artist might look on paint. [He asked:] What are its components? What's its nature? Its glamour?"&lt;ref name="schneider"&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last= Schneider |first= Steven Jay |date= 2001-06-01 |title= Killing in Style: The Aestheticization of Violence in Donald Cammell's 'White of the Eye' |journal= Scope - An Online Journal of Film and Television Studies |issn= 1465-9166 |url= http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm  |format= Archive |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619114211/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm |archivedate = 2004-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Harris]] created a fictional character called [[Hannibal Lecter]], a [[cannibalism|cannibal]] and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), directors [[Jonathan Demme]] and [[Ridley Scott]], respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter is about to kill (and eat) a victim. Lecter was portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. In [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), the villain of the film, [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]], is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]es (such as blue velvet) when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve [[orgasm]].

In the film ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]],'' which tells the story of a burnt-out former [[Black Ops]] agent who seeks to avenge the kidnappers of a young girl he was bodyguarding, a character says that the agent is an "artist" in killing. He says the man is about to "paint his masterpiece" as he seeks out and kills all of the members of the criminal organization who were connected with the child abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Roger |last= Ebert |title= Man on Fire Movie Review |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/man-on-fire-2004 |date= 2004-04-23 |accessdate=2016-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Xavier Morales' review of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Kill Bill:&lt;!-- The official website shows a colon in the title. See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --&gt; Volume 1]]'', entitled "Beauty and violence", he calls the film "a groundbreaking aestheticization of violence".  Morales says that the film, which he calls "easily one of the most violent movies ever made", "a breathtaking landscape in which art and violence coalesce into one unforgettable aesthetic experience".&lt;ref name="morales"/&gt;

Morales argues that "...&amp;nbsp;Tarantino manages to do precisely what Alex de Large was trying to do in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]:'' he presents violence as a form of expressive art...[in which the]...violence is so physically graceful, visually dazzling and meticulously executed that our instinctual, emotional responses undermine any rational objections we may have. Tarantino is able to transform an object of moral outrage into one of aesthetic beauty...[, in which,]...like all art forms, the violence serves a communicative purpose apart from its aesthetic value". When the female sword-wielding protagonist "...skillfully slices and dices her way through...[the opposing fighters]...we get a sense that she is using them as a kind of canvas for her expression of revenge...[,]...like an artist who expresses herself through brush and paint,...[she]...expresses herself through sword and blood".&lt;ref name="morales"&gt;{{cite news|first=Xavier |last=Morales |title=Beauty and violence |url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |work=The Record |publisher=Harvard Law School RECORD Corporation |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021234/http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics analyzing violent film images that seek to aesthetically please the viewer mainly fall into two categories. Critics who see depictions of violence in film as superficial and exploitative argue that it leads audience members to become desensitized to brutality, thus increasing their aggression. On the other hand, critics who view violence as a type of content, or as a theme, claim it is cathartic and provides "acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses".&lt;ref name="bruder"/&gt;

Adrian Martin argues that critics who hold violent cinema in high regard have developed a response to anti-violence advocates, "those who decry everything from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' to ''[[Terminator 2]]'' as dehumanising, desensitising cultural influences". Martin claims that critics who value aestheticized violence defend shocking depictions onscreen on the grounds that "screen violence is not real violence, and should never be confused with it". He claims that their rebuttal also claims that "movie violence is fun, spectacle, make-believe; it's dramatic metaphor, or a necessary catharsis akin to that provided by [[Jacobean theatre]]; it's generic, pure sensation, pure fantasy. It has its own changing history, its codes, its precise aesthetic uses."&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Adrian |year=2000 |title=The Offended Critic: Film Reviewing and Social Commentary |journal=Senses of Cinema |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1443-4059 |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |format=Archive |accessdate=2007-06-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519074902/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |archivedate=2007-05-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Bruder]], a film studies professor at Indiana University and the author of ''Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style,'' proposes that there is a distinction between aestheticized violence and the use of gore and blood in mass market action or war films. She argues that "aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film". Movies such as the popular action film ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' are very violent, but they do "not fall into the category of aestheticized violence because it is not stylistically excessive in a significant and sustained way".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

But Bruder classifies films as using "stylized [e.g. aestheticized] violence if they "revel in guns, gore and explosions, exploiting [[mise-en-scene]] not so much to provide narrative environment as to create the appearance of a 'movie' atmosphere against which specifically cinematic spectacle can unfold". In movies with aestheticized violence, she argues that the "standard realist modes of editing and cinematography are violated in order to spectacularize the action being played out on the screen"; directors use "quick and awkward editing", "canted framings", shock cuts, and slow motion, to emphasize the impacts of bullets or the "spurting of blood".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

For viewers of films with aestheticized violence, such as [[John Woo]]'s movies, she claims that "One of the many pleasures" from watching Woo's films, such as ''[[Hard Target]]'' is that it gets viewers to recognize how Woo plays with conventions "from other Woo films" and how it "connects up with films...which include imitations of or homages to Woo". Bruder argues that films with aestheticized violence such as "''Hard Target'', ''[[True Romance]]'' and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' are [filled] with... signs" and indicators, so that "the stylized violence they contain ultimately serves as...another interruption in the narrative drive" of the film.&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Dwight Garner reviews the controversy and [[moral panic]] surrounding the 1991 novel and 2000 film ''[[American Psycho]]'', which concerns [[Patrick Bateman]], "an Exeter and Harvard grad, a gourmand, a tanning enthusiast and a ruthless fashion critic" who is also a [[serial killer]]. Garner concludes that the film was a "coal-black satire" in which "dire comedy mixes with [[Grand Guignol]]. There's demented opera in some of its scenes." The book, meanwhile, has acquired "grudging respect" and is "seen as a transgressive bag of broken glass that can be talked about alongside plasma-soaked trips like Anthony Burgess's ''A Clockwork Orange''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dwight |last= Garner |title= In Hindsight, an ‘American Psycho’ Looks a Lot Like Us |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/theater/in-hindsight-an-american-psycho-looks-a-lot-like-us.html |newspaper= The New York Times |date=2016-03-24 |accessdate=2016-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garner claims that the novel's author, [[Bret Easton Ellis]], "was racing ahead of the culture" and that his book "was ahead of its time": "The culture has shifted to make room for Bateman. We've developed a taste for barbaric libertines with twinkling eyes and some zing in their tortured souls. [[Tony Soprano]], [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] from "''[[Breaking Bad]]''", [[Hannibal Lecter]] (who predates "''American Psycho''")—here are the most significant pop culture characters of the past 30 years... Thanks to these characters, and to [[first-person shooter]] [[video games]], we’ve learned to identify with the bearer of violence and not just cower before him or her."

==History in art==

===Antiquity===
[[Plato]] proposed to ban poets from his [[The Republic (Plato)|ideal republic]] because he feared that their aesthetic ability to construct attractive [[narrative]]s about immoral behaviour would corrupt young minds. Plato's writings refer to poetry as a kind of [[rhetoric]], whose "...influence is pervasive and often harmful". Plato believed that poetry that was "unregulated by philosophy is a danger to soul and community". He warned that tragic poetry can produce "a disordered psychic regime or constitution" by inducing "a dream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in ...sorrow, grief, anger, [and] resentment". As such, Plato was in effect arguing that "What goes on in the theater, in your home, in your fantasy life, are connected" to what one does in real life.&lt;ref name="griswold"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Griswold |first= Charles |editor= Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title= Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2004/entries/plato-rhetoric/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |edition= Spring 2004 |date= 2003-12-22 |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, [[Stanford University]] |location= Stanford, CA |issn= 1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]], though, advocated a useful role for music, drama, and tragedy: a way for people to purge their negative emotions. Aristotle mentions [[catharsis]] at the end of his ''Politics'', where he notes that after people listen to music that elicits pity and fear, they "are liable to become possessed" by these negative emotions. However, afterwards, Aristotle points out that these people return to "a normal condition as if they had been medically treated and undergone a purge [catharsis]&amp;nbsp;... All experience a certain purge [catharsis] and pleasant relief. In the same manner cathartic melodies give innocent joy to men" (from ''Politics'' VIII:7; 1341b 35-1342a 8).&lt;ref name="dhi"&gt;{{cite book |editor= Philip P.

===15th century – 17th century===
[[File:FallOfTheDamnedBosch.jpg|right|upright|thumb|''[[Fall of the Damned into Hell]]'']]
The artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]], from the 15th and 16th centuries, used images of demons, half-human animals and machines to evoke fear and confusion to portray the evil of man. The 16th-century artist [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] depicted "...the nightmarish imagery that reflect, if in an extreme fashion, popular dread of the [[Apocalypse]] and Hell".&lt;ref name="alsford"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/lcdth_i.html |title= Death - Introductory essay |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Alsford |first= Stephen |date= 2004-02-29 |work= Florilegium Urbanum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 022.jpg|left|thumb|''The [[Crucifixion]]'', central panel of the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]]]
[[Mathis Gothart-Neithart]], a German artist known as "Grünewald" (1480–1528) depicted "intense emotion, especially painful emotion". His painting of the Crucifixion "...does not spare the beholder. Grünewald relentlessly brings out all the marks of terrible suffering and agony, induced by the cruelty and torture of the executioners...[vividly conveying] a sense of horror and pain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gilbert |first= William |title= Renaissance and Reformation |url= http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |year= 1998 |publisher= Carrie |location= Lawrence, KS |chapter= Chapter 22: Renaissance Art in Northern Europe |chapterurl= http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/22.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607032139/http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/| archivedate= 7 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century – present===
In the mid-18th century, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], an Italian etcher, archaeologist and architect active from 1740, did imaginary etchings of prisons that depicted people "stretched on racks or trapped like rats in maze-like dungeons", an "aestheticization of violence and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;

In 1849, as revolutions raged in European streets and authorities were putting down protests and consolidating state powers, composer [[Richard Wagner]] wrote: "I have an enormous desire to practice a little artistic terrorism."&lt;ref name="dworkin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/Editor/DworkinTrotsky.pdf |title= Trotsky's Hammer |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Dworkin |first= Craig |date= 2006-01-17 |format= PDF |publisher= Department of English, University of Utah |location= Salt Lake City, UT |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070626072920/http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/Editor/DworkinTrotsky.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-26 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent Tailhade]] is reputed to have stated, after [[Auguste Vaillant]] bombed the Chamber of Deputies in 1893: "{{lang|fr|Qu'importent les victimes, si le geste est beau?}} [What do the victims matter, so long as the gesture is beautiful]." In 1929 [[André Breton]]'s Second Manifesto on [[surrealist art]] stated that "{{lang|fr|L’acte surréaliste le plus simple consiste, revolvers aux poings, à descendre dans la rue et à tirer au hasard, tant qu’on peut, dans la foule}}" [The simplest Surrealist act consists of running down into the street, pistols in hand, and firing blindly, as fast as you can pull the trigger, into the crowd]."&lt;ref name="dworkin" /&gt;

==Theories and semiotic analysis==
{{Semiotics}}

===Baudrillard===
French [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that whereas modern societies were "...organized around the production and consumption of [[commodification|commodities]]", "postmodern societies are organized around simulation and the play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]". As such, in "...the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an image, a sign, a spectacle". For Baudrillard, the West's "commercialization of the whole world...will turn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world—its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into images, its semiological organization". As a result, the "previously separate domains of the [[economy]], art, politics, and sexuality" become "collapsed into each other", and art penetrates "all spheres of existence." Thus, Baudrillard argues that "[o]ur society has given rise to a general aestheticization: all forms of culture—not excluding anti-cultural ones—are promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation are taken on board".&lt;ref name="kellner"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Kellner |first= Douglas |editor= Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title= Jean Baudrillard |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2005/entries/baudrillard/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |edition= Summer 2005 |date= 2005-08-22 |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, [[Stanford University]] |location= Stanford, CA |issn= 1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiotic analysis===

====Still images====
When a person views an isolated painting, photograph or cartoon, they are viewing a static image. If a photographer takes a still photo of a police officer's struggle to arrest a young man, for example, the [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] meaning might be "there was a man dressed as a police officer placing his hand on the shoulder of another man of a certain age whilst a photographer took a picture". On the other hand, the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotative]] meanings might range from, "law enforcement in action" to "a heroic fight to subdue a dangerous terrorist about to release [[sarin gas]]", to "police use excessive force to arrest non-violent protesters", to "fancy dress party ends badly".  The attribution of the specific [[subtext]] is left to the caption writer, the text accompanying the photo, and the audience.

Critic [[Susan Sontag]] argued that, through repeated exposure, certain well-known photographs have become "ethical reference points", such as the many images depicting the victims and liberation of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] (1977).  From this perspective, the subtext of such images, though still connotatively open to interpretation, has been somewhat restrained by familiarity, predominant cultural beliefs regarding the [[Holocaust]], and perhaps by overusage.

=====News reporting=====
If there is a motion picture or video recording of the previously described scenario of a police officer arresting a man, the filmmakers, videographers, and editors may reframe this scene, by fragmenting the recording, depicting it from different vantage points, editing the material, and reassembling these components. A film editor can produce a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] sequence of intercut, edited images, which forces the audience to interpret those images according to a different set of [[semiotic]] rules. Even without editing or alteration, a film or video recordings' ''[[mise en scène]]'' and non-verbal signs become much more explicit and enable the audience to attribute meaning to the scenario.
 
The [[value (Semiotics)|value]] of this video as a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] will be determined by its relation to the other signifiers in the system. Thus, if the video is included in a reputable television news program, it will acquire a greater claim to be indexical and its status is more likely to be considered reliable "evidence" of real world events. In semiotic terms, the words spoken by the television presenter will be symbolic, and the images will have both iconic and indexical qualities.

The "semiotic value" of the video will change if it is transposed into a polemical or satirical programme, presented by a commentator, or screened with on-screen captions (e.g., "Crime Wave in the Streets", or "Protesters Brutalized by Police"). These substitute contexts form [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] indicators that may help the viewer to assess the plausibility, credibility, or truthfulness of the content. The violence shown on-screen can be '''aestheticized''' by the values of the symbolical signs used by the news presenter, by captions placed on-screen, or by the relations with other signifiers in the same programme (e.g., if the arrest video is preceded by a report about "antisocial and criminal behaviour").

=====Fictional film or video=====
If a film or television director staged a similar fictional scene, the audience will be predisposed to consider it less "real". They know that the scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives. Hence, the lighting, makeup, costumes, acting methods, cutting, and [[soundtrack]] music selection are understood to be combined to inform the audience about the film maker's intentions.

The [[culture industry]]'s mass-produced texts and images about crime, violence, and war have been consolidated into [[genres]]. Film makers typically choose from a predictable range of narrative [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s and use [[stereotype]]d  characters, and [[cliché]]d symbols and metaphors. Over time, certain styles and conventions of filming and editing are standardised within a medium or a genre. Some conventions tend to naturalise the content and  make it seem more real. Other methods deliberately breach convention to create an effect, such as the canted angles, rapid edits, and slow motion shots used in films with aestheticized violence.

=====Analysis of selected films=====
{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}
* ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'': In this 1988 film, filmmaker [[Jonathan Kaplan]] stages a graphic rape scene to consider the moral and legal quality of the fictional spectators who, while not engaging in the rape, nevertheless shouted encouragement to those that were.
* ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'': Matthew Crowder analyzes the aestheticization of violence in ''Strange Days'', a film by director [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (1995). A scene graphically depicts the rape of a woman; it is "...filmed in real-time using a first-person subjective camera". ''Strange Days'' tells the story of Lenny Nero, who sells an illegal, futuristic technology that allows people to record their sensory experiences onto a minidisc, so that other people can "play back" these sensory experiences and have them "wired" directly into their brain.
**In the film, Max records his rape of Iris, and gives the recording to the unsuspecting Lenny. When the "perpetrator of violence [Max] is given control of the cinematic apparatus", this is "referencing films such as ''Peeping Tom'' (Michael Powell, 1959) and ''Halloween'' (Carpenter, 1978)". Like "''Peeping Tom's'' psychopathic killer, Max does seem to see himself as some kind of artist, recording the rape and sending it to Lenny". 
**The "...first person perspective the filming of the rape scene is unrelenting, the camera never turns away from the fear and panic of Iris whose body is not only slung about by the unknown killer but also subjected to an unflinching gaze that the audience is punished with too, made complicit in the rape by their passivity". Crowder argues that "[t]he entire notion of the subjective camera—an aesthetic element of the film—its scopophilic, voyeuristic and sadistic nature, is revealed in all its depravity". As such, "[t]he aesthetic experience of the [rape] scene is one of shock, horror, dislocation and passivity at the way the camera represents the helpless body of Iris as no more than an object".
**The film's use of "playback" clips, as in the rape scene, causes a "...stylistic disruption of Hollywood codes and an even more important aesthetic effect: the disruption of the normal codes of identification with character and narrative".&lt;ref name="crowder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |title=Aesthetics and Politics: Strange Days |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Crowder |first=Matthew |year=2006 |work=Saving The World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822044114/http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |archivedate=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bigelow was criticized for the rape scene by [[Carla Peterson (academic)|Carla Peterson]], in her article "Director joins boys' club -- and it only costs her compassion" (1995).  Crowder claims that Peterson attacked ''Strange Days'' "... as misogynist and offensive because she [Peterson] feels that it tries to create an unproblematic, if slightly uncomfortable, spectacle out of rape". As such, Crowder argues that Peterson "... fails to see that the film concerns more than a logical narrative (which if anything grows increasingly incoherent)" and claims that Peterson has "...misread the scene out of context" and dismissed "...textual elements that clearly signal criticism of both Hollywood and the cinematic apparatus as a tool of masculinist domination".
**Crowder "challenge[s] whether Peterson's response is actually aesthetic, as she makes little reference to communication between work and audience". In contrast, Crowder interprets ''Strange Days'' in a feminist context, which he argues is "...perhaps its most persuasive aesthetic effect". Crowder holds that "...''Strange Days'' can be seen as a self-conscious discourse on cinema and that part of this discourse concerns the act of aesthetic judgement". Furthermore, he states that the film's "narrative can be seen to allegorise the problem of aesthetics and value".&lt;ref name="crowder" /&gt;
* ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'': ''A Clockwork Orange'' is a 1971 film written, directed, and produced by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and based on the novel of the same name by [[Anthony Burgess]]. Set in a futuristic England (circa 1995, as imagined in 1965), it follows the life of a teenage gang leader named Alex. In Alexander Cohen's analysis of Kubrick's film, he argues that the "ultra-violence" of the young protagonist, Alex, "...represents the breakdown of culture itself". In the film, gang members are "...[s]eeking idle de-contextualized violence as entertainment" as an escape from the emptiness of their [[dystopia]]n society.
**Cohen claims that in the film, "...the violence of modern technology sees its reflection in Ultraviolence, beyond violence". When the protagonist murders a woman in her home, Cohen states that Kubrick presents a "[s]cene of aestheticized death" by setting the murder in a room filled with "...modern art which depict scenes of sexual intensity and bondage"; as such, the scene depicts a "...struggle between high-culture which has aestheticized violence and sex into a form of autonomous art, and the very image of post-modern mastery".&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |title=Clockwork Orange and the Aestheticization of Violence |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Cohen |first=Alexander J. |year=1998 |publisher=UC Berkeley Program in Film Studies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515160450/http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |archivedate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery and location ==
The graffito was discovered in 1857 when a building called the ''domus Gelotiana'' was unearthed on the [[Palatine Hill]]. The emperor [[Caligula]] had acquired the house for the imperial palace, which, after Caligula died, became used as a ''Paedagogium'' ([[boarding school]]) for the imperial [[Page (occupation)|page boys]]. Later, the street on which the house sat was walled off to give support to extensions to the buildings above, and it thus remained sealed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L Cutts, ''History of Early Christian Art'', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0766187217&amp;id=zayvAvrH0EwC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=alexamenos&amp;sig=c0NKzmLfgS0qKD4rnXygRrjwcDQ#PPA200,M1 p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
The inscription is usually taken to be a mocking depiction of a [[Christian]] in the act of worship.&lt;ref name="Drum"&gt;{{cite CE1913 |wstitle=The Incarnation |last=Drum |first=Walter |volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, [[Paganism|pagans]] derided Christians for worshipping a man who had been crucified.&lt;ref name="Drum" /&gt; The donkey's head and crucifixion would both have been considered insulting depictions by contemporary Roman society. Crucifixion continued to be used as an execution method for the worst criminals until its abolition by the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the 4th century, and the impact of seeing a figure on a cross is comparable to the impact today of portraying a man with a [[hangman's noose]] around his neck or seated in an [[electric chair]].&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], ''What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?'', 1997, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0802844456&amp;id=gCsD4nkYeEQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA46&amp;lpg=RA1-PA46&amp;ots=RHxAOLTOZu&amp;dq=jesus+cross+hangman%27s+noose&amp;sig=CW0apVCcpX004HDLNDeD8vIJTKk p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems to have been commonly believed at the time that Christians practiced ''[[onolatry]]'' (donkey-worship). That was based on the misconception that Jews worshipped a god in the form of a donkey, a claim made by [[Apion]] (30-20 BC – c. AD 45-48):&lt;ref&gt;from ''Against Apion'' book II, 7, written by Josephus.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] writes:

{{quote|Apion ought to have had a regard to these facts; unless he had himself had either an ass's heart, or a dog's impudence: of such a dog I mean as they worship.

[[Origen]] reports in his treatise ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' that the pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] made the same claim against Christians and Jews:&lt;ref&gt;BOOK VII CHAP. XL.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For the sake of such a monstrous delusion, and in support of those wonderful advisers, and those wonderful words which you address to the lion, to the amphibious creature, to the creature in the form of an ass, and to others, for the sake of those divine doorkeepers..&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04167.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tertullian]], writing in the late 2nd or early 3rd century, reports that Christians, along with Jews, were accused of worshipping such a deity. He also mentions an [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostate Jew]] who carried around [[Carthage]] a [[caricature]] of a Christian with ass's ears and hooves, labeled ''Deus Christianorum {{Polytonic|ὀνοκοίτης}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticum_becker.htm|title=Tertulliani Apologeticum}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("The God of the Christians conceived of an ass.").&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''[[Apologeticum]]'', [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/bindley_apol/bindley_apol.htm#44 16, 1 and 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that both the graffito and the roughly contemporary gems with Crucifixion images are related to [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical groups]] outside [[Catholic Church|the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

A small minority of scholars consider the image to be not of Jesus, but of some other deity.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hudson MacLean, An introduction to Greek epigraphy of the Hellenistic and Roman periods from Alexander the Great down to the reign of Constantine, University of Michigan Press, 2002, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image, Alexamenos is portrayed [[veneration|venerating]] an image of the [[crucifix]], a detail that [[Peter Maser]] believed to represent actual Christian practice of veneration of icons. This practice, however, was not known to be a part of Christian worship until the 4th or 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Balch, Carolyn Osiek, ''Early Christian Families in Context: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN080283986X&amp;id=VjMdbpzLhRQC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=alexamenos&amp;sig=wy9th3yPkBtg4frS_T26iK4_8lo#PPA103,M1 p. 103, footnote 83]&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Alexamenos fidelis" ==
In the next chamber, another inscription in a different hand reads &lt;small&gt;ΑΛΕξΑΜΕΝΟϹ FIDELIS&lt;/small&gt; (''Alexamenos fidēlis''), Latin for "Alexamenos is faithful" or "Alexamenos the faithful".&lt;ref name="CathEncy grafitti"&gt;{{cite CE1913 |wstitle= Graffiti |first= Maurice M. |last= Hassett |volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a riposte by an unknown party to the mockery of Alexamenos represented in the graffito.&lt;ref name="p. 244" /&gt;

== Ancient civilization ==
'''Ancient''' is defined as an early historical period that is identified by the dawn of the oldest known civilizations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ancient|title=Definition of ANCIENT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ancient history]] is the study of life and events during this period in early history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ancient|title=Definition of ANCIENT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Civilizations that fall under classification of ancient are: Ancient Greece (800 B.C. and 500 B.C,) The [[Inca Empire|Incas]] (1438 A.D – 1532 A.D,)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-ancient-civilizations-2079395|title=List of ancient civilizations|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aztecs]] (1345 A.D – 1521 A.D),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (550 BC – 465 B.C,) &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; the [[Ancient Persian religion|Persians (]]550 BC – 465 B.C),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Ancient China|Chinese]] civilization (1600 BCE-1046 BCE,) &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] civilization (2600 BC-900 A.D,)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Ancient Egypt]] (3100 BCE-2686 BCE), &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley civilization]] (3300 BC -1900 BC)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] (3500 BC -500 BC.) &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Ancient Greek aesthetics ==
Ancient or '''archaic Greece''' is classified as the time period between 800 B.C. and 500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/ancient-greece|title=Ancient Greece|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greeks Gods====

Influence of beauty was derived from their Gods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Greek Gods and Goddesses of Greek mythology|Greek gods]] were believed to take a divine human form and inspired their perception of divine beauty. Temples were created in Greece to worship these gods and were filled with life-like images of them. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/howartmadetheworld/episodes/human/greece/|title=How Art Made the World .

==== Form ====
Ancient Greeks were fixated on the aesthetic form of the human body.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This ideal was captured through the art of this era. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;Sculptures were inspired initially by the monumental art of the Ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; Sculptures were perceived to be at their peak of aesthetics when the human form was captured in a unique way and emphasizing a divine or godlike quality. Proportion, poise and perfection of the human form were the artistic and aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Sculpture/|title=Ancient Greek Sculpture|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and bronze monuments are iconic of this civilization. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Antoine-Félix Bouré''' (8 July 1831 – 8 April 1883&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Marchal, ''La sculpture et les chefs-d'œuvre de l'orfèvrerie belges'' (Brussels, 1895), p. 696. Information in this article not otherwise cited comes from Marchal.&lt;/ref&gt;), known in his own time as '''Félix Bouré''' but sometimes found in modern scholarship as '''Antoine Bouré''',&lt;ref&gt;Bouré signed himself as ''Ant. Félix Bouré'' on at least two of his works, ''L'enfant au lézard'' and the pair of lions known as ''Totor et Tutur''. The critic [[Camille Lemonnier]], who knew him  personally through the [[Société Libre des Beaux-Arts]], calls him "Félix Bouré."&lt;/ref&gt; was a Belgian sculptor, best known for his [[monumental sculpture|monumental]] lions.

==Life and career==
Bouré was born in [[Brussels]] as the [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian war of independence]] was drawing to a close. He studied locally first under [[Guillaume Geefs]]&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Wauters, ''Catalogue illustré de l'Exposition rétrospective de l'art belge organisée par la Societé Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles'' (Brussels, 1905), p. 11; Marchal, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; and then from 1846 to 1852&lt;ref&gt;Arto Dictionnaire, "Bouré, Antoine-Félix," [http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/02_LEXICON/01_LEXICON_DETAIL.cfm?LETTER=B&amp;LEX=919 biography.]&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Eugène Simonis]] at the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts|Royal Academy for Fine Art]], going abroad to complete his training at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Academy of Fine Arts at Florence]]. In his studies, he followed the same course as his older brother, [[Paul Bouré]]. Paul died in his mid-twenties when Antoine-Félix was only 17.&lt;ref&gt;Marchal, pp. 696.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré was among the artists whose work was exhibited at the Musée Bovie, a ''grand maison'' built by the painter [[Virginie Bovie]] on the Rue de Trône, Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie ten Bokum, ''Art&amp;fact: Revue des historiens de l'art, des archéologues, des musicologues et des orientalistes de l'Université de Liège'' 24 (2005), [http://www.artfact.ulg.ac.be/revue/be/ten_bokum/index.html retrieved] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132307/http://www.artfact.ulg.ac.be/revue/be/ten_bokum/index.html |date=6 July 2011 }} 25 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, he was one of sixteen co-founders of the [[Société Libre des Beaux-Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;Arto Dictionnaire, "Bouré, Antoine-Félix," [http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/02_LEXICON/01_LEXICON_DETAIL.cfm?LETTER=B&amp;LEX=919 biography.]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[avant-garde]] society that provided exhibition space alternative to that of the official Salon in Belgium. The [[manifesto]] of the society espoused the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realist]] principle of "free and individual interpretation of nature" along with [[avant-garde|avant-gardist]] ideals of "struggle, change, freedom, progress, originality and tolerance" that were inspired by [[Courbet]] and [[Baudelaire]]. "Modernity" and "sincerity" were keywords.

Bouré was a friend of [[Auguste Rodin]], who worked on a number of projects in Brussels throughout the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Verbraeken, "Histoire de la sculpture en Belgique," [http://fr.artquid.com/page/65/histoire-de-la-sculpture-en-belgique.html  ArtQuid.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, Bouré was one of two Belgian sculptors who offered testimony on behalf of the 36-year-old Rodin during a controversy over ''The Vanquished'', a life-sized male nude modeled after a Belgian soldier that was later retitled ''[[The Age of Bronze]]''. Rodin had been accused of assembling the work from [[plaster cast]]s rather than modeling it from life; Bouré confirmed Rodin's work methods from his own observations in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;The Rodin-Web, in cooperation with the [[Musée Rodin]], Rodin Nude Photo Project, "Rodin Works: The Age of Bronze (''The Conquered One, The Vanquished''), [http://www.rodin-web.org/works/1875_age_bronze.htm  retrieved] 23 July 2010; Catherine Lampert, ''Rodin: Sculpture and Drawings'' (Yale University Press, 1987), p. 22 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fky-j_RgN2EC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Félix+Bouré+Louvre&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Yb1eTJrzJcH-8Aa59dW3DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bouré&amp;f=false online.] Lampert describes Bouré's efforts as "letters of support."

Bouré's reputation rests primarily on his large sculptural lions, characterized by their athletic musculature and majestic air.&lt;ref&gt;Marchal, p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these is the colossal lion that sits atop the [[Gileppe Dam]] "like a cat on a garden wall."&lt;ref&gt;Adolph Kemna, "Purification of Water for Domestic Use: European Practice," ''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'' 54 (1905), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gileppe lion stands 13.5 meters tall (around 44 feet).&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Barrage_de_la_Gileppe_805.jpg  information sign] at the dam and most other sources. Its height is sometimes given as 43 feet in Anglophone sources; see for instance General Commissariat of Belgium, ''Belgium, Its Institutions, Industries and Commerce'' (Brussels, 1904), p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Weighing 130 [[tonne]]s, it was constructed from 183 blocks of sandstone brought to the site by horse-drawn carts.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Stéphany, ''La Belgique en cent coups d'oeil'' (Éditions Racine, 2006), p. 202. Marchal, p. 696, notes 243 blocks, but the informational sign at the dam confirms Stéphany's figure of 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré also sculpted the colossal lion [[Bronze sculpture|in bronzed zinc]] at the Leopold Gate in Brussels; the pair at the entrance to the ''Palais de Justice'' in [[Charleroi]], known as ''Totor et Tutur''; and other lions throughout Brussels, including those in the garden of the [[Palace of Academies|Palais des Académies]] and four along the [[Rue Royale, Brussels|Rue Royale]]. Some of his lions were produced in tabletop versions.&lt;ref&gt;Glerum auctioneers listed an example of a 45cm tabletop [http://www.glerum.nl/cms2/kavels/263_115.jpg lion] ([http://www.glerum.nl/catalogus.php?pagina_nummer=5&amp;id=6&amp;lang=nl retrieved] 23 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré's interest in leonine subject matter places him in company with ''[[Animalier|les animaliers]]'', the 19th-century French sculptors led by [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] who made animals the focus of their work rather than relegating them to the background.&lt;ref&gt;National Museum of Wildlife Art artist biography, [http://www.wildlifeart.org/artists/artistDetails/index.php?aID=362 retrieved] 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the sculptor [[Léon Mignon]] (1847–1898) and [[Jacques de Lalaing (artist)|Jacques de Lalaing]] (1858–1917), Bouré helped establish a distinctively Belgian tradition of animal art, to which the flourishing [[Antwerp Zoo]] contributed inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Verbraeken, [http://fr.artquid.com/page/65/histoire-de-la-sculpture-en-belgique.html  ArtQuid]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other work for which Bouré is most noted shows a strikingly different side of the artist. The white marble ''Le lézard'' or ''L'enfant au lezard'', not quite 4 feet long and about 2 feet high (overall 61.5 by 118.5 by 39&amp;nbsp;cm), depicts a nude boy lying on his stomach, ankles crossed, resting on his left elbow with his right hand cocked inquisitively as he directs his absorbed gaze down at a small lizard.

''Souple'' ("supple") is a recurring term of praise for the work, found also in Marchal and even de Hauranne (see following), in whom the work otherwise excited no great admiration.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le lézard'' was not uniformly admired. One critic noted its "poverty of imagination" and thinness of execution, while admitting other qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Duvergier de Hauranne, "Le Salon de 1874," ''Revue des deux mondes'' 3 (1874), p. 694 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ocNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=Bouré+lézard&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0mVKTOfEPM__nAezyqTjDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDhk#v=onepage&amp;q=Bouré%20lézard&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré's child recalls in some aspects the [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] ("Apollo the Lizard-Slayer"), an often-reproduced figure in [[classical antiquity]] of the pubescent god observing a lizard as it climbs up a tree. The original bronze was attributed to the Athenian sculptor [[Praxiteles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''Natural History'' 34.69–70) says the original was a bronze by [[Praxiteles]]: "he made a pubescent Apollo sneaking up with an arrow for hand-to-hand combat with a lizard as it crawls from below, which they call ''Sauroctonos''" (''fecit et puberem Apollinem subrepenti lacertae comminus sagitta insidiantem, quem sauroctonon vocant''); the 1st-century poet [[Martial]] alludes to the statue type in the couplet ''Sauroctonos Corinthius'' ("Corinthian Lizard-Slayer," ''Epigrams'' 14.172): "Spare the lizard creeping toward you, sneaky boy: she desires to perish on your fingers":&lt;br&gt;
:''Ad te reptanti, puer insidiose, lacertae
::''Parce: cupit digitis illa perire tuis''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Louvre]] acquired a white marble version in 1807. The sculpture received attention in French-language books on art published while Bouré was active, including [[Émile Gebhart]]'s ''Praxitèle'' (1864) and [[Wilhelm Fröhner]]'s ''Notice de la sculpture antique du Musée Impérial du Louvre'' (1878). If an image of the ''Sauroctonos'' is rotated and flipped horizontally, the compositional resemblances with Bouré's ''L'enfant au lézard'' become more evident. The Apollo's overall height of nearly 5 feet, which includes the tree trunk extending past the body, gives the figure a vertical proportion comparable to that of Bouré's 4-foot horizontal boy.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre Atlas database, [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=20235&amp;langue=en Apollo Sauroctonos.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical iconography, a lizard may also appear with Eros, and the Louvre Eros is thought to have originally held a small creature in its hand.&lt;ref&gt;Based on depictions of [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Dionysus]] with a lizard, some scholars have suggested that the Apollo type preserved by the Louvre example would've been armed with a sort of [[lasso|lariat]] or noose instead of or in addition to a dart; discussion in Jean Sorabella, "Eros and the Lizard: Children, Animals, and Roman Funerary Sculpture," ''Constructions of Childhood in Ancient Greece and Italy'' (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 2007), pp. 353ff.

(Lemmonier), "Correspondance," ''La Chronique des arts'', p. 128. For Bouré's Roman subject matter, see [[Antoine-Félix Bouré#Historical figures|Historical figures]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the subject matter seems out of keeping with Bouré's monumental and public works, his friend Rodin was also sculpting children during his time in Belgium in the 1870s, when Bouré was a visitor to his studio. Several years later, Rodin produced the bronze ''Les enfants au lézard'' (''Children with a Lizard''), depicting a little girl who retreats to her older sister's arms in fear of the small lizard below. Despite a similarity of subject matter, the work bears little resemblance to Bouré's sinuous reclining figure. Rodin's approach to representing children as "well-fed babies" has been related to his practice in drawing [[cupid]]s ([[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]]) for various two-dimensional media.&lt;ref&gt;Albert E.

The '''Arab Regional Centre for World Heritage''' (French: centre régional arabe pour le patrimoine mondial ; Arabic: المركز الإقليمي العربي للتراث العالمي) is a Category 2 Centre under the auspices of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;The Arab Regional Centre for World Heritage (ARC-WH) was established by the General  Conference of UNESCO at its 35th session in 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; founded as an autonomous and independent Bahraini public institution in 2010.

The ARC-WH purpose is to reinforce the implementation of the [[World Heritage Convention]] in the Arab States region, by enhancing the knowledge of it, promoting the Operational Guidelines and the cooperating among the States Parties of the Arab States region.

ARC-WH is meant to respond to the provisions of the '''Global Strategy for a Representative, Balanced and Credible World Heritage List''' is also intended to assist the implementation of the '''Global Training Strategy for World Cultural and Natural Heritage''' (Helsinki, 2001).

ARC-WH has 18 member States: [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Tunisia]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Yemen]].

The main objective of ARC-WH is to assist States Parties in the implementation of the World Heritage Convention in the Arab States region along three main major axes : '''information''', '''assistance''', '''logistical &amp; financial'''.

==History==

The Arab Regional Centre for World Heritage was established by the Royal Decree issued on 16 December 2010, following the General Conference of UNESCO at its 35th session in 2009. The two legislative chambers ratified the agreement between UNESCO and the Government of Bahrain. The agreement following the decision of the General Conference (35th session)
was signed in February 2010 by the Director-General of UNESCO, [[Irina Bokova]] and the Culture Minister of Bahrain [[Sh. Mai Bint Muhammad Al Khalifa|Sh. Mai Bint Mohammed Al Khalifa]].

As of 23 December 2011, all formalities related to the Agreement were completed upon the receipt of the letter of enforcement by UNESCO. Following the entry into force of the Agreement, the first meeting of the Governing Board was held on 28 April 2012 for the approval of the internal regulations, recruit the founding team of the Centre and approve the first year work plan.

==Activities==

ARC-WH will organize its activities along three main axes:

1. The provision of information relating to the World Heritage Convention and its application, including development and management of an Arabic language website, the translation and publication of relevant documents, and promotion of the establishment of new conservation programmes at universities, in all the Arab region States.

2. The provision of assistance to States Parties in the region to improve their ability to implement the WH Convention (including understanding of WH policy, concepts, rules of procedure, preparation of tentative lists, preparation of nominations, monitoring of state of conservation, education programmes etc.) by facilitating organization of appropriate WH
training at ARC-WH’s premises or anywhere else in the region, and responding to State Party requests for assistance.

3. The provision of logistical and financial support for regional activities in support of the WH Convention including hosting of meetings, conferences, training workshops or exhibitions in the region; the identification of appropriate facilities and services (lecture rooms, equipment, competent translators, etc.) for planned meetings for the WH Centre and other international institutions in the region, and the raising of funds to support World Heritage activities in the region.

==Related International Agencies==
ARC-WH will meet its objectives in close coordination with existing international, regional and national agencies, initiatives
and programmes concerned with World Heritage in the Arab States region including but not limited to:

• international organizations such as [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, and in particular, its ATHAR programme to “protect and promote the rich cultural heritage in the Arab region”; [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature); [[ICOMOS]] (International Council on Monuments and Sites)

• regional organizations such as [[ALECSO]] (The Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization), Tunisia; [[ROPME]] (Regional Organisation for the Protection of the Marine Environment – Kuwait; [[UNEP]], and [[PERSGA]] (Regional Organization for the Conservation of the Environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden-Jeddah);

• national conservation agencies (the various Departments and Directorates of Antiquities in the region), and national conservation organisations such as [[CULTNAT]] (Centre for Documentation of Cultural and Natural Heritage), Egypt, affiliated with Bibliotheca Alexandrina and supported by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of Egypt), and [[CERKAS]] (Centre de Restauration et de Rehabilitation de zones atlasiques et sub-atlasiques), Morocco.

The '''Atlas Fountain''' stands in the grounds of [[Castle Howard]], [[North Yorkshire]], England.  It has been designated a Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[listed building]] and is now recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]], maintained by [[Historic England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1148973|desc=Atlas Fountain and Pond|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Atlas Fountain and pond dates from 1850. It was exhibited at [[The Great Exhibition]] prior to installation.&lt;ref&gt;Castle Howard Guidebook, G. Howard. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed by [[William Andrews Nesfield]] and the sculpted figures were carved in Portland stone by [[John Thomas (sculptor)|John Thomas]] who was paid £1183 10s 3d (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1183.5|1853|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for his work. The figures were transported by rail from London to [[Castle Howard railway station]].

The tazza, pedestals, shells and basin were made by local craftsmen. The water engineering was completed by James Easton,&lt;ref&gt;English Gardens and Landscapes, Christopher Hussey. 1700–1750, Country Life. 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; taking water from a stream in [[Coneysthorpe]] and using a steam engine to pump it uphill to the Ray Wood reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Fountains and Water Features: From Ancient Springs to Modern Marvels. Rosalind Hopwood, Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain was turned on for the first time in October 1853.

The fountain was overhauled in 1983 and again by The Earth Stone and Lime in 2012.

==Description==

A large globe of bronze dominates the fountain supported on the shoulders of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]. Four recumbent [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]] blow water through shells over [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] kneeling on a pedestal in the central tazza. Other jets fill the lower scallop shell basins, which overflow into the central basin producing a dramatic cascade of white water.

The fountain is fed from the half-million gallon Ray Wood reservoir, to the east of the main house. Gravity feeds water into a chamber beneath the pond basin where pipes direct it to the main outlets in the Triton's shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/DB/Latest-News/Atlas-Fountain-Restoration.html |title=Atlas Fountain Restoration :: Castle Howard – Historic Estate, House and Gardens, Yorkshire |publisher=Castle Howard |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091434/http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/DB/Latest-News/Atlas-Fountain-Restoration.html |archivedate=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pond is approximately {{convert|27|m|ft}} in diameter.

'''''Basodee: An Anthology Dedicated to Black Youth''''' (2012), edited by Fiona Raye Clarke, is a youth-created and youth-centred anthology created by a Black writing collective in honour of [[Black History Month]], and authentic diversity in Canada. It highlights the [[Black Canadian]] experience and to promote awareness about the complexities of contemporary Black youth experience in [[Ontario Canada|Ontario]].

The book consists of a foreword by the President of the Ontario Black History Society, Rosemary Sadlier, [[OOnt]] and work by various youth on issues of identity, belonging, and Canadian Black History.

The anthology was created in partnership with the Office of the Provincial Advocate of Children and Youth in Ontario a commission of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] which puts youth at its centre and uses rights to improve the lives and conditions of youth in systems of care in Ontario. The anthology was started in January 2012 and was published by General Store Publishing House in July 2012.

The title "Basodee" comes from the Trinidadian creole word of the same name meaning "half-conscious" and "disoriented." The term was chosen as the title of the book to express the confusion and identity crisis of Black Canadian youth.

The book consists of photography, essays, short stories and poetry by 13 youth expressing what it is to be young, Black and Canadian. Many are immigrants to the country or first-generation Canadians. Some have had experience with the mental health or criminal justice system and some are in care. Each shares their personal stories and views on what it means to be Black and Canadian today.

==Context==
''Basodee'' makes its debut at a time when concern about escalating gun violence in the City of Toronto such as the shooting at the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] on June 2, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1205036--shooting-reported-at-eaton-centre |title=One dead, seven injured in Eaton Centre shooting |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2012-06-03|accessdate=2012-09-27 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] on July 16, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=07/17/2012 12:01 am Updated: 07/20/2012 12:44 pm |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/07/17/shyanne-charles-joshua-yasay-danzig-shooting-_n_1678359.html |title=Shyanne Charles, Joshua Yasay, Identified As Victims Killed In Toronto Block Party Shooting (PHOTOS) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in statements by Toronto Mayor [[Rob Ford]] that he wishes to force individuals convicted of a gun charge out of the city and more money from the province during a 'gun summit' for "anti-crime" initiatives such as the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/tavis |title=Toronto Police Service :: To Serve and Protect |publisher=Torontopolice.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which places increased police presence in priority neighbourhoods.

In response to the July 16 shooting, the Toronto Star published a cartoon by Michael de Adder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadder.net |title=Home |publisher=de Adder |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; cartoon depicting a little black girl's alleged "expected" injuries before the age of two -"boo boo from highchair, mark from tricycle, and head laceration from a medium-caliber bullet."  After numerous complaints the Star apologized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/corrections/article/1230430—apology|title=Apology|publisher=Thestar.com|accessdate=2012-09-27|location=Toronto|date=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the cartoon's insensitivity to the complex issues at play in gun violence. It is media sanctioned expressions of negative stereotypes like these that ''Basodee'' tries to fight, using the voices of many of the youth these stereotypes and top-down solutions attempt to silence.

When many expressions of a voice other than the mainstream Canadian voice are being squelched and co-opted, such as ''Sway Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swaymag.ca |title=Sway Magazine |publisher=Swaymag.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Caribana]] due to economic considerations and a clear climate of devaluation of diversity, the Basodee collective comes together to bring true diversity back to the Canadian cultural milieu and show youth commitment to celebrations such as [[Black History Month]], which are  often seen as outdated and unnecessary in a post-racial "multicultural" society such as Toronto. Michael de Adder and Rob Ford's comments and many of the pieces in ''Basodee'', however, prove that Toronto is very much a race conscious city and is no where near embracing multiculturalism as many have been publicly threatened by the chief city official with exile.

Some of the major themes in ''Basodee'' include identity, struggle and belonging. The book argues that part of the "basodeeness" of Black youth stems from "mis-education" about their history. The term "mis-education" is borrowed from [[Carter G. Woodson]]'s book [[The Mis-Education of the Negro]]. ''Basodee'' contains essays outlining the history of discrimination  in the Canadian education system against Blacks and the present struggle for solutions to this ongoing discrimination such as the establishment of the Africentric Alternative School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2009/09/08/africentric-alternative-school.html |title=Africentric school opens in Toronto - Toronto - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also contains an essay tracing a history of Canadian human rights abuses against Blacks extending into the present day. ''Basodee'' argues that this history which is seldom spoken about form a major part of Black youth's basodeness. When many Black youth feel that dropping out of school and turning to a life of crime are the only way to protect themselves from discrimination and secure against mainstream attempts to erode their identity.

Given this real struggle of Black youth to safeguard their identity, the main thesis of ''Basodee'' is that Black youth in Canada have not been given a place of belonging in Canadian society, despite being here for generations and even since the time of slavery. Thus, the book presents examples from its contributors of how to find that identity – such as remembering where you came from, the struggles you have gone through, and undergoing [[negrescence]].

==Purpose==
The collective hopes that ''Basodee'' will one day become a resource to Black youth struggling to find themselves in the midst of media stereotypes, threats of exile, and stigmatization. In partnering with the Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, the collective hopes to get the book in the hands of youth in the system who need the ideas it explores the most – Crown wards, youth in detention centres, and youth in care. The collective is currently looking for more organizations that work with Black youth as part of their mandate to share the book and also partner with in the future.

'''Bird stones''' are [[prehistoric]], [[abstract art|abstract]] stone carvings made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. The artifacts were a common inclusion in graves and thought to have ceremonial importance. They are noted for their distinctive simplicity and beauty. They first appeared in the middle [[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic period]] around 5,000 years ago and continued into the early [[Woodland period]] to about 2,500 years before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rslive.bslcore.com/article.php?aid=3906&amp;cid=3|title=The Enigmatic Birdstone|website=www.rslive.bslcore.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact purpose of these artifacts is not known, but most have a small hole drilled at the base of the neck and another at the aft end, presumably for mounting. Some theories suggest they were part of an [[atlatl]] (a short rod to hurl spears), in addition to their ceremonial uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/nat_amer/pre/htmls/a_weapons.html|title=Native Americans:Prehistoric:Archaic:Technology:Weapons|website=www.museum.state.il.us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that these artifacts were worn as decorative items denoting marriage status or pregnancy,&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodge|first1=Frederick Webb|title=Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico, Part 1|date=1907|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|location=Washington, DC|pages=148–149|url=https://archive.org/stream/americanindians00hodggoog#page/n2/mode/2up|ref=Hodge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[totem]]s representing tribes.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=George X.|title=The Significance of the So-Called Bird-Stone|journal=American Antiquity|date=January 1936|volume=1|issue=3|page=225|doi=10.2307/275148|jstor=275148|ref=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird stones were mostly made east of the [[Mississippi]], and the thousands in existence have been found primarily in New York, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Micropædia, Vol II at p36&lt;/ref&gt; The stones range in length from 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;inches, and have unique variations in style.

"The first Spanish [[printing press|press]] was set up in 1473 at [[Valencia]], where the German trading company of Ravensburg had an important base....

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11360">{{distinguish|Carbuncle Cup}} 
The '''Carbuncle Awards''' are [[architecture]] prizes, given by the Scottish magazine ''[[Urban Realm]]'', formerly ''Prospect'', presented to buildings and areas in Scotland intermittently since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles |title=Carbuncles |work=urbanrealm.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were established following a discussion about why policy initiatives to improve the quality of the built environment seemed to be having so little impact beyond the centres of Scotland’s key cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/carbuncles/2005/The_Carbuncle_Awards_2005.html |title=The Carbuncle Awards 2005 |work=urbanrealm.com |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the awards is derived from a comment by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], an outspoken critic of modern architecture, who in 1984 described [[Ahrends Burton Koralek]]'s proposed extension of London's [[National Gallery]] as a "monstrous [[carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration|title=Life after carbuncles|first=Jonathan|last=Glancey|date=17 May 2004|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|title=A speech by HRH The Prince of Wales at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace|accessdate=2014-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three award categories:
*Plook on the Plinth Award "for the most dismal town in Scotland". A "plook" is a Scottish noun for [[pimple]].
*The Pock Mark Award "for the worst planning decision".
*The Zit Building Award "for the worst building completed since the last awards".

Public nominations are made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners.

[[Cumbernauld]] in [[Lanarkshire]] has won the Plook on the Plinth Award twice and is the town most frequently nominated for the award.

The Carbuncle Awards inspired the [[Carbuncle Cup]], another [[architecture]] prize launched in 2006 and given annually by ''[[Building Design]]'' magazine to "the ugliest building in the [[United Kingdom]] completed in the last 12 months."&lt;ref name=bd2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/six-in-race-for-carbuncle-cup/5003099.article |title=Six in race for Carbuncle Cup |date=22 July 2010 |author=Watson, Anna |work=bdonline.co.uk |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has gone on to achieve somewhat greater prominence in the media.

'''Chinsō''' 頂相 (alternatively pronounced Chinzō) are commemorative portraits of [[Zen master|Zen masters]], a traditional form of East Asian art, specifically Zen art. They can be painted or sculpted and usually present a Zen master ceremonially dressed and seated upright in chair&lt;ref name="''baroni''"&gt;Baroni, Helen Josephine. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism. The Rosen Publishing, Group Inc, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;. Chinsō include realistic portraits of prominent Zen monks, possibly commissioned by them and painted while they were alive or shortly after they died, as well as depictions of famous Zen patriarchs from the past&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;commissioned by his disciples&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sherman E. Reflections of Reality in Japanese Art. The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Chinsō were believed to have been passed down by Zen masters to their disciples as a symbol of [[Dharma transmission|dharma transmission]], and known to have been meant for use in rituals, especially to represent the deceased during memorial services, and as an icon for their followers&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;. Before monks would die, they would sometimes write a simple poem in the upper part of their portrait called [[Eulogy|eulogy]], or have another author or monk write an inscription at the top. In Japan many remaining sculptural Buddhist chinsō are made out of wood, which may explain why so few remain in China and Korea on account of the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|Huichang persecution]] when most wooden sculptures perished&lt;ref&gt;Pat, Youngsook. Handbook of Korean Art Buddhist Sculpture. Yekyong Publishing Co, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the oldest surviving chinsō of Chan masters were brought from China to Japan; about 12 of those are extant&lt;ref name="''folk''"&gt;Foulk T. Griffith, Sharf Robert H. On the Ritual Use of Ch'an Portraiture in Medieval China. In: Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie, Vol. 7, 1993. pp. 149-219.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Background and History ==
[[File:Zhongfeng Mingben.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Chinese Monk Zhongfeng Mingben|332x332px]]Chinsō flourished during the [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960-1279) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1279-1368) dynasties in China, and were introduced in Japan during the Kamakura period (1185-1333). They are considered historically significant because of their antiquity, preservation and artistic quality&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. There are about 70 known surviving chinsō from China and Japan from the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries that are designated “national treasures,” but about ten times that number have survived in Japanese museums and temple collections&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;.

=== In China ===
[[File:Portrait of the Monk Zhongfeng Mingben, 14th century.jpg|thumb|Another portrait of Monk Zhongfeng Mingben|363x363px]]Chinsō emerged from mainstream traditions of Chinese portraiture during the Song dynasty (960-1279)&lt;ref name="''lippit''"&gt;Lippit, Yukio. “Negative Verisimilitude: The Zen Portrait in Medieval Japan.” In Asian Art History in the Twenty-First Century, edited by Vishaka Desai, 64-95. Williamstown: Sterling and Francine Clari Art Institute, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. Nothing visually distinguished them from other portraits done at the time of Chinese elite; the formal qualities were all the same&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Chinsō are mainly understood to follow this basic formula: the monk is seated cross legged in a chair, feet hidden, with his shoes on a footstool in front of him, in a three quarter view, and ceremonially dressed with inner and outer robes and a kasaya or surplice draped over his left shoulder&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The surplice is can be held together with an ornamental ring right over the monk’s heart&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. He usually holds something in his right hand, like a whisk, scepter, staff or bamboo&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. They follow the highest standard for painting at the time&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. As well as following the same basic formula of Chinese portraiture, chinsō assumed the characteristics of Chinese portraiture in general. These included private ownership, verse inscriptions, their role in social networks&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Surviving chinsō also include many works created in Japan once Zen Buddhism was brought there from China&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;.
[[File:Portrait of Zen Monk Ikkyū Sōjun (1394-1481).jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Japanese Monk Ikkyū Sōjun(1394-1481)|360x360px]]
[[File:Portrait of Ikkyū Sōjun.jpg|left|thumb|Another Portrait of Ikkyū Sōjun|160x160px]]
=== In Japan ===
When Zen Buddhism was brought to Japan from China, the Chinese style of portraiture as well as these traditions surrounding chinsō, were brought with them. This realistic style was not typical in Japan and set chinsō apart from other portraits at the time in Japan because of their high degree of verisimilitude&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Although most easily identifiable chinsō have the subject seated in a chair, in three quarter profile against a black background, with an inscription at the top, not all chinsō followed this rigid formula&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The portraits of Japanese monks Mokuan Shuyu and [[Ikkyū|Ikkyu Sojun]] represent this identifiable formula, but the alternative version of Ikkyu Sojun does not. Instead of being seated in three quarter view, the monk or patriarch could be shown frontally, or as a full figure, and could be in a circular frame instead of simply as a figure against a blank background. Less common are chinsō showing a monk in meditation in a landscape setting, where he could be either walking or sitting. Chinsō are usually inscribed at the top with a eulogy written in free verse, describing who the patriarch was, why it was made and possibly who wrote the eulogy and why. Some scholars distinguish chinsō from the soshizō 祖師像 category, which includes portraits of legendary patriarchs from the distant past, by checking whether or not the portrait is inscribed. It’s also important to note that the soshizō were not as realistic as the chinsō.
== Origin of the term chinsō ==
Chinsō, or dingxiang in Chinese, is a Chinese Buddhist neologism, and was originally a translation for the Sanskrit term [[Usnisa|uṣṇīṣa]]&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The usnisa is the term coined for the fleshy protuberance on top of the Buddha’s head&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. In India it was said to be invisible because it is unable to be seen by living beings&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. During the Song dynasty in China, the term chinsō began being used for portraits of Zen monks as we know the term today&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The existence of a protuberance on top of a Buddha’s head represented the fact he had reached enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj. The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development. Munshiram Manoharial Publishers, New Delhi, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;, similar to how chinsō were thought to prove enlightenment when passed down from a monk to his disciple. 

== Functions of chinsō ==
Chinsō have been known to serve many purposes throughout their history. The category includes portraits commissioned by the Zen monks themselves and painted while they are alive or shortly after they had died, and portraits commissioned by famous Zen patriarchs’ disciples to be used for worship. Scholars have also concluded that they could have been used as certificates or proof of dharma transmission&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. By proof of dharma transmission, it is meant that the portraits were thought to have been passed down from Zen master to their disciples when they became enlightened, since dharma transmission is the recognition of the enlightenment in a monk’s successor and the passing down of lineage. This theory has since been questioned by scholars&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Since the category of chinsō is so broad and includes portraits used for worship as well as portraits used to represent dharma transmission, the category could use stricter guidelines for classifying portrait as chinsō. The true function of chinsō is under questions by scholars for the purpose of clarifying the category&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;.

More recently (since about 1994) it has come to the attention of scholars that chinsō were used in a mortuary context, rather than used to certify or authenticate dharma transmission. This was particularly the case in China.  They were used after monks had died, meaning that they were used like other icons are: as a receptacle for a deity in a ritual context&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;, like objects of worship in temples. An article by T. Griffith Foulk and Robert Sharf published in 1994 attempted to demystify this part of Zen culture by clarifying that chinsō did not serve as evidence of dharma transmission but are simply a category of Buddhist portraiture used in a mortuary context&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Their inscriptions provide possible legitimization to lineage of transmission and possible affiliation, but are said to not have been given for the sole purpose of certifying enlightenment. This argument is supported by their claims that chinsō, unlike more important items for representing transmission like a monk’s robes, were passed out freely in China to “laymen, novices, merchants, and the like”&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Their argument goes on to say chinsō could have just been part of the regular gift giving tradition. Different recipients of chinsō include designated dharma heirs associated with specific linages, another meaningful relation to the monk, who received the portrait as a gift or an anonymous person who received the portrait at a fundraiser (a “hauzshu” in Chinese)&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The purpose and usage of chinsō is still in question by scholars. 
[[File:Statue of the monk Chikotsu Dai'e.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Monk Chikotsu Dai'e]]
Some dharma lineages have been heavily influenced by portraiture&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. For example, the Portrait of Chikotsu Dai’e established Chikotsu Dai’e 癡兀大慧 (1229-1312) as a disciple of the Chan monk Enni Ben’e 円爾弁円(1202-1280) because the inscription of the chinsō is similar to that of Enni Ben’en’s on his own portrait, and Enni’s is similar to that of his predecessor [[Wuzhun Shifan|Wuzun Shifan]] 無準師範 (1178-1249), a Chinese Chan monk&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The portrait of Wuzun Shih-fan was brought by his disciple Enni Ben’en to Japan in 1241 and is one of the oldest surviving chinsō&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Chikotsu Dai’e’s portrait thus establishes the genealogical sequence of Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni and then to Chikotsu&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Even though it is unclear if chinsō served as certificates of dharma transmission, throughout history they have been used to show a direct line of dharma transmission and lineage&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The portraits of these three monks show a clear acknowledgment of enlightenment from one monk to his disciple, from Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni Ben’en to Chikotsu Dai’e. Although each monk may not have passed down their chinsō to his disciple as proof of transmission, we can undertsand the history of lineage as being shown through the passing down of the portraits.

The [[Assembly of Vojvodina]] adopted the Coat of arms of Vojvodina on 28 June 2002. Coat of arms is based on the historical coat of arms of the [[Serbian Vojvodina]] from the flag of [[Zemun]] National Guard from 1848. The Assembly adopted the Traditional coat of arms on 15 September 2016.&lt;ref name=freeeurope/&gt;

==Description==
The three fields of the coat of arms of Vojvodina bear the coats of arms of 3 historic regions of Vojvodina, granted in the 18th century:

*[[Bačka]]. The coat of arms of Bačka was granted by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1657-1705) in 1699. It was later (1861) retained for the [[Bács-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog County]]. In blue field on a green grass stands [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] wearing blue shirt and brown toga with golden nimbus holding in dexter a downpointed silver sword with golden hilt and in sinister a black book (Bible). The Bačka-Bodrog county was divided between [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Hungary]] after [[World War I]]. The northern part of it was later incorporated into [[Bács-Kiskun]] county of Hungary, that also uses the coat of arms with [[St. Paul]] in its dexter half.
*[[Banat]]. The golden lion rampant on red holding a sabre was the coat of arms of the [[Banat of Temeswar]] (Serbian: Tamiški Banat). It was an [[Austria]]n crown land, its governor responding directly to the Emperor, and existed from 1718, when the area was taken over from the Ottoman Empire, to 1779, when it was abolished. The coat of arms of the Tamiš Banat is derived from the oldest arms of the [[Habsburg]] family, which were: Or a lion rampant gules armed langued and crowned azure. The arms denote the land as the Emperor's personal possession (hence the lion, only without the crown, and the colours, or and gules reversed and azure excluded, or in its place), which is situated at the border with the Ottoman Empire (hence the sabre in lion's paw). The coat of arms is nowadays used only in the part of Banat in [[Vojvodina]]. The coat of arms of the part of Banat in [[Romania]] is partly based on it, too: gules over waves azure a bridge with two arched openings or wherefrom issuing a demi-lion or holding a sabre in its right forepaw. Half of the lion also appears on the arms of [[Timiş County|Timiș County]] in Romania.
*[[Srem (region)|Srem]]. The third coat of arms is that of Srem, granted in 1747 by Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. The modern Croatian county of [[Vukovar-Syrmia County|Vukovar-Syrmia]] uses the same coat of arms. The three white stripes on blue, representing the three rivers of Srem: [[Bosut (river)|Bosut]], [[Sava]] and [[Danube]]. A deer rests close to a green poplar (topola) tree. The tree changed throughout history. In the original grant the tree was a cypress tree. The modern [[Croatia]]n design preferred it to make it an oak tree, which is abundant in the region and is a kind of a national symbol. Similarly, the poplar is connected to [[Serbia]] (The royal family stems from a place named [[Topola]]).

==Historical coat of arms==

The historical coat of arms of [[Serbian Vojvodina]] was adopted in 1848. In its central part is a [[Serbian cross]].

On the left and right side are a small coats of arms of the four historical regions of Serbian Vojvodina: [[Syrmia|Srem]] (upper left), [[Banat]] (upper right), [[Bačka]] (bottom left), and [[Baranja region|Baranja]] (bottom right).

On the top is a [[Crown of St. Stephen|Crown of Saint Stephen]]. The crown was placed on the coat of arms because the first intention of [[Serbs]] was to create [[Serbian Vojvodina]], which would be autonomous region within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], but since the war between [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians]] started, the intention was changed into one that Serbian Vojvodina should be completely separated from the Kingdom of Hungary and directly subordinated to [[Vienna]].

On March 17, 2015, the Assembly of Vojvodina failed to meet two-thirds of votes on the legislation of parallel use of the historical coat of arms and flag from 1848.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/politika/aktuelno.289.html:539049-Demokrate-pogazile-rec-i-grb&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''commercial director''' is a [[film director]] who specializes in the creation of [[commercials]], often for television, but sometimes also on film and of  [[music video]]s (given that music videos are recognized as a form of advertising for the song featured in the video{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}).

The term is also used for the more general business role of [[chief commercial officer]].

These structures have existed for many centuries and after falling out of use and their function having been forgotten the more substantial earth or stone examples have attracted names such as ''Roman Trenches'', ''Old Fortifications'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The hinds were the main target of the hunt.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Silz cerf8.jpg|thumb|290px|Red Deer stags and hinds]]
Deer hay winds, folds and elricks were sites where by means of traps wild deer were killed or caught. Evidence that during Saxon times deer hunting was taking place in this fashion survives in a tract written by a 10th-century monk called Ælfric who wrote "''I weave myself nets and set them in a suitable place and urge on my dogs so that they chase the wild animals until they come into the nets unawares and are thus ensnared and I kill them in the nets.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Saxon documents 'Deer Parks' are recorded to as 'Derhage' or 'Deer-hay'. The Saxon word ''haga'' means a palisade or pale, an enclosure, hedge, or set of nets&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JZ7GlfI8UToC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=How+were+Deer+hayes+used?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=toP0x4LJYd&amp;sig=roOVjtpC5bi_C89-TdDVhvQxvOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTu5-miIjPAhVmLcAKHcPgDn8Q6AEIOTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=How%20were%20Deer%20hayes%20used%3F&amp;f=false Wharton's Pocket Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm#H Forests and Chases in England and Wales, c. 1000 to c. 1850. A Glossary of Terms and Definitions.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also regarded as the etymological root of the word hay. The term ''haga'' or hay effectively came to mean a deer park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''haga'', ''hage'', ''hege'', ''haia'', etc. all relate to the managing of deer.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doomsday Book]] records 31 parks with a few still held by Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; The 'deer-hays' of Anglo-Saxon times would have been more or less temporary structures although some may have developed into places where deer were kept until such a times as they were needed at which point they would be killed.&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

Imparkment developed from the 12th to the 14th centuries, reaching its peak in the early 1300s at which time around 3,200 parks in England covered up to 2% of the total land area representing about a quarter of the country’s woodland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'elerc' or 'erelc' in Gaelic originally meant 'ambush' and later meant a 'deer trap' described as a funnel-like defile, artificial or natural into which deer were herded so that they could be contained and then killed. The personal or place name '[[Elrick]]' is linked to such deer traps.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic name ''Tainchell'' was the term used for the group of beaters who took part.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic word 'eilid' means a hind and this association may explain why the word after linguistic evolution in Wigtownshire to 'eileirg' or ' eileirig' with the meaning of 'deer-trap' and the local place-names 'Eldrig', 'Elrig', 'Elrick', etc. derive from this source and some of the defiles used in the hunt can still be identified.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and function==
[[File:Ordnance gazetteer of Scotland - a survey of Scottish topography, statistical, biographical, and historical (1882) (14804905703).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quillisfield or Coilsfield House.]]
The capture and movement of deer from the wild or from established deer hays or parks was necessary for establishing new ones and for restocking existing ones to replace animals lost via excessive hunting or disease and at times to introduce new breeding stock to maintain vigour in isolated and inbred populations. Deer might also be managed in terms of castrating stags and selectively culling diseased or elderly animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In feudal times the monarch would at times make gifts of live deer to those who were in the royal favour to replenish or establish herds, and a system of capturing deer therefore had to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coilsfield Deer Hay, Tarbolton - ditch system with parallel banks, South Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|thumb|250px|A section of the Parkmoor Deer Hay trenches at Coilsfield]]
To create a deer park the person had to own the land, purchase a license from the monarch and have sufficient funds to empark the area, constructing pales and ditches, deer leaps or salters, etc. Some parks even had towers from which the deer could be shot with bows and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thirty-seven parks or hays are listed in the Domesday Book, and of these nine belonged to the king, five by bishops or monastic houses and twenty three by Norman knights, etc. These hays or parks were isolated in the countryside by physical land divisions such as pales with ditches and served to protect the deer which were to be used for hunting and to help keep out predators whilst also preventing wild deer from eating crops in areas where farming was prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term 'fence month' was applied to the time during fawning and to the annual rut time in the autumn during which the deer were not disturbed and this restricted the period when deer hay winds and elricks could be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both wattle fencing and nets may have been employed in the 'wynding of the deer hay' and it was also important that the animals could be separated into small groups to reduce the chance of them goring each other by accident.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; A wide entrance that narrowed down on a gently rising slope would also slow their progress when pursued by hounds and places where people could hide,&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; possibly with hounds until required would be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The beaters would also separate the stags from the hinds if required.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Elricks or deer hay winds were a places in Scotland and England&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; where deer could be channelled and confined in a corral, a practice that ceased to be used in the 18th century although the practice had a brief resurgence in the days of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Stone lined pits and boulders once heated in fires have been found in association with elricks which may have been used to cook or render the venison from the newly slaughtered animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; A deer hunt of this type was recorded in the medieval romance ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

The native Red Deer ([[Cervus elaphus]]) and later introduced Fallow Deer ([[Dama dama]]) are suited for enclosure in deer parks however European Roe Deer ([[Capreolus capreolus]]) are not as they are aggressive towards other deer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt; Fallow Deer were introduced by the Normans from [[Sicily]], probably in the early twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Deer Hays and Elricks===
[[File:Windy Gill, Water of Fail, Tarbolton.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Windy Gill and the Water of Fail]]
Near Parkmill Farm on Parkmoor (NS 4425 2693), [[Tarbolton]] in [[South Ayrshire]] is a complex system of interlinking deep trenches running down to the Water of Fail that were given the name 'Roman Trenches'.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; The local historian John Smith circa 1895 examined them and also identified what he regarded as an ''Ancient British Stockade'' which had been taken following a siege by Roman troops during which the 'Roman Trenches' were built.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the trenches are still around 9 feet deep and are recorded to have once been much deeper.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; They lie within a few hundred metres from a medieval deer park's boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parkmoor Roman Trenches, Tarbolton.jpg|thumb|upright|The Parkmoor 'Roman trenches']]
In 1428 it is recorded that [[John Stewart of Darnley|John Stewart]] of [[Darnley]] near Glasgow held a deer park with a ditch, bank and pale in the Tarbolton area.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, page 215&lt;/ref&gt; Place names such as Parkmoor, Parkmill and Parkhill reflect the existence of a deer park in this area and a park with a building and pale is recorded on the 1654 map of Kyle by the cartographer Blaeu&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; taken from an earlier map by [[Timothy Pont]]. Herman Moll's map of 1732 shows at least four deer parks in the vicinity of Parkmoor at [[Fail Monastery|Fail Abbey]], Park Mill, at Coilsholm Wood and at Barskimming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.nls.uk/view/00000274 The South Part of the Shire of Air, containing Kyle and Carrick by H. Moll]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once known as 'Quillisfield' the estate was given to the monks of [[Melrose Abbey]] by [[John de Graham|Sir John de Graham]] of [[Dunduff Castle|Dunduff]], Lord of Tarbolton in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harpguitars.net/blog/2011/10/hgg9-scheduled-events/ 'Coilsfield' by Nathaniel Gow]&lt;/ref&gt; After the reformation Coilsfield Castle and Estate was acquired by the Cunninghames of Caprington, it was then sold to the Montgomerie family in 1661. In around 1847 the Coilsfield estate was sold to William Orr who had agreed to become the heir of the architect of the house, John Paterson, on the understanding that he would change his name to Paterson but and also buy the Coilsfield estate, renaming it Montgomerie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://landedfamilies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/189-arthur-of-carlung-house-barshaw.html Landed Families of Britain and Ireland.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The RCAHMS describes these features on the old Coilsfield Estate as an "''irregular series of artificially-cut ditches run roughly parallel in a SE-NW direction down a gently W-facing and wooded slope at c70m OD. They are closely spaced, mostly V-shaped, and range from 0.5m to 2.0m in depth with little evidence of upcast banking. Some conjoin to form wider channels which fade at the steeper slopes above the water of Fail.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/42710/parkmill RCAHMS Parkmoor 'Roman Trenches']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nuthill Estate, 'Old Fortifications'.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The 'Old Fortifications' at Nuthill.]]
Taylor has associated the local place names of Wyndford and Windy Gill at Parkmoor with an early 16th-century reference to the ''winding of the hay yard'' to catch deer at the Nuthill Estate in Fife and has suggested that this made reference to the construction of wattle fencing and nets along the line of the trench banks in preparation for catching deer and that the system of trenches may have been known as a 'wynd'.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scots language]] the word 'Wynd' has been used since at least the 13th century to describe frequently winding, narrow streets or alleys which aptly describes the appearance of known deer hay winds and elricks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/wynd_n_2 Scots Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and wynding would be the creation of narrow alleys or entrances.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; At Parkmoor the deer would naturally enter the Windy Gill to drink&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; and could then be driven by men and hounds towards the deer hay wind. The area that was supposed by John Smith to be an ''Ancient British Stockade'' and the area later used as a bowling green may have been involved in the processing of the deer by comparison with the use of elricks.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the Nuthill Estate in Fife (NO234079) are a system of trenches surveyed by Thomas Winter in 1757 and recorded as 'The Trenches are Old Fortifications' or 'Roman Trenches'. This complex system of trenches and banks are located near the old royal hunting park of Falkland.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is considered to have been used to capture deer from the Lomond Hills by corralling them and then taking suitable hinds and stags to the nearby royal hunting park.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The Falkland Treasurers Accounts of 1505 refer to a payment of 14 shillings to "''John Balfour for ranging through the countryside with bloodhounds to drive the deer to the park''" and for the "''winding of the hay yard to catch them''".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Fields or enclosures called ‘Deerends’ are recorded just to the west of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onomastics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Falkland-to-Strathmiglo-13-Sept-2014-leaflet.pdf Living Lomonds Landscape Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Glen of the Bar - geograph.org.uk - 1465166.jpg|thumb|200px|The Glen of the Bar elrick]]
At Nuthill at least seven trenches can still be discerned with a present-day depth of up to 2 metres and a length of 150 to 200 metres. Some are cut through the bedrock and they curve towards each other towards the west at the bottom of a slope that joins a water course. The glen or gill then acts as a natural channel that runs towards the old Falkland Deer Park and the Lomond Hills lie above.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; A number of place names suggest the past use of the site such as 'Deerends', 'Greyhound Den' and 'Burn of Deer'.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; 

Indications of similar systems of trenches exist at [[Chillingham Castle|Chillingham Park]] in [[Northumberland]] and [[Erringden]] Park in Yorkshire, additionally "''Montrose's Camp''" near [[Fyvie Castle]] has features in common with deer hay winds famously militarily utilised by [[Fyvie Castle|Montrose]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kington, Worcestershire|Kington]] in Worcestershire is recorded to have had a deer hay.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; 

The as yet unidentified system of trenches and banks at the High Parks in the Cadzow Wood area (NS 7343 5347) of [[Chatelherault Country Park]] have a number of characteristics in common with deer hay winds and are located in an area closely associated with the hunting of deer by royalty and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/45727/cadzow Cadzow - Canmore entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some deer hay winds may have consisted of banks and ditches several kilometres long that were used to direct deer for the purpose of capture&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; such as with the so-called "''Deil's Dyke''" near [[New Cumnock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bob_newcumnock/deilsdyke_B/ History of the Parish of New Cumnock]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elricks have been identified at [[Dalkeith]] and others may have existed at the Glen of the Bar in Galloway, on the [[Isle of Rum]] and on the [[Isle of Jura]] where in one case stone walls may have channelled the deer into a corral.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual 'deer trap' may have been the function of a structure with foot high walls at Wet Sleddle Slack near [[Shap]] in [[Cumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

A relevant quote here is that "''Deer hunting has left physical traces on the landscape in the form of banks and dykes used either as park boundaries or for trapping the deer''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bob_newcumnock/deilsdyke_B/ History of the Parish of New Cumnock]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Micro-history==
The fourteenth century treatise ''The Book of Hunting'' illustrates a scene ''The Gathering before the Stag Hunt'' which clearly portrays wattle fencing of the kind used in a deer hay wind.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; 

The town of [[Hayes and Harlington Urban District|Hayes]] in West Middlesex derives its name from the presence of a deer hay in the area.

The village of [[Elrick]] near Aberdeen is named after an elrick and the surname 'Elrick' is common in the area.

In 1559 seven acres of land near Tarbolton named Longhuntflat was leased by John Stewart and his wife Helen Cunninghame of Halrig.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Design Quality Indicator''' ('''DQI''') is a toolkit to measure, evaluate and improve the design quality of buildings.

Development of DQI was started by the [[Construction Industry Council]] (CIC) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Page 6, Spencer, N. and Winch, G. (2002). ''How Buildings add value for clients'', London: Thomas Telford. {{ISBN|0-7277-3128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated in response to the success of Key Performance Indicators devised for assessing construction process issues such as timely completion, financial control and safety on site by the construction industry's Movement for Innovation (M4I). The aim of the DQI systems was to ensure that the M4I's indicators of construction process were balanced by an assessment of the building as a product.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, S. (2004) Preface to ''Designing Better Buildings: quality and value in the built environment'', London: Spon Press. {{ISBN|0-415-31525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex was commissioned to develop the indicator tool, which was launched as an online resource on 1 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[Construction Industry Council]]. ''[http://www.dqi.org.uk/DQI/Common/031001_Launch.pdf DQI Online – How well is your building designed?]'' 1 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004 the DQI received recognition from the [[Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management|British Institute of Facilities Management]] for the role of involving users in the design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorproject.org.uk/maps/downloads/2004/IStructE%20online.pdf|format=PDF|title= DQI online service gets recognition from BIFM – ''The Structural Engineer''|date= 2 November 2004|website=elsalvadorproject.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DQI tool was made available to users in the United States in 2006, and an online American version was launched on 20 October 2008.

Unlike its forerunner the '''Housing Quality Indicator''' (HQI) system devised for the UK's Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) by the consultancy DEGW and published on open access in February 1999,&lt;ref&gt; Wheeler, P. (2004) 'Housing quality indicators in practice' in Macmillan, S. (2004) ''Designing Better Buildings: quality and value in the built environment'', London: Spon Press. {{ISBN|0-415-31525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the DQI system instead could be used only by approved facilitators. The criteria and the method of assessment, which though unacknowledged is a simple form of multi-attribute utility analysis, remained unaccessible to design teams and their clients unless they employed a facilitator licensed to use it. Guidance on using the HQI system can be found on the government website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-quality-indicators|title=Housing quality indicators - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DQI version for hospitals is also on open access on the national archive.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130124042007/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_082085.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual framework==
DQI applies a structured approach to assess design quality based on the model by the architect [[Vitruvius]], the Roman author of the earliest surviving theoretical treatise on building in Western culture, who described design in terms of ''utilitas, firmitas ''and ''venustas'', often translated as commodity, firmness and delight.&lt;ref&gt;Gann et al. (2003), ''Design Quality Indicator as a tool for thinking: Building Research and Information'', London: Spon Press. {{DOI|10.1080/0961321032000107564}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DQI uses a modern-day interpretation of these terms as:
*Functionality (''utilitas'') – the arrangement, quality and interrelationship of spaces and how the building is designed to be useful to all.
*Build Quality (''firmitas'') – the engineering performance of the building, which includes structural stability and the integration, safety and robustness of the systems, finishes and fittings.
*Impact (''venustas'') – the building’s ability to create a sense of place and have a positive effect on the local community and environment.

==Methodology==
DQI is completed by a range of stakeholders in the briefing and design stages of a building project, or on a completed building.  Stakeholders who participate include:
*Architects
*Building users (or potential users)
*Building clients
*[[Facilities manager]]s (or future facilities managers)
*[[Project manager]]s
*[[Quantity surveyor]]s ([[Cost engineering|Cost engineer]])
*[[Structural engineer|Structural]] and [[Building services engineering|building services engineers]]

DQI is applied in a facilitated workshop that is led by a certified DQI facilitator.

==Models and related approaches==
There are three models of design quality indicator:
*DQI which is applicable to all building types&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dqi.org.uk|title=DQI - Home|website=www.dqi.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*DQI for schools which is applicable to school buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dqi.org.uk/website/dqiforschools/default.aspa|title=Schools version of DQI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model of DQI is being used on all current school projects in the UK&lt;ref&gt;[[Construction Industry Council]]. ''[http://www.cic.org.uk/newsevents/dqifs081205.pdf DQI for Schools Launched]'' 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and forms part of the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] 'Minimum Design Standard' for new school buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]]. ''[http://www.cabe.org.uk/design-review/schools/minimum-design-standard Minimum Design Standards Launched]'' May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*DQI for health buildings which was released in beta format in June 2012 on the  DQI website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dqi.org.uk/website/healthbuildings/default.aspa&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:DotakuBronzeBellLateYayoi3rdCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|A Yayoi period ''dōtaku'', 3rd century]]
{{nihongo|'''''Dōtaku'''''|銅鐸}} are [[Japan]]ese [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] smelted from relatively thin [[bronze]] and richly decorated.

Dotaku were used for about 400 years, between the second century B.C. and the second century C.E. (corresponding to the end of the [[Yayoi era]]), and were nearly only used as decorations for [[rituals]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. They were richly decorated with patterns representing [[nature]] and [[animal]]s, among which the [[dragonfly]], [[praying mantis]] and [[spider]] are featured. Historians believe that ''dōtaku'' were used to pray for good [[harvests]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} as the animals featured are [[natural enemies]] of insect pests that attack [[paddy fields]].

According to Japanese folklore, dōtaku were used as emergency bells (such as a watch tower’s bell); intended especially in cases of invasion, particularly invaders from the Korean peninsula.  When sentinels spotted invaders, they loudly rang the dōtaku as an alarm, so that people could hide themselves or their possession, and to alert warriors to prepare themselves to repel the enemy.

There is a dotaku museum&lt;ref name="city.yasu.lg.jp"&gt;[http://www.city.yasu.lg.jp/map/24.html]&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to the bells in [[Yasu, Shiga|Yasu city]], in [[Shiga prefecture]], in central Japan.

{{commonscatinline|Dotaku}}

== History ==
During the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi Era]] (400 B.C.E. – 300 C.E.), a great number of technological innovations occurred. Unlike the earlier nomadic [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]] people, the Yayoi emphasized having large community settlements and the cultivation of rice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of Japanese Art, 2nd Edition|last = Mason|first = Penelope|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these, they learned how to cast [[bronze]] and [[Iron ore|iron]] in order to create various metal objects such as weapons, mirrors, and several tools. Among the bronze objects, ''dotaku'', one of the most distinctive objects of the era, were created. In recent years, ''dotaku'' have been studied by researchers in order to decipher their origins, how they were created, their various purposes, and the reasons for the images on the main body.

== Origin ==
Despite being a well-known artifact of the Yayoi era, the concept of ''dotaku'' did not initially originate in [[Japan]]. According to several studies, these [[bell (instrument)|bells]] are thought to be derived from "earlier, smaller Korean examples that adorned horses and other domesticated animals",&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bell (dotaku) [Japan] (18.68) {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/18.68|website = www.metmuseum.org|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Chinese cattle bells, or [[Han Chinese]] ''zhong'', which were bells without clappers used for composing ritual music. However, further studies show that the Yayoi did not have [[Ranch|cattle farms]], and although several ''dotaku'' do have suspension rings and [[Bell (instrument)|clappers]], they make "muffled tones"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/two-d%C5%8Dtaku-ritual-bells/pAERWRrgJXeh_g|title = Two dōtaku (ritual bells)|date = |accessdate = 2017-01-29|website = The British Museum|publisher = The British Museum|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "rattling sounds"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; when struck, suggesting that they were not meant to be rung.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Therefore, any bells from China were imported as ritual objects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Locations ===
In total, over four hundred ''dotaku''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; have been found in [[Japan]], mainly in [[Honshu|western Honshu]], the Tokai District, Shikoku, and the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] region, namely [[Kyoto]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], and [[Osaka]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The "first recorded discovery of ''dotaku''"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; was in 662 C.E. at a temple located in [[Shiga Prefecture]]. They are often "found buried on isolated hillsides"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; either ‘singly, [in] pairs, or in large groups"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; along with various bronze mirrors and weapons. When buried in groups, researchers have speculated that several clans each buried their only ''dotaku'' in one area to signify the unity of all the clans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Prehistoric Japan: New Perspectives on Insular East Asia|last = Imamura|first = Keiji|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 170–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
[[File:Dotaku LACMA M.58.9.3 (1 of 2).jpg|left|thumb|270x270px|Dotaku (bell-shaped bronze), Yayoi period, 2nd-1st century BC]]

Physically, the body of a ''dotaku'' consists of "a truncated cone shape"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with an oval cross-section&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gardner’s Art through the Ages: A Global History|last = Kleiner|first = Fred|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 477}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "has rows of horizontal bands divided in the center by a vertical row".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Arching and extending over the top and the sides of the body is an "elaborate flange filled with [[saw]]tooth design and projecting spirals".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The materials used for ''dotaku'' came from both Korea and China since "bronze resources were not found until the 7th century",&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan, Late Yayoi Period / Dotaku / 100-200|url = http://www.davidrumsey.com/amica/amico1259573-33003.html|website = www.davidrumsey.com|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bronze was considered more precious than iron.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, researchers have detected lead traces inside the bells, which was a common characteristic of Chinese metals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These Yayoi bells vary in height ranging from 4 inches to 50 inches,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm to 127&amp;nbsp;cm. In conjunction with the varying height, the styles of the bells also varied greatly. Across several regions, this scattered production continued until a group of bronze-smiths congregated and decided on a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Archaeology of Japan: From the Earliest Rice Farming Villages to the Rise of the State|last = Mizoguchi|first = Koji|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 180–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/2734|title=荒神谷遺跡発掘調査概報 2 銅鐸・銅矛出土地|last=The Shimane Board of Education|first=|date=1986|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Making ===
These bells were originally made through the use of two-part [[sandstone]] moulds, in which "designs were carved"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; in order to create the appearance of raised bronzes lies on the outer surface. Many of these sandstone moulds were "found in abundance in [[northern Kyushu]]"&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History - Yayoi Period|url = http://www.jref.com/articles/yayoi-period.188/|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and near Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As time progressed, ''dotaku'' gradually became larger in size and thinner due to the fact that they were now being made using [[clay]] moulds instead of sandstone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This allowed for more detailed work, such as simple line drawings, compared to the smaller and thicker sandstone moulds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Main purpose ==
Other purposes of the ''dotaku'' are still being debated by researchers, but it is certain that they were used for agricultural rituals and rites, as supported by various sources.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dotaku (Ritual Bronze Bells) and the Yayoi Period {{!}} 京都国立博物館 {{!}} Kyoto National Museum|url = http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/eng/dictio/kouko/45dotaku.html|website = www.kyohaku.go.jp|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest that, when not in use, ''dotaku'' were buried "in the ground to receive Earth’s [[Life force energy|life force]]",&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; thus ensuring agricultural fertility for the community;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; they were also believed to have been used to pray for rain. These beliefs and suggestions are supported by the fact that many ''dotaku'' had inscriptions of "flowing water, [[waterfowl]], fish, boats, and agricultural objects"&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge History of Japan, Volume 1|last = Hall|first = John Whitney|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 332–334}}&lt;/ref&gt; on them. Although it is unknown whether or not ''dotaku'' were "used by the chieftains for small principalities or by villages in public community festivals",&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; it is certain that they belonged to the community as a whole rather than an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some alternate theories include ''dotaku'' being used as "a [[sundial]], producing gold, heating water for bathing, or related to secret Jewish practices", although these explanations have little support within the mainstream archaeological community.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Similarities with Chinese imagery ==
Regarding the designs of ''dotaku'', they contain many aspects that resemble Chinese objects. For example, many early bells had "delicate decorations [that] resemble contemporary [[Chinese mirror]]s".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It wasn’t until later in the Yayoi era that decorations "with scenes of animals and humans hunting or farming"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; were used.  Along with these depictions, there are also images of the typical Yayoi "[[Yayoi period|elevated granaries]] and scenes of [[Mochi|rice being pounded]]".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Deer ===
Many depictions of [[deer]] appear on ''dotaku'' the most, even though the "Yayoi ate mostly [[wild boar]]".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to "''Harima Fudoki''",&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; which is a series of reports comprised in the [[Nara period]] (710 C.E. – 793 C.E.), there was "a magical ritual of sowing seeds in deer blood that was used to speed up the germination of rice plants"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; because it was believed that "the deer’s life force helped the growth of rice",&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; which explains why the character [[Forest Spirit]] in the film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' was a human-faced deer.

== Research ==
There have also been studies as to whether or not the images on the ''dotaku'' have significant meanings. According to a researcher named Oba, each picture contains a hidden [[Pictogram|pictograph]] that can be deciphered through a phonetic reading. For example, a picture of a man shooting a deer can be read as "''iru ka''" (to shoot a deer),&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review|jstor = 132139|journal = Journal of Japanese Studies|date = 1975-04-01|pages = 485–506|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/132139|first = Roy Andrew|last = Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when combined to form "Iruka" , the pictures refer to [[Soga no Iruka]], which is a reference to the [[Soga clan|Soga Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Through several more readings, Oba discovered that the drawings "contain references to precise persons, places, and events in Japanese prehistory"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; as well as provided "info of shapes of buildings, hunting customs, and other aspects of daily life",&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; possibly left for future generations. However, due to a lack of concrete evidence, other researchers have deemed it improbable that the pictures are actually hidden pictographs; it is possible that the pictures are just pictures. Despite the lack of evidence, researchers do believe that the pictures aren’t just casual pictures drawn for the sake of art, that there is some other meaning behind them.

== In popular culture ==
The deer, often depicted on the surfaces of dotaku, is physically manifested in the film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. In the film, Forest Spirit is a "god of life and death" and is characterized as a large deer with a human-like face.

The Pokémon Bronzong is designed after a dōtaku.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The '''Emfietzoglou Gallery Museum''' is an [[art gallery]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is sited in [[Marousi]] near the metro station. Its founder [[Prodromos Emfietzoglou]] gave his private art collection of over 500 works to the public. 

These days the Emphietsoglou gallery offers a review of 750 works of modern Greek art including some of the best paintings from the last 200 years. 

__TOC__

==History==
Since 19th century Prodromos Emfietzoglou and his family due to their interest in Greek art were collecting works of various Greek painters. Their passion in combination with many artists' donations led in 1999 to the foundation of the museum. Today the collection is composed of paintings, sculpture, photography, engravings and video installations.

==The Gallery==
The museum is cited in Maroussi in 3.000 m&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; next to the collector's residence. 
Today there are about 750 works of 260 Greek artists. The works are distributed in the museum's building, in the surrounding open area and some are exposed in the collector's residence but in spite of this spatial division visitors are allowed to visit all the works.
The last years several educational happenings are arranged. It is calculated that about 20.000 students took part in these happenings.

'''Xuan Kong Flying Star feng shui''' or ''Xuan Kong Fei Xing''&lt;ref&gt;Heluo (1999). [http://www.heluo.nl/articles/HowToFindFacingAndSittingInFengShui.pdf How to find facing and sitting in feng shui.]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of disciplines in [[Feng Shui]], and is an integration of the principles of [[Yin Yang]], the interactions between the five elements, the eight trigrams, the [[Lo Shu]] numbers, and the [[24 Mountains]], by using time, space and objects&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; to create an astrological chart to analyze positive auras and negative auras of a building.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Introduction_to_Flying_Stars.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: Introduction to Flying Stars.]&lt;/ref&gt;

These include analyzing wealth, mental and physiological states, success, relationships with external parties, and health of the inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;Jamilin (2007). [http://www.jamilin.com/Free_Feng_Shui/Articles/Flying_Star_Feng_Shui/ Flying Stars Feng Shui.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Qing Dynasty]], it was popularized by a grandmaster [[Shen Zhu Ren]], with the book that he wrote called '''Mr. Shen's Study of Xuan Kong''', or ''Shen Shi Xuan Kong Xue''.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Introduction_to_Flying_Stars.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: Introduction to Flying Stars.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Flying Star Feng Shui does not limit itself to buildings for the living or ''Yang Zhai'', where rules pertaining to directions equally apply to all built structures; it also applies to grave sites and buildings for spirits or ''Yin Zhai''.&lt;ref&gt;Heluo (1999). [http://www.heluo.nl/articles/HowToFindFacingAndSittingInFengShui.pdf 8-White Star Feng Shui: How to find facing and sitting in Feng Shui.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

===Numbers===
[[File:Magic Square Lo Shu.svg|thumb|right|Modern representation of the ''Lo Shu'' square as a [[magic square]]]]

In the [[Lo Shu Square]], flying stars are nine numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Tsai  (2009). [http://www.chineseastrologyonline.com/pwbasic.htm The Background of the Purple White Flying Stars.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each number in the Lo Shu represents one of the Chinese [[Trigram]]s and is related to an Element, Family Member, [[Cardinal direction|Cardinal]], Colour, Hour, Season, [[Organ (anatomy)|Organ]], Ailments and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shui Design Consultancy  (2008-09). [http://www.feng-shui-design-consultancy.com/chinese-magic-square.html Chinese Magic Square.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers always move to the lower right (northwest), middle right (west), lower left (northeast), upper center (south), lower center (north), upper right (southwest), middle left (east), upper left (southeast) and back to the center.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Plotting_the_Stars_1.html Plotting a Flying Star.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time===

[[Time]] is divided into 20-Year cycles. Each cycle of 20 years is a Period or "Yun". A grand cycle comprises 9 Periods in total which covers a span of 180 years.&lt;ref&gt;Joey Yap (2005). [http://joeyyap.com/fengshui/article.asp?ArID=11 Hoo Hah About Period 8 .]&lt;/ref&gt;

Periods are used to describe the cyclical pattern of [[Qi]]. Different types of Qi have different strengths and weaknesses with the reference to a particular Period.&lt;ref&gt;Heluo (1999). [http://www.heluo.nl/articles/HowToBuildYourFlyingStarChart.pdf How to build your flying star chart.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Periodic Table on Flying Stars'''&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heluo (1999). [http://www.fengshui-consultants.co.uk/feng_shui_flying_star.htm Flying Star.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Timely and Untimely Flying Stars====

A timely star is positive for a building whereas untimely star is negative. For the current period, ''Period 8'' (Year 2004–2023), stars ''Eight'', ''Nine'' and ''One'' are timely (For a building, they are timely if and only if the object placed in that palace is timely). Star ''Eight'' is most timely which is often treated as Prosperous and Noble Star. Star ''Nine'' and Star ''One'' belong to ''Sheng Qi'', a growing [[energy]]. The other six stars are regarded as having retreating, killing or dead ''qi''.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Xiao Wen (2005). [http://joeyyap.com/fengshui/article.asp?ArID=42 Help! My flying star chart doesn’t work.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerby Kuek. ''Power of Feng Shui.'' Ming Pao Publications (2009) 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen Feng Mou. ''Xuan Kong Feng Shui Tan Jiu.'' Wu Ling (2005) 22-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space===

An accurate measurement of direction must be obtained before any system of [[Feng Shui]] can be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Taking_Directions.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: Taking Directions.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Luopan]] is a magnetic compass to determine the precise direction of a structure or an item.

====24 Mountains====
The most important ring on the [[Luopan]] is the 24 Mountain ring.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/The_Luo_Pan_and_the_24_Mountains.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: 24 Mountains.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 24 Mountain ring, each direction is subdivided into three sectors.

====Taking Directions====

Using the principles of [[Yin and Yang]], the facing of a building is determined by the side of the built structure that receives most ''Yang Qi''.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Jiu Xing Feng Shui Xue.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A house is constructed with an architectural frontage with its side that faces whatever landscape feature. The facing of that house is considered by the direction of its frontage which is most ''Yang'' in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Jiu Xing Feng Shui Xue.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In apartments, or condominiums, the facing of a unit is determined by the facing of the entire building. If the structure is not an obvious facade, the facing of the unit is determined by the side of the building having the most ''Yang'' energy (faces the busiest crowd flow).

====Taking locations====

Energy in a building can be tapped into by locating a person within a sector that houses the energy. Ideally, living objects should be located in a sector with positive [[Qi]] as determined by Flying Star Chart.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Direction_vs_Location.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: Direction vs Location.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout of a building is demarcated with a '''Nine Palace''' grid, which looks like a ''tic-tac-toe grid''. A door, room or other object's location refers to the square within this grid where the object is found. This may or may not correspond to the direction that the object faces. A door could be located in the southwest sector, but face south. Its location could be also southwest, and its direction to be facing to the south.

===Objects===

Objects are essential to evaluate the [[Feng Shui]] of a building.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Jiu Xing Feng Shui Xue.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao Jiufeng. ''Di Li Wu Jie.'' Wu Ling (2004) 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen Feng Mou. ''Xuan Kong Feng Shui Tan Jiu.'' Wu Ling (2005) 22-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mountain====
[[Image:City of London.jpg|thumb|Skyscrapers and apartments are mountains.]]
Mountain generates [[Qi]]. A lush and green mountain or hill generates auspicious Qi, while a barren, rocky rising area will, in general, generate inauspicious energy.&lt;ref&gt;Kerby Kuek. ''Power of Feng Shui.'' Ming Pao Publications (2009) 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas, skyscrapers, apartments or any structure that rises from the ground have a similar role to a mountain: generating energy outside. From inside, cupboards, wardrobes, or any furniture that is taller or larger than any others nearby are also considered mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Xue Feng Shui De Di Yi Ben Shu.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2004) 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water====
[[Image:Tokyo EXP way.JPG|thumb|Highways and roads are forms of water in Feng Shui.]]

Water conducts [[Qi]]. It is essential to identify the cleanliness of the water, the location and the flow of the water formation. These include ponds, lakes, rivers, drains and fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Fa Da Feng Shui Xue.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerby Kuek. ''Power of Feng Shui.'' Ming Pao Publications (2009) 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas, highways and lowland play a similar role to waterways, conducting Qi. Inside a building or a room, spinning fan or anything  lower than ground level is considered water.&lt;ref&gt;Chen Feng Mou. ''Xuan Kong Feng Shui Tan Jiu.'' Wu Ling (2005) 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine-Palace Flying Stars==

'''Nine Palace Flying Stars''' or ''Jiu Gong Fei Xing'' is another name of Flying Stars method whereby palaces are the nine sectors overlaid onto a layout of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Xiao Wen (2005). [http://joeyyap.com/fengshui/article.asp?ArID=42 Help! My flying star chart doesn’t work.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flying Star Chart===

A '''Flying Star chart''' consists of three numbers in each Palace of the [[Luo Shu]]. These numbers are called the '''Base Star''', the '''Facing Star''' and the '''Sitting Star'''.

Constructing a Flying Star Chart requires
- The dates that the building was occupied by the owners
- The facing of the building&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Plotting_the_Stars_1.html Plotting a Flying Star.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Ju Ming Shuo Fa.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2004) 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a building is constructed in the year 2003, but the residents do not move in until February 4 of 2004, the Period of the building is 8, not 7.

Period does not change again unless there is major renovation undertaken to the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Xue Feng Shui De Di Yi Ben Shu.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2004) 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules and Procedures===

Creating a ''Flying Star chart'' is always begun with the Base Star. Period of the building determines the number occupies the Base Star position of the ''Central Palace''. Base Stars always fly in the [[Luo Shu]] path.

[[Image:FlyingStarChartA.jpg|thumb|left|Constructing a flying star chart.]]

Once all the base stars are distributed amongst the nine palaces, the number in Facing Palace on the Luo Shu grid is determined by the facing direction of the building. This number is the facing star.

The ''Sitting Palace'' is always opposite of the ''Facing Palace''. The sitting star is the number in the sitting palace.

For instance, in a Period-8 building that faces southwest, the number that locates in Facing Palace is number 5 whereas the number in Sitting Palace is number 2; thus, 5 is Facing Star and 2 is Sitting Star.

Unlike the Base Star, the Facing Star and Sitting Star can fly in either ascending (''Yang'') order, or descending (''Yin'') order. The order depends upon two factors on 
1 Whether the star is an even number or an odd number, and 
2 Which the mountain that the unit faces.

Even-numbered Stars follow a ''Yin-Yang-Yang'' form. In a certain number which comprises three mountains, should the mountain that the property faces is ''Yang'', then the numbers fly in ascending order of [[Lo Shu]] path, and vice versa.

Odd-numbered Stars follow a ''Yang-Yin-Yin'' form. In a certain number which comprises three mountains, should the mountain that the property faces is ''Yang'', then the numbers fly in ascending order of Lo Shu path, and vice versa.

To determine the polarity of number 5 star, go by the polarity of the Period number.

==Properties of Nine Stars==

===Timely and Untimely===
Flying stars can be timely or untimely. The nature of flying star depends on which period is to be referred and which star is being activated.&lt;ref&gt;Fushantang (1998). [http://www.fushantang.com/1007/1007-1/g2106.html Xuan Kong Fei Xing.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry of Flying Stars==

According to [[I-Ching]], south direction belongs to fire. However, in a building, the south sector may not a fire. The nature of a palace depends on combination among elements of the ''base star'', of the ''sitting star'', of the ''facing star'' and of the ''Heaven Trigram''.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu zuxia ''Feixing Feng Shui Xue.'' Zhu Zuxia Training Centre (2009) 20-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a house that faces bearing 337.6 - 352.5 was built in 2001, and was occupied by residents in 2006.

Period of the house: Period 8, since 2006 is the year of occupying

Facing: Ren mountain in North direction, bearing 337.6 - 352.5

Sitting: Bing mountain in South direction, opposite of the facing

===Timely Flying Star===

Timely flying star is a catalyst to the phase combination of ''Sitting Star'', ''Facing Star'', ''Base Star'' and ''Heavenly Trigram'', implying whether to boost the current aura to best or to the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu zuxia ''Feixing Feng Shui Xue.'' Zhu Zuxia Training Centre (2009) 36-40.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, annual Star 1 (Water) has the ability to combat the competition of metallic stars 6 and 7.

====Annual and Monthly Flying Stars====

In [[Sexagenary cycle]], a new Chinese year begins on start of spring, which usually falls on February 4. The annual flying star that visits the center palace has to be subtracted by one every Chinese year. Once ''Star 1'' is reached, annual star would loop back around to 9 in next year. 

''Star 1'' occupies center palace in 1999, 2008, 2017 and so on.

Annual and monthly stars always follow Lo Shu path.

'''Folk music''' includes [[#Traditional folk music|traditional folk music]] and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th-century [[folk revival]]. Some types of folk music may be called [[‘World music’]]. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and [[art music|classical styles]]. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.

Starting in the mid-18th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (third) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called [[contemporary folk music]] or [[folk revival]] music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms.&lt;ref name="AboutDefinition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folkmusic.about.com/od/glossary/g/FolkMusic.htm |publisher=About.com definition |title=Folk Music |first1=Kim |last1=Ruehl |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller, similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as [[folk rock]], [[folk metal]], and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in Romanian it shares a different name, and it often does not share the same people and animals as traditional music.

=== Definitions ===
A consistent definition of '''traditional folk music''' is elusive.&lt;ref name = NERevival&gt;''The Never-Ending Revival'' by Michael F. Scully  University of Illinois Press Urbana and Chicago 2008 {{ISBN|978-0252033339}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The terms ''folk music'', ''folk song'', and ''[[folk dance]]'' are comparatively recent expressions. They are extensions of the term ''[[folklore]]'', which was coined in 1846 by the English antiquarian [[William Thoms]] to describe "the traditions, customs, and superstitions of the uncultured classes".&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977"&gt;Percy Scholes, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 1977, article "Folk Song".&lt;/ref&gt; The term further derives from the German expression ''[[Völkisch movement|Volk]]'', in the sense of "the people as a whole" as applied to popular and national music by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and the German Romantics over half a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional folk music also includes most [[indigenous music]].&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt;

However, despite the assembly of an enormous body of work over some two centuries, there is still no certain definition of what folk music (or [[folklore]], or the [[Wikt:folk|folk]]) is.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Middleton, Richard]], ''Studying Popular Music'', Philadelphia: Open University Press (1990/2002). {{ISBN|0335152759}}, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt; Some do not even agree that the term Folk Music should be used.&lt;ref name = NERevival/&gt; Folk music may tend to have certain characteristics&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; but it cannot clearly be differentiated in purely musical terms. One meaning often given is that of "old songs, with no known composers",&lt;ref name="Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2"&gt;Ronald D. Cohen ''Folk music: the basics'' (CRC Press, 2006), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; another is that of music that has been submitted to an evolutionary "process of [[oral transmission]].... the fashioning and re-fashioning of the music by the community that give it its folk character".&lt;ref name="Lloyd 1969"&gt;International Folk Music Council definition (1954/5), given in Lloyd (1969) and Scholes (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such definitions depend upon "(cultural) processes rather than abstract musical types...", upon "''continuity'' and ''oral transmission''...seen as characterizing one side of a cultural dichotomy, the other side of which is found not only in the lower layers of feudal, capitalist and some oriental societies but also in 'primitive' societies and in parts of 'popular cultures'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Seeger]] (1980), citing the approach of Redfield (1947) and Dundes (1965), quoted in Middleton (1990) p.127.&lt;/ref&gt;  One widely used definition is simply "Folk music is what the people sing".&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011 page 13"&gt;Donaldson, 2011 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

For Scholes,&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; as well as for [[Cecil Sharp]] and [[Béla Bartók]],&lt;ref name="A.L.Lloyd, 1969, pp. 14-5"&gt;A. L. Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; there was a sense of the music of the country as distinct from that of the town. Folk music was already, "...seen as the authentic expression of a way of life now past or about to disappear (or in some cases, to be preserved or somehow revived)",&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, Richard 1990, p. 127.  ''Studying Popular Music''. Milton Keynes; Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0335152767|0335152759}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in "a community uninfluenced by art music"&lt;ref name="Lloyd 1969" /&gt; and by commercial and printed song. Lloyd rejected this in favour of a simple distinction of economic class&lt;ref name="A.L.Lloyd, 1969, pp. 14-5" /&gt; yet for him true folk music was, in [[Charles Seeger]]'s words, "associated with a lower class"&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; in culturally and socially stratified societies. In these terms folk music may be seen as part of a "schema comprising four musical types: 'primitive' or 'tribal'; 'elite' or 'art'; 'folk'; and 'popular'".&lt;ref name="Charles Seeger 1980 p.127"&gt;Charles Seeger (1980) quoted in Middleton (1990) p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music in this genre is also often called ''traditional music.''  Although the term is usually only descriptive, in some cases people use it as the name of a genre.  For example, the [[Grammy Award]] previously used the terms "traditional music" and "traditional folk" for folk music that is not contemporary folk music.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==== Characteristics ====
From a historical perspective, traditional folk music had these characteristics:&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt;{{verification needed|date=November 2016}}
* It was transmitted through an [[oral tradition]]. Before the 20th century, ordinary people were usually illiterate; they acquired songs by memorizing them. Primarily, this was not mediated by books or recorded or transmitted media. Singers may extend their repertoire using [[Broadside (music)|broadsheets]] or [[song book]]s, but these secondary enhancements are of the same character as the primary songs experienced in the flesh.
* The music was often related to [[Culture|national culture]]. It was culturally particular; from a particular region or culture. In the context of an [[immigrant]] group, folk music acquires an extra dimension for social cohesion. It is particularly conspicuous in immigrant societies, where [[Greek Australians]], [[Somali Americans]], [[Punjabi Canadians]], and others strive to emphasize their differences from the mainstream. They learn songs and dances that originate in the countries their grandparents came from.
* They commemorate historical and personal events. On certain days of the year, such as [[Easter]], [[May Day]], and [[Christmas]], particular songs celebrate the yearly cycle. [[Wedding]]s, [[birthday]]s, and [[funeral]]s may also be noted with songs, dances and special costumes. Religious festivals often have a folk music component. [[Choral music]] at these events brings children and non-professional singers to participate in a public arena, giving an emotional bonding that is unrelated to the aesthetic qualities of the music.
* The songs have been performed, by [[Convention (norm)|custom]], over a long period of time, usually several [[generation]]s.

As a side-effect, the following characteristics are sometimes present:
* There is no [[copyright]] on the songs. Hundreds of folk songs from the 19th century have known authors but have continued in oral tradition to the point where they are considered traditional for purposes of music publishing. This has become much less frequent since the 1940s. Today, almost every folk song that is recorded is credited with an arranger.
* Fusion of cultures: Because cultures interact and change over time, traditional songs evolving over time may incorporate and reflect influences from disparate cultures. The relevant factors may include instrumentation, [[Musical tuning|tunings]], [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], [[Phrasing (music)|phrasing]], subject matter, and even production methods.

==== Terminology ====

===== Tune =====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
In folk music, a ''tune'' is a short [[instrumental]] [[piece (music)|piece]], a [[melody]], often with repeating [[section (music)|sections]], and usually played a number of times. A collection of tunes with structural similarities is known as

=== Origins ===
[[File:Indian village musicians.jpg|thumb|Indians always distinguished between classical and folk music, though in the past even classical Indian music used to rely on the unwritten transmission of repertoire.]]
Throughout most of human prehistory and history, listening to [[recorded music]] was not possible. Music was made by common people during both their work and leisure, as well as during religious activities. The work of economic production was often manual and communal. [[Manual labor]] often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced the [[boredom]] of repetitive tasks, it kept the [[rhythm]] during [[Synchronization|synchronized]] pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as [[Sowing|planting]], [[weeding]], [[reaping]], [[threshing]], [[weaving]], and [[Milling (grinding)|milling]]. In [[leisure time]], singing and playing [[musical instrument]]s were common forms of entertainment and history-telling—even more common than today, when electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive.&lt;ref name="SeegerLomaxDocumentary"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr9FP93o8Ro |title=To Hear Your Banjo Play, Alan Lomax's 1947 Documentary narrated by Pete Seeger |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that folk music originated as [[art music]] that was changed and probably debased by oral transmission, while reflecting the character of the society that produced it.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; In many societies, especially preliterate ones, the cultural transmission of folk music requires [[Learning music by ear|learning by ear]], although [[Musical notation|notation]] has evolved in some cultures. Different cultures may have different notions concerning a division between "folk" music on the one hand and of "art" and "court" music on the other. In the proliferation of popular music genres, some traditional folk music became also referred to "[[World music]]" or "Roots music".

The English term "[[folklore]]", to describe traditional folk music and dance, entered the vocabulary of many continental European nations, each of which had its folk-song collectors and revivalists.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; The distinction between "authentic" folk and national and [[popular song]] in general has always been loose, particularly in America and Germany&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt; – for example popular songwriters such as [[Stephen Foster]] could be termed "folk" in America.&lt;ref name="Percy Scholes 1977" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.L.Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Panther Arts, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Folk Music Council]] definition allows that the term can also apply to music that, "...has originated with an individual composer and has subsequently been absorbed into the unwritten, living tradition of a community. But the term does not cover a song, dance, or tune that has been taken over ready-made and remains unchanged."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by both Scholes (1977) and Lloyd (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

The post–[[World War II]] folk revival in America and in Britain started a new genre, [[Contemporary Folk Music|contemporary folk music]], and brought an additional meaning to the term "folk music": newly composed songs, fixed in form and by known authors, which imitated some form of traditional music. The popularity of "contemporary folk" recordings caused the appearance of the category "Folk" in the [[Grammy Award]]s of 1959: in 1970 the term was dropped in favor of "Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording (including Traditional Blues)", while 1987 brought a distinction between "Best Traditional Folk Recording" and "Best Contemporary Folk Recording". After that, they had a "Traditional music" category that subsequently evolved into others. The term "folk", by the start of the 21st century, could cover [[Singer-songwriter|singer songwriters]], such as [[Donovan]] from Scotland and American [[Bob Dylan]], who emerged in the 1960s and much more. This completed a process to where "folk music" no longer meant only traditional folk music.&lt;ref name="Ronald D. Cohen 2006 pp. 1-2" /&gt;

Traditional folk music often includes [[Lyrics|sung words]], although folk [[instrumental music]] occurs commonly in [[dancing music|dance music]] traditions. [[Narrative verse]] looms large in the traditional folk music of many cultures. This encompasses such forms as traditional [[epic poetry]], much of which was meant originally for oral performance, sometimes accompanied by instruments. Many epic poems of various cultures were pieced together from shorter pieces of traditional narrative verse, which explains their episodic structure, repetitive elements, and their frequent ''[[in medias res]]'' plot developments. Other forms of traditional narrative verse relate the outcomes of [[battle]]s or describe [[Tragedy (event)|tragedies]] or [[natural disaster]]s.

Sometimes, as in the triumphant ''[[Song of Deborah]]'' found in the [[Bible|Biblical]] ''[[Book of Judges]]'', these songs celebrate victory. Laments for lost battles and wars, and the lives lost in them, are equally prominent in many traditions; these laments keep alive the cause for which the battle was fought. The narratives of traditional songs often also remember [[folk hero]]es such as [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] or [[Robin Hood]]. Some traditional song narratives recall [[supernatural]] events or mysterious deaths.

[[Hymn]]s and other forms of [[religious music]] are often of traditional and unknown origin. Western [[musical notation]] was originally created to preserve the lines of [[Gregorian chant]], which before its invention was taught as an oral tradition in [[monasticism|monastic]] communities. Traditional songs such as ''[[Green grow the rushes, O]]'' present religious lore in a mnemonic form, as do Western [[Christmas carol]]s and similar traditional songs.

[[Work song]]s frequently feature [[call and response (music)|call and response]] structures and are designed to enable the laborers who sing them to coordinate their efforts in accordance with the rhythms of the songs. They are frequently, but not invariably, composed. In the American [[armed force]]s, a lively oral tradition preserves [[jody call]]s ("Duckworth chants") which are sung while soldiers are on the march. Professional sailors made similar use of a large body of [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]]. [[Love poetry]], often of a tragic or regretful nature, prominently figures in many folk traditions. [[Nursery rhyme]]s and [[nonsense verse]] used to amuse or quiet children also are frequent subjects of traditional songs.

Music transmitted by word of mouth through a community, in time, develops many variants, because this kind of transmission cannot produce word-for-word and note-for-note accuracy. Indeed, many traditional singers are quite creative and deliberately modify the material they learn.

For example, the words of "[[I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day]]" (Roud 975) are known from a [[Broadside (music)|broadside]] in the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bodley24.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/acwwweng/ballads/image.pl?ref=Harding+B+20(69)&amp;id=08664.gif&amp;seq=1&amp;size=0 |title=Ballads Catalogue: Harding B 20(69) |publisher=Bodley24.bodley.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date is almost certainly before 1900, and it seems to be Irish. In 1958 the song was recorded in Canada (My Name is Pat and I'm Proud of That). Scottish traveler [[Jeannie Robertson]] from Aberdeen, made the next recorded version in 1961. She has changed it to make reference to "Jock Stewart", one of her relatives, and there are no Irish references. In 1976 Scottish artist [[Archie Fisher]] deliberately altered the song to remove the reference to a dog being shot. In 1985 [[The Pogues]] took it full circle by restoring all the Irish references.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}

Because variants proliferate naturally, it is naïve to believe that there is such a thing as the single "authentic" version of a [[ballad]] such as "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]". Field researchers in traditional song (see below) have encountered countless versions of this ballad throughout the English-speaking world, and these versions often differ greatly from each other. None can reliably claim to be the original, and it is possible that the "original" version ceased to be sung centuries ago.  Many versions can lay an equal claim to authenticity.

The influential folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] felt that these competing variants of a traditional song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological [[natural selection]]: only those new variants that were the most appealing to ordinary singers would be picked up by others and transmitted onward in time. Thus, over time we would expect each traditional song to become aesthetically ever more appealing&amp;nbsp;— it would be collectively composed to perfection, as it were, by the community.

Literary interest in the popular ballad form dates back at least to [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]] and [[William Wordsworth]]. English Elizabethan and Stuart composers had often evolved their music from folk themes, the classical [[Suite (music)|suite]] was based upon stylised folk-dances, and [[Haydn and folk music|Joseph Haydn]]'s use of folk melodies is noted. But the emergence of the term "folk" coincided with an "outburst of national feeling all over Europe" that was particularly strong at the edges of Europe, where [[Self-determination|national identity]] was most asserted. [[Musical nationalism|Nationalist composers]] emerged in Central Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Spain and Britain: the music of [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Manuel de Falla|de Falla]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], and many others drew upon folk melodies.

While the loss of traditional folk music in the face of the rise of [[popular music]] is a worldwide phenomenon, it is not one occurring at a uniform rate throughout the world. The process is most advanced "where [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[Commercialization|commercialisation]] of culture are most advanced"&lt;ref&gt;Alison Vardy, et al., [http://www.celticharpsheetmusic.com/about/traditional-music.htm About Traditional Music Page], Celtic Harp Sheet Music site. Accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but also occurs more gradually even in settings of lower technological advancement. However, the loss of traditional music is slowed in nations or regions where traditional folk music is a badge of cultural or national identity, for instance in the case of [[Bangladesh]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Pakistan]], [[Scotland]], [[Latvia]], [[Turkey]], [[Fado|Portugal]], [[Brittany]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Music of Greece|Greece]] and [[Music of Crete|Crete]]. Tourism revenue can provide a potent incentive to preserve local cultural distinctives. Local government often sponsors and promotes performances during tourist seasons, and revives lost traditions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Early folk music, fieldwork and scholarship ===
Much of what is known about folk music prior to the development of audio recording technology in the 19th century comes from [[Field research|fieldwork]] and writings of scholars, collectors and proponents.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== 19th-century Europe ====
Starting in the 19th century, academics and amateur scholars, taking note of the musical traditions being lost, initiated various efforts to preserve the music of the people. One such effort was the collection by [[Francis James Child]] in the late 19th century of the texts of over three hundred [[ballad]]s in the English and Scots traditions (called the [[Child Ballads]]), some of which predated the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011 page 13" /&gt;

Contemporaneously with Child, the Reverend [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] and later [[Cecil Sharp]] worked  to preserve a great body of English rural traditional song, music and dance, under the aegis of what became and remains the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] (EFDSS). Sharp campaigned with some success to have English traditional songs (in his own heavily edited and expurgated versions) to be taught to school children in hopes of reviving and prolonging the popularity of those songs. Throughout the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, American scholar Bertrand Harris Bronson published an exhaustive four-volume collection of the then-known variations of both the texts and tunes associated with what came to be known as the Child Canon. He also advanced some significant theories concerning the workings of oral-aural tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Similar activity was also under way in other countries. One of the most extensive was perhaps the work done in [[Riga]] by [[Krisjanis Barons]], who between the years 1894 and 1915 published six volumes that included the texts of 217,996 Latvian folk songs, the ''Latvju dainas''. In Norway the work of collectors such as [[Ludvig Mathias Lindeman]] was extensively used by Edvard Grieg in his ''Lyric Pieces'' for piano and in other works, which became immensely popular.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}

Around this time, composers of [[European classical music|classical music]] developed a strong interest in collecting traditional songs, and a number of outstanding composers carried out their own field work on traditional music. These included [[Percy Grainger]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in England and [[Béla Bartók]] in Hungary. These composers, like many of their predecessors, both made arrangements of folk songs and incorporated traditional material into original classical compositions. The ''Latviju dainas'' are extensively used in the classical choral works of [[Andrejs Jurāns]], [[Jānis Cimze]], and [[Emilis Melngailis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== North America ====
[[File:Cecil-sharp-appalachia-map.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Locations in Southern and Central Appalachia visited by the British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] in 1916 (blue), 1917 (green), and 1918 (red). Sharp sought "old world" English and Scottish ballads passed down to the region's inhabitants from their British ancestors. He collected hundreds of such ballads, the most productive areas being the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky.]]

The advent of [[audio recording]] technology provided folklorists with a revolutionary tool to preserve vanishing musical forms. The earliest American folk music scholars were with the [[American Folklore Society]] (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]], but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies as well.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;
In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Library of Congress]] worked through the offices of traditional music collectors [[Robert Winslow Gordon]], [[Alan Lomax]] and others to capture as much North American field material as possible.  Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, ''Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads''.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s. Cecil Sharp also worked in America, recording the traditional songs of the Appalachian Mountains in 1916–1918 in collaboration with [[Maud Karpeles]] and [[Olive Dame Campbell]] and is considered the first major scholar covering American folk music.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Sharp are represented under other names by actors in the modern movie ''[[Songcatcher]]''.

One strong theme amongst folk scholars in the early decades of the 20th century was [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], the analysis of the diversity of folk music (and related cultures) based on regions of the US rather than based on a given song's historical roots. Later, a dynamic of class and circumstances was added to this.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 32–37&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent regionalists were literary figures with a particular interest in folklore. [[Carl Sandburg]] often traveled the U.S. as a writer and a poet.  He also collected songs in his travels and, in 1927, published them in the book ''[[The American Songbag]]''. "In his collections of folk songs, Sandburg added a class dynamic to popular understandings of American folk music. This was the final element of the foundation upon which the early folk music revivalists constructed their own view of Americanism. Sandburg's [[working class]] Americans joined with the [[Ethnic group|ethnically]], [[Race (human categorization)|racially]], and regionally diverse citizens that other scholars, public intellectuals, and folklorists celebrated their own definitions of the American folk, definitions that the folk revivalists used in constructing their own understanding of American folk music, and an overarching American identity".&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1930s, the study of folk music was primarily the province of scholars and collectors.  The 1930s saw the beginnings of larger scale themes, commonalities, themes and linkages in folk music developing in the populace and practitioners as well, often related to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55"&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 39–55&lt;/ref&gt;  Regionalism and [[cultural pluralism]] grew as influences and themes.  During this time folk music began to become enmeshed with political and social activism themes and movements.&lt;ref name="Donaldson, 2011, p 39-55" /&gt; Two related developments were the U.S. Communist Party's interest in folk music as a way to reach and influence Americans,&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; and politically active prominent folk musicians and scholars seeing communism as a possible better system, through the lens of the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woody Guthrie]] exemplifies songwriters and artists with such an outlook.

Folk music festivals proliferated during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 44–52&lt;/ref&gt; [[President Franklin Roosevelt]] was a fan of folk music, hosted folk concerts at the [[White House]], and often patronized folk festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  One prominent festival was [[Sarah Gertrude Knott]]'s [[National Folk Festival (United States)|National Folk Festival]], established in St. Louis, Missouri in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Williams, ''Staging Tradition: John Lair and Sarah Gertrude Knott'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the sponsorship of [[the Washington Post]], the festival was held in Washington, DC at Constitution Hall from 1937–1942.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 103–04&lt;/ref&gt; The folk music movement, festivals, and the wartime effort were seen as forces for social goods such as democracy, cultural pluralism, and the removal of culture and race-based barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, 2011, pp. 105–07&lt;/ref&gt;

The American folk music revivalists of the 1930s approached folk music in different ways.&lt;ref name="Donaldson87" /&gt; Three primary schools of thought emerged: "Traditionalists" (e.g. Sarah Gertrude Knott and [[John Lomax]]) emphasized the preservation of songs as artifacts of deceased cultures. "Functional" folklorists (e.g. Botkin and Alan Lomax) maintained that songs only retain relevance when utilized by those cultures which retain the traditions which birthed those songs.  "Left-wing" folk revivalists (e.g. Charles Seeger and Lawrence Gellert) emphasized music's role "in 'people's' struggles for social and political rights".&lt;ref name="Donaldson87"&gt;Donaldson, 2011, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 1930s these and others had turned American folk music into a social movement.&lt;ref name="Donaldson87" /&gt;

Sometimes folk musicians became scholars and advocates themselves. For example, [[Jean Ritchie]] (born in 1922) was the youngest child of a large family from [[Viper, Kentucky]] that had preserved many of the old [[Appalachia]]n traditional songs. Ritchie, living in a time when the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] had opened up to outside influence, was university educated and ultimately moved to New York City, where she made a number of classic recordings of the family repertoire and published an important compilation of these songs.

In January 2012, the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]], with the Association for Cultural Equity, announced that they would release Lomax's vast archive of 1946 and later recording in digital form. Lomax spent the last 20 years of his life working on an [[Interactive Multimedia|interactive multimedia]] educational computer project he called the [[Cantometrics#Cantometrics as an educational tool|Global Jukebox]], which included 5,000 hours of sound recordings, 400,000 feet of [[film]], 3,000 [[videotape]]s, and 5,000 [[photograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere/ "The Premiere of the Global Jukebox".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124514/http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere/ |date=2012-02-02 }} Radio interview with Don Fleming by [[John Hockenberry]] on [[Public Radio International|PRI]]'s [[The Takeaway]].&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 2012, this has been accomplished.

Many Asian civilizations distinguish between [[Art music|art]]/court/[[Classical music|classical]] styles and "folk" music, though cultures that do not depend greatly upon notation and have much anonymous art music must distinguish the two in different ways from those suggested by western scholars. For example, the late [[Alam Lohar]] is a good example of a classical South Asian folk singer of great repute.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Khunung Eshei/Khuland Eshei is an ancient folk song&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Manipur folk art performances mesmerise Madurai|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manipur-folk-art-performances-mesmerise-madurai/article3028787.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 2006-12-03|access-date = 2015-12-21|issn = 0971-751X|language = en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Meitei people|Meiteis]] of [[Manipur]] who have maintained it for thousands of years. &lt;!--Several claims here need verifying: (1) that many Asian cultures differentiate art/court/classical styles and folk music, (2) that these cultures distinguish these categories in ways different from those suggested by Western scholars, and (3) that Alam Lohar is a good example of a singer of great repute.

===== Folk music of China =====
{{Further|Music of China#Folk music|Shijing|Yuefu}}
Archaeological discoveries date [[Culture of China|Chinese]] folk music back 7000 years; it is largely based on the [[pentatonic scale]].

[[Han dynasty|Han]] traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of [[oboe]] called a [[suona]] and apercussive ensembles called a [[chuigushou]]. Ensembles consisting of [[mouth organ]]s ([[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]]), shawms ([[suona]]), [[flute]]s ([[Dizi (musical instrument)|dizi]]) and percussion instruments (especially [[yunluo]] [[gong]]s) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of [[Beijing]], [[Xi'an]], [[Wutai shan]] and [[Tianjin]]. [[Xi'an]] drum music, consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi'an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[Chinese flute|pipes]], an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western [[free reed]] instruments, such as the [[accordion]]. Parades led by Western-type [[brass band]]s are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band.

In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music|Nanguan]] is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with a love-stricken women. Further south, in [[Shantou]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and [[Chaozhou]], [[erxian]] and [[Guzheng|zheng]] ensembles are popular.[[Sizhu]] ensembles use [[flute]]s and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in [[Nanjing]] and [[Hangzhou]], as well as elsewhere along the southern [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] area. Sizhu has been secularized in cities but remains spiritual in rural areas.[[Jiangnan Sizhu]] (silk and bamboo music from [[Jiangnan]]) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in [[Shanghai]]; it has become widely known outside of its place of origin. [[Guangdong music (genre)|Guangdong Music]] or [[Guangdong music (genre)|Cantonese Music]] is instrumental music from [[Guangzhou]] and surrounding areas. It is based on Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Many pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time. This music tells stories, myths and legends.

===== Traditional folk music of Sri Lanka =====
{{Main|Music of Sri Lanka}}
The genre of [[Sri Lanka]]n music is known as [[Music of Asia|Oriental music]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The art, music and dances of Sri Lanka derives from the elements of nature, and have been enjoyed and developed in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serendib.btoptions.lk/article.php?issue=29&amp;id=734 |title=The Percussive Force |publisher=Serendib.btoptions.lk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The music is of several types and uses only a few types of instruments.

The temple paintings and carvings used birds, elephants, wild animals, flowers and trees, and the [[Traditional 18 Dances]] display the dancing of birds and animals. For example:
* Mayura Wannama&amp;nbsp;– The dance of the [[peacock]]
* Hanuma Wannama&amp;nbsp;– The dance of the [[monkey]]
* Gajaga Wannama&amp;nbsp;– The dance of the [[elephant]]

Musical types include:
* Local drama music includes [[Kolam]], Nadagam and Noorthy types.  Kolam music is based on low country tunes primarily to accompany mask dance in [[exorcism]] rituals. It is considered less developed/evolved, true to the folk tradition and a preserving of a more ancient artform. It is limited to approximately 3–4 notes and is used by the ordinary people for pleasure and entertainment.
* Nadagam music is a more developed form of drama influenced from South Indian street drama which was introduced by some south Indian Artists.  [[Phillippu Singho]] from Negombo in 1824 Performed “[[Harishchandra Nadagama]]” in [[Hanguranketha Divisional Secretariat|Hnguranketha]] which was originally written in [[Telugu language|Telingu]] language. Later “Maname”, “Sanda kinduru” and few others were introduced. [[Don Bastian]] of [[Dehiwala]] introduced Noorthy firstly by looking at Indian dramas and then [[John de Silva|John De Silva]] developed it as did Ramayanaya in 1886.
* [[Sinhala light music]] is currently the most popular type of music in Sri Lanka and enriched with the influence of folk music, kolam music, nadagam music, noorthy music, [[film music]], classical music, western music, and others. Some artists visited India to learn music and later started introducing light music. [[Ananda Samarakoon|Ananda Samarakone]] was the pioneer of this and also composed the national anthem.
The classical [[Sinhalese Orchestra]] consists of five categories of instruments, but among the [[percussion instrument]]s, the [[drum]] is essential for dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.lk/srilanka/sightsandsoundsofsrilanka/srilankanmusicandsounds/index.htm |title=Sri Lankan Music Instrument &amp; sounds |publisher=Info.lk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211001325/http://www.info.lk/srilanka/sightsandsoundsofsrilanka/srilankanmusicandsounds/index.htm |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The vibrant beat of the rhythm of the drums form the basic of the dance. The dancers feet bounce off the floor and they leap and swirl in patterns that reflect the complex rhythms of the drum beat. This drum beat may seem simple on the first hearing but it takes a long time to master the intricate rhythms and variations, which the drummer sometimes can bring to a [[crescendo]] of intensity. There are six common types of drums falling within 3 styles (one-faced, two-faced, and flat-faced):
* The typical Sinhala Dance is identified as the [[Kandy]]an dance and the [[Geta Bera|Gatabera]] drum is indispensable to this dance.
* [[Yak Bera|Yak-bera]] is the demon drum or the, drum used in low country dance in which the dancers wear masks and perform devil dancing, which has become a highly developed form of art.
* The Dawula is a [[barrel]]-shaped drum, and it was used as a companion drum in the past, to keep strict time with the beat.
* The [[Thammattama]] is flat, two-faced drum. The drummer strikes the drum on the two surfaces on top with sticks, unlike the others where you drum on the sides. This is a companion drum to the afore mentioned Dawula.
* A small double headed hand drum, used to accompany songs. It is mostly heard in the poetry dances (vannam).
* The Rabana is a flat faced circular drum and comes in several sizes. The large Rabana has to be placed on the floor like a circular short-legged [[Table (furniture)|table]] and several people (especially the womenfolk) can sit around it and beat on it with both hands. This is used in festivals such as the [[Sinhalese New Year]] and ceremonies such as weddings. The resounding beat of the Rabana symbolizes the joyous moods of the occasion.  The small Rabana is a form of mobile drum beat, since the player carries it wherever he goes.

Other instruments include:
* The "[[Thalampata]]" – 2 small cymbals joined together by a string.
* The wind section, is dominated by an instrument akin to the [[clarinet]]. This is not normally used for the dances. This is important to note because the Sinhalese dance is not set to music as the western world knows it; rhythm is king.
* The [[flute]]s of metal such as silver &amp; brass produce [[Shrillness|shrill]] music to accompany Kandyan Dances, while the plaintive strains of music of the reed flute may pierce the air in devil-dancing. The [[conch-shell]] ([[Hakgediya]]) is another form of a natural instrument, and the player blows it to announce the opening of ceremonies of grandeur.
* The [[Ravanahatha]] (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilisation of Sri Lanka in the time of King Ravana. The bowl is made of cut coconut shell, the mouth of which is covered with goat hide. A dandi, made of bamboo, is attached to this shell. The principal strings are two: one of steel and the other of a set of horsehair. The long bow has jingle bells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=/2011/02/09/art21.asp |title=&amp;#124;&amp;#124; Daily News Online Edition |location=Sri Lanka  |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004045/http://www.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=%2F2011%2F02%2F09%2Fart21.asp |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailynews.lk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/02/13/art01.asp |title=Artscope &amp;#124; Online edition of Daily News – Lakehouse Newspapers |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2008-02-13 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211004038/http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/02/13/art01.asp |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
{{See also|Australian folk music|Indigenous Australian music}}
Folk song traditions were taken to Australia by early settlers from England, Scotland and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]]. The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of [[bush ballads]] often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au" /&gt;

The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Smith, ''Singing Australian: A History of Folk and Country Music'' (Pluto Press Australia, 2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous bush ballad is "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", which has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/waltzingmatilda/ Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?"], The National Library of Australia, retrieved 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous Australian music]] includes the music of [[Australian Aborigine]]s and [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who are collectively called [[Indigenous Australians]]; it incorporates a variety of distinctive traditional [[music]] styles practiced by Indigenous Australian peoples, as well as a range of contemporary musical styles of and [[fusion (music)|fusion]] with European traditions as interpreted and performed by indigenous Australian artists. Music has formed an integral part of the [[society|social]], [[culture|cultural]] and ceremonial observances of these peoples, down through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day. The traditional forms include many aspects of performance and [[musical instrument]]ation unique to particular regions or [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Indigenous Australian groups]]. Equal elements of musical tradition are common through much of the [[Australia]]n continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is related to that of adjacent parts of [[New Guinea]] and so their music is also related. Music is a vital part of Indigenous Australians' cultural maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718052935/http://www.wilurarra.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=24 Wilurarra Creative (2010).

===== Celtic traditional music =====
{{See also|Folk music of Ireland|Folk music of Scotland}}
[[Celtic music]] is a term used by artists, record companies, music stores and music magazines to describe a broad grouping of [[musical genre]]s that evolved out of the folk musical traditions of the [[Celtic people]]s. These traditions include [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Music of the Isle of Man|Manx]], [[Music of Cornwall|Cornish]], [[Music of Wales|Welsh]], and [[Breton music|Breton]] traditions. [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Asturian and Galician music]] is often included, though there is no significant research showing that this has any close musical relationship. [[Music of Brittany|Brittany]]'s Folk revival began in the 1950s with the "bagadoù" and the "kan-ha-diskan" before growing to world fame through [[Alan Stivell]]'s work since the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=saw&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sawyers, June Skinner|title=Celtic Music: A Complete Guide|year=2000|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0306810077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland]], [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]] (although its members were all Irish-born, the group became famous while based in New York's Greenwich Village), [[The Dubliners]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[Planxty]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Pogues]], [[The Corrs]], [[The Irish Rovers]], and a variety of other folk bands have done much over the past few decades to revitalise and re-popularise [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]]. These bands were rooted, to a greater or lesser extent, in a tradition of Irish music and benefited from the efforts of artists such as [[Seamus Ennis]] and [[Peter Douglas Kennedy|Peter Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=saw /&gt;

In [[Scotland]], [[The Corries]], [[Silly Wizard]], [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]], [[Runrig]], [[Jackie Leven]], [[Julie Fowlis]], [[Karine Polwart]], [[Alasdair Roberts (musician)|Alasdair Roberts]], [[Dick Gaughan]], [[Wolfstone]], [[Boys of the Lough]], and [[The Silencers (band)|The Silencers]] have kept Scottish folk vibrant and fresh by mixing traditional Scottish and Gaelic folk songs with more contemporary genres. These artists have also been commercially successful in continental Europe and North America. There is an emerging wealth of talent in the Scottish traditional music scene, with bands such as [[Mànran]], [[Skipinnish]], Barluath and [[Breabach]] and solo artists such as Patsy Reid, [[Robyn Stapleton]] and Mischa MacPherson gaining many successes in recent years.

===== Central and Eastern Europe =====
{{See also|Music of Belarus|Hungarian folk music|Music of Moldova|Russian traditional music|Music of Ukraine|Bard (Soviet Union)|Music of Slovenia|Czech folklore}}
During the Communist era national folk dancing in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was actively promoted by the state. Dance troupes from Russia and Poland toured non-communist Europe from about 1937 to 1990. The [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army Choir]] recorded many albums. Eastern Europe is also the origin of the Jewish [[Klezmer]] tradition.
[[File:Ľubomír Párička gra na dudach.webm|thumb|Ľubomír Párička playing bagpipes, Czech Republic]]
The [[polka]] is a central European [[dance]] and also a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[dancing music|dance music]] familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. It originated in the middle of the 19th century in [[Bohemia]]. Polka is still a popular genre of folk music in many European countries and is performed by folk artists in [[Poland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Netherlands]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Slovakia]]. Local varieties of this dance are also found in the [[Nordic countries]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Latin America]] (especially [[Mexico]]), and in the [[United States]].

German [[Lied|Volkslieder]] perpetuated by [[Liederhandschrift]]en manuscripts like ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' date back to medieval [[Minnesang]] and [[Meistersinger]] traditions. Those folk songs revived in the late 18th century period of [[German Romanticism]], first promoted by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and other advocates of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], later compiled by [[Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]] (''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'') as well as by [[Ludwig Uhland]].

The [[Volksmusik]] and [[folk dance]]s genre, especially in the [[Alps|Alpine]] regions of [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] (''[[Ranz des Vaches|Kuhreihen]]'') and [[South Tyrol]], up to today has clinged on rustic communities against the backdrop of [[industrialisation]]—Low German [[sea shanty|shanties]] or the [[Wienerlied]] (''[[Schrammelmusik]]'') being notable exceptions. [[Music of Slovenia|Slovene]] folk music in [[Upper Carniola]] and [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]] also originated from the Alpine traditions. Traditional ''Volksmusik'' is not to be confused with commercial ''[[Volkstümliche Musik]]'' variations, strongly related to German [[Schlager music]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Hungarian group [[Muzsikás]] played numerous American tours and participated in the Hollywood movie ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' while the singer [[Márta Sebestyén]] worked with the band [[Deep Forest]]. The Hungarian ''[[táncház]]'' movement, started in the 1970s, involves strong cooperation between musicology experts and enthusiastic amateurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, traditional Hungarian folk music and folk culture barely survived in some rural areas of Hungary, and it has also begun to disappear among the [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnic Hungarians]] in [[Transylvania]]. The táncház movement revived broader folk traditions of music, dance, and costume together and created a new kind of music club. The movement spread to ethnic Hungarian communities elsewhere in the world.

===== Balkan music =====

[[File:Misteriata-na-balgarskite-glasove.jpg|thumb|[[Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir|The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices]]]]
The Balkan folk music was influenced by the mingling of Balkan ethnic groups in the period of [[Ottoman Empire]]. It comprises the [[music of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Music of Greece|Greece]], [[Music of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Music of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Music of Romania|Romania]], [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Music of Albania|Albania]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkey]], some of the historical states of [[Music of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] or the [[Music of Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] and geographical regions such as [[Music of Thrace|Thrace]].

Nordic folk music includes a number of traditions in [[Northern Europe]]an, especially [[Scandinavia]]n, countries.  The [[Nordic countries]] are generally taken to include [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. Sometimes it is taken to include [[Greenland]] and historically the [[Baltic countries]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].

The many regions of the Nordic countries share certain traditions, many of which have diverged significantly.  It is possible to group together the Baltic states (or, sometimes, only Estonia) and parts of northwest Russia as sharing cultural similarities, contrasted with Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Atlantic islands of, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  Greenland's Inuit culture has its own musical traditions, influenced by Scandinavian culture.  Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the Baltic nations and the Scandinavian nations.  The Saami of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia have their own unique culture, with ties to the neighboring cultures.

[[Swedish folk music]] is a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[music]] based largely on [[folkloristics|folkloric]] collection work that began in the early 19th century in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky, David (2005) pp. 33–41. "Hidden Traditions: Conceptualizing Swedish Folk Music in the Twenty-First Century."  Ph.D. Dissertation, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary instrument of Swedish folk music is the [[fiddle]].  Another common [[musical instrument|instrument]], unique to Swedish traditions, is the [[nyckelharpa]].  Most Swedish instrumental folk music is [[dance music]]; the signature music and dance form within Swedish folk music is the [[polska (dance)|polska]].  Vocal and instrumental traditions in Sweden have tended to share [[Tune (folk music)|tunes]] historically, though they have been performed separately.&lt;ref&gt;Jersild, Margareta (1976) pp. 53–66. "Om förhållandet mellan vokalt och instrumentalt i svensk folkmusik.  ''Svensk tidskrift för musikforskning'' 58(2): 53–66. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning with the [[folk music revival]] of the 1970s, [[vocalist]]s and [[instrumentalist]]s have also begun to perform together in folk music [[musical ensemble|ensembles]].

==== Latin and South America ====
{{See also|Andean music|Cueca|Nueva canción}}
Folk music on the Americas consists on the encounter and union of three main musical types: European traditional music, traditional music of the American natives and tribal African music that arrived among the slaves, main differences consist on the particular type of each of these main slopes.

Particular case of Latin and South American music points to [[Andean music]] among other native musical styles (such as Caribbean, pampean and selvatic), Iberean music ([[Music of Spain|Spain]] and [[Music of Portugal|Portugal]]) and generally speaking [[Music of Africa|African]] tribal music, that fused together evolving in differentiated musical forms along South and Central America.

[[Andean music]] comes from the general area inhabited by [[Quechua people|Quechuas]], [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] and other peoples that roughly in the area of the [[Inca Empire]] prior to European contact. It includes folklore music of parts of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]]. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The [[Nueva Canción]] movement of the 1970s revived the genre across Latin America and bought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.

[[Nueva canción]] (Spanish for 'new song') is a movement and genre within [[Latin American music|Latin American]] and [[Iberia]]n music of folk music, folk-inspired music and socially committed music. It some respects its development and role is similar to the second folk music revival. This includes evolution of this new genre from traditional folk music, essentially contemporary folk music except that that English genre term is not commonly applied to it. Nueva cancion is recognized as having played a powerful role in the social upheavals in Portugal, Spain and Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s.

Nueva cancion first surfaced during the 1960s as "The Chilean New Song" in [[Chile]]. The musical style emerged shortly afterwards in Spain and other areas of Latin America where it came to be known under similar names. Nueva canción renewed traditional Latin American folk music, and was soon associated with revolutionary movements, the Latin American [[New Left]], [[Liberation Theology]], [[hippie]] and [[human rights]] movements due to political lyrics. It would gain great popularity throughout [[Latin America]], and is regarded as a precursor to [[Rock en español]].

[[Cueca]] is a family of musical styles and associated dances from [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Argentina]].

[[Trova]] and [[Son (music)|Son]] are styles of traditional [[Cuban music]] originating in the province of Oriente that includes influences from Spanish song and dance such as [[Bolero]] and [[contradanza]] as well as [[Afro-Cuban]] rhythm and percussion elements.

[[Moda de viola]] is the name designed to Brazilian folk music. Is often performed with a 6-string nylon acoustic guitar, but the most traditional instrument is the [[viola caipira]]. The songs basically detailed the hardness of life of those who work in the country. The themes are usually associated with the land, animals, folklore, impossible love and separation. Although there are some upbeat songs, most of them are nostalgic and melancholic.

Canada's traditional folk music is particularly diverse.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;  Even prior to liberalizing its immigration laws in the 1960s, Canada was ethnically diverse with dozens of different Indigenous and European groups present.  In terms of music, academics do not speak of a Canadian tradition, but rather ethnic traditions ([[Acadian music]], [[Irish-Canadian music]], [[Blackfoot music]], [[Innu music]], [[Inuit music]], [[Métis fiddle]], etc.) and later in Eastern Canada regional traditions ([[Music of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland music]], [[Cape Breton fiddling]], [[Quebecois music]], etc.)

{{quote|Traditional folk music of European origin has been present in Canada since the arrival of the first French and British settlers in the 16th and 17th centuries....They fished the coastal waters and farmed the shores of what became Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and the St Lawrence River valley of Quebec.

The fur trade and its [[voyageurs]] brought this farther north and west into Canada; later lumbering operations and lumberjacks continued this process.

Agrarian settlement in eastern and southern Ontario and western Quebec in the early 19th century established a favorable milieu for the survival of many Anglo-Canadian folksongs and broadside ballads from Great Britain and the US. Despite massive industrialization, folk music traditions have persisted in many areas until today. In the north of Ontario, a large Franco-Ontarian population kept folk music of French origin alive.

Populous Acadian communities in the Atlantic provinces contributed their song variants to the huge corpus of folk music of French origin centred in the province of Quebec. A rich source of Anglo-Canadian folk music can be found in the Atlantic region, especially Newfoundland. Completing this mosaic of musical folklore is the Gaelic music of Scottish settlements, particularly in Cape Breton, and the hundreds of Irish songs whose presence in eastern Canada dates from the Irish famine of the 1840s, which forced the large migrations of Irish to North America.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Peacock, Carmelle Bégin |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/folk-music-emc/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |title=Folk music |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Knowledge of the [[history of Canada]]", wrote Isabelle Mills in 1974, "is essential in understanding the mosaic of Canadian folk song. Part of this mosaic is supplied by the folk songs of Canada brought by European and Anglo-Saxon settlers to the new land."&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;Mills, Isabelle (1974). http://cjtm.icaap.org/content/2/v2art5.html The Heart of the Folk Song, ''[[Canadian Journal for Traditional Music]]'' Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; She describes how the French colony at Québec brought French immigrants, followed before long by waves of immigrants from Great Britain, Germany, and other European countries, all bringing music from their homelands, some of which survives into the present day. Ethnographer and folklorist [[Marius Barbeau]] estimated that well over ten thousand French folk songs and their variants had been collected in Canada. Many of the older ones had by then died out in France.

Music as professionalized paid entertainment grew relatively slowly in Canada, especially remote rural areas, through the 19th and early 20th centuries.  While in urban music clubs of the [[dance hall]]/[[vaudeville]] variety became popular, followed by jazz, rural Canada remained mostly a land of traditional music. Yet when American radio networks began broadcasting into Canada in the 1920s and 1930s, the audience for Canadian traditional music progressively declined in favour of [[Nashville sound|American Nashville-style country music]] and urban styles like jazz.  The [[Americanization]] of Canadian music led the [[Canadian Radio League]] to lobby for a national public broadcaster in the 1930s, eventually leading to the creation of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) in 1936. The CBC promoted Canadian music, including traditional music, on its radio and later television services, but the [[modernism|mid-century craze for all things "modern"]] led to the decline of folk music relative to rock and pop. Canada was however influenced by the folk music revival of the 1960s, when  local venues such as the Montreal Folk Workshop, and other folk clubs and coffee houses across the country, became crucibles for emerging songwriters and performers as well as for interchange with artists visiting from abroad.

American traditional music is also called roots music.  Roots music is a broad category of music including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[old time music]], [[jug band]]s, [[Appalachian folk music|Appalachian folk]], [[blues]], [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]].  The music is considered American either because it is native to the [[United States]] or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck [[musicologist]]s as something distinctly new. It is considered "roots music" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including [[rock and roll]], contemporary folk music, [[rhythm and blues]], and [[jazz]]. Some of these genres are considered to be traditional folk music.
* [[Cajun music]], an emblematic [[music of Louisiana]], is rooted in the [[ballads]] of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s of [[Canada]]. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]-based, [[Cajun]]-influenced [[zydeco]] form, both of [[Acadiana]] origin. These [[French Louisiana#Modern French Louisiana|French Louisiana]] sounds have influenced [[American popular music]] for many decades, especially [[country music]], and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials.
* [[Appalachian music]] is the traditional music of the region of [[Appalachia]] in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences, including English [[ballad]]s, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially [[fiddle]] music), hymns, and African-American [[blues]].  First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of [[Old-time music]], [[country music]], and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and were an important part of the [[American folk music revival]].  Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the [[banjo]], [[American fiddle]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|fretted dulcimer]], and [[guitar]].&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Ted Olson, "Music&amp;nbsp;– Introduction".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early recorded Appalachian musicians include [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], [[Henry Whitter]], [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], the [[Carter Family]], [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Frank Proffitt]], and [[Dock Boggs]], all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Ola Belle Reed]], [[Lily May Ledford]], and [[Doc Watson]].  Country and bluegrass artists such as [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Roy Acuff]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Chet Atkins]], and [[Don Reno]] were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;  Artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Jerry Garcia]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs.
* The [[Carter Family]] was a [[American folk music|traditional American folk music]] group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[Southern Gospel]], [[popular music|pop]] and [[rock music]]ians. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars; a beginning of the divergence of country music from traditional folk music. Their recordings of such songs as "[[Wabash Cannonball]]" (1932), "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]" (1935), "[[Wildwood Flower]]" (1928), and "[[Keep On the Sunny Side]]" (1928) made them country standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Definitive Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock |last=Heatley |first=Michael |year=2007 |publisher=Star Fire |location=London |isbn=978-1844519965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Folk music revival" refers to either a period of renewed interest in traditional folk music, or to an event or period which transforms it; the latter usually includes a social activism component. A prominent example of the former is the British folk revival of approximately 1890–1920. The most prominent and influential example of the latter (to the extent that it is usually called "''the'' folk music revival") is the folk revival of the mid 20th century, centered in the English-speaking world which gave birth to contemporary folk music.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=shows 18–19}}  See the "[[Contemporary folk music]]" article for a description of this revival.

One earlier revival influenced western [[classical music]]. Such composers as [[Percy Grainger]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and [[Béla Bartók]], made field recordings or transcriptions of folk singers and musicians.

In Spain, [[Isaac Albéniz]] (1860–1909) produced piano works reflect his Spanish heritage, including the ''[[Suite Iberia]]'' (1906–1909). [[Enrique Granados]] (1867–1918) composed ''[[zarzuela]]'', Spanish light opera, and ''Danzas Españolas'' – Spanish Dances. [[Manuel de Falla]] (1876–1946) became interested in the [[cante jondo]] of Andalusian [[flamenco]], the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works, which include ''[[Nights in the Gardens of Spain]]'' and ''Siete canciones populares españolas'' ("Seven Spanish Folksongs", for voice and piano). Composers such as [[Fernando Sor]] and [[Francisco Tarrega]] established the [[guitar]] as Spain's national instrument.  Modern Spanish folk artists abound ([[Mil i Maria]], [[Russian Red]], et al.) modernizing while respecting the traditions of their forebears.

Flamenco grew in popularity through the 20th century, as did northern styles such as the Celtic music of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. French classical composers, from [[Bizet]] to [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], also drew upon Spanish themes, and distinctive Spanish genres became universally recognized.

Folk music revivals or [[roots revival]]s also encompass a range of phenomena around the world where there is a renewed interest in traditional music.  This is often by the young, often in the traditional music of their own country, and often included new incorporation of social awareness, causes, and evolutions of new music in the same style. [[Nueva canción]], a similar evolution of a new form of socially committed music occurred in several Spanish speaking countries.

=== First British folk revival ===
The "first" [[British folk revival]] was a [[roots revival]] which occurred approximately 1890–1920 and was marked by heightened interest in traditional music and its preservation. It arose from earlier developments, perhaps combined with changes in the nature of British identity, led to a much more intensive and academic attempt to record what was seen as a vanishing tradition, and is now usually referred to as the first English or British folk revival.

;United States
It is sometimes claimed that the earliest folk festival was the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival, 1928, in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], founded by [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]]. The [[National Folk Festival (USA)]] is an itinerant folk festival in the [[United States]]. Since 1934, it has been run by the [[National Council for the Traditional Arts]] (NCTA) and has been presented in 26 communities around the nation. After leaving some of these communities, the National Folk Festival has [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] several locally run folk festivals in its wake including the [[Lowell Folk Festival]], the Richmond Folk Festival, the [[American Folk Festival]] and, most recently, the Montana Folk Festival.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[File:Fontana del Tritone,Rome.jpg|thumb|''Fontana del Tritone'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], Piazza Barberini, Rome]]

'''Fontana del Tritone''' (''Triton Fountain'') is a seventeenth-century fountain in Rome, by the [[Baroque]] sculptor [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. Commissioned by his patron, Pope [[Urban VIII]], the fountain is located in the Piazza Barberini, near the entrance to the [[Palazzo Barberini]] (which now houses the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]]) that Bernini helped to design and construct for the [[Barberini]], Urban's family.&lt;ref&gt;The Palazzo Barberini was built according to a plan by the architect [[Carlo Maderno]]. When Maderno died in 1629, Bernini took over supervising its construction. Both the fountain and palace are close to [[Borromini]]'s [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]]&lt;/ref&gt; This fountain should be distinguished from the nearby ''Fontana dei Tritoni'' (Fountain of the Tritons) by  [[Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri]] in [[Piazza Bocca della Verità]] which features two Tritons.

The [[fountain]] was executed in [[travertine]] in 1642&amp;ndash;43. At its centre rises a larger than lifesize muscular [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], a minor sea god of ancient Greco-Roman legend, depicted as a [[merman]] kneeling on the sum of four dolphin tailfins. His head is thrown back and his arms raise a [[conch]] to his lips; from it a jet of water spurts, formerly rising dramatically higher than it does today.  The fountain has a base of four [[dolphin]]s&lt;ref&gt;The dolphins are represented in their heraldic conventionalization, not as they appear in nature.&lt;/ref&gt; that entwine the [[papal tiara]] with crossed keys and the heraldic [[Barberini]] bees in their scaly tails.&lt;ref&gt;Two finished terracotta ''[[Glossary of sculpting terms|bozzetti]]'' at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], (accession numbers 52.218 and 52.219) securely attributed to Bernini, reflect his exploration of the fountain's themes of the intertwined upended dolphins and the muscular, scaly-tailed Triton.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Tritone'', the first of Bernini's free-standing urban fountains, was erected to provide water from the [[Acqua Felice]] aqueduct which Urban had restored, in a dramatic celebration. It was Bernini's last major commission from his great patron who died in 1644. At the Triton Fountain, Urban and Bernini brought the idea of a sculptural fountain, familiar from [[villa]] gardens, decisively to a public urban setting for the first time; previous public fountains in the city of Rome had been passive basins for the reception of public water.

Bernini has represented the triton to illustrate the triumphant passage from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' book I, evoking godlike control over the waters and describing the draining away of the [[Deluge (mythology)|Universal Deluge]]. The passage that Urban set Bernini to illustrate, was well known to all literate Roman contemporaries:

:''Already Triton, at his call, appears
:''Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears;
:''And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears.
:''The sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire,
:''And give the waves the signal to retire.
:''His writhen shell he takes; whose narrow vent
:''Grows by degrees into a large extent,
:''Then gives it breath; the blast with doubling sound,
:''Runs the wide circuit of the world around:
:''The sun first heard it, in his early east,
:''And met the rattling ecchos in the west.
:''The waters, list'ning to the trumpet's roar,
:''Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.
:::&amp;mdash;free translation by Sir Samuel Garth, John Dryden, et al..&lt;!--retaining original spelling--&gt;

Two finished terracotta ''[[Glossary of sculpting terms|bozzetti]]'' at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;Accession numbers 52.218 and 52.219.&lt;/ref&gt; securely attributed to Bernini, reflect his exploration of the fountain's themes of the intertwined upended dolphins and the muscular, scaly-tailed Triton.

==Subsequent history==
[[File:Sculptures of dolphins in Fontana del Tritone (Rome).jpg|thumb|''Fontana del Tritone'' dolphins heads]]
The Triton Fountain is one of those evoked in [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Fontane di Roma]]''. The legend applied to [[Trevi Fountain]] has been extended to this: that any visitor who throws a coin into the water (while facing away from the fountain) will have guaranteed their return to Rome.

The setting of the Piazza Barberini has changed significantly since the seventeenth century. Engravings of the time and photographs from the nineteenth century show much lower buildings around the piazza, which would have made the fountain much more dramatic. However, it is a tribute to the artistic judgement of Bernini that even now, with tall buildings around the traffic-ridden piazza, that the Triton Fountain can still maintain a dramatic presence.

The '''Golden Mile''' (or, colloquially, "The Mile") is the popular stretch of [[beach]]front in the city of [[Durban]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]], including the [[promenade]] that runs along with it. It runs roughly from uShaka Beach (where the [[uShaka Marine World]] is located) in [[Point Waterfront]] to [[Suncoast Casino and Entertainment World]] in the north and now includes a route directly to Moses Mabhida Stadium. It abuts the central business district of the city to its west. 

It is one of the main tourist attractions in the Durban area. The wide stretch of golden sands, artificially separated by various [[piers]], provides excellent opportunities for sun-worshippers and swimmers to enjoy the sub-tropical sunshine and warm waters of the [[Indian Ocean]]. Most of the Mile's beaches are protected year-round by [[lifeguards]] and [[shark]] nets. The Mile is also a well-known [[surfing|surfer's]] haven. The South Beach end, in particular, is well known as a safe beach for neophyte surfers. The beachfront properties are a mix of residential [[apartments]] and tourist [[hotels]], development of which boomed in the 1970s, although remnants of Durban's [[art-deco]] architecture are still evident. Interspersed among the beachfront properties are several popular restaurants and nightclubs.

The Golden Mile has long been a popular [[domestic holiday]] destination and during the holiday seasons (June–July and December–January) 
South Africans from across the country, but in particular the [[Gauteng]] region, flock to enjoy its many attractions, which include:

*[[Blue Lagoon (Durban)|Blue Lagoon]], a popular hangout, picnic and fishing spot
*''Mini Town'' with a miniature replica of Durban, complete with a working miniature railway and airport.
*[[Moses Mabhida Stadium]]
*Traditional market vendors and other hawkers with a selection of [[Zulu people|Zulu]] art and crafts.
*An [[oceanway]] pavement along the beaches to encourage more people to enjoy walking and cycling.
*[[Suncoast Casino and Entertainment World]], a casino complex with a semi-private beach, restaurants, shops and public entertainment facilities.
*[[uShaka Marine World]] aquarium, water park, dolphinarium, containing a restaurant with the largest shark tank in the world.
*[[North Beach (Durban)|North Beach]], [[Dairy Beach]], the [[Bay of Plenty (Durban)|Bay of Plenty]], Snake Park, Pirates and Country Club beaches are popular [[surfing]] beaches separated by the piers.
*The Skate Park in front of the Bay of Plenty caters for skateboarders, roller bladers and BMX'ers.
*The Surfing Museum, a historical site cataloguing some of Durban's surfing history.

[[File:Wanna live here? It will be a nice price! (8225766410).jpg|thumb|Section of a mural of ''[[tong lau]]'' on [[Graham Street]] by Alex Croft]]

In [[Hong Kong]] there are a few types of graffiti that are utilized for different reasons. The face of artist [[Ai WeiWei]] is one of the more well-known caricatures in the region. Journalist and commentators have considered the graffiti as "street-art", "creative" and the "voice of the young".&lt;ref name="Cheung2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Chi-wai Cheung|title=Media Power in Hong Kong: Hyper-Marketized Media and Cultural Resistance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nSPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|date=12 February 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-26657-0|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti is often a mode of expression much like other artistic outlets. It can allow artists to vent emotions as well as their opinions on the politics or society around them. Unlike other places around the world, Graffiti in Hong Kong can be used as a way of advertisement for some companies.

Similar to other countries however, graffiti is considered defacing public property and is technically an illegal act in Hong Kong. While graffiti is not prosecuted as commonly as in the United States, fines and arrest still do occur.&lt;ref name="vice_IWen"&gt;{{Cite web| title = I Went Bombing with Hong Kong's Biggest Graffiti Writers| author = Mock, Ray| work = Vice| date = 2016-07-17| accessdate = 2018-03-08| url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9b8kgy/hong-kong-graffiti-tour-xme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of graffiti==
[[Graffiti]] is a term applied to a range of illegally created marks in which there has been an attempt to establish some sort of coherent composition that people could resonate with, or one that conveys messages.  Such marks are made by an individual or individuals, who might not be professional artists, upon a [[wall]] or other surface that is usually visually accessible to the public.

==Different styles of graffiti in Hong Kong==

===Calligraphy graffiti===
[[Tsang Tsou Choi]], also known as the "King of Kowloon", was the founder of [[Hong Kong]] [[calligraphy]] graffiti.  His graffiti work is different from general [[spray painting]]; he used [[ink brush]]es to write [[word]]s on walls instead of spray painting to express his ideas and thoughts towards society. The [[aesthetic]] value of his works of art stirred up much controversy over Hong Kong. Still, most Hong Kong citizens still pay respect and attention to his graffiti, even though he died in 2007.&lt;ref name="scmp_Whyg"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Why graffiti has never taken off in oh-so-law-abiding Hong Kong| author = Sin, Ben | author2 = Westcott, Ben| work = South China Morning Post| date = 2016-06-05| accessdate = 2018-03-08| url = http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/1962466/why-graffiti-has-never-taken-oh-so-law-abiding-hong-kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spray painted graffiti===
Spray painting graffiti is one of the most popular styles adopted by graffiti artists. Hong Kong graffiti artists have a unique sense on where to do graffiti to reflect different aesthetic feelings of their works. For instance, [[drawing]] on [[rust]]y surfaces like iron walls produces a vintage feeling of the work. Drawings on uneven [[stone]] walls gives a strong dimensional sense.

===Ai WeiWei's portrait===
[[Ai WeiWei]], a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[contemporary artist]] and [[activist]], was arrested by [[Beijing]] authorities for "economic crimes" . Ai's [[portrait]] was later painted on walls facing streets in Hong Kong by a teenage girl, who attempted to raise awareness of [[human rights]] and reveal the dark side of the [[Chinese government]]. Ai's portrait was even projected on Wall of the [[People's Liberation Army]] Building via [[laser]].&lt;ref name="reut_Pro-"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Pro-Ai graffiti in Hong Kong sparks warning by Chinese army| last = Staff | first = Reuters| work = Reuters| date = 2011-04-30| accessdate = 2018-03-08| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-grafitti-ai/pro-ai-graffiti-in-hong-kong-sparks-warning-by-chinese-army-idUSLNE74101720110502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government response==
Per [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|basic law]], modifying a [[public property]] without permission is illegal in Hong Kong. On 13 July 2009, a French graffiti artist name Zevs painted a [[Chanel]] [[logo]] on the outside wall of an Armani store in central Hong Kong. He was arrested for his illicit spray-painting and was detained in Hong Kong until August. In 2011, a painted portrait of [[Ai WeiWei]] resulted in an investigation by [[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] and the Crime Investigate Detective. Invader, another famous graffiti artist, has been spreading his work in Hong Kong since 2001; he has painted at least 74 [[mosaic]] print tiles on city streets. Most of them have been removed. In 2014, a [[Pac-Man]] print in [[Tin Hau]] also produced by Invader was removed for safety reasons. Such actions have stirred up much disagreement. The public did not agree that tile mosaics on walls would cause any harm and danger to [[society]]. Some news articles and journals criticised the [[Government of Hong Kong|government]] for their actions towards [[street art]]. However, the government continued to take down Invader's work.

Though [[painting]] on public properties without permission is illegal, Hong Kong's government promised to preserve the painted works of King of Kowloon [[Tsang Tsou Choi]], though most have already been cleaned away. The [[wall of fame]] in [[Mong Kok]]'s [[Argyle Street, Hong Kong|Argyle Street]] provides a canvas for Hong Kong graffiti artists.&lt;ref name="hong_Mong"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Mongkok's Graffiti Wall of Fame!| author = | work = Hong Kong Hustle| date = 3 July 2013| accessdate = 2018-03-08| url = https://www.hongkonghustle.com/art-design/7944/hong-kong-graffiti-wall-of-fame-mongkok-bute-luen-wan-street-argyle-alley-kowloon-hk-china-street-art-mk-style-artist-piece/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government seems to have accepted the street as a "graffiti community" even though street artists are violating the law. Paintings extend over the wall for two blocks.

==Purposes of doing graffiti in Hong Kong==
Graffiti in Hong Kong can be divided into three aspects — as an [[emotion]]al outlet, for [[political dissent|political dissatisfaction]], and as [[advertisement]].

===Emotional Outletting===
Graffiti related to emotions can generally be seen in [[tunnel]]s and under bridges, where the public might not easily notice. For instance, spray painted words like "free" or "heart broken" can be seen painted on walls. The reason for such placement is to provide artists with an outlet to [[artistic expression|express]] their personal emotions. Many people express their feelings through writing and talking. However, there are people who aren't good at oral or written [[communication]]. Instead, they are more comfortable with [[drawing]] and [[art]]. Graffiti is an illegal street art, and some people are attracted to the exciting and rebellious feeling of doing illegal things in an attempt to voice their opinions.

===Political dissatisfaction===
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Graffiti on the road (Mong Kok, HK) (1).jpg|Graffiti on the road (Mong Kok, HK)
File:Graffiti on the road (Mong Kok, HK) (2).jpg|Graffiti on the road (Mong Kok, HK)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Graffiti can also be used to voice [[opinion]]s and dissatisfaction towards [[government authority|authorities]]. For instance, there was graffiti related to "real [[universal suffrage]]" being drawn in [[Admiralty (HK)|Admiralty]] during [[2014 Hong Kong protests|the Occupy Central protests in 2014]]. Individuals voiced their [[anger]] and depression towards both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments through graffiti work. They hoped to make common cause with Hong Kong [[citizen]]s through graffiti art in order to gain more support for universal suffrage. For example,  protesters not only did chalk paint graffiti, but also created a [[mural]] made from thousands of [[Post-it note|Post-It notes]] with citizens' wishes written on each. Couplets with citizens' petitions were also hung on a [[footbridge]].

===Advertisement===
Graffiti can also be used cheaply as a medium to advertise in Hong Kong. It is quite common to see advertisements spray-painted on [[public buildings|public facilities]], [[letter box|mailslots]], [[transformer]] boxes, [[street sign]]s, and so on. Company names and contact data might be written or drawn in an attempt for publication purposes. Such graffiti can be commonly seen in traditional [[Districts of Hong Kong|districts]] such as [[Sham Shui Po]] and [[Kwun Tong]]. It is a style of graffiti unique to Hong Kong.

'''''Ill Met by Moonlight: The Abduction of General Kreipe'''''  is a non-fiction partly-autobiographical book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Moss, W. Stanley. ''Ill Met by Moonlight'', 2014, Orion|url=https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781780226231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Dry|url=http://pauldrybooks.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=PDB&amp;Product_Code=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[W. Stanley Moss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Davis, Wes. ''The Ariadne Objective'', 2014, Random House|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/the-ariadne-objective/9780593072806}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[British people|British]] soldier, writer and traveller. It describes an operation in Crete during the Second World War to capture German general [[Heinrich Kreipe]]. Moss kept a diary during the war years and based his book on it. The 2014 edition includes an introduction by one of Moss's children and an afterword by [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]].

The story was made into a [[Ill Met by Moonlight (film)|1957 film with the same title]] starring [[Dirk Bogarde]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] writer-director-producer team of [[Powell and Pressburger|Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger]].

==Development and publication==
Moss recounted his and [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]]’s activities during the [[Second World War]] as agents in [[Crete]] of the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), notably their extraordinary [[Kidnap of General Kreipe|kidnapping of Heinrich Kreipe]], Commander of the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Infantry Division]] that was occupying Crete, and his removal to [[Cairo]] (and British war forces) in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Secret War Exhibition, Imperial War Museum, London,|url= http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was written in early 1945 but was censored by the Head of SOE, [[Colin Gubbins|Major-General Sir Colin Gubbins]] (CD), by instruction to [[Colin Hercules Mackenzie|Colin Mackenzie]] (BB100), Head of [[Force 136]]. When the book was finally published in 1950, it was selected by [[W. Somerset Maugham]] as one of the best three books of that year writing,"more thrilling than any detective story I can remember, and written in a modest and most engaging manner".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times '', 24 December 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''London Mystery Magazine #10 '', June - July 1951, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The book was chosen to lead the BBC's famous radio series ''Now it can be told'' of 1950.

==Summary==
{{main|Kidnap of Heinrich Kreipe}}

In May 1941, German forces attacked and occupied Crete. Allied forces were driven back and evacuated to North Africa by June. The [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) inserted agents on Crete in order to work with the local [[Cretan resistance|resistance]] in harrying German occupying forces.

On 4 February 1944, Major [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]] and Captain [[William Stanley Moss]] and two Cretan SOE agents left Egypt by plane for Crete. Their intention was to parachute into Crete but after arriving at the [[drop zone]], only Leigh Fermor was able to parachute successfully. The others had to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and were returned to Egypt. On landing Leigh Fermor was met by a group from the [[Cretan resistance]], with whom he remained until the arrival of the rest of the SOE team. After three more attempts at a parachute jump over a two-month period, Moss and the other two arrived by Motor Launch ML 842 on 4 April 1944. They were met on the beach by Leigh Fermor and another SOE agent, Sandy Rendel.

Their target General Müller was replaced by General Kreipe just before they arrived.  The team decided to proceed with the plan to abduct the German commanding officer.  The SOE team included a number of Cretans; 'Anthony' (Antonis Papaleonidas), 'Micky' (Michalis Akoumianakis) and Grigorios Chnarakis. Micky was especially welcome as his house was opposite Kreipe's residence, the [[Villa Ariadne]], in the village of [[Knossos]]. The team reconnoitred the area and planned the abduction. Dressed as a Cretan shepherd, Leigh Fermor travelled on the local bus to check Knossos and the area around the German headquarters. He decided that the German headquarters would be too difficult to penetrate. After a few days of alternately observing the actions of the General, they finalized the details of the abduction. The plan was for the two British officers, dressed as [[corporal]]s in the  ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]'' (German military police), to stop the general's car on his way home at what was supposed to be a routine check point.

On the night of 26 April 1944, the two British officers stopped the General's car before the Villa Ariadne. When the car stopped, Leigh Fermor took care of Kreipe and Moss knocked the driver out with his cosh.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, Ben, ''The Times'', 11 June 2011, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moss's cosh held by Imperial War Museum London, Catalogue ref WEA 4182&lt;/ref&gt; Moss drove the team and the General in the General's car for an hour and a half through 22 controlled road blocks in [[Heraklion]] before leaving Leigh Fermor to abandon the car. When Leigh Fermor left the car, he also left documents revealing that the kidnapping had been done by [[British Commandos]] so that no reprisals should be taken against the local population.

With his Cretan escorts, Moss set off with the General across country to a rendezvous where they would be joined by Leigh Fermor. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British motor launch (ML 842 commanded by Brian Coleman) was to pick them up. On 14 May 1944, the SOE team and the general were finally picked up from a beach near [[Rodakino]], possibly Peristeres beach, on the southern side of the island. They were transported to safety, landing at [[Mersa Matruh]] in Egypt.

After the war, a member of Kreipe’s staff reported how, on hearing the news of the kidnapping, an uneasy silence in the officers' mess in Heraklion was followed by, “Well gentlemen, I think this calls for champagne all round.”&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, Artemis, ''Cairo in the War 1939–1945'', Hamish Hamilton, 1989, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Post War correspondence explains that Kreipe was disliked by his soldiers because, amongst other things, he objected to the stopping of his own vehicle for checking in compliance with his commands concerning approved travel orders. This tension between the General and his troops, in part, explains the caution of sentries in considering stopping the General’s car as Moss drove it through Heraklion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beutin, Dr Ludwig, Letter to W. Stanley Moss, 27 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was due to be published in Germany in 1950. Kreipe alleged that he had never given his parole not to shout or to try to   escape to Moss and Leigh Fermor as described by Moss in the book. Kreipe secured an injunction preventing publication of the book in Germany on the grounds that the statement in the book was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Oliver, ''Ill Met by Moonlight:The Post-War Cultural Narrative of the Abduction of General Kreipe in Crete, 1944'', 2018, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Leigh Fermor's report after the operation&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Fermor, Patrick, ''Short Report on Capture of General Kreipe", TNA File HS5/418
1944, p3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of his account of the abduction published in 2015 both corroborated Moss's version of events.

== Reference songs ==
Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first interval of a popular song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mayfield, Connie E. | year=2002 | title=Theory Essentials, Volume I: An Integrated Approach to Harmony, Ear Training, and Keyboard Skills | publisher=Schirmer | location=New York | isbn=0-534-57231-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=I can't find any mention of songs in connection with intervals in this book. If it's in there, please provide a page number.|date=November 2016}} Such songs are known as "reference songs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sutton|first1=Christopher|title=The Ultimate Guide to Interval Ear Training|url=http://www.easyeartraining.com/learn/ultimate-guide-to-interval-ear-training/|publisher=Easy Ear Training|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have shown that such familiar-melody associations are quite limited in scope, applicable only to the specific scale-degrees found in each melody.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Michael (1983): "Beyond Intervals: The Teaching of Tonal Hearing," ''Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy'', (6):18-34&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are various [[solmization]] systems (including [[solfeggio]], [[sargam (music)|sargam]], and [[numerical sight-singing]]) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the [[scale (music)|scale]]. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.

'''Jørgen Valentin Sonne''' (24 June 1801, [[Birkerød]] – 24 September 1890, [[Copenhagen]]) was a Danish [[Genre art|genre]] painter; known primarily for his battle scenes.

== Biography ==
His father, Jeppe (1771–1833), was a [[copperplate engraver]] for the [[Royal Mint (Denmark)|Royal Mint]]. He originally intended to pursue a military career and enrolled at the [[Royal Danish Military Academy]], but left after a year and went to the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] instead.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/J%C3%B8rgen_Sonne Brief biography] @ Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he began to work in the studios of [[Christian David Gebauer]], mostly making copies of the old [[Dutch Masters]].&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=1116 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted some original pictures and had a small showing in 1818. 
[[File:Jørgen V. Sonne - Rural Scene - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|185px|left|Rural Scene (1848)]]
In 1828, he received a travel stipend from the Academy that allowed him to visit Munich, where he became an apprentice of the history painter, [[Peter von Cornelius]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He stayed there for three years and made several trips into the mountains to do landscapes, which are not among his best works.

When he left Munich, he was able to obtain further support for studies in Rome. While there, he made numerous hunting trips as an excuse to observe the rural peasants and their daily habits. During these trips he made sketches that he would use as inspiration throughout his career.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

He returned to Denmark in 1841; producing works based on his Italian studies as well as ones depicting the Danish peasantry. In 1848, following the start of the [[First Schleswig War]], he was given permission to accompany the army to [[Southern Jutland]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; Many of the soldiers were impressed by the way he calmly sketched while bullets flew around him. During the [[Second Schleswig War]], despite being sixty-three years old, he was with the army again, at the [[Battle of Dybbøl]] and in [[Sønderborg]] when the city was under bombardment. 
[[File:Dybbol Skanse.jpg|thumb|325px|Scene from the Battle of Dybbøl]] 
In 1865, he was awarded the {{ill|Anckerske Legat|da|Det anckerske Legat}} (a scholarship for writers, artists and composers) and was able to return to Italy for a year.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; In addition to his canvases, he is known for designing a large mural on the exterior walls of the [[Thorvaldsen Museum]] and illustrations for a Danish translation of the Hindu play, ''[[Shakuntala]]''.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He was appointed [Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog]] in 1852, and received the [[Dannebrogordenens Hæderstegn]] in 1881.

During his last decade, he began having eye problems and became too weak to paint for long periods. To the end, his artistic outlook was conservative; believing that the latest trends were simply a way to hide lack of content. He never married.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

The '''Kroesos Foundation''' is an artistic collective set up by Swiss Artist, [[Mark Divo]]. Between January and  March 2002 they occupied the building in the centre of Zurich where the original European Dada movement began, as a response to the horrors of the first World War, which came to be known as the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]]. The collective organised a number of events/ performances over a period of three months until they were forced to leave the building. In spite of their eviction they managed to have the building turned into a museum. Members of the collective include [[Mark Divo]], Aiana Calugar, [[Dan Jones (artist)|Dan Jones]], [[Lennie Lee]], [[ingo giezendanner]] and Pastor [[Leumund Cult]]. Throughout the winter of 2002 they were described as neo-Dadaists by the Swiss and international press. The group have exhibited in a number of international exhibitions including the real Biennale at the Kinsky Palace in Prague

'''Leo Castelli''' (born '''Leo Krausz'''; September 4, 1907&amp;nbsp;– August 21, 1999) was an Italian-American [[art dealer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E2D61038F930A1575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Russel, John. "Leo Castelli, Influential Art Dealer, Dies at 91." New York Times, August 23, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; His gallery showcased  [[contemporary art]] for five decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/people/obit/1999/09/11/castelli/ DiEgidio, Tom. "Leo Castelli." Salon.com, September 11, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the movements which Castelli showed were [[Surrealism]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], [[Color field painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]],   [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Minimal Art]], [[Conceptual Art]], and [[Neo-expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1UEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 |first=David|last=Bourdon|publisher=Life Magazine|date=May 1970|title=Whats Up in Art, The Castelli Clan|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Leo Castelli was born Leo Krausz,&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;Dwight Garner (May 18, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/books/19book.html A Smooth Operator, at the Vanguard of the Gallery World in the 1960s] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Trieste]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the second of three children of Italian and Austro-Hungarian Jewish origin.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"&gt;[[Peter Schjeldahl]] (June 7, 2010), [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/06/07/100607crbo_books_schjeldahl Leo the Lion - How the Castelli gallery changed the art world] ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Ernest Krauss, a Hungarian by birth, who had gone to Trieste as a young man and married wealthy heiress Bianca Castelli,&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;Myrna Oliver (August 24, 1999), [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/24/news/mn-3077 Leo Castelli; Influential Dealer Promoted Careers of Artists From Johns to Warhol] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from a family of coffee importers&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Gerald Clarke (February 26, 1979), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073021,00.html Dealer Leo Castelli Sold the World on Pop Art, and Now He's Cleaning Up] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which had long been based there.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;John Russell (August 23, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/23/arts/leo-castelli-influential-art-dealer-dies-at-91.html Leo Castelli, Influential Art Dealer, Dies at 91] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, which the family spent in Vienna (where Leo Castelli learned perfect German), they returned to Trieste.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The family changed its name to "Krausz-Castelli" and then "Castelli" in the mid-1930s, when Mussolini's government required names to be Italianized.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

After earning a law degree at the [[University of Milan]] in 1924, Castelli returned to Trieste, where his father had secured a job for him with an insurance company.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; In 1932, he went to work for an insurance company in Bucharest, where he married [[Ileana Sonnabend|Ileana Schapira]] one year later. After their marriage, the couple honeymooned in Vienna and bought their first artwork, a [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] watercolor.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Castelli's father-in-law, Mihai Schapira, helped him to be transferred in 1935 to the [[Banca d'Italia]] in Paris. There, Ileana's taste and money helped him start his first gallery at [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris, which was named for its co-director, the decorator René Drouin,&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; and situated between the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz Hotel]] and the couturier [[Elsa Schiaparelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Castelli's FIRST STEPS in the art world: a "Surrealist" event in Paris in '39 – by Michèle C. Cone. [[Artnet]], July 21, 2010. http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/cone/leo-castelli-surrealist-design7-21-10.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Specializing in surrealistic art,&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; the gallery opened in July 1939, with a show of modern and antique furniture, including commissioned pieces by Drouin, [[Max Ernst]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], [[Leonor Fini]] (a former girlfriend of Castelli's from Trieste), [[Eugene Berman]], and other artists in the force field of Surrealism.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

Ileana's connections enabled the couple to flee to America at the start of World War II. Castelli's parents did not escape but died in Budapest, hounded by members of Hungary's fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon (June 11, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/books/review/Solomon-t.html Leo Castelli’s New York Story] ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple would remain married for more than 25 years, and were friends and partners even after their divorce, when Ileana married Michael Sonnabend and that couple opened its own gallery.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; Castelli arrived in the United States in 1941, by way of Marrakesh, Tangier, Algeciras, Vigo and Havana.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; He took graduate history courses in economic history&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;  at [[Columbia University]]&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; until volunteering for the Army, serving in the intelligence service in Europe. After the liberation of France, he was sent to Bucharest as an interpreter for the Allied commission that controlled the city. As a result of Castelli's military service, he was given American citizenship.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Returning to New York, Castelli took a managerial position with his father-in-law's clothing factory.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

==Leo Castelli Gallery==
In New York, the Castellis were two of only three non-artist members (the other was dealer [[Charles Egan Gallery|Charles Egan]])&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; of the Club, an influential coterie founded in 1949 that included [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Ad Reinhardt]]. Castelli's first exercise as a private dealer came through Drouin, in 1947: some hundred canvases by [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], consigned by his widow, Nina.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; His first American curatorial effort was the [[Ninth Street Show]] of 1951, a seminal event in the emergence of Abstract Expressionism. He soon attached himself to the pioneering gallerist [[Sidney Janis]], one of the early proponents of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lamster (May 23, 2010), [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/23/entertainment/la-ca-leo-castelli-20100523 Book Review: A dealer and his galaxy of art stars in 'Leo and His Circle"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, he opened the Leo Castelli Gallery in a townhouse at 4 E. 77th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues in New York City. From the mid-1960s through the 1970s, the gallery was perhaps the most prominent commercial venue for art in the world.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Daniel Grant (February 24, 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703960804576120434103905642 Leo Castelli's Cache Of Art-History Gold] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the gallery showcased European [[Surrealism]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and other European artists. However the gallery also exhibited American [[Abstract Expressionism]]. [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Norman Bluhm]] were some artists who were included in group shows.

In 1958, [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] joined the gallery, signaling a turning away from [[Abstract Expressionism]], towards [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]] and [[Conceptual Art]].[[File:Warhol Flowers, offset lithograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castelli Gallery's first [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] exhibition, ''Flowers'', November, 1964]] From the early 1960s through the late 70s, [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Lee Bontecou]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Ed Ruscha]], [[Salvatore Scarpitta]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Lawrence Weiner]] and [[Joseph Kosuth]] joined the stable of Castelli artists. He gave Johns, Stella and Lichtenstein their first one-man shows.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Castelli opened a temporary annex, the Castelli Warehouse, on West 108th Street, with a show organized by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], of environmental sculpture by nine artists, including Nauman, Serra, and [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; In 1971 Leo Castelli opened a downtown [[SoHo]] branch of the Leo Castelli Gallery at 420 West Broadway, in a building bought by the Hague Art Delivery Company and a cooperative of dealers: Castelli took the second floor; his former wife's [[Sonnabend Gallery]] the took the third floor, and [[André Emmerich]] (later replaced by [[Charles Cowles (art dealer)|Charles Cowles]]) took the top floor; while John Weber, (former director of the [[Virginia Dwan (art dealer)|Dwan Gallery]]) rented his gallery on the fourth floor. In the 1980s, Castelli opened a second larger downtown exhibition space at a 142 Greene Street also in [[SoHo]]. He later mounted joint shows with [[Mary Boone]], of [[Julian Schnabel]], in 1981, and [[David Salle]], in 1982.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

Castelli also pioneered a stipend system that was unknown in New York when he opened his gallery. He put his artists on a payroll whether or not their work sold. For this and other reasons, desertions were initially rare among his artists. When Castelli discovered Serra in 1967, for example, he offered him a guarantee of three years of monthly payments even though he did not expect to sell any of the unknown sculptor's lead-plate work in that time.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Castelli also was known for spotting new talent and insisting on European exposure for his American artists, leading to Rauschenberg in 1964 becoming the first American to win the [[Venice Biennale]]'s international grand prize in painting.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; His most important clients included [[Museum Ludwig|Peter Ludwig]] and [[Giuseppe Panza]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;

Castelli's second wife, Antoinette Fraissex du Bost,&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; opened Castelli Graphics, an art gallery devoted to the prints and photographs of Castelli Gallery and other artists.&lt;ref name="NYT87"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/obituaries/antoinette-castelli-58-dies-president-of-graphics-gallery.html Antoinette Castelli, 58, Dies; President of Graphics Gallery] ''New York Times'', September 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple also had a son together, Jean-Christophe Castelli, but Antoinette Castelli died in 1987.&lt;ref name="NYT87"/&gt; In 1995 Leo Castelli married the Italian art historian Barbara Bertozzi Castelli.

In 2015, Bertozzi Castelli opened a one-room satellite gallery at 1046 Madison Avenue, near 80th Street, with [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]]'s installation ''Lead and Felt'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Hilarie M. Sheets (September 24, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/arts/design/richard-prince-takes-a-new-approach-to-cowboys.html Changing Galleries] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Castelli received the rosette of the [[French Legion of Honor]], allegedly in exchange for donating works by Johns to the [[Centre Pompidou]].&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; The mayor of Trieste made him the honorary director of the [[Revoltella Museum]]. In 1998, the [[National Arts Club]] awarded Castelli its Centennial Medal of Honor. On this occasion, [[Dennis Hopper]] called Castelli "the godfather of the contemporary art world."&lt;ref&gt;[[Phoebe Hoban]] (March 29, 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/29/style/the-night-a-pearl-beyond-price.html A Pearl Beyond Price] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 a traveling exhibit honoring the 25th anniversary of Castelli Gallery visited the [[San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art|La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The [[Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale|Museum of Art]], Fort Lauderdale, showed "Three Decades of Exploration: Homage to Leo Castelli", an exhibit of more than 30 works by artists discovered, shown and encouraged by Castelli in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Rober Hurlburt (November 1, 1987), [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-11-01/features/8702030168_1_leo-castelli-american-art-contemporary-art Exhibition A Tribute To Noted Art Dealer] ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[Butler Institute of American Art]] presented "Leo Castelli: a tribute exhibition". In 1996, [[Gagosian Gallery]] mounted the exhibition "Leo Castelli: An Exhibition in Honor of His Gallery and Artists" in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Many artists have enshrined Castelli in their works. [[Elaine de Kooning]] and [[Richard Artschwager]] painted his portrait, Warhol made a silkscreen of him in a jacket and tie. Frank Stella named a work after him, in 1992 he posed for the French artist [[Klaus Guingand]] who immortalized his shadow, and a sculpture by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], ''Leo'', places a brain at the center of a target.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Strickland (May 12, 1991), [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/12/nyregion/leo-castelli-meets-film-maker-and-fan.html Leo Castelli Meets Film Maker and Fan] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, on the occasion of Castelli's death, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published a eulogy by [[James Rosenquist]].

In 1988, when there were no tax deductions for gifts to museums, Castelli gave one of the icons of postwar American art, Robert Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' (1955) to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 1992, amid rumors that Castelli was negotiating to sell his archives to the [[Getty Center]] in Los Angeles, his collection was said to be worth some $2 million.&lt;ref name="CAG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/arts/design/19voge.html|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Castelli Archives Going to Smithsonian|publisher=New York Times|date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Castelli's heirs – his widow, Barbara Bertozzi Castelli, and his two children, Jean-Christopher Castelli and Nina Castelli Sundell – announced the donation of the gallery's archives from 1957 through 1999 to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Archives of American Art]]. Castelli had been interviewed for the archive's oral-history project in 1969, 1973 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt;

{{History of printing}}
'''Lithography''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]]'', lithos|stone||''[[wikt:γράφειν|γράφειν]]'', graphein|to write}})&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lithography |volume=16 |pages=785–789 |first=Frederick Vincent |last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of [[printing]] originally based on the [[miscibility|immiscibility]] of oil and water.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Peter. (1964) ''The Technique of Lithography''. London: [[B.T. Batsford]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The printing is from a stone ([[lithographic limestone]]) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor [[Alois Senefelder]] as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. (1998) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carterpage11"&gt;Carter, Rob, Ben Day, Philip Meggs. Typographic Design: Form and Communication, Third Edition. (2002) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Lithography can be used to print text or [[artwork (graphic arts)|artwork]] onto paper or other suitable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lithography and Lithographers |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher |place=London |year=1915 |editor=Pennel ER |url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithography originally used an image drawn with oil, fat, or wax onto the surface of a smooth, level [[lithographic limestone]] plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and [[gum arabic]], ''[[etching]]'' the portions of the stone that were not protected by the grease-based image. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these etched areas retained water; an [[offset ink|oil-based ink]] could then be applied and would be repelled by the water, sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a blank [[paper]] sheet, producing a [[printing|printed page]]. This traditional technique is still used in some [[fine art]] printmaking applications.

In modern lithography, the image is made of a [[polymer]] coating applied to a flexible plastic or metal plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk/digital-photographic.html|title=Digital &amp; Photographic|first=James|last=Hill|website=www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image can be printed directly from the plate (the orientation of the image is reversed), or it can be [[offset printing|offset]], by transferring the image onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and publication.

As a printing technology, lithography is different from [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] (gravure), wherein a plate is either [[engraving|engraved]], [[etching|etched]], or [[mezzotint|stippled]] to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and [[woodblock printing]] or [[letterpress]] printing, wherein ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with [[offset lithography]], which has become the most common form of printing technology since the 1960s.

The related term "[[photolithography]]" refers to when photographic images are used in lithographic printing, whether these images are printed directly from a stone or from a metal plate, as in offset printing. "Photolithography" is used synonymously with "offset printing".  The technique as well as the term were introduced in Europe in the 1850s. Beginning in the 1960s, photolithography has played an important role in the fabrication and [[mass production]] of [[integrated circuit]]s  in the [[microelectronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, John. editor. ''Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography: A-I, index, Volume 1.'' Taylor &amp; Francis (2008). {{ISBN|9780415972352}}. page 865.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansuripur, Masud. ''Classical Optics and Its Applications''. Cambridge University Press (2002) {{ISBN|9780521804998}}. page 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principle of lithography==
Lithography uses simple chemical processes to create an image.  For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("[[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("[[hydrophilic]]").  Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows a flat print plate to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]], [[letterpress printing]]).

Lithography was invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1796.  In the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of [[limestone]] was used (hence the name "lithography": "lithos" (λιθος) is the ancient Greek word for stone).  After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of [[gum arabic]] in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and was repelled by the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite.

===Lithography on limestone===
[[Image:Litography negative stone and positive paper.jpg|thumb|Lithography stone and [[mirror image]] print of a map of Munich]]

Lithography works because of the mutual [[Hydrophobe|repulsion of oil and water]]. The image is drawn on the surface of the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the [[lipid]] content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous [[solution]] of [[gum arabic]], weakly acidified with nitric acid {{chem|HNO|3}} is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of [[calcium nitrate]] salt, {{chem|Ca(NO|3|)|2}}, and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the printing ink. Using lithographic [[turpentine]], the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hoen &amp; Co.|A. B. Hoen]], Discussion of the Requisite Qualities of Lithographic Limestone, with Report on Tests of the Lithographic Stone of Mitchell County, Iowa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBIMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA339&amp;pg=RA1-PA339 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1902], Des Moines, 1903; pages 339–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gascoigne|first1=Bamber|title=How to Identify Prints: a complete guide to manual and mechanical processes from woodcut to ink jet|date=1988|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=Spain|page=1c}}&lt;/ref&gt; When printing, the stone is kept wet with water. Naturally the water is attracted to the layer of gum and salt created by the acid wash. [[Printing ink]] based on drying oils such as [[linseed oil]] and varnish loaded with [[pigment]] is then rolled over the surface. The water repels the greasy ink but the hydrophobic areas left by the original drawing material accept it. When the hydrophobic image is loaded with ink, the stone and paper are run through a press that applies even pressure over the surface, transferring the ink to the paper and off the stone.

Senefelder had experimented during the early 19th century with multicolor lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by [[Godefroy Engelmann]] (France) in 1837 known as [[chromolithography]].&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge was to keep the images aligned (''[[Printing registration|in register]]''). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.

"Lithography, or printing from soft stone, largely took the place of engraving in the production of English commercial maps after about 1852. It was a quick, cheap process and had been used to print British army maps during the [[Peninsula War]]. Most of the commercial maps of the second half of the 19th century were lithographed and unattractive, though accurate enough."&lt;ref&gt;Lynam, Edward. 1944. British Maps and Map Makers. London: W. Collins. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern lithographic process===
{{main|Offset printing}}
[[Image:Gubernie zachodnie krolestwo polskie 1902.jpg|thumb|A 1902 lithograph map (original size 33×24 cm)]]

High-volume lithography is used presently to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging—just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[Offset printing|offset lithography]].

For offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used instead of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]].  A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created by direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device known as a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. Non-image portions of the emulsion have traditionally been removed by a chemical process, though in recent times plates have come available that do not require such processing.

[[Image:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich]]
[[Image:Lithography machine in Bibliotheca Alexandrina.jpg|thumb|right|Lithography machine in [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The plate is affixed to a cylinder on a printing press. Dampening rollers apply water, which covers the blank portions of the plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area. Hydrophobic ink, which is repelled by the water and only adheres to the emulsion of the image area, is then applied by the inking rollers.

If this image were transferred directly to paper, it would create a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber ''blanket'', which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or ''offset'' to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as ''offset lithography'' or ''[[offset printing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see diagram at [http://www.compassrose.com/static/Offset.jpg compassrose.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many innovations and technical refinements have been made in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of [[Printing press|presses]] with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass on both sides of the sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (''webs'') of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren, instead of the old method (conventional dampening) which is still used on older presses, using rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a "delta effect or vario," which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as "hickies".

The process of lithography printing is illustrated by [http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/library_docs/manuals/printing/images/offsetlitho.gif this simplified diagram]. This press is also called an ink pyramid because the ink is transferred through several layers of rollers with different purposes. Fast lithographic 'web' printing presses are commonly used in newspaper production.

The advent of [[desktop publishing]] made it possible for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital [[imagesetter]]s enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from digital input, skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual page layout. The development of the digital [[platesetter]] during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from digital input, a process known as [[computer to plate]] printing.

==Microlithography and nanolithography==
{{Main|Photolithography}}
Microlithography and [[nanolithography]] refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 [[micrometers]] are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 [[nanometers]] are considered nanolithographic. [[Photolithography]] is one of these methods, often applied to [[semiconductor]] manufacturing of [[integrated circuit|microchips]]. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated [[photomask]] or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.

Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example [[electron beam lithography]], are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of [[maskless lithography]], in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a [[resist]]-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.

In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and [[nanolithography|nanolithographic]] technologies exist or are being developed, including [[nanoimprint lithography]], [[interference lithography]], [[X-ray lithography]], [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]], [[magnetolithography]] and [[scanning probe lithography]]. Some of these new techniques have been used successfully for small-scale commercial and important research applications.
Surface-charge lithography, in fact [[Plasma desorption mass spectrometry]] can be directly patterned on polar dielectric crystals via pyroelectric effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grilli | first1 = S. | last2 = Vespini | first2 = V. | last3 = Ferraro | first3 = P. | year = 2008 | title = Surface-charge lithography for direct pdms micro-patterning | url = | journal = Langmuir | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 13262–13265 | doi = 10.1021/la803046j | pmid=18986187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lithography as an artistic medium==
[[File:Redon smiling-spider.jpg|thumb|left|''Smiling Spider'' by [[Odilon Redon]], 1891]]
During the first years of the 19th century, lithography had only a limited effect on [[printmaking]], mainly because technical difficulties remained to be overcome. Germany was the main center of production in this period. [[Godefroy Engelmann]], who moved his press from [[Mulhouse]] to Paris in 1816, largely succeeded in resolving the technical problems, and during the 1820s lithography was adopted by artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Géricault]]. After early experiments such as ''Specimens of Polyautography'' (1803),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=''Specimens of Polyautography, Consisting of Impressions taken from Original Drawings, Made on Stone purposely for this Work’' | date=1803|  publisher=Philipp André| location=London|  url=http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21118663020001551}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had experimental works by  a number of British artists including [[Benjamin West]], [[Henry Fuseli]],  [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], [[Thomas Barker of Bath]],  [[Thomas Stothard]],   [[Henry Richard Greville]], [[Richard Cooper Jr.|Richard Cooper]],   [[Henry Singleton (painter)|Henry Singleton]], and  [[William Henry Pyne]], London also became a center, and some of Géricault's prints were in fact produced there. [[Goya]] in Bordeaux produced his last series of prints by lithography—''The Bulls of Bordeaux'' of 1828. By the mid-century the initial enthusiasm had somewhat diminished in both countries, although the use of lithography was increasingly favored for commercial applications, which included the prints of [[Daumier]], published in newspapers. [[Rodolphe Bresdin]] and [[Jean-François Millet]] also continued to practice the medium in France, and [[Adolf Menzel]] in Germany. In 1862 the publisher Cadart tried to initiate a portfolio of lithographs by various artists, which was not successful but included several prints by [[Manet]]. The revival began during the 1870s, especially in France with artists such as [[Odilon Redon]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] and [[Degas]] producing much of their work in this manner. The need for strictly limited [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]s to maintain the price had now been realized, and the medium became more accepted.

[[File:Edvard Munch - Self-Portrait (1895) G0192-59 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self Portrait with Skeleton Arm'' by [[Edvard Munch]]]]
In the 1890s, color lithography gained success in part by the emergence of [[Jules Chéret]], known as the ''father of the modern poster'', whose work went on to inspire a new generation of poster designers and painters, most notably [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and former student of Chéret, [[Georges de Feure]]. By 1900 the medium in both color and monotone was an accepted part of printmaking.

During the 20th century, a group of artists, including [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Chagall]], [[Dufy]], [[Léger]], [[Matisse]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], and [[Picasso]], rediscovered the largely undeveloped artform of lithography thanks to the [[Mourlot Studios]], also known as ''Atelier Mourlot'', a Parisian printshop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family. The Atelier Mourlot originally specialized in the printing of wallpaper; but it was transformed when the founder's grandson, [[Fernand Mourlot]], invited a number of 20th-century artists to explore the complexities of fine art printing. Mourlot encouraged the painters to work directly on lithographic stones in order to create original artworks that could then be executed under the direction of master printers in small editions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/36544351/PICASSO_LITHOGRAPHER_AND_ACTIVIST|title=Picasso lithographer and activist|last=Orozco|first=Miguel|publisher=Academia.edu|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The combination of modern artist and master printer resulted in lithographs that were used as posters to promote the artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot History of 20th century lithography by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Braque, Leger at Atelier Mourlot, French Institute Alliance Française] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723085822/http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot |date=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mourlot, Fernand. ''Twentieth Century Posters.'' Wellfleet Press: Secaucus, New Jersey, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Wood]], [[George Bellows]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Max Kahn]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Eleanor Coen]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[David Hockney]], [[Susan Dorothea White]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] are a few of the artists who have produced most of their prints in the medium. [[M. C. Escher]] is considered a master of lithography, and many of his prints were created using this process. More than other printmaking techniques, [[printmaker]]s in lithography still largely depend on access to good [[Printer (publishing)|printer]]s, and the development of the medium has been greatly influenced by when and where these have been established.
{{Further|List of printmakers}}
As a special form of lithography, the serilith process is sometimes used. Seriliths are mixed media original prints created in a process in which an artist uses the [[lithograph]] and [[serigraph]] processes. The separations for both processes are hand-drawn by the artist. The serilith technique is used primarily to create fine art limited print editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrysideart.com/serigraphy.htm|title=What is a Serilith?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luminous Interactive''' digital art platform was the brainchild of [[Lend Lease Group]] in collaboration with [http://ramus.com.au/portfolios/luminous-darling-quarter/ Ramus Illumination], and is billed, according to the [[Wall Street Journal]], as 'the world's biggest interactive permanent light display'. It was officially opened in the Darling Quarter Precinct in [[Sydney Central Business District]] (CBD) on 18 May 2012. 

Luminous at Darling Quarter is a permanent platform solely for illuminated digital 'art' – both animated and static. The 'canvas' extends over four levels of two campus-style buildings, covering 557 windows in total, and presents a digital façade spanning a distance of 150&amp;nbsp;metres. The artistic and design direction was set by international light artist [https://darlingquarter.com/play/luminous/ Bruce Ramus,] with Ramus studio responsible for design management and production of the work. Fixtures were manufactured by Australian architectural lighting specialists Klik Systems using advanced [[LED]] systems.

==Interactive==
[[File:LuminousDarlingQuarter17.jpg|thumb|upright|Interactive technology by iion, in collaboration with Ramus Illumination, activates the canvas and gives Luminous a social/web presence]]

Interactive content is available from 6pm, Friday through Sunday, with touch screen kiosks in [[Tumbalong Park]] allowing the general public to paint their own digital designs and play over-scaled arcade games on the buildings in front of them. Web surfers can also play using their smart phone or contribute on their computer through a dedicated website. The online component of Luminous has similarities to [[Project Blinkenlights]], a Berlin digital light installation, but expands the concept for the general public, allowing user-friendly interaction in an unprecedented way.

==Luminous concept==

The [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] occupying the buildings is joint partner in the project along with the [[Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority]] and [[Lend Lease]]. The consortium selected Bruce Ramus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ramus.com.au/profile/|title=Profile - Ramus|work=Ramus|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the first artist, Artistic Director and Lighting Designer for Luminous. Canadian-born Ramus made his name lighting stage shows for [[U2]] and [[David Bowie]], and is design mentor for [[Sydney Opera House]].

==Technology==

At Darling Quarter, each window forms a 'pixel' in the canvas, lit with Klik Systems's energy efficient LEDs, and seen from a distance can form a coherent animated picture. A sophisticated colour palette is available thanks to white LEDs added to the standard RGB (red, green, blue) colours. The system is also capable of integrating music: graphic synchronization allows for sound-based designs to be visualized on the canvas.

Contrary to many light installations, direct light is minimized to viewers, instead using the automated timber louvers to reflect light from Klik System's linear LEDs (running along the windowsills, angled upwards with a 10-degree spreader lens). The entire project offsets almost all its energy use, thanks to photo-voltaic panels on the roof of both Darling Quarter buildings. The project allegedly uses the same power as 5 household vacuum cleaners.

==Darling Quarter==

Lend Lease designed and constructed Darling Quarter for owner APPF Commercial and first proposed the idea of a permanent space for illuminated art. Darling Quarter precinct includes a community green, children’s playground, and a large number of world-food restaurants, cafes and bars, and reflects Lend Lease’s enthusiasm for iconic new spaces for future generations.

The digital façade is in action six evenings a week. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, displaying ‘soft’ images (such as clouds or waves). On Friday, Saturday and Sunday 'Luminous' displays interactive artworks that aim to invite debate and make art critics – and artists - of every citizen and visitor. 

Sydney has a growing reputation for light shows, particularly due to the annual VIVID Sydney festival and the SPARC DESIGN lighting conferences at the Museum of Modern Art, which are regularly sponsored by Klik Systems and other long term supporters in the Australian lighting industry. Vivid Sydney was inaugurated in 2008, curated in 2010 by [[Laurie Anderson]] and [[Lou Reed]] and is billed as an international [[carbon-neutral]] festival of Light, Music and Ideas. The 2012 musical line-up includes [[Sufjan Stevens]] and [[Florence &amp; The Machine]].

'''''Mr. Bellamy''''' is a 1961 [[pop art]] painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]  in his [[comic book]] style of using [[Ben-Day dots]] and a [[text balloon]]. The work is regarded as one of the better examples of Lichtenstein's sense of humor. The work is held in the collection at the [[Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/coll1.htm|title=Lichtensteins in Museums|accessdate=June 22, 2013|publisher=LichtensteinFoundation.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606073129/http://lichtensteinfoundation.org/coll1.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1961, Lichtenstein had developed the technique of emulating the mechanized production techniques, while simultaneously depicting the subjects of pop culture. This extended his pop art to a second dimension. He did so by developing a technique that took [[Ben-Day dots]] from small comic book panels and magazine pages to the grand scale of his oversized paintings.&lt;ref name=S87/&gt;

==Critical response==
The work represents Lichtenstein's "gentle, professorial humor" and his penchant for "corny themes, colors, and postures."&lt;ref name=PAACH/&gt; Apart from enlarging its size, Lichtenstein presented a "mere copy, lacking artistic originality and creativity" in this work.&lt;ref name=MB/&gt; This subject matter sourced from comic books was regarded as "the lowest commercial and intellectual kind" because of public sentiment on the heels of 1950s [[United States Senate]] investigations of connections between comics and juvenile delinquency.&lt;ref name=MB/&gt;

[[File:1907. Мэнь-Шени (дух-хранительводы).jpg|thumb|New Year picture. Unknown. 1900.]]

A '''New Year picture''' (Chinese: [[wikt:年|年]][[wikt:画|画]]) (Pinyin: Nían Hùa; literally "Year Picture") is a popular [[Banhua]] in China. It is a form of Chinese colored [[woodblock printing|woodblock print]], for decoration during the [[Chinese New Year]] Holiday, then later used to depict current events.

== Background ==
Its original form was a picture of a [[door god]] fashioned during the [[Tang dynasty]]. Later, more subjects, such as fairs, the [[Kitchen God]], women and babies were included. Customarily, as each [[Chinese New Year]] arrives, every family replaces its New Year picture in order to "say goodbye to the Past and welcome the Future" (Chinese: [[wikt:辞|辞]][[wikt:旧|旧]][[wikt:迎|迎]][[wikt:新|新]]).

In the 19th century Nianhua were mass-produced and displayed for those who could not read. They often depicted the Chinese point of view of events.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fathom.com/feature/122228/ |title=The Boxer Rebellion, 1900: A Selection of Books, Prints and Photographs |last=Wood |first=Frances |publisher=British Library |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109132215/http://www.fathom.com/feature/122228/ |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenes sometimes were used to create patriotic sentiment. Many Nianhua were produced during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] depicting the Muslim Kansu Brave forces of General [[Dong Fuxiang]], showing them as victorious over the [[Eight Nation Alliance]] of the western powers and Japan.&lt;ref name="elliot2002"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=doing+fuxiang+russian#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Some did it for civilisation, some did it for their country: a revised view of the boxer war |author=Jane E. Elliott |year=2002 |publisher=Chinese University Press |page=204 |isbn=962-996-066-4 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous production places for New Year Pictures in China are [[Sichuan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2004-01/16/content_1279748_1.htm |title=中国年画 |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tianjin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2004-01/16/content_1279748_3.htm |title=中国年画 |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shandong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2004-01/16/content_1279748_4.htm |title=中国年画 |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Suzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2004-01/16/content_1279748_2.htm |title=中国年画 |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the best four, [[Yangliuqing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinapage.com/newyr.html |title=Chinese New Year Graphics |publisher=Chinapage.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131034040/http://www.chinapage.com/newyr.html |archivedate=2013-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from Tianjin was regarded as the greatest. Yanliuqing’s paintings were first produced between 1573 and 1620.

The New Year Pictures in Sichuan were mostly come from Mianzhu. Mianzhu’s New Year Pictures are different from other places’. The particular rules require symmetry, completeness, equilibrium, clarity and a moral meaning. It originates from earlier Song Dynasty and booming in late Ming and early Qing Dynasty. In its prosperous time, there were more than 300 workshops in Mianzhu. In addition, the production were transported and sold not only in different parts of China, but also sold to India, Japan and other countries.{{Original research inline|date=November 2010}}

As times changed, people, especially those in cities, were influenced by modern arts to see New Year Pictures as traditional and staid. Moreover, people considered the door god was too menacing to hang in their homes. They wanted something more artistic. At the middle of the 1980s, the sales amount of New Year Pictures in Mianzhu was around five hundred thousand. However, the number dropped sharply since the early 1990s.{{Original research inline|date=November 2010}}

==Production method==

Half-drawing and half-painting, lithography, offset printing and so on.

Usually, Chromatic woodblock New Year pictures have four steps:

[[File:Pastiche.jpg|thumb|A pastiche combining elements of two paintings ([[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 005.jpg|original 1]] and [[:File:Sandro Botticelli 068.jpg|original 2]]), using [[Photoshop]]]]

A '''pastiche''' is a work of [[visual art]], literature, theatre, or music that [[Imitation|imitates]] the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJVlZjIe5o8C&amp;pg=PA1005 |page=1005 |isbn=0-691-15491-0 |editor=Roland Greene |editor2=Stephen Cushman |editor3=Clare Cavanagh |editor4=Jahan Ramazani |editor5=Paul F. Rouzer |editor6=Harris Feinsod |editor7=David Marno |editor8=Alexandra Slessarev |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[parody]], pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoestery |first=Ingeborg |title=Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfpcjdU5fD8C |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-33880-8 |oclc=44812124 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''pastiche'' is a French [[cognate]] of the Italian noun ''[[wikt:pasticcio|pasticcio]]'', which is a [[pâté]] or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pastiche|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, ''pastiche'' and ''[[pasticcio]]'' describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work. Pastiche is an example of [[eclecticism in art]].

[[Allusion]] is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Moreover, allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=1-4130-3390-3 |last1=Abrams |first1=Meyer Howard |last2=Harpham |first2=Geoffrey |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of [[intertextuality]].

For example, many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]], originally penned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], have been written as pastiches since the author's time.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=8047|title= Pastiche Nuts|last= Lopresti|first= Rob|date= 2009-08-12|work= Tune It Or Die!|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=125|title= When Good Characters Go Bad|last= Lundin|first= Leigh|date= 2007-07-15|work= ADD Detective|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellery Queen]] and [[Nero Wolfe]] are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=3561|title= The Pastiche|last= Andrews|first= Dale|date= 2008-10-28|work= Mystery Masterclass|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themysteryplace.com/forum/messages.aspx?TopicID=241|title= Pastiche vs. fan fiction.

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the [[Robert E. Howard]] stories, written by other writers without Howard's authorization. This includes the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]].
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a pastiche of works by [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. In 1991 [[Alexandra Ripley]] wrote the novel ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', a pastiche of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] sequel. 

In 2017, John Banville published Mrs. Osmond, a sequel to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, written in a style similar to that of James.

===Music===

[[Charles Rosen]] has characterized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] various works in imitation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] style as pastiche, and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s works, such as his ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' and [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky) | ''Serenade for Strings'']], employ a poised "classical" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite).&lt;ref name="brown_ng18628"&gt;* Brown, David, "Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich." In ''The New Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (London: MacMillan, 1980), 20 vols., ed. Sadie, Stanley. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. 18:628&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of [[George Rochberg]], who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from [[serialism]] after the death of his son in 1963.

"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all "hodge-podged" together to create one piece of music.&lt;ref name="An Invitation to the Opera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|title= AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA|last= Baker|first= Roy Thomas|date= October 1995|publisher= Sound on Sound|accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar earlier example is "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]]. One can find musical "pastiches" throughout the work of the American composer [[Frank Zappa]].

A ''pastiche Mass'' is a musical [[Mass (music)|Mass]] where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by [[early music | early-music]] ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; for example, the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' by [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===

In musical theatre pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical ''[[Follies]]'', a show about a reunion of performers from a musical [[revue]] set between the World Wars, [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[George Gershwin]] but also the lyrics of writers such as [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Otto Harbach]], and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song "[[Losing My Mind]]" sung in the show contains "near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies" from the Gershwins' [[The Man I Love (song)|"The Man I Love"]] and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies" Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including [[Gypsy (musical) | ''Gypsy'']], [[Saturday Night (musical) | ''Saturday Night'']], and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies", Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Pastiche can also be a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] device whereby filmmakers pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to another filmmaker's style and use of [[cinematography]], including camera angles, [[lighting]], and [[mise en scène]]. A film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and [[documentaries]] but can be found in [[non-fiction]] [[drama]], [[comedy]] and [[Horror film|horror]] films as well). Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]`s [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] is a pastiche of earlier American [[Westerns]]. Another major filmmaker, [[Quentin Tarantino]], often uses various plots, characteristics and themes from many lesser-known films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that "I steal from every single movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/markets-festivals/quentin-tarantino-the-great-recycler-1200703098/|title=Quentin Tarantino: The Great Recycler|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=7 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Todd Haynes]]' 2002 film [[Far From Heaven]] was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical [[Douglas Sirk]] melodrama - in particular [[All That Heaven Allows]]. The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama.

In cinema, the influence of [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film ''[[Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn]]'') can be regarded as a function of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="Jameson, 1991"&gt;(Jameson, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sandoval, Chela. Methodology of the Oppressed. Minneapolis,MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
In discussions of [[urban planning]], the term "pastiche" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major [[architects]]: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many post-war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as [[Le Corbusier]] or [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The term itself is not pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;Jamses Stevens Curl, "Oxford Dictionary of Architecture", 2006, p562.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Alain de Botton]] describes pastiche as "an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Channel 4]]|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-perfect-home/episode-guide|title= Alain de Botton: The Perfect Home}}

'''''Salutat''''' is an 1898 painting by [[Thomas Eakins]] (1844–1916). Based on a real-life boxing match that occurred in 1898, the work depicts a boxer waving to the crowd after the match. According to Eakins' biographer [[Lloyd Goodrich]], ''Salutat'' is "one of Eakins' finest achievements in figure-painting."&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, pp. 151-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's title is [[Latin]] for "He greets" or "He salutes."

==Background==
Much as he had with his paintings of rowers in the 1870s, during the late 1890s Eakins turned his interest again to the male nude, this time depicting prizefighters. Eakins attended fights in 1898, and aided by sportswriters Clarence Cranmer and Henry Walter Schlichter, met with and hired fighters to pose for him.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, pp. 144-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Turkey Point Billy Smith.jpeg|left|thumbnail|A postcard of Billy Smith, circa 1900]]
The studio became a place to spar; according to Eakins's protégé the sculptor [[Samuel Murray]], (who in 1899 made a bronze statue of Billy Smith)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsantiques101.com/MurrayBSmith/001_big.jpg Samuel Murray's 1899 statue of ''Turkey Point Billy Smith,''] retrieved March 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; one of the fighters, Ellwood McCloskey, would "round up fellow pugilists who had promised to pose but didn't show up":&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hey, you son of a bitch, haven't you got a date to pose for Mr. Eakins? Come on now, or I'll punch your goddamn head off."&lt;ref name="Goodrich145"&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

"Turkey Point" Billy Smith, a featherweight who competed in over 100 bouts over the course of ten years and fought two featherweight champions, was the protagonist for ''Salutat'' as well as for ''[[Between Rounds]]''.&lt;ref name="Goodrich145"/&gt;





&lt;!--deliberate extra space because of images - please retain--&gt;
==Studies==
Eakins made multiple studies of the subject. A pencil-on-paper study was purchased by [[Joseph Hirshhorn]] in 1965 and donated to [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|his eponymous museum]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604201930/http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;subkey=6357 Thomas Eakins - Study for "Salutat".] Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Retrieved March 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eakins also completed an oil-on-canvas study, which he gave to art critic [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] after Hartmann praised Eakins in his 1901 book ''A History of American Art''. (This was the first time Eakins had been recognized as being of historic importance.)&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 358&lt;/ref&gt; This study is now in the possession of the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!229849!0 Study for "Salutat", (painting).] Art Inventories Catalog, Smithsonian American Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmoa.org/searchcollections/details.aspx?item=1021940 Thomas Eakins: Study for Salutat]. Carnegie Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''Salutat'', ''Between Rounds'' (a portion of which was executed separately as ''[[Billy Smith (painting)|Billy Smith]]'') and ''[[Taking the Count]]'' are a series of three large boxing paintings done by Eakins. The former two depict events surrounding a boxing match that took place on April 22, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wichitaartmuseum.org/acm/detail.php?action=v&amp;id=1237583225304978 Billy Smith, 1898]. Wichita Art Museum&lt;/ref&gt; [[Featherweight]] Tim Callahan fought featherweight Billy Smith in a match that was close until the final round, when Callahan gained the advantage and won the fight. However, for ''Salutat'', Eakins chose to depict Smith as the winner.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, 444&lt;/ref&gt; In the work, Smith raises his hand to salute the audience, in the style of a [[Gladiator]]. On the painting's original frame Eakins carved the words "DEXTRA VICTRICE CONCLAMANTES SALVTAT" (With the victorious right hand, he salutes those shouting [their approval]).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As with a number of other Eakins works, the rendering of the figures is extremely precise, such that it has allowed art historians to identify individual members of the audience. While working on the boxing pictures, friends would visit the studio, and Eakins invited them to "stay a while and I'll put you in the picture."&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Salutat'', audience members include Eakins's friend Louis Kenton (wearing eyeglasses and a bow tie), sportswriter Clarence Cranmer (wearing a bowler hat), David Jordan (brother of Letitia Wilson Jordan, whom Eakins painted in ''[[Portrait of Letitia Wilson Jordan]]''), photographer Louis Husson (next to Jordan), Eakins's student [[Samuel Murray]], and Eakins's father Benjamin Eakins.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, 444-445&lt;/ref&gt; 

Smith is bathed in soft white light, which illuminates his muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger 350, footnote 8&lt;/ref&gt; Amid a general tonality of warm grays and browns that contains no strong chromatic notes, the skin tones of the three main figures are pale.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; All three men have the quality of relief sculpture, and with Smith's figure separate from those of his seconds, they appear to move across the canvas in an arrangement reminiscent of a [[frieze]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and provenance==
Eakins sent the painting to the Annual of the [[Pennsylvania Academy]] in January 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, Darrel; et al. ''Thomas Eakins'' ''The 1890s'' Marc Simpson, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; and although it "failed to please the few critics who noticed it", he exhibited the picture a total of four times in the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting remained unsold during Eakins's lifetime, and was bought from his widow by [[Thomas Cochran (banker)|Thomas Cochran]] in 1929; he subsequently donated the picture to the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]] at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Volume II, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">[[File:Olofsborg från sjösidan.JPG|thumb|420px|St. Olaf's Castle, the venue for the Opera Festival in Savonlinna.]] 
'''Savonlinna Opera Festival''' ({{lang-fi|Savonlinnan oopperajuhlat}}) is held annually in the city of [[Savonlinna]] in [[Finland]]. The Festival takes place at the medieval [[Olavinlinna]] (St. Olaf's Castle), built in 1475. The [[castle]] is located amid spectacular lake scenery.

== Origin ==
The birth of the Savonlinna Opera Festival ties in closely with the emerging [[Finland|Finnish]] identity and striving for independence at the beginning of the 20th century. Attending a nationalist meeting in [[Olavinlinna]] Castle in 1907, the Finnish soprano [[Aino Ackté]], already famous at opera houses the world over and an ardent patriot, immediately spotted the potential of the [[castle]] as the venue for an [[opera]] festival.

The first opera festival was held in 1912.&lt;ref name="Symington2009"&gt;{{cite book

|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aino Ackté]] directed the festival for five summers, staging four [[Finland|Finnish]] [[opera]]s. The only [[opera]] by a non-Finnish composer was [[Charles Gounod]]’s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', with Ackté herself in the leading female role of Marguerite.

In 1917 the festival ran into difficulties because of [[First World War]], [[History of Finland|Finnish Declaration of Independence]] and the ensuing [[Finnish Civil War]].

For fifty years, the [[opera]] festival was dormant, but in 1967,  Savonlinna Music Days decided to organise an opera course for young singers. The high point of the course was a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' in the castle. Therefore, 1967 is nowadays regarded as the start of the present Festival; since then it has had steady growth of both audience and reputation.

== Present-day festival ==
[[File:Scenen på borggården, Olofsborg.JPG|thumb|275px|The stage at the courtyard of St. Olaf's Castle.]]
The Savonlinna Opera Festival has grown into an internationally recognised festival lasting a month. Each year it performs to a total audience of around 60,000, an estimated quarter of whom come from abroad. Each year the Festival has, in addition to staging leading works from classical operatic repertoire, staged its own productions.

=== Premieres ===
Six operas have been premiered at the Savonlinna Opera Festival since 1967: ''[[The Horseman (opera)|The Horseman]]'' (1975), ''[[The King Goes Forth to France]]'' (1984, commissioned jointly by [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] and the BBC), and ''[[Palatsi (opera)|The Palace]]'' (1995) by [[Aulis Sallinen]], ''[[The Knife (opera)|The Knife]]'' (1989) by [[Paavo Heininen]], ''[[Aleksis Kivi (opera)|Aleksis Kivi]]'' (1997) by [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] and ''[[The Age of Dreams]]'' (2000–2001) by Herman Rechberger [http://sonopt.pp.fi], [[Olli Kortekangas]] and [[Kalevi Aho]].

=== Visits by foreign opera companies ===
For over a decade, the Savonlinna Opera Festival has hosted foreign opera companies: The first of these was the [[Estonia Theatre]] from [[Tallinn]]. This was followed for the next three seasons by the world-famous [[Mariinsky Theatre|Mariinsky (Kirov) Theatre]] from [[St. Petersburg]], by [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] from [[London]] in 1998, the [[Opéra national du Rhin]] from [[Strasbourg]] in 1999, the [[New Israeli Opera]] in 2000, [[Los Angeles Opera]] in 2001, the [[Deutsche Oper am Rhein]] in 2002, and the Choir and Orchestra of the [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago]] in 2003, with a staging of [[Sergio Ortega]]'s ''Fulgor y Muerte de Joaquín Murieta'', after a libretto by [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Pablo Neruda]].

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
'''Spirit of place''' (or soul) refers to the unique, distinctive and cherished aspects of a place; often those celebrated by artists and writers, but also those cherished in [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[festival]]s and celebrations. It is thus as much in the invisible weave of culture ([[folklore|stories]], art, memories, beliefs, histories, etc.) as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place ([[monument]]s, boundaries, [[river]]s, [[woodland|woods]], architectural style, [[rural crafts]] styles, pathways, [[Vista (landscaping)|views]], and so on) or its [[interpersonal]] aspects (the presence of [[Kinship|relatives]], [[friendship|friends]] and kindred spirits, and the like).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Often the term is applied to a rural or a relatively unspoiled or regenerated place &amp;mdash; whereas the very similar term [[sense of place]] would tend to be more domestic, [[urbanist|urban]], or [[suburban]] in tone. For instance, one could logically apply 'sense of place' to an urban high street; noting the [[architecture]], the width of the [[road]]s and [[Sidewalk|pavement]]s, the [[plants|plantings]], the style of the [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]]-fronts, the [[street furniture]], and so on, but one could not really talk about the 'spirit of place' of such an essentially urban and commercial environment. However, an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep meaning in [[children's street culture]].{{or|date=December 2016}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] term for spirit of place was [[Genius loci]], by which it is sometimes still referred. This has often been historically envisaged as a guardian [[animal]] or a small supernatural being ([[puck (mythology)|puck]], [[fairy]], [[elf]], and the like) or a [[ghost]]. In the developed world these beliefs have been, for the most part, discarded. A new layer of less-embodied superstition on the subject, however, has arisen around [[ley lines]], [[feng shui]] and similar concepts, on the one hand, and urban leftover spaces, such as back alleys or gaps between buildings in some North-American downtown areas, on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akkerman and A.F. Cornfeld (2010) "Greening as an urban design metaphor: Looking for the city's soul in leftover spaces," The ''[https://www.usask.ca/structurist/ Structurist]'' 49/50: 30-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The western cultural movements of [[Romanticism]] and [[Neo-romanticism]] are often deeply concerned with creating cultural forms that 're-enchant the land', in order to establish or re-establish a spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;T. Graves and L. Poraj-Wilezynska (2009) "'Spirit of place' as process: Archaeography, dowsing and perceptual mapping at Belas Knap," ''[http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx Time and Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123161318/http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx |date=2010-11-23 }}'' 2: 167-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[earth art]] (sometimes called environment art) artists such as [[Andy Goldsworthy]] have explored the contribution of natural/ephemeral sculpture to spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;B. E. Bannon (2011) "Re-envisioning nature: The role of aesthetics in environmental ethics," ''[http://www.cep.unt.edu/enethics.html Environmental Ethics]'' 33(4): 415-436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, R. (2008) Andy Goldsworthy: Nature's collaborator, art's alchemist," ''[http://www.queensu.ca/quarterly/ Queen's Quarterly]'' 114(4): 597-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many indigenous and tribal cultures around the world are deeply concerned with spirits of place in their [[landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;Opp, J. (2011) "Public history and the fragments of place: Archaeology, history and heritage site development in southern Alberta," ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rrhi20/current Rethinking History]'' 15: 241-267&lt;/ref&gt; Spirits of place are explicitly recognized by some of the world's main religions: [[Shinto]] has its [[Kami]] which may incorporate spirits of place; Christianity has spirits of place in the Angelic Choirs of [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Dominions|Dominions]] and [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Principalities|Principalities]], [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] and [[Bonpo]] traditions.

==Spirit of Place Symposia==

Between 1988 and 1993, five annual Spirit of Place Symposiums were produced by environmental psychologist James Swan and Roberta Swan, in the United States and Japan. The programs sought to explore the relationship between ancient wisdom about the importance of a sense or spirit of a place, and modern science and design. The programs—held in Davis, CA; Grace Cathedral, San Francisco' Mesa Verde National Park; Tenri, Japan; and San Rafael, CA—featured over 350 speakers, including scientists, designers, and representatives of natives cultures. They also included concerts by Paul Horn, Anna Halprin, [[Steven Halpern]], and R. Carlos Nakai. The five programs attracted an audience of 10,000, and featured on national TV in the United States and Japan. The 1992 symposium held in Tenri, Japan, was the largest environmental conference in Japan that year. Representatives of 20 different American Indian tribes, Ainu, Inuit, Aborigine, and African traditional cultures were speakers in the series. Two anthologies edited by James and Roberta Swan, ''The Power of Place'' (Quest, 1991) and ''Dialogues with the Living Earth'' (Quest, 1996) present a selection of presentations at the Spirit of Place Symposiums.

'''''Terror Illustrated''''' was a black-and-white [[magazine]] published by [[EC Comics]] in late 1955 and early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated blocks of text with several illustrations per page.

The first issue appeared with a cover date of November–December 1955, but the second issue was the last. A third issue existed but was not printed by EC. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and the line was cancelled when EC's distributor went bankrupt.

''Terror Illustrated'' was edited by [[Al Feldstein]]. As with EC's comics, Feldstein was the most prolific writer of the title, and generally wrote up to three stories per issue. In addition to the stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonyms Maxwell Williams and [[Alfred E. Neuman]]. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by publisher [[William Gaines]]. This included "The Basket" and "The Gorilla's Paw" in the first issue and "Horror in the Freak Tent" and "Reflection of Death" in #2. Other contributing writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had worked as a writer on EC's earlier publications) and John Larner.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Russ. ''Complete EC Library: Terror Illustrated''. Gemstone, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Featured illustrators included [[Reed Crandall]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Graham Ingels]], [[Johnny Craig]], [[Charles Sultan]] and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]].

In 2006 ''Terror Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines by publisher Russ Cochran (with [[Gemstone Publishing]]) in hardbound volumes as the final part of his ''Complete EC Library''. The reprint volume included the previously unpublished third issue of ''Terror Illustrated''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5543">'''The Active Eye''' was a 1975 exhibition of work by contemporary [[New Zealand]] photographers, originated by the Manawatu Art Gallery in Palmerston North and touring to other galleries around New Zealand.&lt;ref name='Ireland'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ireland|first1=Peter|title=Photography - New directions, 1970s to 2000s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ephemera/43223/the-active-eye-exhibition-manawatu-art-gallery-1975|website=Te Ara|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was one of the first to focus on contemporary photography in New Zealand, and attracted considerable controversy around the works included by artist Fiona Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Peter|title=Incandescent Moment: Fiona Clark's Go Girl|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 2003|issue=106|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issue106/Clark.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exhibition==

The exhibition was a collaboration between photography organisation PhotoForum and the Manawatu Art Gallery under the director at the time, [[Luit Bieringa]], and based on photos selected by Tom Hutchins, John B. Turner and Gordon H. Brown.&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blackman|first1=Gary|title=Looking Directly at the Camera|url=http://www.landfallreview.com/looking-directly-at-the-camera/|website=Landfall Review Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by the [[Creative New Zealand | Queens Elizabeth II Arts Council]] and Kodak New Zealand.&lt;ref name ='CAG'&gt;{{cite web|title=The Active Eye|url=http://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/exhibitions/contemporary-new-zealand-photography|website=Christchurch Art Gallery|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The exhibition consisted of 104 works: among the many photographers represented in the exhibition were [[Ans Westra]], [[Peter Peryer]], Murray Hedwig, Glenn Busch and [[Fiona Clark (photographer)|Fiona Clark]].&lt;ref name ='CAG'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='OTN'&gt;{{cite web|title=Rinse and Repeat|url=http://overthenet.blogspot.co.nz/2014/08/rinse-and-repeat.html|website=Over the net|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Fowler. The exhibition was scheduled to show in 12 New Zealand art galleries.&lt;ref name ='OTN'/&gt;

==Censorship controversy==

Two works by photographer Fiona Clark included in the exhibition raised objections from members of the public and were later removed from the exhibition.&lt;ref name ='Wells'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Peter|title=Incandescent Moment Fiona Clark's Go Girl|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 2003|volume=106|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issue106/Clark.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two black and white images were from a series of ten images, taken by Clark at a dance party at the [[University of Auckland]] café for Pride Week in 1974.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Active Eye|url=http://www.fionaclark.com/gallery/the-active-eye.html|website=Fiona Clark|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs depict transgender women, and the white paper around the images were inscribed with short texts by a friend of Clark's, including phrases such as 'Aren’t you furious you hung up closet queens' and 'How many of you boys would like to suck these tits?'.&lt;ref name="Hurrell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurrell|first1=John|title=Fiona Clark at Artspace|url=http://eyecontactsite.com/2016/03/fiona-clark-at-artspace|website=EyeContact|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following complaints, the works were reviewed by police and not deemed indecent; however, a number of galleries including the [[Sarjeant Gallery]], the [[Christchurch Art Gallery|Robert McDougall Art Annex]], and the [[Govett-Brewster Art Gallery]] bowed to pressure from the public and local councillors and withdrew the works from display (in some cases, the works could be viewed in staff offices).&lt;ref name ='Hurrell'/&gt; The  [[Auckland Art Gallery]] cancelled the exhibition as a result of the controversy.&lt;ref name ='Hurrell'/&gt;

==Impact and legacy==

''The Active Eye'' marked an important point in photography's acceptance as a contemporary art form in New Zealand.&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt; In the mid 1970s few New Zealand public art galleries collected or showed contemporary photography.&lt;ref name = 'Hewson'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hewson|first1=Paul|title=Snaps Gallery and the exhibiting of photographs|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Winter 1979|issue=12|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues11to20/snaps.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Active Eye'', as the first national survey of contemporary photography, is viewed as a turning point in the art form's position in New Zealand art history and art discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutchins|first1=Tom|title=Three New Zealand Photographers: Fiona Clark, Laurence Aberhart, Peter Peryer|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Winter 1979|volume=14|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues11to20/exhibitions14akth.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works shown in ''The Active Eye'' were acquired by the Manawatu Art Gallery (now [[Te Manawa]]) as the basis of their contemporary photography collection.&lt;ref name = 'Hewson'/&gt; A selection were displayed in 2012 in the exhibition ''Now and Then''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lacy|first1=Judith|title=Images show artist behind camera|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/your-manawatu/tribune/6844847/Images-show-artist-behind-camera|website=Manawatu Standard|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Blind Girl''''' (1856) is a [[painting]] by [[John Everett Millais]] which depicts two itinerant beggars, presumed to be sisters, one of whom is a blind musician, her [[concertina]] on her lap. They are resting by the roadside after a rainstorm, before travelling to the town of [[Winchelsea]], visible in the background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/millais/paintings/akim3.html The Victorian Web: Combining Details and Mood in The Blind Girl.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has been interpreted as an [[allegory]] of the senses, contrasting the experiences of the blind and sighted sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M. (1987), ''Engaging English art: Entering the Work in Two Centuries of English Painting and Poetry'', Alabama: University of Alabama Press&lt;/ref&gt; The former feels the warmth of the sun on her face, and fondles a blade of grass, while the latter shields her eyes from the sun or rain and looks at the unusual spectacle of a [[double rainbow]] that has just appeared. Some critics have interpreted the rainbow in Biblical terms, as the sign of God's [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:16.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, K. (2000), The Victorians and the Visual Imagination, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the painting was first exhibited in 1856 it was pointed out to Millais that in double rainbows the inner rainbow inverts the order of the colours. Millais had originally painted the colours in the same order in both rainbows. He altered it for scientific accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bright Earth: Art and the invention of color|first=Philip|last=Ball|authorlink=Philip Ball|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-226-03628-1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Small Tortoiseshell|tortoiseshell butterfly]] rests on the blind girl's shawl, implying that she is holding herself extremely still. The sheet around her neck is captioned "Pity the Blind".

[[File:Viktor Vasnetsov Signature 1886.png|thumb|260px|Signature by Viktor Vasnetsov. 1886]]
'''Viktor Mikhaylovich Vasnetsov''' ({{lang-ru|Ви́ктор Миха́йлович Васнецо́в}}; May 15 ([[New Style|N.S.]]), 1848 – July 23, 1926) was a [[Russia]]n [[artist]] who specialized in [[mythology|mythological]] and [[history|historical]] subjects. He is considered the co-founder of Russian folklorist and [[romantic nationalism|romantic nationalistic]] painting&lt;ref name="krugosvet"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date = 
| url = http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/izobrazitelnoe_iskusstvo/VASNETSOV_VIKTOR_MIHALOVICH.html| title = Васнецов, Виктор Михайлович | publisher = www.krugosvet.ru|accessdate    = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[neo-romanticism]]), and a key figure in the [[Russian Revival|Russian revivalist]] movement.

==Biography==

===Childhood (1848–58)===
Viktor Vasnetsov was born in the remote village of Lopyal in [[Vyatka Governorate]] in 1848, the second of the six children.&lt;ref name="smr"&gt;{{cite web | author = 
| date = | url =http://www.centre.smr.ru/win/artists/vasnec_v/biogr_vasnec1.htm
| title = Богатырь русской живописи| publisher = www.centre.smr.ru| accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Mikhail Vasilievich Vasnetsov, known to be philosophically inclined, was a member of priesthood, and of scholarly dictation in the [[natural sciences]] and [[astronomy]]. His grandfather was an [[icon]] painter. Two of Mikhail Vasnetsov's three sons, Viktor and [[Apollinary Vasnetsov|Apollinary]], became remarkable painters, the third one becoming a schoolteacher. It was in Lopyal that Viktor started to paint, mostly landscapes and scenes of village life. Recalling his childhood in a letter to [[Vladimir Stasov]], Vasnetsov remarked that he "had lived with peasant children and liked them not as a [[narodnik]] but as a friend".&lt;ref name="smr"/&gt;

===Vyatka (1858–67)===
From the age of ten, Viktor studied in a seminary in Vyatka, each summer moving with his family to a rich merchant village of Ryabovo. During his seminary years, he worked for a local [[icon]] shopkeeper. He also helped an exiled [[Poland|Polish]] artist, [[Michał Elwiro Andriolli]], to execute [[fresco]]es for Vyatka's [[Alexander Nevsky]] cathedral.

Having graduated from the seminary, Viktor decided to move to [[Saint Petersburg]] to study art. He auctioned his paintings of ''Woman Harvester'' and ''Milk-maid'' (both 1867) in order to raise money required for the trip to the Russian capital.

===Saint Petersburg (1867–76)===
[[File:Vasnetsov Moving House.jpg|thumb|260px|''Moving House'', 1876]]
In August 1867 Viktor entered the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. Three years later, the [[Peredvizhniki]] movement of realist painters rebelled against the [[Academism]].

Vasnetsov befriended their leader [[Ivan Kramskoi]], referring to him as his teacher. He also became very close to his fellow student [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]].

It is ironic, but Viktor, whose name is associated with historical and mythological paintings, initially avoided these subjects at all costs. For his graphic composition of ''[[Christ]] and [[Pontius Pilate]] Before the People'', the Academy awarded a small silver medal to him.

In the early 1870s he executed a lot of [[engraving]]s depicting contemporary life. Two of them (''Provincial Bookseller'' from 1870 and ''A Boy with a Bottle of Vodka'' from 1872) won him a bronze medal at the [[World Fair]] in [[London]] (1874).

At that period he also started producing [[Genre works|genre paintings]] in oil. Such pieces as ''Peasant Singers'' (1873) and ''Moving House'' (1876) were warmly welcomed by democratic circles of Russian society.

===Paris (1876–77)===
In 1876 Repin invited Vasnetsov to join the Peredvizhniki colony in [[Paris]]. While living in France, Viktor studied classical and contemporary paintings, academist and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] alike. At that period, he painted ''Acrobats'' (1877), produced prints, and exhibited some of his works at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]]. It was in Paris that he became fascinated with fairy-tale subjects, starting to work on ''[[Ivan Tsarevich]] Riding a Grey Wolf'' and ''The Firebird''. Vasnetsov was a model for [[Sadko]] in Repin's celebrated painting ''[[:Image:Sadko.jpg|Sadko in the Underwater Kingdom]]''. In 1877 he returned to [[Moscow]].

===Moscow (1877–84)===
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|260px|''[[The Flying Carpet (painting)|The Flying Carpet]]'', 1880]]
In the late 1870s Vasnetsov concentrated on illustrating Russian fairy tales and the epic narrative poem [[Bylina]]s, executing some of his best known pieces: ''[[:Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|The Knight at the Crossroads]]'' (1878), ''[[Prince Igor]]'s Battlefield'' (1878),
''[[:File:Три царевны подземного царства.jpg|Three princesses of the Underground Kingdom]]'' (completed 1884 ), ''The Flying Carpet'' (1880), and ''Alionushka'' (1881).

These works were not appreciated at the time they appeared. Many radical critics dismissed them as undermining the realist principles of the [[Peredvizhniki]]. Even such prominent connoisseurs as [[Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov]] refused to buy them. The vogue for Vasnetsov's paintings would spread in the 1880s, when he turned to religious subjects and executed a series of icons for [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo]] estate of his patron [[Savva Mamontov]].

===Kiev (1884–89)===
[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|260px|''Baptism of [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]]'', a Vasnetsov fresco, St. Vladimir's Cathedral in Kiev]] [[Image:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (painting)|''Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'']] (1887) by Vasnetsov, St. Vladimir's Cathedral]]In 1884-1889 Vasnetsov was commissioned to paint [[fresco]]s in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral|St Vladimir's Cathedral]] of [[Kiev]]. This was a challenging work which ran contrary to both Russian and Western traditions of religious paintings. The influential art critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] labelled them a sacrilegious play with religious feelings of the Russian people. Another popular critic, [[Dmitry Filosofov]], referred to these frescoes as "the first bridge over 200 years-old gulf separating different classes of Russian society".

While living in Kiev, Vasnetsov made friends with [[Mikhail Vrubel]], who was also involved in the cathedral's decoration. While they worked together, Vasnetsov taught the younger artist a great deal. It was in Kiev that Vasnetsov finally finished ''[[Ivan Tsarevich]] Riding a Grey Wolf'' and started his most famous painting, the ''[[Bogatyr]]s''.

In 1885 the painter travelled to [[Italy]]. The same year he worked on stage designs and costumes for [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s opera ''[[Snegurochka (opera)|The Snow Maiden]]''.

===Later years (1890–1926)===
[[File:1898 Vasnetsov Bogatyrs anagoria.JPG|thumb|260px|''[[Bogatyrs]]'' (1898), one of Vasnetsov's most famous paintings, depicts mythical Russian knights [[Dobrynya Nikitich]], [[Ilya Muromets]] and [[Alyosha Popovich]].]]
The following two decades were productive for Vasnetsov. He increasingly turned to other media during this period. In 1897 he collaborated with his brother Apollinary on the theatrical design of another Rimsky-Korsakov premiere, ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]''.

At the turn of the century, Vasnetsov elaborated his hallmark "fairy-tale" style of [[Russian Revival]]ist architecture. His first acclaimed design was a church in [[Abramtsevo, Sergiyevo-Posadsky District, Moscow Oblast|Abramtsevo]] (1882), executed jointly with [[Vasily Polenov]]. In 1894, he designed his own mansion in [[Moscow]]. The Russian pavilion of the World Fair in [[Paris]] followed in 1898. Finally, in 1904, Vasnetsov designed the best known of his "fairy-tale" buildings — the façade of the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].

Between 1906 and 1911, Vasnetsov worked on the design of the mosaics for [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw]]; he was also involved in the design of [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Moscow]].

[[File:Stamps of Moskow Vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|260px|A [[revenue stamp]] of [[Russia]], 1914]]
In 1912, he was given a noble title by [[Czar Nicholas II]]. In 1914, he designed a revenue stamp intended for voluntary collection for victims of World War I.

Even prior to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Vasnetsov became active as a regent of the Tretyakov Gallery. He allocated a significant portion of his income to the [[State Historical Museum]], so that a large part of the museum's collection was acquired on Vasnetsov's money. After the [[October Revolution]] he advocated removing some of the religious paintings (notably those by [[Alexander Ivanov (painter)|Alexander Ivanov]]) from churches to the Tretyakov Gallery.

In 1915 Vasnetsov participated in the designing of a military uniform for the Victory parade of Russian army in Berlin and Constantinopole. Vasnetsov is credited with the creation of the [[budenovka]] (initially named ''bogatyrka''), a military hat reproducing the style of [[Kievan Rus'|ancient Rus']] [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]-shaped helmets.

He died in Moscow in 1926.

==Legacy==
[[File:Vasnetsov Ioann 4.jpg|thumbnail|260px|Vasnetsov's painting of Ivan the Terrible]]
A [[minor planet]] [[3586 Vasnetsov]], discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Zhuravlyova]] in 1978 is named after Viktor Vasnetsov and Apollinary Vasnetsov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=3575+Anyuta  | isbn = 3-540-00238-3 | page = 301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]]'', Vasnetsov's painting of [[Ivan the Terrible]] is anachronistically presented as if it already existed in that Tsar's lifetime, and as being sent by Ivan to England when he offers to marry [[Queen Elizabeth I]].

Vasnetsov's grandson was [[People's Artist of the USSR]] [[Andrei Vasnetsov]].
