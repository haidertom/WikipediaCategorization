Retrieved 27 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;
Originally developed by Drs. Rick Luettich and Joannes Westerink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luettich|first1=Rick|last2=Westerink|first2=Joannes|last3=Scheffner|first3=Norman|title=ADCIRC: An Advanced Three-Dimensional Circulation Model for Shelves, Coasts, and Estuaries.

Report 2. User's Manual for ADCIRC-2DDI|date=January 1994|publisher=Coastal Engineering Research Center|location=Vicksburg MS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the model is developed and maintained by a combination of academic, governmental, and corporate partners, including the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], the [[University of Notre Dame]], and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|US Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adcirc.org/community/developers/development-group/ ADCIRC Development Group]. Retrieved on 27 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ADCIRC system includes an independent multi-algorithmic wind forecast model and also has advanced coupling capabilities, allowing it to integrate effects from sediment transport, ice, waves, surface runoff, and baroclinicity.

== Access ==
The model is free, with source code made available by request via the website&lt;ref name=adcircwebsite /&gt;, allowing users to run the model on any system with a [[List of compilers#Fortran compilers|Fortran compiler]]. A pre-compiled [[Windows]] version of the model can also be purchased alongside the [[SMS (hydrology software)]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aquaveo.com/software/sms-adcirc SMS ADCIRC website]. Retrieved 27 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;. ADCIRC is coded in [[Fortran]], and can be used with native [[binary file|binary]], [[ASCII|text]], or [[netCDF]] file formats.  

== Capabilities ==
The model formulation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/ims/adcirc/adcirc_theory_2004_12_08.pdf ADCIRC Theory Report]. Retrieved on 27 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;
is based on the [[shallow water equations]], solving the [[continuity equation#fluid dynamics|continuity equation]] (represented in the form of the Generalized Wave Continuity Equation&lt;ref name="Kinnmark1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kinnmark|first1=Ingemar|title=The Shallow Water Wave Equations: Formulation, Analysis and Application|volume=15|year=1986|issn=0176-5035|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-82646-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
and the momentum equations (with [[Cauchy momentum equation#Convective acceleration|advective]], [[Coriolis force|Coriolis]], [[viscosity#Eddy viscosity|eddy viscosity]], and [[shear stress#shear stress in fluids|surface stress]] terms included).  ADCIRC utilizes the [[finite element method]] in either three-dimensional or two-dimensional depth-integrated form on a triangular [[unstructured grid]] with [[Cartesian Coordinate System|Cartesian]] or [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] coordinates. It can run in either [[Barotropic fluid|barotropic]] or [[baroclinic]] modes, allowing inclusion of changes in water density and properties such as salinity and temperature. ADCIRC can be run either in serial mode (e.g. on a personal computer) or in parallel on [[supercomputer|supercomputers]] via [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]]. The model has been optimized to be [[parallel algorithm#parallelizability|highly parallelized]], in order to facilitate rapid computation of large, complex problems.&lt;ref name="KerrDonahue2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=P.

ADCIRC is able to apply several different bottom friction formulations including [[Manning formula|Manning's n]]-based bottom drag due to changes in land coverage (such as forests, cities, and seafloor composition), as well as utilize atmospheric forcing data (wind stress and atmospheric pressure) from several sources, and further reduce the strength of the wind forcing due to [[roughness length|surface roughness]] effects.&lt;ref name="WesterinkLuettich2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westerink|first1=Joannes J.|last2=Luettich|first2=Richard A.|last3=Feyen|first3=Jesse C.|last4=Atkinson|first4=John H.|last5=Dawson|first5=Clint|last6=Roberts|first6=Hugh J.|last7=Powell|first7=Mark D.|last8=Dunion|first8=Jason P.|last9=Kubatko|first9=Ethan J.|last10=Pourtaheri|first10=Hasan|title=A Basin- to Channel-Scale Unstructured Grid Hurricane Storm Surge Model Applied to Southern Louisiana|journal=Monthly Weather Review|volume=136|issue=3|year=2008|pages=833–864|issn=0027-0644|doi=10.1175/2007MWR1946.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DietrichBunya2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dietrich|first1=J.

The model is also able to incorporate effects such as time-varying topography and bathymetry, boundary fluxes from rivers or other sources, tidal potential, and sub-grid scale features like levees. 

ADCIRC is frequently coupled to a [[wind wave model]] such as STWAVE, [http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net/ SWAN], or [[Wind wave model#WAVEWATCH|WAVEWATCH III]], especially in storm surge applications where [[radiation stress|wave radiation stress]] can have important effects on ocean circulation and vice versa. In these applications, the model is able to take advantage of tight coupling with wave models to increase calculation accuracy.&lt;ref name="DietrichBunya2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BunyaDietrich2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunya|first1=S.|last2=Dietrich|first2=J.

Planes are given special attention and British makers, among them [[Holtzapffel]], [[T. Norris &amp; Son|Norris]], [[Alexander Mathieson &amp; Sons|Mathieson]] and [[Stewart Spiers|Spiers]], are discussed in depth.

==Summary==
A wide array of edge and boring tools provides a broad survey of hand tool-making from prehistory to today. Writing in ''[[The Times]]'', Huon Mallalieu encapsulated the function of the book: "Over the past 35 years [David Russell] has amassed probably the world’s largest collection of antique woodworking tools from the Stone Age to the 20th century ... The catalogue not only lists and lavishly illustrates 1556 items, but also makers’ stamps and associated material ..."&lt;ref&gt;Huon Mallalieu, "The heft of a hammer, the balance of an axe or the certainty of a saw are the links between man and material", ''The Times'', November 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
After looking at a range of tools from prehistory to the Romans, the book examines in detail more recent hand tools by function: from saws to drills and braces; from rules and gauges to bevels, squares and levels. Much of the book, however, is devoted to an extensive selection of wooden and metal planes and highlights their manifold functions. These planes are arranged within chapters on continental European, British and American models, with some of the great British makers from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century discussed in depth. A short chapter focuses on spurious and altered items, drawing the reader's attention to some of the pitfalls of collecting vintage tools.

==Critical reception==
The book has been widely acclaimed in both the general and specialized press. According to the ''[[Sheffield Telegraph]]'', "the book not only celebrates the collection but is considered the most serious work of reference of its kind to date and destined to become a 'bible' in its field".&lt;ref&gt;''Sheffield Telegraph'', December 9, 2010. [http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/arts/days-when-sheffielders-produced-tools-for-every-job-1-2842972 See full article].&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking at the book from another angle, Eve Kahn in the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the book was "intended to glamorize unsung innovations".&lt;ref&gt;Eve M. Kahn, "A Craftsman's Wares", ''New York Times'', September 13, 2013, p. C26. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/arts/design/works-from-earliest-photographers-are-on-display-and-on-sale.html?_r=0 See full article].&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Duguay, writing in ''Canadian Woodworking &amp; Home Improvement'', declared that the book was "Lavish, stunning, outstanding, magnificent ... superlatives just don't do justice to [it]."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Duguay, "A 'must-have' for anyone who loves woodworking tools", ''Canadian Woodworking &amp; Home Improvement''  [https://www.canadianwoodworking.com/antique-woodworking-tools See full article].&lt;/ref&gt;

Journals of some of the leading tool societies have been generous in their praise. "David Russell’s book is a vehicle for sharing his fabulous collection with the world," enthused John Wells in the ''Chronicle'', the journal of the [[Early American Industries Association]]. "His unerring eye has sought out the most interesting tools available over the past 40 years, resulting in one of the world’s greatest collections of antique woodworking tools."&lt;ref&gt;John Wells, "A Bounty of Tools in an Outstanding Collector's Book", ''Chronicle'', vol. 64, no. 3, September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   The late Frank Ham, writing in the Australian journal ''Tool Chest'', declared the book to be "the most impressive record of tools" he had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Ham, ''Tool Chest'' (Journal of the Hand Tool Preservation Association of Australia), no. 108, May, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on the illustrations, Mark Bridge commented in ''[[Antiques Trade Gazette]]'' on how [[James Austin (photographer)|James Austin]], the book's photographer, had "managed to capture the elusive qualities of balance, texture and patina which make the finest tools a pleasure to handle, frequently lifting them into the realm of folk art".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bridge, "The young apprentice cabinetmaker who became a connoisseur", ''Antiques Trade Gazette'', October 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">The '''behavioral immune system''' is a phrase coined by the psychological scientist [[Mark Schaller]] to refer to a suite of psychological mechanisms that allow individual organisms to detect the potential presence of disease-causing [[parasite]]s in their immediate environment, and to engage in behaviors that prevent contact with those objects and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1702_2 |last=Schaller |first=M. |year=2006 |title=Parasites, behavioral defenses, and the social psychological mechanisms through which cultures are evoked |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages= 96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sd2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Duncan, L.A. |title=Evolution and the social mind: Evolutionary psychology and social cognition |editor=J.P. Forgas, M.G. Haselton &amp; W. von Hippel |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=293–307 |chapter=The behavioral immune system: Its evolution and social psychological implications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0963721411402596 |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Park, J.H. |year=2011 |title=The behavioral immune system (and why it matters) |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mechanisms include sensory processes through which cues connoting the presence of parasitic infections are perceived (e.g., the smell of a foul odor, the sight of [[Acne scarring|pox]] or [[pustules]]), as well as [[stimulus–response]] systems through which these sensory cues trigger a cascade of aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions (e.g., arousal of [[disgust]], automatic activation of cognitions that connote the threat of disease, behavioral avoidance).&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oaten |first=M. |author2=Stevenson, R.J. |author3=Case, T.I. |date=March 2009 |title=Disgust as a disease–avoidance mechanism |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=303–21 |doi=10.1037/a0014823 |pmid=19254082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a behavioral immune system has been documented across many animal species, including humans. It is theorized that the mechanisms that comprise the behavioral immune system evolved as a crude first line of defense against disease-causing pathogens.&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;

==Implications for human behavior==
Within the [[psychological sciences]], there is extensive research linking the behavioral immune system to a variety of prejudices—including prejudices against people who aren't actually diseased but are simply characterized by some sort of visual characteristics that deviate from those of a subjectively prototypical human being. The disease–avoidant processes that characterize the behavioral immune system have been shown to contribute to prejudices against [[obese]] individuals, [[elderly]] individuals, and people with physical disfigurements or [[disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J.H. |author2=Faulkner, J. |author3=Schaller, M. |date=June 2003 |title=Evolved disease-avoidance processes and contemporary anti-social behavior: Prejudicial attitudes and avoidance of people with physical disabilities |journal= Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |publisher=Springer Netherlands |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=65–87 |issn=1573-3653 |doi=10.1023/A:1023910408854 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l147k15h81282134/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Crandall, C.S. |year=2007 |title=Pathogen-avoidance mechanisms and the stigmatization of obese people |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=410–4 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/ParkSchallerCrandall2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=L.A. |author2=Schaller, M. |date=October 27, 2009 |title=Prejudicial Attitudes Toward Older Adults May Be Exaggerated When People Feel Vulnerable to Infectious Disease: Evidence and Implications |journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy |publisher=The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=97–115 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122665436/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01188.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the behavioral immune system appears to contribute to [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faulkner |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Park, J.H. |author4= Duncan, L.A.  |year=2004 |title=Evolved Disease–Avoidance Mechanisms and Contemporary Xenophobic Attitudes |journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations |volume=7 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/1368430204046142 |pages=333–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Navarrete |first=C.D. |author2=D. Fessler|author3=S. Eng |year=2007 |title=Elevated ethnocentrism in the first trimester of pregnancy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=60–5 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fessler/pubs/NavarretePregEthnocentr2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One implication is that these prejudices tend to be exaggerated under conditions in which people feel especially vulnerable to the potential transmission of infectious diseases.

Additional lines of research on the behavioral immune system have shown that people engage in more reticent and conservative forms of behavior under conditions in which they feel more vulnerable to disease transmission. For instance, when the potential threat of disease is made salient, people tend to be less extraverted or sociable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797610361706 |last=Mortensen |first=C.R. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4=Neuberg, S.L. |author5=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2010 |title=Infection breeds reticence: The effects of disease salience on self-perceptions of personality and behavioral tendencies |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=440–7 |pmid=20424082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that the behavioral immune system also incorporates mechanisms designed to search out and process (heuristic) signs of disease at the level of basic visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.008 |last=Ackerman |first=J.M. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Mortensen, C.R. |author4=Sasaki, T. |author5=Neuberg, S.L.  |author6=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2009 |title=A pox on the mind: Disjunction of attention and memory in the processing of physical disfigurement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages= 478–85 |url=http://web.mit.edu/joshack/www/Ackerman_Pox-on-the-mind2009.pdf |pmid=19578547 |pmc=2699287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for human culture==
The behavioral immune system also has consequences at a [[cultural]] level of analysis. Under ecological circumstances in which diseases are more prevalent, people also tend to display more reticent and socially restricted forms of behavior, and human cultures are defined by more conservative norms and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fincher |first=C.L. |author2=Thornhill, R. |author3=Murray, D.R. |author4= Schaller, M.  |year=2008 |title=Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=275 |issue=1640 |pages=1279–85 |pmid=18302996 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/FincherThornhillMurraySchaller2008.pdf |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0094 |pmc=2602680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Murray, D.R. |date=July 2008 |title=Pathogens, personality, and culture: Disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=212–21 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2008-08084-014&amp;CFID=5418322&amp;CFTOKEN=19787463 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.212 |pmid=18605861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for immunology==
Some research suggests that the behavioral immune system has implications for the functioning of the physiological [[immune system]] too. One study found that the mere visual perception of diseased-looking people stimulated white blood cells to respond more aggressively to infection (as indicated by the production of the proinflammatory [[cytokine]] [[Interleukin 6]] in response to a bacterial stimulus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Miller, G.E. |author3=Gervais, W.M. |author4=Yager, S. |author5= Chen, E.  |year=2010 |title=Mere visual perception of other people's disease symptoms facilitates a more aggressive immune response |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=649–52 |pmid=20483842 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/SchallerMillerGervaisYagerChen2010.pdf |doi=10.1177/0956797610368064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also indicates that immune-relevant interventions which target pathogen transmission can interrupt behavioral responses. For example, receiving a flu vaccination or washing one's hands can reduce the extent of negative interpersonal and intergroup attitudes elicited by disease cues and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huang|first=J.Y. |author2=Sedlovskaya, A. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4= Bargh, J.A.  |year=2011 |title=Immunizing Against Prejudice: Effects of Disease Protection on Attitudes Toward Out-Groups |journal=Psychological Science |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1550–56 |pmid=22058107 |doi=10.1177/0956797611417261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Café des Phares, Place de la Bastille, Paris.JPG|thumb|The Café des Phares (Paris) - the first café philosophique in the world]]
'''Café philosophique''' ("cafe-philo") is a grassroots forum for philosophical discussion, founded by philosopher [[Marc Sautet]] in Paris, France, on December 13, 1992.&lt;ref name = "chaplin282"&gt; Chaplin, p. 282 ''Philosopher Marc Sautet started the first "cafe-philo" at the Cafe des Phares on the Place de la Bastille in Paris.''&lt;/ref&gt;

There were about 100 "cafés-philo" operating throughout France and some 150 cafés-philos internationally at the time of Sautet's death in 1998.&lt;ref name ="simons"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Marlise | last1 = Simons | title = Thought For Food: Cafes Offer Philosophy In France | newspaper = New York Times | date = May 2, 1998 | pages = B9 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/02/arts/thought-for-food-cafes-offer-philosophy-in-france.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

The subjects discussed at the cafes had a range that varied from the Santa Claus myth to truth to beauty to sex to death. They posed such questions as ''What is a fact?'' and ''Is hope a violent thing?'' Sautet made the discussions seem fun and exciting. The concept was to bring people together in a public friendly forum where they could discuss ideas. A cafe tended to have this type of atmosphere where people were relaxed drinking coffee and carrying on conversations. This concept ultimately developed into Café Philosophique that he founded.&lt;ref name ="cafephilo"&gt;[http://www.philodialogue.com/history.htm Cafe philo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of participants in philosophy cafes worldwide have adopted Sautet's idea as a way to enhance their thinking. Ideas are thrown out with concern for accuracy and philosophical rigor. The concepts discussed were in the spirit of tolerance and openness. The idea of Sautet's philosophy cafes have spread around the world. The concept that started in France and subsequently entered England, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Finland and eventually throughout Europe is now in Canada, South America, Greece, Australia, Japan and the United States.&lt;ref name = "steeped"/&gt; Due to this success, the French president [[Jacques Chirac]] sent a founding member on a good will mission to Latin America to introduce the concept there.&lt;ref name ="simons"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Predecessors ===

The [[French Institute for Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]] also runs a café philosophique in Edinburgh - continuing a tradition that dates back to the days of the great Francophile philosopher [[David Hume]]. Staff of The French Institute for Scotland are also involved in teaching philosophy in Scottish primary schools, as an example in [[Clackmannan]]. In England, a Cafe Philosophique has been meeting in a Cromford (Derbyshire) bookshop cafe since being founded by Wirksworth philosopher-potter Evan Rutherford in 1993, and by 2009 had held around 100 meetings. The public evenings are usually led by members and associates of the ever-changing group rather than by professional philosophers, but prospective speakers are welcome to propose topics; the text of some of the talks can be read online.

The [[Ottoman empire]] expanded throughout Europe in the 17th century. From [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] came the idea of a place where men could meet and discuss various topics over coffee or tea ([[Viennese coffee house]] culture). Adapted to Western culture, the Turkish "coffee cafes" became the place where friends met for a drink. The tradition of the [[Agora]] was moved from the public square to the center city cafe. Philosophers, poets, writers, and intellectuals of all types made these places their new meeting places.

In 1686 the Sicilian [[Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli]] started ''[[Café Procope]]'' in ''rue de l'Ancienne Comédie'', in the Latin Quarter of Paris known as the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]]. It was the first café in Paris. Certain intellectuals that have frequented the cafe for philosophical discussions throughout history have been [[Victor Hugo]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Honoré de Balzac]] [[Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais]], [[François-Marie Arouet]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Georges Danton]], [[Jean-Paul Marat]], [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Denis Diderot]] amongst others.

For about 30 years in Paris, poets, painters, writers and part of the [[surrealist]] movement went to cafés of [[Montparnasse]]. Also in Paris after World War II the cafes of the Latin quarter saw a form of [[existentialism]]. The philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] conducted philosophical discussions at the [[Café de Flore]]. These "coffee philos" were the historical beginnings of Sautet's "cafés-philos".

=== Café philosophique ===

Sautet started the idea of philosophy cafes in the [[Place de la Bastille]] neighborhood of Paris at the Café des Phares on December 13, 1992.&lt;ref name = "chaplin282"/&gt; He would gather some friends at his "café philos" each Sunday at 11 A.M. and opened up philosophical debates ("conceptual fisticuffs") for some two hours. His philosophy was a return to the basic principles of reasoning intended for the general public, not [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg38904.html ''Steeped in Thought: The Philosophy Café Movement''] by Joshua Glenn, contributing editor, Britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt; The first meetings started with only a dozen or so people. Soon university students showed up, followed by eccentric citizens off the street, off-duty cab drivers, and idle wealthy women.&lt;ref name ="obit"&gt;Obituary - "The Times" newspaper of London (UK): Apr 1, 1998.  pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This became a weekly event that grew in popularity to about 200 people at each meeting.&lt;ref name="steeped"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zftrans.com/bbs/simple/index.php?t15052.html# |title=Steeped in Thought: The Philosophy café Movement |access-date=2009-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043657/http://www.zftrans.com/bbs/simple/index.php?t15052.html# |archive-date=2011-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sautet returned philosophy to the general public in Café Philosophique. In so doing, he was rejected by scholars as being unfaithful to the normal philosophy taught in [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;Marinoff, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chemical Society of Japan''' (CSJ) is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1878 in order to advance research in chemistry.  The mission of the CSJ is to promote chemistry for science and industry in collaboration with other domestic and global societies.&lt;ref name="about_csj"&gt;Chemical Society of Japan (CSJ), [http://www.csj.jp/csj-en/about/about.html  About CSJ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The organization was modeled after the British Chemical Society.  This [[learned society]] in London was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, the Japanese association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout Japan and across international borders. &lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"&gt;Lagowski, J. J. (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became The [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Membership was expanded in 1948 in a merger with the Society of Chemical Industry.&lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"/&gt; In 2018 the first woman was announced as president, the distinguished chemist [[Maki Kawai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chemistry.or.jp/en/aboutus/message.html|title=President Message|work=The Chemical Society of Japan|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Activities==
Support for the ''[[Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan]]'' (BCSJ) began in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;CSJ, [http://www.csj.jp/csj-en/journals/bcsj.html history of BCSJ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other publications of the society include:

'''Corrected Flow''' is the mass flow that would pass through a device (e.g. compressor, bypass duct, etc.) if the inlet pressure and temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at Sea Level, on a Standard Day (e.g. 101.325 kPa, 300K).

Corrected Flow, '''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;''', can be calculated as follows, assuming Imperial Units:

'''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta} = w\sqrt{T/518.7}/(P/14.696)&lt;/math&gt;'''

Corrected Flow is often given the symbol '''&lt;math&gt;wc&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''&lt;math&gt;wr&lt;/math&gt;''' (for referred flow).

So-called Non-Dimensional Flow, '''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{T}/{P}&lt;/math&gt;''', is proportional to Corrected Flow:

'''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{T}/{P}= w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta} * \sqrt{518.7}/{14.696}&lt;/math&gt;'''

The equivalent equations for Preferred SI Units are: (101.325kPa, 288.15K)

'''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta} = w\sqrt{T/288.15}/(P/101.325)&lt;/math&gt;'''

'''&lt;math&gt;w\sqrt{T}/{P}= w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta} * \sqrt{288.15}/{101.325}&lt;/math&gt;'''

Nomenclature:

*'''&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''' Stagnation (or Total) Pressure (in kPa)
*'''&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;''' Stagnation (or Total) Temperature (in K)
*'''&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;''' Real Mass Flow
*'''&lt;math&gt;{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;''' Referred Pressure
*'''&lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;''' Referred Temperature

In relative form, Corrected Flow, Referred Flow and Non-Dimensional Flow are all measures of axial Mach number.

Side note:
If the mass flow can be considered an energy source such as fuel flow, the corrected flow is calculated as follows:

'''&lt;math&gt; w/(\delta * \sqrt{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;'''

Note: 

The source of coefficients is coming out from the fact that rotating components will in fact change the fluid properties, because of vibrations (compressibility of the flow change). 
So if one wants to correct the fuel flow then a theta correction exponent should be found through iterations, but for corrections for flow at engine entry (W2) then this aspect on rotating components vibration is not accounted because much smaller than one inside an engine. As a consequence the inlet flow is corrected just by square root of Theta and divided by delta.

'''DNA isolation''' is a process of purification of DNA from sample using a combination of physical and chemical methods. The first isolation of DNA was done in 1869 by [[Friedrich Miescher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahm R | title = Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 565–81 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17901982 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-007-0433-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is a routine procedure in [[molecular biology]] or [[forensics|forensic]] analyses. For the chemical method, there are many different kits used for extraction, and selecting the correct one will save time on kit optimization and extraction procedures. [[PCR]] sensitivity detection is considered to show the variation between the commercial kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshikawa H, Dogruman-Al F, Dogruman-Ai F, Turk S, Kustimur S, Balaban N, Sultan N | title = Evaluation of DNA extraction kits for molecular diagnosis of human Blastocystis subtypes from fecal samples | journal = Parasitology Research | volume = 109 | issue = 4 | pages = 1045–50 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21499752 | doi = 10.1007/s00436-011-2342-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Empty section|date=November 2018}}

== Basic procedure ==
There are three basic and two optional steps in a DNA extraction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Rice | first1 = George | name-list-format = vanc | title = DNA Extraction | url = http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/research_methods/genomics/dnaext.html | website = Educational Resources, Microbial Life | publisher = Montana State University | accessdate = 17 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, D. N., et al. "Evaluation and optimization of DNA extraction and purification procedures for soil and sediment samples." Applied and Environmental Microbiology 65.11 (1999): 4715-4724.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cells which are to be studied need to be collected.
* Breaking the [[cell membrane]]s open to expose the DNA along with the cytoplasm within ([[Lysis|cell lysis]]).
** Lipids from the cell membrane and the nucleus are broken down with  [[detergent]]s and [[surfactant]]s.
** Breaking [[protein]]s by adding a [[protease]] (optional).
** Breaking [[RNA]] by adding an [[RNase]] (optional). 
* The solution is treated with concentrated salt solution to make debris such as broken proteins, lipids and RNA to clump together.
* [[Centrifugation]] of the solution, which separates the clumped cellular debris from the DNA.
* DNA purification from detergents, proteins, salts and reagents used during cell lysis step. The most commonly used procedures are:
** [[Ethanol precipitation]] usually by ice-cold [[ethanol]] or [[isopropanol]]. Since DNA is insoluble in these alcohols, it will aggregate together, giving a ''pellet'' upon [[centrifugation]]. Precipitation of DNA is improved by increasing of ionic strength, usually by adding [[sodium acetate]].
** [[Phenol–chloroform extraction]] in which [[phenol]] [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatures]] proteins in the sample. After centrifugation of the sample, denaturated proteins stay in the organic phase while aqueous phase containing [[nucleic acid]] is mixed with the [[chloroform]] that removes phenol residues from solution.
** [[Minicolumn purification]] that relies on the fact that the [[nucleic acid]]s may bind ([[adsorption]]) to the solid phase (silica or other) depending on the [[pH]] and the salt concentration of the buffer.

Cellular and [[histone]] proteins bound to the DNA can be removed either by adding a [[protease]] or by having precipitated the proteins with [[sodium acetate|sodium]] or [[ammonium acetate]], or [[phenol-chloroform extraction|extracted them with a phenol-chloroform]] mixture prior to the DNA-precipitation.

After isolation, the DNA is dissolved in slightly alkaline buffer, usually in the [[TE buffer]], or in [[Ultrapure water|ultra-pure water]].

== Method Selection ==
Some of the most common DNA extraction methods include [[Phenol-chloroform extraction|organic extraction]], [[Chelex 100|Chelex extraction]], and [[solid phase extraction]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/dna-extraction|title=ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods consistently yield isolated DNA, but they differ in both the quality and the quantity of DNA yielded. When selecting a DNA extraction method, there are multiple factors to consider, including cost, time, safety, and risk of contamination.

[[Phenol-chloroform extraction|Organic extraction]] involves the addition of and incubation in multiple different chemical solutions;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; including a [[Cell lysis|lysis]] step, a phenol chloroform extraction, an [[ethanol precipitation]], and washing steps. Organic extraction is often used in laboratories because it is cheap, and it yields large quantities of pure DNA. Though it is easy, there are many steps involved, and it takes longer than other methods. It also involves the unfavorable use of the toxic chemicals [[phenol]] and [[chloroform]], and there is an increased risk of contamination due to transferring the DNA between multiple tubes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123448124|title=Forensic DNA typing : biology, technology, and genetics of STR markers|last=1969-|first=Butler, John M. (John Marshall),|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|isbn=9780080470610|edition= 2nd|location=Amsterdam|oclc=123448124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chelex 100|Chelex extraction]] method involves adding the Chelex resin to the sample, boiling the solution, then vortexing and centrifuging it. The cellular materials bind to the Chelex beads, while the DNA is available in the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|supernatant]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Chelex method is much faster and simpler than organic extraction, and it only requires one tube, which decreases the risk of DNA contamination. Unfortunately, Chelex extraction does not yield as much quantity and the DNA yielded is single-stranded, which means it can only be used for [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]-based analyses and not for [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|RFLP]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Solid phase extraction]] such as using a [[Spin column-based nucleic acid purification|spin-column based extraction]] method takes advantage of the fact that DNA binds to [[Silica gel|silica]]. The sample containing DNA is added to a column containing a silica gel or silica beads. The DNA binds to the silica, while the rest of the solution is washed out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The DNA can then be removed from the silica using a buffer. This method is very easy and uses only one tube; it also yields high quantities of pure, high-quality DNA, and the procedure can even be automated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Multiple solid phase extraction commercial kits are manufactured and marketed by different companies; the only problem is that they are more expensive than organic extraction or Chelex extraction.

==Special types ==
Specific techniques must be chosen for isolation of DNA from some samples. Typical samples with complicated DNA isolation are:
* archaeological samples containing partially degraded DNA, see [[ancient DNA]] &lt;ref&gt;Pääbo, Svante. "Ancient DNA: extraction, characterization, molecular cloning, and enzymatic amplification." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 86.6 (1989): 1939-1943.&lt;/ref&gt;
* samples containing inhibitors of subsequent analysis procedures, most notably inhibitors of [[PCR]], such as [[humic acid]] from soil, [[indigo]] and other fabric dyes or [[haemoglobin]] in blood
* samples from microorganisms with thick cellular wall, for example [[yeast]]

Extrachromosomal DNA is generally easy to isolate, especially [[plasmid]]s may be easily isolated by cell lysis followed by precipitation of proteins, which traps chromosomal DNA in insoluble fraction and after centrifugation, plasmid DNA can be purified from soluble fraction.

A Hirt DNA Extraction is an isolation of all [[extrachromosomal DNA]] in a mammalian cell. The Hirt extraction process gets rid of the high molecular weight [[nuclear DNA]], leaving only low molecular weight [[mitochondrial DNA]] and any viral [[episomes]] present in the cell.

==Detecting DNA==
{{main|Quantification of nucleic acids}}

A diphenylamine (DPA) indicator will confirm the presence of DNA. This procedure involves chemical hydrolysis of DNA: when heated (e.g. ≥95&amp;nbsp;°C) in acid, the reaction requires a deoxyribose sugar and therefore is specific for DNA. Under these conditions, the 2-deoxyribose is converted to w-hydroxylevulinyl aldehyde, which reacts with the compound, diphenylamine, to produce a blue-colored compound. DNA concentration can be determined measuring the intensity of absorbance of the solution at the 600&amp;nbsp;nm with a [[spectrophotometer]] and comparing to a [[standard curve]] of known DNA concentrations.

Measuring the intensity of absorbance of the DNA solution at wavelengths [[Quantification of nucleic acids|260 nm and 280 nm]] is used as a measure of DNA purity. DNA absorbs [[UV]] light at 260 and 280 nanometres, and aromatic proteins absorb UV light at 280&amp;nbsp;nm; a pure sample of DNA has a ratio of 1.8 at 260/280 and is relatively free from protein contamination. A DNA preparation that is contaminated with protein will have a 260/280 ratio lower than 1.8.

DNA can be quantified by cutting the DNA with a [[restriction enzyme]], running it on an agarose [[gel electrophoresis|gel]], staining with [[ethidium bromide]] or a different stain and comparing the intensity of the DNA with a DNA marker of known concentration.

Using the [[Southern blot]] technique, this quantified DNA can be isolated and examined further using [[PCR]] and [[RFLP]] analysis. These procedures allow differentiation of the repeated sequences within the genome. It is these techniques which [[forensic]] scientists use for comparison, identification, and analysis.

[[File:Europäische Wasserscheiden.png|thumb|300px|Major drainage divides (red ridgelines&lt;ref name="RndmHse1"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 September 2013|publisher=Random House Inc.|title=ridgeline. Dictionary.com|edition=Dictionary.com Unabridged
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ridgeline?s=t }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[drainage basin]]s (green regions) in Europe. (Note the German labels.)]]

A '''drainage divide''', '''water divide''', '''divide''', '''ridgeline''',&lt;ref name="RndmHse1"/&gt; '''watershed''', or '''water parting''' is the line that separates neighbouring [[drainage basin]]s. On rugged land, the divide lies along [[topography|topographical]] [[ridge]]s, and may be in the form of a single range of [[hill]]s or [[mountain]]s, known as a '''dividing range'''. On flat terrain, especially where the ground is [[marsh]]y, the divide may be harder to discern.

A '''valley floor divide''' is a low drainage divide that runs across a valley, sometimes created by deposition or [[stream capture]].

Since ridgelines are relatively easy to see and agree about, drainage divides are often [[Border#Natural borders|natural borders]] defining political boundaries, as with the 18th century North America [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] that preceded the [[American Revolution]].

==Types==
Drainage divides can be divided into three types:
*[[Continental divide]] in which waters on each side flow to different oceans, such as the [[Congo-Nile Divide]].
*Major drainage divide in which waters on each side of the divide never meet but flow into the same ocean, such as the divide between the [[Yellow River]] basin and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]].  Another, more subtle, example is the Schuylkill-Lehigh divide at [[Pisgah Mountain]] in Pennsylvania in which two minor creeks divide to flow and grow east and west respectively joining the [[Lehigh River]] and [[Delaware River]] or the [[Susquehanna River]] and [[Potomac River]], with each tributary complex having separate outlets into the Atlantic.
*Minor drainage divide in which waters part but eventually rejoin at a river confluence, such as the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Missouri River]] drainage divides.

== Valley-floor divides ==
A valley-floor divide occurs on the bottom of a valley and arises as a result of subsequent depositions, such as [[scree]], in a valley through which a river originally flowed continuously.&lt;ref&gt;Leser, Hartmut, ed. (2005). ''Wörterbuch Allgemeine Geographie'', 13th ed., dtv, Munich, p. 935. {{ISBN|978-3-423-03422-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include the [[Kartitsch Saddle]] in the [[Gail (river)|Gail]] valley in [[East Tyrol]], which forms the watershed between the [[Drau]] and the Gail, and the divides in the ''Toblacher Feld'' between [[Innichen]] and [[Toblach]] in [[Italy]], where the [[Drau]] empties into the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Rienz]] into the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].

Settlements are often built on valley-floor divides in the Alps. Examples are [[Eben im Pongau]], [[Kirchberg in Tirol]] and [[Waidring]] (In all of these, the village name indicates the pass and the watershed is even explicitly displayed in the coat of arms). Extremely low divides with heights of less than two metres are found on the [[North German Plain]] within the ''[[Urstromtäler]]'', for example, between [[Havel]] and [[Finow]] in the ''Eberswalde Urstromtal''. In marsh deltas such as the [[Okavango Delta|Okavango]], the largest drainage area on earth, or in large lakes areas, such as the [[Finnish Lakeland]], it is difficult to find a meaningful definition of a watershed. Another case is [[bifurcation (river)|bifurcation]], where the watershed is effectively in the river bed, a wetland or underground. The largest watershed of this type is the bifurcation of the [[Orinoco]] in the north of [[South America]], whose main stream empties into the [[Caribbean]], but which also drains into the South Atlantic via the [[Casiquiare canal]] and [[Amazon River]].

== Impact on communication ==
Drainage divides hinder river [[navigation]]. In pre-industrial times, water divides were crossed at [[portage]]s. Later, [[canal]]s connected adjoining drainage basins; a key problem in such canals is ensuring a sufficient water supply. Important examples are the [[Chicago Portage]], connecting the Great Lakes and Mississippi by the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], and the [[Canal des Deux Mers]] in France, connecting the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17408">'''Ecocriticism''' is the study of [[literature]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] from an [[interdisciplinary]] point of view, where literature scholars analyze texts that illustrate environmental concerns and examine the various ways literature treats the subject of [[nature]]. Some ecocritics brainstorm possible solutions for the correction of the contemporary environmental situation, though not all ecocritics agree on the purpose, methodology, or scope of ecocriticism. 
In the United States, ecocriticism is often associated with the [[Association for the Study of Literature and Environment]] (ASLE),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; which hosts biennial meetings for scholars who deal with environmental matters in literature.  ASLE publishes a journal&amp;mdash;''Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment'' (''ISLE'')&amp;mdash;in which current international scholarship can be found.

Ecocriticism is an intentionally broad approach that is known by a number of other designations, including "green (cultural) studies", "[[Ecopoetry|ecopoetics]]", and "environmental literary criticism" and is often informed by other fields such as [[ecology]], [[sustainable design]], [[biopolitics]], [[environmental history]], [[environmentalism]], and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], among others.

== Definition ==
In comparison with other 'political' forms of criticism, there has been relatively little dispute about the moral and philosophical aims of ecocriticism, although its scope has broadened rapidly from nature writing, romantic poetry, and canonical literature to take in film, television, theatre, animal stories, architectures, scientific narratives and an extraordinary range of literary texts. At the same time, ecocriticism has borrowed methodologies and theoretically informed approaches liberally from other fields of literary, social and scientific study.

Cheryll Glotfelty's working definition in ''The Ecocriticism Reader'' is that "ecocriticism is the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment",&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and one of the implicit goals of the approach is to recoup professional dignity for what Glotfelty calls the "undervalued genre of nature writing".&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Buell defines "'ecocriticism' ... as [a] study of the relationship between literature and the environment conducted in a spirit of commitment to environmentalist praxis".&lt;ref&gt;430, n.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Estok noted in 2001 that "ecocriticism has distinguished itself, debates notwithstanding, firstly by the ethical stand it takes, its commitment to the natural world as an important thing rather than simply as an object of thematic study, and, secondly, by its commitment to making connections".&lt;ref&gt;Estok 2001, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in an article that extends ecocriticism to Shakespearean studies, Estok argues that ecocriticism is more than "simply the study of Nature or natural things in literature; rather, it is any theory that is committed to effecting change by analyzing the function–thematic, artistic, social, historical, ideological, theoretical, or otherwise–of the natural environment, or aspects of it, represented in documents (literary or other) that contribute to material practices in material worlds".&lt;ref&gt;Estok 2005, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; This echoes the functional approach of the [[cultural ecology]] branch of ecocriticism, which analyzes the analogies between ecosystems and imaginative texts and posits that such texts potentially have an ecological (regenerative, revitalizing) function in the cultural system.&lt;ref&gt;Zapf 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As Michael P. Cohen has observed, "if you want to be an ecocritic, be prepared to explain what you do and be criticized, if not satirized."   Certainly, Cohen adds his voice to such critique, noting that one of the problems of ecocriticism has been what he calls its "praise-song school" of criticism. All ecocritics share an environmentalist motivation of some sort, but whereas the majority are 'nature endorsing',&lt;ref&gt;[[Kate Soper]], "What is Nature?", 1998&lt;/ref&gt; some are 'nature sceptical'. In part this entails a shared sense of the ways in which 'nature' has been used to legitimise gender, sexual and racial norms (so homosexuality has been seen as 'unnatural', for example), but it also involves scepticism about the uses to which 'ecological' language is put in ecocriticism; it can also involve a critique of the ways cultural norms of nature and the environment contribute to environmental degradation. Greg Garrard has dubbed 'pastoral ecology' the notion that nature undisturbed is balanced and harmonious,&lt;ref&gt;Barry 2009, pp. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt; while Dana Phillips has criticised the literary quality and scientific accuracy of nature writing in "The Truth of Ecology". Similarly, there has been a call to recognize the place of the [[Environmental Justice]] movement in redefining ecocritical discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Buell 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the question of what ecocriticism is or should be, Camilo Gomides has offered an operational definition that is both broad and discriminating: "The field of enquiry that analyzes and promotes works of art which raise moral questions about human interactions with nature, while also motivating audiences to live within a limit that will be binding over generations" (16). He tests it for a film (mal)adaptation about Amazonian deforestation. Implementing the Gomides definition, Joseph Henry Vogel makes the case that ecocriticism constitutes an "economic school of thought" as it engages audiences to debate issues of resource allocation that have no technical solution. Ashton Nichols has recently argued that the historical dangers of a romantic version of nature now need to be replaced by "urbanatural roosting", a view that sees urban life and the natural world as closely linked and argues for humans to live more lightly on the planet, the way virtually all other species do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/beyondromanticecocriticism-1/AshtonNichols|title=Macmillan|first=|last=Macmillan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary studies==
Ecocritics investigate such things as the underlying [[ecology|ecological]] values, what, precisely, is meant by the word nature, and whether the examination of "place" should be a distinctive category, much like class, gender or race. Ecocritics examine human perception of [[wilderness]], and how it has changed throughout history and whether or not current environmental issues are accurately represented or even mentioned in popular culture and modern literature. Scholars in ecocriticism engage in questions regarding [[anthropocentrism]], and the "mainstream assumption that the natural world be seen primarily as a resource for human beings" as well as critical approaches to changing ideas in "the material and cultural bases of modern society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Timothy|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Literature and the Environment|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=New York|isbn=9780521720908|page=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=May 19, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciplines, such as history, economics, philosophy, ethics, and psychology, are also considered by ecocritics to be possible contributors to ecocriticism.

While William Rueckert may have been the first person to use the term ''ecocriticism'' (Barry 240) in his 1978 essay entitled ''Literature and Ecology: An Experiment in Ecocriticism,'' ecocriticism as a movement owes much to [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 environmental exposé ''[[Silent Spring]]''. Drawing from this critical moment, Rueckert's intent was to focus on "the application of ecology and ecological concepts to the study of literature".&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;107&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecologically minded individuals and scholars have been publishing progressive works of ecotheory and criticism since the explosion of environmentalism in the late 1960s and 1970s. However, because there was no organized movement to study the ecological/environmental side of literature, these important works were scattered and categorized under a litany of different subject headings: [[pastoral]]ism, human ecology, regionalism, American Studies etc. British [[marxist literary criticism|marxist critic]] [[Raymond Williams]], for example, wrote a seminal critique of pastoral literature in 1973, ''[[The Country and the City]]''.

Another early ecocritical text, Joseph Meeker's ''The Comedy of Survival'' (1974), proposed a version of an argument that was later to dominate ecocriticism and environmental philosophy; that environmental crisis is caused primarily by a cultural tradition in the West of separation of culture from nature, and elevation of the former to moral predominance. Such [[anthropocentrism]] is identified in the tragic conception of a hero whose moral struggles are more important than mere biological survival, whereas the science of animal ethology, Meeker asserts, shows that a "comic mode" of muddling through and "making love not war" has superior ecological value. In the later, "second wave" ecocriticism, Meeker's adoption of an ecophilosophical position with apparent scientific sanction as a measure of literary value tended to prevail over Williams's ideological and historical critique of the shifts in a literary genre's representation of nature.

As Glotfelty noted in ''The Ecocriticism Reader'', "One indication of the disunity of the early efforts is that these critics rarely cited one another's work; they didn't know that it existed...Each was a single voice howling in the wilderness."&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ecocriticism—unlike feminist and Marxist criticisms—failed to crystallize into a coherent movement in the late 1970s, and indeed only did so in the USA in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the mid-1980s, scholars began to work collectively to establish ecocritism as a genre, primarily through the work of the [[Western Literature Association]] in which the revaluation of nature writing as a non-fictional literary genre could function. In 1990, at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], Glotfelty became the first person to hold an academic position as a professor of Literature and the Environment, and UNR has retained the position it established at that time as the intellectual home of ecocriticism even as ASLE has burgeoned into an organization with thousands of members in the US alone. From the late 1990s, new branches of ASLE and affiliated organizations were started in the UK, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand (ASLEC-ANZ), India (OSLE-India), Taiwan, Canada and Europe.

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.5|"The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire. Hers is the head upon which all "the ends of the world are come," and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed! All the thoughts and experience of the world have etched and moulded there, in that which they have of power to refine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias. She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants: and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern thought has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the modern idea." The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' described by [[Walter Pater]]]]

'''Ekphrasis''' or '''ecphrasis''',  comes from the Greek for the description of a work of art produced as a rhetorical exercise,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chambers Dictionary'', Chambers Harrap, Edinburgh 1993 {{ISBN|0-550-10255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in the adjectival form '''ekphrastic''', is a vivid, often dramatic, verbal description of a [[Visual arts|visual work of art]], either real or imagined. In [[Classical antiquity|ancient times]], it referred to a description of any thing, person, or [[experience]]. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐκ ''ek'' and φράσις ''phrásis'', 'out' and 'speak' respectively, and the verb ἐκφράζειν ''ekphrázein'', "to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name".

According to the [[Poetry Foundation]], "an ekphrastic poem is a vivid description of a scene or, more commonly, a work of art."&lt;ref&gt;The Poetry Foundation, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/glossary-term/ekphrasis Glossary Terms: Ekphrasis] (accessed 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, an ekphrastic poem is a poem inspired or stimulated by a work of art.

Ekphrasis has been considered generally to be a [[rhetorical device]] in which one medium of [[art]] tries to relate to another medium by defining and describing its [[essence]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and in doing so, relate more directly to the audience, through its illuminative liveliness.
A descriptive work of [[prose]] or [[poetry]], a [[film]], or even a [[photograph]] may thus highlight through its ''rhetorical'' vividness what is happening, or what is shown in, say, any of the [[visual art]]s, and in doing so, may enhance the original art and so take on a life of its own through its brilliant description. One example is a painting of a sculpture: the painting is "telling the story of" the sculpture, and so becoming a storyteller, as well as a story (work of art) itself. Virtually any type of [[artistic media|artistic medium]] may be the actor of, or subject of ekphrasis. One may not always be able, for example, to make an accurate sculpture of a book to retell the story in an authentic way; yet if it's the spirit of the book that we are more concerned about, it certainly can be conveyed by virtually any medium and thereby enhance the artistic impact of the original book through [[synergy]].

In this way, a painting may represent a sculpture, and vice versa; a poem portray a picture; a sculpture depict a heroine of a novel; in fact, given the right circumstances, any art may describe any other art, especially if a ''rhetorical element'', standing for the sentiments of the artist when she/he created her/his work, is present. For instance, the distorted faces in a crowd in a painting depicting an original work of art, a sullen countenance on the face of a sculpture representing a historical figure, or a film showing particularly dark aspects of neo-Gothic architecture, are all examples of ekphrasis.

== History ==

=== Plato's forms, the beginning of ekphrasis ===
In the ''Republic'', Book X, Plato discusses [[substantial form|forms]] by using real things, such as a [[bed]], for example, and calls each way a bed has been made, a "bedness". He commences with the original form of a bed, one of a variety of ways a bed may have been constructed by a craftsman and compares that form with an ideal form of a bed, of a perfect [[archetype]] or image in the form of which beds ought to be made, in short, the [[epitome]] of bedness.

In his analogy, one bedness form shares its own bedness – with all its shortcomings – with that of the ideal form, or template. A third bedness, too, may share the ideal form. He continues with the fourth form also containing elements of the ideal template or archetype which in this way remains an ever-present and invisible ideal version with which the craftsman compares his work. As bedness after bedness shares the ideal form and template of all creation of beds, and each bedness is associated with another ad infinitum, it is called an "infinite regress of forms".

=== From form to ekphrasis ===
It was this epitome, this template of the ideal form, that a craftsman or later an artist would try to reconstruct in his attempt to achieve perfection in his work, that was to manifest itself in ekphrasis at a later stage.

Artists began to use their own literary and artistic [[genre]] of art to work and reflect on another art to illuminate what the eye might not see in the original, to elevate it and possibly even surpass it.

=== Plato and Aristotle ===
For [[Plato]] (and [[Aristotle]]), it is not so much the form of each bed that defines ''bedness'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~jjacobs1/utpictura/1.htm|title=Ecphrasis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[mimesis|mimetic]] stages at which beds may be viewed that defines ''bedness.'' 
# a bed as a physical entity is a mere form of bed
# any view from whichever perspective, be it a side elevation, a full panoramic view from above, or looking at a bed end-on is at a second remove
# a full picture, characterising the whole bed is at a third remove
# ekphrasis of a bed in another art form is at a fourth remove

=== Socrates and Phaedrus ===
In another instance, [[Socrates]] talks about ekphrasis to [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] thus:&lt;br /&gt;
"You know, Phaedrus, that is the strange thing about writing,
which makes it truly correspond to painting.&lt;br /&gt;
The painter's products stand before us as though they were alive,&lt;br /&gt;
but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the same with written words; they seem to talk&lt;br /&gt;
to you as if they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything&lt;br /&gt;
about what they say, from a desire to be instructed,&lt;br /&gt;
they go on telling you just the same thing forever".&lt;ref&gt;Plato: ''Phaedrus'' 275d&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genre ==

=== In literature ===

The fullest example of ekphrasis in antiquity can be found in [[Philostratus III|Philostratus of Lemnos]]' ''Eikones'' which describes 64 pictures in a Neapolitan villa.  Ekphrasis is described in [[Aelius Festus Aphthonius|Aphthonius]]' ''[[Progymnasmata]]'', his [[textbook]] of [[style guide|style]], and later classical literary and rhetorical textbooks, and with other classical literary techniques was keenly revived in the Renaissance.

In the Middle Ages, ekphrasis was less often practiced, especially as regards real objects, and historians of [[medieval art]] have complained that the accounts of monastic chronicles recording now vanished art concentrate on objects made from valuable materials or with the status of [[relic]]s, and rarely give more than the cost and weight of objects, and perhaps a mention of the subject matter of the [[iconography]].

The [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods made much use of ekphrasis. In Renaissance Italy, Canto 33 of [[Ariosto]]'s ''Orlando Furioso'' describes a picture gallery created by Merlin. In Spain, [[Lope de Vega]] often used allusions and descriptions of Italian art in his plays, and included the painter [[Titian]] as one of his characters. [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] also incorporated works of art in dramas such as ''The Painter of his Dishonor''. [[Cervantes]], who spent his youth in Italy, utilized many Renaissance frescoes and paintings in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and many of his other works. In England, [[Shakespeare]] briefly describes a group of erotic paintings in [[Cymbeline]], but his most extended exercise is a 200-line description of the Greek army before Troy in [[The Rape of Lucrece]]. Ekphrasis seems to have been less common in France during these periods.

Instances of ekphrasis in [[19th century literature]] can be found in the works of such influential figures as Spanish novelist [[Benito Pérez Galdós]], French poet, painter and novelist [[Théophile Gautier]], Norwegian playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]], and Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].

[[Herman Melville|Herman Melville's]] ''[[Moby Dick]], or The Whale'' features an intense use of ekphrasis as a stylistic manifesto of the book in which it appears. In the chapter "The Spouter Inn", a painting hanging on the wall of a whaler's inn is described as irreconcilably unclear, overscrawled with smoke and defacements. The narrator, so-called Ishmael, describes how this painting can be both lacking any definition and still provoking in the viewer dozens of distinct possible understandings, until the great mass of interpretations resolves into a Whale, which grounds all the interpretations while containing them, an indication of how Melville sees his own book unfolding around this chapter.

In Pérez Galdós's ''Our Friend Manso'' (1882), the narrator describes two paintings by [[Théodore Géricault]] to point to the shipwreck of ideals; while in  ''La incógnita'' (1889), there are many allusions and descriptions of Italian art, including references to [[Botticelli]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Masaccio]], [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], etc.

In [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s 1888 work ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'', the first act begins with the description of a painting of a mermaid dying on the shore and is followed by a description of a sculpture that depicts a woman having a nightmare of an ex-lover returning to her.  Both works of art can be interpreted as having much importance in the overall meaning of the play as protagonist Ellida Wangel both yearns for her lost youth spent on an island out at sea and is later in the play visited by a lover she thought dead.  Furthermore, as an interesting example of the back-and-forth dynamic that exists between literary ekphrasis and art, in 1896 (eight years after the play was written) Norwegian painter [[Edvard Munch]] painted an image similar to the one described by Ibsen in a painting he entitled (unsurprisingly enough) ''Lady from the Sea''.  Ibsen's last work [[When We Dead Awaken]] also contains examples of ekphrasis as the play's protagonist, Arnold Rubek, is a sculptor who several times throughout the play describes his masterpiece "Resurrection Day" at length and in the many different forms the sculpture took throughout the stages of its creation.  Once again the evolution of the sculpture as described in the play can be read as a reflection on the transformation undergone by Rubek himself and even as a statement on the progression Ibsen's own plays took as many scholars have read this final play (stated by Ibsen himself to be an 'epilogue') as the playwright's reflection on his own work as an artist.

The Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] employed ekphrasis most notably in his novel ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]''.  In this novel, the protagonist, Prince Myshkin, sees a painting of a dead Christ in the house of Rogozhin that has a profound effect on him.  Later in the novel, another character, Hippolite, describes the painting at much length depicting the image of Christ as one of brutal realism that lacks any beauty or sense of the divine.  Rogozhin, who is himself the owner of the painting, at one moment says that the painting has the power to take away a man's faith, a comment that Dostoyevsky himself made to his wife Anna upon seeing the actual painting that the painting in the novel is based on, ''[[The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb]]'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]].  The painting was seen shortly before Dostoyevsky began the novel.  Though this is the major instance of ekphrasis in the novel, and the one which has the most thematic importance to the story as a whole, other instances can be spotted when Prince Myshkin sees a painting of Swiss landscape that reminds him of a view he saw while at a sanatorium in Switzerland, and also when he first sees the face of his love interest, Nastasya, in the form of a painted portrait.  At one point in the novel, Nastasya, too, describes a painting of Christ, her own imaginary work that portrays Christ with a child, an image which naturally evokes comparison between the image of the dead Christ.

The Irish aesthete and novelist [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890/1891) tells how Basil Hallward paints a picture of the young man named Dorian Gray. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, who espouses a new hedonism, dedicated to the pursuit of beauty and all pleasures of the senses. Under his sway, Dorian bemoans the fact that his youth will soon fade. He would sell his soul so as to have the portrait age rather than himself. As Dorian engages in a debauched life, the gradual deterioration of the portrait becomes a mirror of his soul. There are repeated instances of notional ekphrasis of the deteriorating figure in the painting throughout the novel, although these are often partial, leaving much of the portrait's imagery to the imagination. The novel forms part of the magic portrait genre. Wilde had previously experimented with employing portraits in his written work, as in [[The Portrait of Mr. W. H.]] (1889).

[[Anthony Powell]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'' begins with an evocation of the painting by [[Poussin]] which [[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|gives the sequence its name]], and contains other passages of ekphrasis, perhaps influenced by the many passages in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]''.

In the 20th century, [[Roger Zelazny]]'s "[[24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai]]" uses an ekphrastic frame, descriptions of [[Hokusai]]'s famous series of woodcuts, as a structural device for his story.

==== Ekphrastic poetry ====
[[File:Angelo monticelli shield-of-achilles.jpg|thumb|This is a design of the Shield of Achilles based on the description in the Iliad. It was completed by Angelo Monticelli c. 1820. This shield represents the art of Ekphrastic poetry Homer used in his writings.]]
Ekphrastic poetry may be encountered as early as the days of [[Homer]] whose [[Iliad]] (Book 18) describes the [[Shield of Achilles]], with how [[Hephaestus]] made it as well as its completed shape.&lt;ref name="writingaboutart"&gt;Munsterberg, Marjorie, Writing About Art: [http://writingaboutart.org/pages/ekphrasis.html Ekphrasis] (retrieved 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Famous later examples include [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] when he describes what [[Aeneas]] sees engraved on the doors of [[Carthage]]'s temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and [[Catullus 64]], which contains an extended ekphrasis of an imaginary coverlet with the story of [[Ariadne]] picked out on it.

Ekphrastic poetry flourished in the [[romanticism|Romantic]] era and again among the [[pre-Raphaelite]] poets. A major poem of the English Romantics – [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]]— provides an example of the artistic potential of ekphrasis. The entire poem is a description of a piece of pottery that the narrator finds immensely evocative. [[Felicia Hemans]] made extensive use of ekphrasis &lt;ref&gt;Grant F. Scott. ''The Fragile Image: Felicia Hemans and Romantic Ekphrasis'' in ''Felicia Hemans. Reimagining Poetry in the Nineteenth Century''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-333-80109-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as did [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], especially in her ''Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures''. [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s "double-works" exemplify the use of the genre by an artist mutually to enhance his visual and literary art. Rossetti also ekphrasised a number of paintings by other artists, generally from the Italian Renaissance, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='For "Our Lady of the Rocks", by Leonardo da Vinci'|url=http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/5-1848.raw.html|website=Rossetti Archive|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of the genre from the nineteenth century include [[Michael Field (author)|Michael Field]]'s 1892 volume ''Sight and Song'', which contains only ekphrastic poetry; [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s poem 'Before the Mirror', which ekphrasises [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s [[Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl]], hinted at only by the poem's subtitle, "Verses Written under a Picture"; and [[Robert Browning]]'s [[My Last Duchess]], which although a [[dramatic monologue]], includes some description by the Duke of the portrait before which he and the listener stand.

Ekphrastic poetry is still commonly practised. Twentieth-century examples include [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s "Archaïscher Torso Apollos",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unix.cc.wmich.edu/~cooneys/poems/gr/Rilke.html|title=Rainer Maria Rilke, Torso of an Archaic Apollo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Shield of Achilles]]'' (1952), a poem by [[W.H. Auden]],&lt;ref name="writingaboutart" /&gt; which brings the tradition back to its start with an ironic retelling of the episode in Homer (see above), where [[Thetis]] finds very different scenes from those she expects. In contrast, his earlier poem ''[[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]]'' describes a particular real and very famous painting ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', thought until recently to be by rather than after [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], which is also described in the poem by [[William Carlos Williams]] ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]''.{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}

=== In, or as, art history ===

Since the types of objects described in classical ekphrases often lack survivors to modern times, art historians have often been tempted to use descriptions in literature as sources for the appearance of actual Greek or Roman art, an approach full of risk. This is because ekphrasis typically contains an element of competition with the art it describes, aiming to demonstrate the superior ability of words to "paint a picture".  Many subjects of ekphrasis are clearly imaginary, for example those of the epics, but with others it remains uncertain the extent to which they were, or were expected to be by early audiences, at all accurate.

This tendency is by no means restricted to classical art history; the evocative but vague mentions of objects in metalwork in ''[[Beowulf]]'' are eventually always mentioned by writers on [[Anglo-Saxon art]], and compared to the treasures of [[Sutton Hoo]] and the [[Staffordshire Hoard]]. The ekphrasic writings of the lawyer turned bishop [[Asterius of Amasea]] (fl. around 400) are often cited by art historians of the period to fill gaps in the surviving artistic record.  The inadequacy of most medieval accounts of art is mentioned above; they generally lack any specific details other than cost and the owner or donor, and hyperbolic but wholly vague praise.

Journalistic art criticism was effectively invented by [[Denis Diderot]] in his long pieces on the works in the [[Paris Salon]], and extended and highly pointed accounts of the major exhibitions of new art became a popular seasonal feature in the journalism of most Western countries.  Since few if any of the works could be illustrated description and evocation was necessary, and the cruelty of descriptions of works disliked became a part of the style.

As [[art history]] began to become an academic subject in the 19th century, exphrasis as [[formal analysis]] of objects was regarded as a vital component of the subject, and by no means all examples lack attractiveness as literature.  Writers on art for a wider audience produced many descriptions with great literary as well as art historical merit; in English [[John Ruskin]], both the most important journalistic critic and popularizer of historic art of his day, and [[Walter Pater]], above all for his famous evocation of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', are among the most notable.  As photography in books or on television allowed audiences a direct visual comparison to the verbal description, the role of ekphrasic commentary on the images was even perhaps increased.

Ekphrasis has also been an influence on art; for example the ekphrasis of the Shield of Achilles in Homer and other classical examples were certainly an inspiration for the elaborately decorated large serving dishes in silver or [[silver-gilt]], crowded with complicated scenes in [[relief]], that were produced in 16th century [[Mannerist]] metalwork.

=== In music ===

There are a number of examples of ekphrasis in music, of which the best known is probably ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a [[suite (music)|suite]] in ten movements (plus a recurring, varied Promenade) composed for [[piano]] by the Russian composer [[Modest Mussorgsky]] in 1874, and then very popular in various arrangements for orchestra. The suite is based on real pictures, although as the exhibition was dispersed, most are now unidentified.

The first movement of ''[[Three Places in New England]]'' by [[Charles Ives]] is an ekphrasis of the [[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]] in Boston, sculpted by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. Ives also wrote a poem inspired by the sculpture as a companion piece to the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mortensen|first=Scott|title=Orchestral Set No. 1: Three Places in New England – Notes|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Ives/WK_OS_1_Three_Places.htm|work=A Charles Ives Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachmaninoff]]'s symphonic poem ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'' is a musical evocation of [[Böcklin]]'s [[Isle of the Dead (painting)|painting of the same name]]. [[King Crimson]]'s song "[[Starless and Bible Black|The Night Watch]]", with lyrics written by [[Richard Palmer-James]], is an ekphrasis on [[Rembrandt]]'s painting ''[[The Night Watch]]''.

=== Notional ekphrasis ===

Notional ekphrasis may describe mental processes such as dreams, thoughts and whimsies of the imagination. It may also be one art describing or depicting another work of art which as yet is still in an inchoate state of creation, in that the work described may still be resting in the imagination of the artist before he has begun his creative work. The expression may also be applied to an art describing the origin of another art, how it came to be made and the circumstances of its being created. Finally it may describe an entirely imaginary and non-existing work of art, as though it were factual and existed in reality.

== In ancient literature ==


=== Greek literature ===

==== ''The Iliad'' ====

The [[shield of Achilles]] is described by Homer in a famous example of ekphrastic poetry, used to depict events that have occurred in the past and events that will occur in the future. The shield contains images representative of the [[Cosmos]] and the inevitable fate of the city of Troy. The shield of Achilles features the following nine depictions:
# The Earth, Sea, Sky, Moon and the Cosmos (484–89)
# Two cities – one where a wedding and a trial are taking place, and one that is considered to be Troy, due to the battle occurring inside the city (509–40)
# A field that is being ploughed (541–49)
# The home of a King where the harvest is being reaped (550–60)
# A vineyard that is being harvested (561–72)
# A herd of cattle that is being attacked by two lions, while the Herdsman and his dogs try to scare the lions off the prize bull (573–86)
# A sheep farm (587–89)
# A scene with young men and women dancing (590–606)
# The mighty Ocean as it encircles the shield (607–609)

Although not written as elaborately as previous examples of ekphrastic poetry, from lines 609–614 the belt of [[Heracles|Herakles]] is described as having "marvelous works,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Odyssey of Homer|last=Lattimore|first=Richmond|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|year=1967|location=New York|at=lines 609–614}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as animals with piercing eyes and hogs in a grove of trees. It also contains multiple images of battles and occurrences of manslaughter. In ''the Odyssey,'' there is also a scene where Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, must prove to his wife, Penelope, that he has proof that Odysseus is still alive. She asks him about the clothes Odysseus was wearing during the time when the beggar claims he hosted Odysseus. Homer uses this opportunity to implement more ekphrastic imagery by describing the golden brooch of Odysseus, which depicts a hound strangling a fawn that it captured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''The Argonautika'' ====

The Cloak of Jason is another example of ekphrastic poetry. In ''[[Argonautica|The Argonautika]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodios|first1=Apollonios|title=The Argonautika|at=lines 720–763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason's cloak has seven events embroidered into it:

# The forging of Zeus' thunderbolts by the Cyclops (730-734)
# The building of Thebes by the sons of Antiope (735–741)
# Aphrodite with the shield of Ares (742–745)
# The battle between Teleboans and the Sons of Electryon (746–751)
# Pelops winning Hippodameia (752–758)
# Apollo punishing Tityos (759–762)
# Phrixus and the Ram (763–765)

The description of the cloak provides many examples of ekphrasis, and not only is modeled off of Homer's writing, but alludes to several occurrences in Homer's epics ''the Iliad'' and ''the Odyssey''. Jason's cloak can be examined in many ways. The way the cloak's events are described is similar to the catalogue of Women that Odysseus encounters on his trip to the Underworld.&lt;ref name="University of Berkeley, California"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulloch|first1=Anthony|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=www.academia.edu|page=59|url=https://www.academia.edu/367874/Jasons_Cloak|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloak and its depicted events lend more to the story than a simple description; in true ekphrasis fashion it not only compares Jason to future heroes such as Achilles and Odysseus, but also provides a type of foreshadowing. Jason, by donning the cloak, can be seen as a figure who would rather resort to coercion, making him a parallel to Odysseus, who uses schemes and lies to complete his voyage back to Ithaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=H. A.|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association (1974-)|date=1 January 1980|volume=110|pages=263–286|doi=10.2307/284222|jstor=284222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason also bears similarities to Achilles; by donning the cloak, Jason is represented as an Achillean heroic figure due to the comparisons made between his cloak and the shield of Achilles. He is also takes up a spear given to him by Atalanta, not as an afterthought, but due to his heroic nature and the comparison between himself and Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=James|title=The Best of the Argonauts|date=1993|publisher=The University of California Press|page=120|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3d5nb1mh&amp;chunk.id=d0e7664&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jason only wears the cloak while going to meet with Hypsipyle, it foreshadows the changes that Jason will potentially undergo during his adventure. Through the telling of the scenes on the cloak, Apollonios relates the scenes on the cloak as virtues and morals that should be upheld by the Roman people, and that Jason should learn to live by. Such virtues include the piety represented by the Cyclops during the forging of Zeus' thunderbolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=H. A.|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association |date=1 January 1980|volume=110|page=265|doi=10.2307/284222|jstor=284222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reminiscent of the scene in ''the Iliad'' when Thetis goes to see Hephaestus, and requisitions him to create a new set of armor for her son Achilles. Before he began creating the shield and armor, Hephaestus was forging 20 golden tripods for his own hall, and in the scene on Jason's cloak we see the Cyclops performing the last step of creating the thunderbolts for Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=James|title=The Best of the Argonauts|page=122|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3d5nb1mh&amp;chunk.id=d0e7664&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman literature ===

==== ''The Aeneid'' ====

''[[Aeneid|The Aeneid]]'' is an epic that was written by Virgil during the reign of Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome. While the epic itself mimics Homer's works, it can be seen as propaganda for Augustus and the new Roman empire.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=R. D.|date=1981|title=The Shield of Aeneas|jstor=41591854|journal=Vergilius|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield of Aeneas is described in book eight, from lines 629–719.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This shield was given to him by his mother, Venus, after she asked her husband Vulcan to create it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Aeneid of Virgil|last=Ahl|first=Frederick|publisher=Oxford World's Classics|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-923195-9|location=Great Britain|at=lines 372–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scene is almost identical to Thetis, the mother of Achilles, asking Hephaestus to create her son new weapons and armor for the battle of Troy.

The difference in the descriptions of the two shields are easily discernible; the shield of Achilles depicts many subjects, whereas the shield made for Aeneas depicts the future that Rome will have, containing propaganda in favor of the Emperor Augustus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Much like other ekphrastic poetry, it depicts a clear catalogue of events:

# The She Wolf and the suckling Romulus and Remus (629–634)
# The Rape of the Sabine Women (635–639)
# Mettius pulled apart by horses (640–645)
# Invasion of Lars Parsona (646–651)
# Manlius guarding the capitol (652–654)
# Gauls invading Rome (655–665)
# Tartarus with Cato and Catiline (666–670)
# The Sea around the width of the shield (671–674)
# The Battle of Actium (675–677)
# Augustus and Agrippa (678–684)
# Antony and Cleopatra (685–695)
# Triumph (696–719)

There is speculation as to why Virgil depicted certain events, while completely avoiding others such as Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Virgil clearly outlined the shield chronologically, but scholars argue that the events on the shield are meant to reflect certain Roman values that would have been of high importance to the Roman people and to the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://classicsvic.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/penwillvol18.pdf|title=Reading Aeneas' Shield|last=Penwill|first=John|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values may include ''virtus, clementia, iustitia'', and ''pietas'', which were the values inscribed on a shield given to Augustus by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=S. J.|date=November 1997|title=The Survival and Supremacy of Rome: The Unity of the Shield of Aeneas|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8428342&amp;fileId=S0075435800058081|journal=The Journal of Roman Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instance of ekphrasitc poetry maybe Virgil's attempt to relate more of his work to Augustus.

Earlier in the epic, when Aeneas travels to Carthage, he sees the temple of the city, and on it are great works of art that are described by the poet using the ekphrastic style. Like the other occurrences of ekphrasis, these works of art describe multiple events. Out of these, there are eight images related to the Trojan War:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Depictions of Agamemnon and Menelaus, Priam and Achilles (459)
# Greeks running from Trojan soldiers (468)
# The sacking of the tents of Rhesus and the Thracians, and their deaths by Diomedes (468–472)
# Troilus being thrown from his Chariot as he flees from Achilles (473–478)
# The women of Troy in lamentation, praying to the gods to help them (479–482)
# Achilles selling Hektor's body (483–487)
# Priam begging for the return of his son, with the Trojan commanders nearby (483–488)
# Penthesilea the Amazon, and her fighters (489–493)

==== ''The Metamorphoses'' ====

There are several examples of ekphrasis in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]''; one in which Phaeton journeys to the temple of the sun to meet his father Phoebus. When Phaeton gazes upon the temple of the sun, he sees the following carvings:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metamorphoses|last=Martin|first=Charles|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The seas that circle the Earth, the surrounding lands, and the sky (8–9)
# The gods of the sea and the Nymphs (10–19)
# Scenes of men, beasts, and local gods (20–21)
# Twelve figures of the Zodiac, six on each side of the door to the temple (22–23)

== Other aspects ==

=== Educational value of using ekphrasis in teaching literature ===

The rationale behind using examples of ekphrasis to teach literature is that once the connection between a poem and a painting are recognized for example, the student's emotional and intellectual engagement with the literary text is extended to new dimensions. The literary text takes on new meaning and there is more to respond to because another art form is being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Joseph O'Beirne, and Lucy Floyd Morcock Milner. Bridging English. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice, 1999. pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as the material taught has both a visual and linguistic basis new connections of understanding are formed in the student's brain thus creating a stronger foundation for understanding, remembrance and internalization. Using ekphrasis to teach literature can be done through the use of [[higher order thinking]] skills such as distinguishing different perspectives, interpreting, inferring, sequencing, compare and contrast and evaluating.

The program began in January 1987 when the Hillsborough County [[Commissioner]]s approved ordinance with $21 million in acquisition funding over four years. In 1990 voters approved a 20-year bond issuance for additional land purchases. Again in November 2008 another bond program was approved by voters for up to $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/parks/resources/publications/elapp.pdf ELAPP] Resources publications Hillsborough County&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20 years up to 2008, more than 50 land purchases had been made including several in the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]]. Approximately $200 million had been spent with an estimated 38 percent coming from outside sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplanningcommission.org/newsletter/year/issues-in-2008/fall-2008-partners-in-planning/elapp-plays-key-role-in-protecting-natural-resources-in-hillsborough-county.html ELAPP plays key role in protecting natural resources in Hillsborough County] issues in 2008 Hillsborough Planning Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">An '''evolutionarily significant unit''' ('''ESU''') is a population of [[organism]]s that is considered distinct for purposes of [[Conservation ethic|conservation]]. Delineating ESUs is important when considering conservation action. 
This term can apply to any [[species]], [[subspecies]], [[Race (biology)|geographic race]], or [[population]]. Often the term "species" is used rather than ESU, even when an ESU is more technically considered a subspecies or variety rather than a [[species|biological species]] proper. In [[Marine biology|marine animals]] the term "stock" is often used as well.

==Definition==
Definitions of an ESU generally{{weasel-inline|date=December 2016}} include at least one of the following criteria:&lt;ref name="Conner"&gt;Jeffrey Conner, Daniel Hartl. ''A Primer of Ecological Genetics''. 2004, {{ISBN|978-0878932023}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Genetic differentiation at [[Genetic_monitoring#Types|neutral markers]] among related ESUs caused by [[Population bottleneck|past restriction of gene flow]], or
# Locally adapted [[Phenotype|phenotypic traits]] caused by differences in [[Natural selection|selection]].

Criterion 2 considers the gene flow between populations, measured by [[fixation index|F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A high degree of differentiation between two populations among genes that provide no adaptive advantage to either population (known as ''neutral markers'') implies a lack of gene flow, showing that [[Genetic drift|random drift]] has occurred in isolation from other populations. Very few migrants per generation are needed to prevent strong differentiation of neutral markers. Even a single migrant per generation may be enough for neutral markers to show gene flow between populations, making it difficult to differentiate the populations through neutral markers.

Criterion 3 does not consider neutral genetic markers, instead looking at locally adapted traits of the population. Local adaptations may be present even with some gene flow from other populations, and even when there is little differentiation at neutral markers among ESUs. Reciprocal transplantation experiments are necessary to test for genetic differentiation for phenotypic traits, and differences in selection gradients across habitats. Such experiments are generally more difficult than the fixation index tests of criterion 2, and may be impossible for very rare or [[endangered species]].

For example, [[Hemileuca maia|Cryan's buckmoth]] (''Hemileuca maia'') feeds only on the herb ''[[Menyanthes trifoliata]]'', commonly known as buckbean, and while indistinguishable morphologically from related buckmoths, and not differentiated at the genetic markers tested, the moth is highly adapted to its host plant, having 100% survivorship on ''Menyanthes'', while close genetic relatives all died when reared on the plant.&lt;ref name=Buckmoth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=John|first1=Legge|last2=Richard|first2=Roush|last3=Rob|first3=Desalle|last4=Alfried|first4=Vogler|last5=Bernie|first5=May|title=Genetic Criteria for Establishing Evolutionarily Significant Units in Cryan's Buckmoth|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10010085.x |journal=Conservation Biology|date=February 1996|volume=10|issue=1|pages=85–98|ref=http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/gvl/Conservation_Genetics_Fund/Publications_4_files/1996%20-%20Cryan%27s%20buckmoth.pdf}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this case gene flow was sufficient to reduce differentiation at neutral markers, but did not prevent local [[host adaptation]].

Both criteria 2 and 3 have the problem that there is no clear dichotomy between ESU and not-ESU, as genetic differentiation between populations forms a continuum, prompting a contention for consideration of both genetic and ecological processes in identifying ESUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Crandall | display-authors=etal   | year=2000 | title=Considering evolutionary processes in conservation biology | journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume=15 | issue=| pages=290–295 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)01876-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the different approaches to designating ESUs each have their benefits, and the need and form of management prescriptions may vary across contexts, some support an "adaptive" approach to identification of ESUs, for instance suggesting consideration of facets from numerous designation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fraser | first1= | last2=Bernatchez | year=2001 | title=Adaptive evolutionary conservation: towards a unified concept for defining conservation units | journal=Molecular Ecology | volume=10 | issue=| pages=2741–2752 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.2001.t01-1-01411.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''famine''' is a widespread scarcity of [[food]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=James |jstor=30008004 |title=Scarcity and Poor Relief in Eighteenth-Century Ireland: The Subsistence Crisis of 1782–4 |journal=Irish Historical Studiesvolume=28 |date=May 1992 |pages=38–62 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by several factors including war, inflation, [[crop failure]], [[Demographic trap|population imbalance]], or government policies. This phenomenon is usually accompanied or followed by regional [[malnutrition]], [[starvation]], [[epidemic]], and increased [[death|mortality]]. Every inhabited continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history. In the 19th and 20th century, it was generally Southeast and South Asia, as well as Eastern and Central Europe that suffered the most deaths from famine. The numbers dying from famine began to fall sharply from the 2000s.

Some countries, particularly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], continue to have extreme cases of famine. Since 2010, Africa has been the most affected continent in the world. As of 2017, the [[United Nations]] has warned some 20 million are at risk in South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and [[Famine in Yemen|Yemen]]. Agricultural conditions have been fluctuating more and more due to variations in weather, and the distribution of food has been affected by conflict. Most programmes now direct their aid towards Africa.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Definitions==
According to the [[United Nations]] humanitarian criteria, even if there are food shortages with large numbers of people lacking nutrition, a famine is declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. The criteria are:
*At least 20% of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope
*The prevalence of acute malnutrition in children exceeds 30%
*The death rate exceeds two persons per 10,000 persons per day
The declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or member states, but serves to focus global attention on the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39025927|title=South Sudan declares famine in Unity State|date=20 February 2017|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|List of famines}}
The cyclical occurrence of famine has been a mainstay of societies engaged in [[subsistence agriculture]] since the dawn of agriculture itself. The frequency and intensity of famine has fluctuated throughout history, depending on changes in food demand, such as  [[population growth]], and supply-side shifts caused by changing [[climate|climatic]] conditions. Famine was first eliminated in Holland and England during the 17th century, due to the [[commercialization]] of agriculture and the implementation of improved techniques to increase [[crop yield]]s.

===Decline of famine===
In the 16th and 17th century, the feudal system began to break down, and more prosperous farmers began to [[enclosure|enclose]] their own land and improve their yields to sell the surplus crops for a profit. These [[capitalism|capitalist]] landowners paid their labourers with [[wage labour|money]], thereby increasing the commercialization of rural society. In the emerging competitive labour market, better techniques for the improvement of labour productivity were increasingly valued and rewarded. It was in the farmer's interest to produce as much as possible on their land in order to sell it to areas that demanded that product. They produced guaranteed [[surplus value|surpluses]] of their crop every year if they could.

Subsistence peasants were also increasingly forced to commercialize their activities because of increasing [[tax]]es. Taxes that had to be paid to central governments in money forced the peasants to produce crops to sell. Sometimes they produced [[industrial crop]]s, but they would find ways to increase their production in order to meet both their subsistence requirements as well as their tax obligations. Peasants also used the new money to purchase manufactured goods. The agricultural and social developments encouraging increased food production were gradually taking place throughout the 16th century, but took off in the early 17th century.

By the 1590s, these trends were sufficiently developed in the rich and commercialized province of [[Holland]] to allow its population to withstand a general outbreak of famine in Western Europe at that time. By that time, the [[Netherlands]] had one of the most commercialized agricultural systems in Europe. They grew many industrial crops such as [[flax]], [[hemp]] and [[hops]]. Agriculture became increasingly specialized and efficient. The efficiency of Dutch agriculture allowed for much more rapid urbanization in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries than anywhere else in Europe. As a result, productivity and wealth increased, allowing the Netherlands to maintain a steady food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bieleman |first=Jan |url=http://www.neha.nl/publications/eshn-4/08-bieleman.pdf |title=Dutch Agriculture in the Golden Age, 1570–1660 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401022510/http://www.neha.nl/publications/eshn-4/08-bieleman.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1650, English agriculture had also become commercialized on a much wider scale. The last peace-time famine in England was in 1623–24. There were still periods of hunger, as in the Netherlands, but no more famines ever occurred. Common areas for pasture were [[enclosure|enclosed]] for private use and large scale, efficient farms were consolidated. Other technical developments included the draining of marshes, more efficient field use patterns, and the wider introduction of industrial crops. These agricultural developments led to wider prosperity in England and increasing urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtler |first=W.H.R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yomy8cKVOtkC |title=A Short History of English Agriculture |publisher=Etusevi Company |chapter=ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 17th century, English agriculture was the most productive in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=William E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59ITUOLbVkoC |title=The Scientific Revolution: An Encyclopedia |year=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both England and the Netherlands, the population stabilized between 1650 and 1750, the same time period in which the sweeping changes to agriculture occurred. Famine still occurred in other parts of [[Europe]], however. In [[East Europe]], famines occurred as late as the twentieth century.

===Attempts at famine alleviation===
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Skibbereen]], Ireland, during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], 1847 illustration by [[James Mahony]] for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]

Because of the severity of famine, it was a chief concern for governments and other authorities. In pre-industrial Europe, preventing famine, and ensuring timely food supplies, was one of the chief concerns of many governments, although they were severely limited in their options due to limited levels of external trade and an infrastructure and bureaucracy generally too rudimentary to effect real relief. Most governments were concerned by famine because it could lead to [[revolt]] and other forms of social disruption.

By the mid-19th century and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], it became possible for governments to alleviate the effects of famine through [[price controls]], large scale importation of food products from foreign markets, stockpiling, [[rationing]], regulation of production and [[charity (practice)|charity]]. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of 1845]] in Ireland was one of the first famines to feature such intervention, although the government response was often lacklustre. The initial response of the British government to the early phase of the famine was "prompt and relatively successful," according to [[F. S. L. Lyons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ireland since the famine |first=Francis Stewart Leland |last=Lyons |publisher=Fontana |year=1973 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted by widespread crop failure in the autumn of 1845, Prime Minister [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] purchased £100,000 worth of maize and [[cornmeal]] secretly from America. [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers &amp; Co]] initially acted as purchasing agents for the Prime Minister. The government hoped that they would not "stifle private enterprise" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.{{sfn|Kinealy|1995|p=38}} The maize corn was then re-sold for a penny a pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Disraeli |last=Blake |first=Robert |lccn=67011837 |series=University paperbacks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpRnAAAAMAAJ |year=1967 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Peel moved to repeal the [[Corn Laws]], [[tariff]]s on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high. The famine situation worsened during 1846 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel's ministry.{{sfn|Blake|1967|pp=221–41}} In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Great Hunger |first=Cecil |last=Woodham-Smith |year=1962 |pages=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Famine in India Natives Waiting for Relief in Bangalore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|People waiting for famine relief in [[Bangalore]] From the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 1877]]

Despite this promising start, the measures undertaken by Peel's successor, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], proved comparatively "inadequate" as the crisis deepened. Russell's ministry introduced public works projects, which by December 1846 employed some half million Irish and proved impossible to administer. The government was influenced by a [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed. It halted government food and relief works, and turned to a mixture of "indoor" and "outdoor" direct relief; the former administered in [[workhouse]]s through the [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], the latter through [[soup kitchen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ireland: History of a Nation |first=David |last=Ross |year=2002 |publisher=New Lanark: Geddes &amp; Grosset |isbn=1-84205-164-4 |pages=224, 311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic attempt at creating the necessary regulatory framework for dealing with famine was developed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1880s. In order to comprehensively address the issue of famine, the British created an Indian Famine commission to recommend steps that the government would be required to take in the event of a famine.&lt;ref name="L.

The famine code was also one of the first attempts to scientifically predict famine in order to mitigate its effects. These were finally passed into law in 1883 under [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]].

The [[Indian Famine Codes|Code]] introduced the first [[famine scale]]: three levels of [[food insecurity]] were defined: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine.  "Scarcity" was defined as three successive years of [[crop failure]], [[crop yield]]s of one-third or one-half normal, and large populations in distress.

===20th century===
During the 20th century, an estimated 70 million people died from [[List of famines|famines across the world]], of whom an estimated 30 million died during the [[Three Years of Natural Disasters|famine of 1958–61]] in [[China]].&lt;ref name=IDSWorkingPaper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/wp105.pdf|

A few of the great famines of the late 20th century were: the [[Biafra|Biafran famine]] in the 1960s, the [[Khmer Rouge]]-caused famine in [[Cambodia]] in the 1970s, the [[North Korea]]n [[North Korean famine|famine of the 1990s]] and the [[Ethiopia]]n [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|famine of 1983–85]].

The latter event was reported on television reports around the world, carrying footage of starving [[Ethiopia]]ns whose plight was centered around a feeding station near the town of [[Korem]]. This stimulated the first mass movements to end famine across the world.

[[BBC]] newsreader [[Michael Buerk]] gave moving commentary of the tragedy on 23 October 1984, which he described as a "biblical famine". This prompted the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] single, which was organized by [[Bob Geldof]] and featured more than 20 pop stars. The [[Live Aid]] concerts in [[London]] and [[Philadelphia]] raised even more funds for the cause. Hundreds of thousands of people died within one year as a result of the famine, but the publicity Live Aid generated encouraged Western nations to make available enough surplus grain to end the immediate hunger crisis in Africa.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/live-aid-concert|title=Live Aid concert - Jul 13, 1985 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Until 2017, worldwide deaths from famine had been falling dramatically. The [[World Peace Foundation]] reported that from the 1870s to the 1970s, great famines killed an average of 928,000 people a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/famine/|title=Famine Trends Dataset, Tables and Graphs – World Peace Foundation|website=sites.tufts.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, annual deaths had dropped to an average of 75,000, less than 10% of what they had been until the 1970s. That reduction was achieved despite the approximately 150,000 lives lost in the [[2011 East Africa drought|2011 Somalia famine]]. Yet in 2017, the [[UN]] officially declared famine had returned to Africa, with about 20 million people at risk of death from starvation in Nigeria, in [[2017 South Sudan famine|South Sudan]], in [[Famine in Yemen|Yemen]], and in [[2017 Somalian drought|Somalia]].&lt;ref name = "democracyFT"/&gt;

{{category see also|Famines in Africa}}
;Early history
In the mid-22nd century BC, a sudden and short-lived climatic change that caused reduced rainfall resulted in several decades of drought in [[Upper Egypt]]. The resulting famine and civil strife is believed to have been a major cause of the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom]].
An account from the [[First Intermediate Period]] states, "All of Upper Egypt was dying of hunger and people were eating their children." In 1680s, famine extended across the entire [[Sahel]], and in 1738 half the population of [[Timbuktu]] died of famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html |title=Len Milich: Anthropogenic Desertification vs 'Natural' Climate Trends |website=Ag.arizona.edu |date=10 August 1997 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211081648/http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], between 1687 and 1731, there were six famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=The Ottoman Empire, 1700–1922 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-83910-6 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famine that afflicted Egypt in 1784 cost it roughly one-sixth of its population.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061121232204.htm Icelandic Volcano Caused Historic Famine In Egypt, Study Shows]".

According to John Iliffe, "Portuguese records of [[Angola]] from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys."&lt;ref&gt;John Iliffe (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent''].

The first documentation of weather in West-Central Africa occurs around the mid-16th to 17th centuries in areas such as Luanda Kongo, however, not much data was recorded on the issues of weather and disease except for a few notable documents. The only records obtained are of violence between Portuguese and Africans during the [[Battle of Mbilwa]] in 1665. In these documents the Portuguese wrote of African raids on Portuguese merchants solely for food, giving clear signs of famine. Additionally, instances of [[cannibalism]] by the African Jaga were also more prevalent during this time frame, indicating an extreme deprivation of a primary food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Joseph C. |title=The Significance of Drought, Disease and Famine in the Agriculturally Marginal Zones of West-Central Africa |journal=Journal of African History |date=January 1982 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=17–61 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=3243140&amp;jid=AFH&amp;volumeId=23&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=3243132 |accessdate=11 November 2011 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700020235 |pmid=11632226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable period of famine occurred around the turn of the 20th century in the [[Congo Free State]]. In forming this state, Leopold used mass labor camps to finance his empire.&lt;ref name="Masci 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masci |first=David |title=Famine in Africa |journal=CQ Researcher |date=8 November 2002 |volume=12 |issue=39 |url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2002110800#top |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period resulted in the death of up to 10 million Congolese from brutality, disease and famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dummett |first=Mark |title=King Leopold's Legacy of DR Congo Violence |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3516965.stm |accessdate=27 November 2011 |date=24 February 2004 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some colonial "pacification" efforts often caused severe famine, notably with the repression of the Maji Maji revolt in [[Tanganyika]] in 1906. The introduction of cash crops such as [[cotton]], and forcible measures to impel farmers to grow these crops, sometimes impoverished the peasantry in many areas, such as northern Nigeria, contributing to greater vulnerability to famine when severe drought struck in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papaioannou |first=Kostadis J. |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629815000578 |title=Climate shocks and conflict: Evidence from colonial Nigeria |journal=Political Geography |volume=50 |date=January 2016 |pages=33–47 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2015.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale famine occurred in [[Ethiopia]] in 1888 and succeeding years, as the [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest epizootic]], introduced into [[Eritrea]] by infected cattle, spread southwards reaching ultimately as far as [[South Africa]]. In Ethiopia it was estimated that as much as 90 percent of the national herd died, rendering rich farmers and herders destitute overnight. This coincided with [[drought]] associated with an el Nino oscillation, human epidemics of [[smallpox]], and in several countries, intense [[war]]. The [[Famines in Ethiopia|Ethiopian Great famine]] that afflicted Ethiopia from 1888 to 1892 cost it roughly one-third of its population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/ijas/ijasno2/georgis.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911102037/http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/ijas/ijasno2/georgis.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sudan]] the year 1888 is remembered as the worst famine in history, on account of these factors and also the exactions imposed by the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist state]].

Records compiled for the [[Himba people|Himba]] recall two droughts from 1910 to 1917. They were recorded by the Himba through a method of [[oral tradition]]. From 1910 to 1911 the Himba described the drought as "drought of the omutati seed" also called ''omangowi'', which means the fruit of an unidentified vine that people ate during the time period. From 1914 to 1916 droughts brought ''katur' ombanda'' or ''kari' ombanda'' which means "the time of eating clothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Joseph C. |title=The Significance of Drought, Disease and Famine in the Agriculturally Marginal Zones of West-Central Africa |journal=Journal of African History |date=January 1982 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=17–61 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=3243140&amp;jid=AFH&amp;volumeId=23&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=3243132 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700020235 |pmid=11632226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;20th century

For the middle part of the 20th century, agriculturalists, economists and geographers did not consider Africa to be especially famine prone. From 1870 to 2010, 87 per cent of deaths from famine occurred in Asia and Eastern Europe, with only 9.2 per cent in Africa.&lt;ref name = "democracyFT"&gt;{{Cite news

Although the drought was brief the main cause of death in Rwanda was due to Belgian prerogatives to acquisition grain from their colony (Rwanda). The increased grain acquisition was related to WW2. This and the drought caused 300,000 Rwandans to perish.&lt;ref name="Masci 2002"/&gt;

From 1967 to 1969 large scale famine occurred in Biafra and Nigeria due to a [[Nigerian Civil War|government blockade of the Breakaway territory]]. It is estimated that 1.5 million people died of starvation due to this famine. Additionally, drought and other government interference with the food supply caused 500 thousand Africans to perish in Central and West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iliffe |first=John |title=Africans: The History of a Continent |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine recurred in the early 1970s, when [[Ethiopia]] and the west African [[Sahel]] suffered [[Sahel drought|drought and famine]]. The Ethiopian famine of that time was closely linked to the crisis of feudalism in that country, and in due course helped to bring about the downfall of the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. The Sahelian famine was associated with the slowly growing crisis of pastoralism in Africa, which has seen livestock herding decline as a viable way of life over the last two generations.

[[File:Starved girl.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A girl during the [[Nigerian Civil War]] of the late 1960s. Pictures of the famine caused by Nigerian blockade garnered sympathy for the Biafrans worldwide.]]
Famines occurred in [[Sudan]] in the late-1970s and again in 1990 and 1998. The 1980 famine in [[Karamoja]], [[Uganda]] was, in terms of mortality rates, one of the worst in history. 21% of the population died, including 60% of the infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/food/8F091e/8F091E05.htm|title=Food and bulletin volume 9, number 1, march 1987|website=www.unu.edu|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, large scale multilayer drought occurred in the Sudan and Sahelian regions of Africa. This caused famine because even though the Sudanese Government believed there was a surplus of grain, there were local deficits across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=BE |first=Spiers |title=Famine in Africa |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9110094&amp;q=Famine+in+Africa&amp;uid=791203203&amp;setcookie=yes |accessdate=27 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823070354/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9110094&amp;q=Famine+in+Africa&amp;uid=791203203&amp;setcookie=yes |archivedate=23 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1984, television reports describing the Ethiopian famine as "biblical", prompted the [[Live Aid]] concerts in [[London]] and [[Philadelphia]], which raised large sums to alleviate the suffering. A primary cause of the famine (one of the largest seen in the country) is that Ethiopia (and the surrounding Horn) was still recovering from the droughts which occurred in the mid-late 1970s. Compounding this problem was the intermittent fighting due to [[Ethiopian civil war|civil war]], the [[Derg|government]]'s lack of organization in providing relief, and hoarding of supplies to control the population. Ultimately, over 1 million Ethiopians died and over 22 million people suffered due to the prolonged drought, which lasted roughly 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia in Crisis: Famine and Its Aftermath 1984–1988|url=http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia/35.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Somalia became a war zone with no effective government, police, or basic services after the collapse of the dictatorship led by [[Siad Barre]] and the split of power between warlords. This coincided with a massive drought, causing over 300,000 Somalis to perish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masci |first=David |title=Famine In Africa |journal=CQ Researcher |date=8 November 2002 |volume=12 |issue=39 |url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2002110800#top}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Recent years

Since the start of the 21st century, more effective early warning and humanitarian response actions have reduced the number of deaths by famine markedly. That said, many African countries are not self-sufficient in food production, relying on income from [[cash crop]]s to import food. [[Agriculture]] in Africa is susceptible to [[climate|climatic]] fluctuations, especially [[drought]]s which can reduce the amount of food produced locally. Other agricultural problems include [[Soil fertility|soil infertility]], [[land degradation]] and [[erosion]], swarms of [[desert locust]]s, which can destroy whole crops, and livestock diseases. [[Desertification]] is increasingly problematic: the [[Sahara]] reportedly spreads up to {{convert|30|mi|km|0|order=flip}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0801/p01s02-woaf.html |title=Hunger is spreading in Africa |website=CSMonitor.com |date=1 August 2005 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most serious famines have been caused by a combination of drought, misguided economic policies, and conflict. The 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia, for example, was the outcome of all these three factors, made worse by the Communist government's censorship of the emerging crisis. In Sudan at the same date, drought and economic crisis combined with denials of any food shortage by the then-government of President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], to create a crisis that killed perhaps 250,000 people—and helped bring about a popular uprising that overthrew Nimeiry.

Numerous factors make the [[food security]] situation in Africa tenuous, including political instability, armed conflict and [[civil war]], [[political corruption|corruption]] and mismanagement in handling food supplies, and trade policies that harm African agriculture. An example of a famine created by human rights abuses is the [[1998 Sudan famine]]. [[AIDS]] is also having long-term economic effects on agriculture by reducing the available workforce, and is creating new vulnerabilities to famine by overburdening poor households. On the other hand, in the modern history of Africa on quite a few occasions famines acted as a major source of acute political instability.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] ''[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=165&amp;Itemid=70 Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends in Africa]''. Moscow: Russia, 2006.  {{ISBN|5-484-00560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Africa]], if current trends of [[population growth]] and [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] continue, the continent might
be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to [[United Nations University]] (UNU)'s Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.&lt;ref name="news.mongabay.com"/&gt;

Today, famine is most widespread in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], but with exhaustion of food resources, overdrafting of [[groundwater]], wars, internal struggles, and economic failure, famine continues to be a worldwide problem with hundreds of millions of people suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor  |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0724/p01s01-wogi.html |title=Rising food prices curb aid to global poor |date=24 July 2007 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; These famines cause widespread malnutrition and impoverishment. The [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia|famine in Ethiopia]] in the 1980s had an immense death toll, although Asian famines of the 20th century have also produced extensive death tolls. Modern African famines are characterized by widespread destitution and malnutrition, with heightened mortality confined to young children.

;Current initiatives
Against a backdrop of conventional interventions through the state or markets, alternative initiatives have been pioneered to address the problem of food security. One pan-African example is the [[Great Green Wall]]. Another example is the "Community Area-Based Development Approach" to agricultural development ("CABDA"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. Piloted in [[Ethiopia]] in the 1990s it has spread to [[Malawi]], [[Uganda]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Kenya]]. In an analysis of the programme by the [[Overseas Development Institute]], CABDA's focus on individual and community capacity-building is highlighted. This enables farmers to influence and drive their own development through community-run institutions, bringing food security to their household and region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The role of African Unity organization===
The organization of African unity and its role in the African crisis has been interested in the political aspects of the continent, especially the liberation of the occupied parts of it and the elimination of racism. The organization has succeeded in this area but the economic field and development has not succeeded in these fields. African leaders have agreed to waive the role of their organization in the development to the United Nations through the Economic Commission for Africa "ECA".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kout, Bashir.

These events are comparable, though somewhat smaller in scale, to the ecological trigger events of China's vast 19th-century famines.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Etienne Will, ''Bureaucracy and Famine''&lt;/ref&gt; Qing China carried out its relief efforts, which included vast shipments of food, a requirement that the rich open their storehouses to the poor, and price regulation, as part of a state guarantee of subsistence to the peasantry (known as ''ming-sheng'').

When a stressed monarchy shifted from state management and direct shipments of grain to monetary charity in the mid-19th century, the system broke down. Thus the 1867–68 famine under the [[Tongzhi Restoration]] was successfully relieved but the [[Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879|Great North China Famine]] of 1877–78, caused by drought across northern China, was a catastrophe. The province of [[Shanxi]] was substantially depopulated as grains ran out, and desperately starving people stripped forests, fields, and their very houses for food. Estimated mortality is 9.5 to 13 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U8480E/U8480E05.htm Dimensions of need&amp;nbsp;– People and populations at risk].

;Great Leap Forward
The [[Great Chinese Famine|largest famine of the 20th century]], and almost certainly of all time, was the 1958–61 [[Great Leap Forward]] famine in China. The immediate causes of this famine lay in Mao Zedong's ill-fated attempt to transform China from an agricultural nation to an industrial power in one huge leap. Communist Party cadres across China insisted that peasants abandon their farms for collective farms, and begin to produce steel in small foundries, often melting down their farm instruments in the process. Collectivisation undermined incentives for the investment of labor and resources in agriculture; unrealistic plans for decentralized metal production sapped needed labor; unfavorable weather conditions; and communal dining halls encouraged overconsumption of available food.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, G, and Wen, G (1997), "[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Communal%20dining%20and%20the%20Chinese%20Famine%201958-1961&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search Communal dining and the Chinese Famine 1958–1961]"&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the centralized control of information and the intense pressure on party cadres to report only good news—such as [[production quota]]s met or exceeded—that information about the escalating disaster was effectively suppressed. When the leadership did become aware of the scale of the famine, it did little to respond, and continued to ban any discussion of the cataclysm. This blanket suppression of news was so effective that very few Chinese citizens were aware of the scale of the famine, and the greatest peacetime demographic disaster of the 20th century only became widely known twenty years later, when the veil of censorship began to lift.

The exact number of famine deaths during 1958–61 is difficult to determine, and estimates range from 18&lt;ref name=grada9&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gráda |first=Cormac Ó |title=Great Leap into Famine |series=UCD Centre For Economic Research Working Paper Series |year=2011 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to at least 42 million&lt;ref name=dikotterxii&gt;Dikötter, Frank.

;Khmer Rouge
[[File:Choeungek2.JPG|thumb|Skulls of [[Khmer Rouge]] murder victims at [[Choeung Ek]]]]
In 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge]] took control of [[Cambodia]]. The new government was led by [[Pol Pot]], who desired to turn Cambodia into a communist, agrarian utopia. His regime emptied the cities, abolished currency and private property, and forced Cambodia's population into slavery on communal farms. In less than four years, the Khmer Rouge had executed nearly 1.4 million people, mostly those believed to be a threat to the new ideology.

Due to the failure of the Khmer Rouge's agrarian reform policies, Cambodia experienced widespread famine. As many as one million more died from starvation, disease, and exhaustion resulting from these policies.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, William, ''The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience'', Touchstone, 1985, pp. 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;Kaplan, Robert D., ''The Ends of the Earth'', Vintage, 1996, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 [[Vietnam]] invaded Cambodia and removed the Khmer Rouge from power. By that time about one quarter of Cambodia's population had been killed.

;North Korean famine in the 1990s
[[North Korean famine|Famine struck North Korea in the mid-1990s]], set off by unprecedented floods. This [[Autarky|autarkic]] [[Urban area|urban]], industrial state depended on massive inputs of subsidised goods, including fossil fuels, primarily from the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. When the Soviet collapse and China's marketization switched trade to a hard currency, full-price basis, North Korea's economy collapsed. The vulnerable agricultural sector experienced a massive failure in 1995–96, expanding to full-fledged famine by 1996–99.

Estimates based on the North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a result of the famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoorenberg |first1=Thomas |last2=Schwekendiek |first2=Daniel |title=Demographic Changes in North Korea: 1993–2008 |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=38 |issue=1 |date=March 2012 |pages=133–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00475.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea has not yet regained food self-sufficiency and relies on external [[food aid]] from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Russia]] and the [[United States]].

===India===
{{Main|Famine in India}}
{{See also|Timeline of major famines in India during British rule}}
Owing to its almost entire dependence upon the [[monsoon]] rains, [[India]] is vulnerable to crop failures, which upon occasion deepen into famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Famine |display=Famine § Famines in India |volume=10 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 14 famines in [[History of India|India]] between the 11th and 17th centuries (Bhatia, 1985). For example, during the 1022–1033 Great famines in India entire provinces were depopulated. Famine in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] killed at least two million people in 1702–1704. B.M. Bhatia believes that the earlier famines were localised, and it was only after 1860, during the [[British Raj|British rule]], that famine came to signify general shortage of foodgrains in the country. There were approximately 25 major famines spread through states such as [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south, and [[Bihar]] and [[Bengal]] in the east during the latter half of the 19th century.

[[File:India-famine-family-crop-420.jpg|thumb|Victims of the Great Famine of 1876–78 in India during British rule, pictured in 1877.]]
[[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] argued as early as 1900, and present-day scholars such as [[Amartya Sen]] agree, that some historic famines were a product of both uneven rainfall and British economic and administrative policies, which since 1857 had led to the seizure and conversion of local farmland to foreign-owned plantations, restrictions on internal trade, heavy taxation of Indian citizens to support British expeditions in [[Afghanistan]] (see [[European influence in Afghanistan#Second Anglo-Afghan War|The Second Anglo-Afghan War]]), inflationary measures that increased the price of food, and substantial exports of staple crops from India to Britain. (Dutt, 1900 and 1902; Srivastava, 1968; Sen, 1982; Bhatia, 1985.)

Some British citizens, such as [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], agitated for policy reforms and famine relief, but [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such changes in the belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. The first, the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], is estimated to have taken around 10 million lives—one-third of Bengal's population at the time. Other notable famines include the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]], in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died&lt;ref name=mikedavis7&gt;Davis, Mike. ''[[Late Victorian Holocausts]]''. 1.

Verso, 2000. {{ISBN|1-85984-739-0}} p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The famines were ended by the 20th century with the exception of the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] killing an estimated 2.1 million Bengalis during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dyson |first=Tim |last2=Maharatna |first2=Arup |date=September 1991 |title=Excess mortality during the Great Bengal Famine: A Re-evaluation |url= |journal=The Indian Economic and Social History Review |publisher=SAGE |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=281–297 |doi=10.1177/001946469102800303 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observations of the Famine Commission of 1880 support the notion that food distribution is more to blame for famines than food scarcity. They observed that each province in British India, including [[Burma]], had a surplus of foodgrains, and the annual surplus was 5.16 million tons (Bhatia, 1970). At that time, annual export of rice and other grains from India was approximately one million tons.

{{cquote|Population growth worsened the plight of the peasantry. As a result of peace and improved sanitation and health, the Indian population rose from perhaps 100 million in 1700 to 300 million by 1920. While encouraging agricultural productivity, the British also provided economic incentives to have more children to help in the fields. Although a similar population increase occurred in Europe at the same time, the growing numbers could be absorbed by industrialization or emigration to the Americas and Australia. India enjoyed neither an industrial revolution nor an increase in food growing. Moreover, Indian landlords had a stake in the cash crop system and discouraged innovation. As a result, population numbers far outstripped the amount of available food and land, creating dire poverty and widespread hunger.|20x|20x|-Craig A.

The [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] (or to 1322) was the first major food crisis to strike Europe in the 14th century.

Most nobles, cities, and states were slow to respond to the crisis and when they realized its severity, they had little success in securing food for their people. In 1315, in Norfolk England, the price of grain soared from 5 shillings/quarter to 20 shillings/quarter.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=o8ea33eCFQgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=great+wave+great+famine+inflation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQsO3RzPbWAhWT3oMKHXv-Bb4Q6AEIJTAA#v=snippet&amp;q=1315&amp;f=false] David Hackett Fisher The Great Wave p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine was a very destabilizing and devastating occurrence. The prospect of [[starvation]] led people to take desperate measures. When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term survival. They would kill their [[draught animal]]s, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their [[seed]] corn, sacrificing next year's crop in the hope that more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They migrated to the cities where merchants from other areas would be more likely to sell their food, as cities had a stronger purchasing power than did rural areas. Cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order. With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, [[crime]] would often follow them. Many peasants resorted to [[bandit]]ry in order to acquire enough to eat.

One famine would often lead to difficulties in the following years because of lack of seed stock or disruption of routine, or perhaps because of less-available labour. Famines were often interpreted as signs of [[God]]'s displeasure. They were seen as the removal, by God, of His gifts to the people of the Earth. Elaborate religious processions and rituals were made to prevent God's wrath in the form of famine.

;16th century
[[File:Goya-Guerra (59).jpg|thumb|An engraving from [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'s ''[[Disasters of War]]'', showing starving women, doubtless inspired by the terrible famine that struck [[Madrid]] in 1811–1812.]]
During the 15th century to the 18th century, famines in Europe became more frequent due to the [[Little Ice Age]]. The colder climate resulted in harvest failures and shortfalls that led to a rise in [[conspiracy theories]] concerning the causes behind these famines, such as the [[Pacte de Famine]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Steven. ''The Famine Plot Persuasion in Eighteenth-Century France''. Pennsylvania: Diane Publishing Co, 1982. {{ISBN|0-87169-723-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1590s saw the worst famines in centuries across all of Europe. Famine had been relatively rare during the 16th century. The economy and population had grown steadily as subsistence populations tend to when there is an extended period of relative peace (most of the time). Although peasants in areas of high population density, such as northern Italy, had learned to increase the yields of their lands through techniques such as promiscuous culture, they were still quite vulnerable to famines, forcing them to work their land even more intensively.

The great famine of the 1590s began a period of famine and decline in the 17th century. The price of grain, all over Europe was high, as was the population. Various types of people were vulnerable to the succession of bad harvests that occurred throughout the 1590s in different regions. The increasing number of wage labourers in the countryside were vulnerable because they had no food of their own, and their meager living was not enough to purchase the expensive grain of a bad-crop year. Town labourers were also at risk because their wages would be insufficient to cover the cost of grain, and, to make matters worse, they often received less money in bad-crop years since the disposable income of the wealthy was spent on grain. Often, unemployment would be the result of the increase in grain prices, leading to ever-increasing numbers of urban poor.

All areas of Europe were badly affected by the famine in these periods, especially rural areas. The Netherlands was able to escape most of the damaging effects of the famine, though the 1590s were still difficult years there. [[Amsterdam]]'s grain trade with the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], guaranteed a food supply.

;17th century
The years around 1620 saw another period of famine sweep across Europe. These famines were generally less severe than the famines of twenty-five years earlier, but they were nonetheless quite serious in many areas. Perhaps the worst famine since 1600, the great famine in [[Finland]] in 1696, killed one-third of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009053403/http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf |date=9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devastating harvest failures afflicted the northern [[Italy|Italian]] economy from 1618 to 1621, and it did not recover fully for centuries. There were serious famines in the late-1640s and less severe ones in the 1670s throughout northern Italy.

Over two million people died in two famines in [[France]] between 1693 and 1710. Both famines were made worse by ongoing wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ó Gráda |first=Cormac |last2=Chevet |first2=Jean-Michel |year=2002 |title=Famine And Market In ''Ancient Régime'' France |journal=The Journal of Economic History |pmid=17494233 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=706–33 |doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=122547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas of Europe have known famines much more recently. [[France]] saw famines as recently as the 19th century. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in [[Ireland]], 1846–1851, caused by the failure of the potato crop over a few years, resulted in 1,000,000 dead and another 2,000,000 [[refugees]] fleeing to Britain, Australia and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.

;20th century
Famine still occurred in [[Eastern Europe]] during the 20th century. Droughts and famines in [[Imperial Russia]] are known to have happened every 10 to 13 years, with average droughts happening every 5 to 7 years. Russia experienced eleven major famines between 1845 and 1922, one of the worst being the [[Russian famine of 1891-2|famine of 1891–92]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/savage/A-FAM.PDF The Dimension of Famine]" (PDF).

The [[Hunger Plan]], i.e. the Nazi plan to starve large sections of the Soviet population, caused the deaths of many. The Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 reported civilian victims in the USSR at German hands, including Jews, totalled 13.7 million dead, 20% of the 68 million persons in the occupied USSR. This included 4.1 million famine and disease deaths in occupied territory. There were an additional estimated 3 million famine deaths in areas of the USSR not under German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;The Russian Academy of Science Rossiiskaia Akademiia nauk.

The 872 days of the [[Siege of Leningrad]] (1941–1944) caused unparalleled famine in the Leningrad region through disruption of utilities, water, energy and food supplies. This resulted in the deaths of about one million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=24841 |title=The Moscow Times&amp;nbsp;— News, Business, Culture &amp; Multimedia from Russia |website=Sptimes.ru |date= |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine even struck in Western Europe during the [[Second World War]]. In the [[Netherlands]], the ''[[Dutch famine of 1944|Hongerwinter]]'' of 1944 killed approximately 30,000 people. Some other areas of Europe also experienced famine at the same time.

Beginning in the 20th century, nitrogen [[fertilizer]]s, new [[pesticide]]s, [[desert farming]], and other agricultural technologies began to be used to increase food production, in part to combat famine. Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] influenced [[agriculture]], world grain production increased by 250%.  Developed nations have shared these technologies with developing nations with a famine problem. However, as early as 1995, there were signs that these new developments may contribute to the decline of arable land (e.g. persistence of pesticides leading to [[soil contamination]], [[Soil salinity|salt accumulation due to irrigation]], [[erosion]]).

In 1994, David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), estimated the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Mario Giampietro 1994.

Other countries affected include [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to [[water scarcity]] and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even while overexploiting its [[aquifers]], China has developed a [[grain]] deficit, contributing to the upward pressure on grain prices. Most of the three billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]].

After [[China]] and [[India]], there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits&amp;nbsp;– [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Mexico]], and [[Pakistan]]. Four of these already import a large share of their grain. Only Pakistan remains marginally self-sufficient.

Evan Fraser, a geographer at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, explores the ways in which [[climate change]] may affect future famines.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2007a. Travelling in antique lands: Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change. Climate Change 83:495–514.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, he draws on a range of historic cases where relatively small environmental problems triggered famines as a way of creating theoretical links between climate and famine in the future.  Drawing on situations as diverse as the [[Great Irish Potato Famine]],&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2003. Social vulnerability and ecological fragility: building bridges between social and natural sciences using the Irish Potato Famine as a case study. Conservation Ecology 7:9 (online).&lt;/ref&gt; a series of weather induced famines in [[Asia]] during the late 19th century, and famines in Ethiopia during the 1980s, he concludes there are three "lines of defense" that protect a community's [[food security]] from [[environmental change]]. The first line of defense is the [[Agroecosystem|agro-ecosystem]] on which food is produced: diverse ecosystems with well managed soils high in [[organic matter]] tend to be more resilient. The second line of defense is the wealth and skills of individual households: If those households affected by bad weather such as [[drought]] have savings or skills they may be able to do all right despite the bad weather.  The final line of defense is created by the formal institutions present in a society.  Governments, churches, or NGOs must be willing and able to mount effective relief efforts. Pulling this together, Evan Fraser argues that if an [[ecosystem]] is resilient enough, it may be able to withstand weather-related shocks. But if these shocks overwhelm the ecosystem's line of defense, it is necessary for the household to adapt using its skills and savings. If a problem is too big for the family or household, then people must rely on the third line of defense, which is whether or not the formal institutions present in a society are able to provide help. Evan Fraser concludes that in almost every situation where an environmental problem triggered a famine you see a failure in each of these three lines of defense.&lt;ref name="Fraser2006"&gt;Fraser, E.

* Brown and Eckholm&amp;nbsp;– Sudden, sharp reduction in food supply resulting in widespread hunger.{{sfn|Brown|Eckholm|1974|p=}}
* Scrimshaw&amp;nbsp;– Sudden collapse in level of food consumption of large numbers of people.{{sfn|Scrimshaw|1987|p=}}
* Ravallion&amp;nbsp;– Unusually high mortality with unusually severe threat to food intake of some segments of a population.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=2}}
* Cuny&amp;nbsp;– A set of conditions that occurs when large numbers of people in a region cannot obtain sufficient food, resulting in widespread, acute malnutrition.{{sfn|Cuny|1999|p=}}

Food shortages in a population are caused either by a lack of food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010|p=}} However, FAD could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} Based on the studies of some recent famines, the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and it has been suggested that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability. According to this view, famines are a result of entitlements,  the theory being proposed is called the "failure of exchange entitlements" or FEE.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}}

According to the Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), global [[climate change]] is additionally challenging the Earth's ability to produce food, potentially leading to famine.&lt;ref name="Psrccaf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Famine|url=http://www.psr.org/resources/climate-change-and-famine.html|publisher=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements make a particular region more vulnerable to famine. These include poverty, [[population growth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14291581 |title='Top 10 culprits' for Horn of Africa hunger |publisher=BBC News |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an inappropriate social infrastructure, a suppressive political regime, and a weak or under-prepared government.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=1}}

According to a FEWSNET report, "Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/reactions/fewsnet-report-260000-people-died-somalia-famine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and population pressure===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright|A child suffering extreme starvation in [[India]], 1972]]
Many famines are caused by imbalance of food production compared to the large populations of countries whose [[Human overpopulation|population exceeds the regional carrying capacity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Historically, famines have occurred from agricultural problems such as [[drought]], crop failure, or [[infectious disease|pestilence]]. Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, wars, and [[List of epidemics|epidemic diseases]] such as the [[Black Death]] helped to cause hundreds of famines in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], including 95 in Britain and 75 in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3609390/Poor-studies-will-always-be-with-us.html "Poor studies will always be with us"], ''The Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the [[Hundred Years' War]], crop failures and epidemics reduced the population by two-thirds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html Don O'Reilly, "Hundred Years' War: Joan of Arc and the Siege of Orléans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109043743/http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html |date=9 November 2006 }}", ''TheHistoryNet.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of a harvest or change in conditions, such as [[drought]], can create a situation whereby large numbers of people continue to live where the [[carrying capacity]] of the land has temporarily dropped radically. Famine is often associated with [[subsistence]] agriculture. The total absence of agriculture in an economically strong area does not cause famine; [[Arizona]] and other wealthy regions import the vast majority of their food, since such regions produce sufficient economic goods for trade.

Famines have also been caused by volcanism. The 1815 eruption of the [[Mount Tambora]] volcano in Indonesia caused crop failures and famines worldwide and caused the worst famine of the 19th century. The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground. The same mechanism is theorized to be caused by very large meteorite impacts to the extent of causing mass extinctions.

===State-sponsored famines===
In certain cases, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] in China (which produced the [[Great Chinese Famine|largest famine in absolute numbers]]), [[North Korean famine|North Korea in the mid-1990s]], or [[Zimbabwe]] in the early-2000s, famine can occur because of government policy.

[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|The government's [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]] of agriculture was one of the main causes of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].]]
In 1932, under the rule of the USSR, [[Ukraine]] experienced one of its largest famines when between 2.4 and 7.5 million peasants died as a result of a state sponsored famine. It was termed the [[Holodomor]], suggesting that it was a deliberate campaign of repression designed to eliminate resistance to collectivization. Forced grain quotas imposed upon the rural peasants and a brutal reign of terror contributed to the widespread famine. The Soviet government continued to deny the problem and it did not provide aid to the victims nor did it accept foreign aid. Several contemporary scholars dispute the notion that the famine was deliberately inflicted by the Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert William Davies|last2=Wheatcroft|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen G.

Barely enough grain was left for the peasants, and starvation occurred in many rural areas. Exportation of grain continued despite the famine and the government attempted to conceal it. While the famine is attributed to unintended consequences, it is believed that the government refused to acknowledge the problem, thereby further contributing to the deaths. In many instances, peasants were persecuted. Between 20 and 45 million people perished in this famine, making it one of the deadliest famines to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title=Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years' |last=Akbar |first=Arifa |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |location=London |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi ended its famine by subsidizing farmers despite the strictures imposed by the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=newyorktimes /&gt; During the 1973 [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia#Wollo famine|Wollo Famine]] in [[Ethiopia]], food was shipped out of Wollo to the capital city of [[Addis Ababa]], where it could command higher prices. In the late-1970s and early-1980s, residents of the [[dictatorship]]s of Ethiopia and [[Sudan]] suffered massive famines, but the [[democracy]] of [[Botswana]] avoided them, despite also suffering a severe drop in national food production. In [[Somalia]], famine occurred because of a [[failed state]].

[[File:Famines by political regime.png|thumb|Famines since 1850 by political regime]]

According to Amartya Sen (1999)  “there has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy”. Hasell and Roser have demonstrated that while there have been a few minor exceptions, famines rarely occur in democratic systems but are strongly correlated with [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and [[Colonialism|colonial]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/famines/|title=Famines|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famine prevention==
[[File:Famine in Algeria 1869.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A starving child during the 1869 famine in [[Algeria]].]]
Relief technologies, including [[immunization]], improved [[public health]] infrastructure, general food rations and supplementary feeding for vulnerable children, has provided temporary mitigation to the mortality impact of famines, while leaving their economic consequences unchanged, and not solving the underlying issue of too large a regional population relative to food production capability. Humanitarian crises may also arise from [[genocide]] campaigns, [[civil war]]s, [[refugee]] flows and episodes of extreme violence and state collapse, creating famine conditions among the affected populations.

Despite repeated stated intentions by the world's leaders to end hunger and famine, famine remains a chronic threat in much of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Southeast, South Asia, and the Middle East. In July 2005, the [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]] labelled [[Niger]] with emergency status, as well as [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[South Sudan]], [[Somalia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. In January 2006, the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] warned that 11 million people in Somalia, [[Kenya]], [[Djibouti]] and Ethiopia were in danger of starvation due to the combination of severe drought and military conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000206/index.html|title=Millions of people are on the brink of starvation in the Horn of Africa|website=Fao.org|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the most serious humanitarian crisis in Africa was in [[Sudan]]'s region [[Darfur]].

[[Frances Moore Lappé]], later co-founder of the [[Institute for Food and Development Policy]] (Food First) argued in ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' (1971) that [[vegetarian]] diets can provide food for larger populations, with the same resources, compared to omnivorous diets.

Noting that modern famines are sometimes aggravated by misguided economic policies, political design to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, or acts of war, political economists have investigated the political conditions under which famine is prevented. Economist [[Amartya Sen]]{{refn|Sen is known for his assertion that famines do not occur in democracies in much the same way that [[Adam Smith]] is associated with the "[[invisible hand]]" and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] with "[[creative destruction]]".{{sfn|Massing|2003|p=1}}|group=note}} states that the liberal institutions that exist in India, including competitive elections and a free press, have played a major role in preventing famine in that country since independence. [[Alex de Waal]] has developed this theory to focus on the "political contract" between rulers and people that ensures famine prevention, noting the rarity of such political contracts in Africa, and the danger that international relief agencies will undermine such contracts through removing the locus of accountability for famines from national governments.

[[File:Russia Famine Saratov 1921.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A woman, a man and a child, all three dead from starvation. [[Russia]], 1921.]]
The demographic impacts of famine are sharp. Mortality is concentrated among children and the elderly. A consistent demographic fact is that in all recorded famines, male mortality exceeds female, even in those populations (such as northern India and Pakistan) where there is a male longevity advantage during normal times. Reasons for this may include greater female resilience under the pressure of malnutrition, and possibly female's naturally higher percentage of body fat. Famine is also accompanied by lower fertility. Famines therefore leave the reproductive core of a population—adult women—lesser affected compared to other population categories, and post-famine periods are often characterized a "rebound" with increased births.

Even though the theories of [[Thomas Malthus]] would predict that famines reduce the size of the population commensurate with available food resources, in fact even the most severe famines have rarely dented population growth for more than a few years. The mortality in China in 1958–61, Bengal in 1943, and Ethiopia in 1983–85 was all made up by a growing population over just a few years. Of greater long-term demographic impact is emigration: Ireland was chiefly depopulated after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|1840s famines]] by waves of emigration.

===Food security===
{{Main|food security}}
Long term measures to improve food security, include investment in modern [[agriculture]] techniques, such as [[fertilizers]] and [[irrigation]],&lt;ref name=obama&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html "Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but can also include strategic national [[food storage]].

[[World Bank]] strictures restrict government subsidies for farmers, and increasing use of fertilizers is opposed by some environmental groups because of its unintended consequences: adverse effects on water supplies and habitat.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 "Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm |title=Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity |publisher=The Atlantic |date=5 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Norman Borlaug]], father of the [[Green Revolution]], is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.]]
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the [[Western world]], such as [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]], to the [[Indian Sub-continent]], called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing [[infrastructure]] and institutions that are in short supply in [[Africa]], such as a system of roads or public [[seed]] companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html|title=In Africa, Prosperity From Seeds Falls Short|date=10 October 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting [[farmer]]s in areas of food insecurity, through such measures as free or subsidized [[fertilizer]]s and [[seed]]s, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor  |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |date=18 June 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] and some rich nations press nations that depend on them for aid to cut back or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[privatization]] even as the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm|title=BBC NEWS&amp;nbsp;— Africa&amp;nbsp;— Zambia: Fertile but hungry|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relief===
{{Main|Famine relief}}
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html |title=UN aid debate: Give cash, not food? |date=4 June 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]]' [[World Food Program]] (WFP), the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfp&gt;http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899 |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a [[mobile phone]] operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2 |title=Ethiopia: A model of African food aid is now in trouble |date=6 May 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Revolution]] was widely viewed as an answer to famine in the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1950 and 1984, hybrid strains of high-yielding crops transformed agriculture around the globe and world grain production increased by 250%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm|title=Special Reports&amp;nbsp;– The limits of a Green Revolution?|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=August 2013}} criticize the process, stating that these new high-yielding crops require more chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, which can harm the environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Although these high-yielding crops make it technically possible to feed more people, there are indications that regional food production has peaked in many world sectors, due to certain strategies associated with intensive agriculture such as [[groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] and overuse of [[pesticide]]s and other agricultural chemicals.

===Levels of food insecurity===
{{Main|Famine scales}}
In modern times, local and political governments and [[non-governmental organization]]s that deliver famine relief have limited resources with which to address the multiple situations of food insecurity that are occurring simultaneously.  Various methods of categorizing the gradations of food security have thus been used in order to most efficiently allocate food relief.  One of the earliest were the [[Indian Famine Codes]] devised by the British in the 1880s. The Codes listed three stages of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity and famine, and were highly influential in the creation of subsequent famine warning or measurement systems.  The early warning system developed to monitor the region inhabited by the [[Turkana people]] in northern [[Kenya]] also has three levels, but links each stage to a pre-planned response to mitigate the crisis and prevent its deterioration

The experiences of famine relief organizations throughout the world over the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major developments: the "livelihoods approach" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement [[income]], etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of [[agriculture|agricultural]] land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass [[starvation]]. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving [[Market (economics)|market]]s, the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine's severity.

Since 2003, many of the most important organizations in famine relief, such as the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], have adopted a five-level scale measuring intensity and magnitude. The intensity scale uses both livelihoods' measures and measurements of mortality and child malnutrition to categorize a situation as food secure, food insecure, food crisis, famine, severe famine, and extreme famine. The number of deaths determines the magnitude designation, with under 1000 fatalities defining a "minor famine" and a "catastrophic famine" resulting in over 1,000,000 deaths.

==Society and culture==
Famine personified as an [[allegory]] is found in some cultures, e.g. one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in Christian tradition,  the [[fear gorta]] of Irish folklore, or the [[Wendigo]] of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tradition.

'''Forensic dentistry''' or '''forensic odontology''' is the application of dental knowledge to those criminal and civil laws that are enforced by police agencies in a [[criminal justice system]]. Forensic dentists are involved in assisting investigative agencies to identify recovered [[Cadaver|human remains]] in addition to the identification of whole or fragmented bodies; forensic dentists may also be asked to assist in determining age, [[race (human classification)|race]], [[job|occupation]], previous dental history and [[socioeconomic status]] of unidentified human beings.

Forensic dentistry is the proper handling, [[Inspection|examination]] and [[evaluation]] of [[dentistry|dental]] [[evidence]], which will be then presented in the interest of [[justice]]. The evidence that may be derived from [[teeth]] is the age (in children) and identification of the person to whom the teeth belong. This is done using dental records including [[radiograph]]s, ante-mortem (prior to death) and post-mortem (after death) [[photograph]]s and [[DNA]]. "Forensic odontology" is derived from [[Latin]], meaning a forum or where legal matters are discussed.

The other type of evidence is that of bite marks, left on either the victim (by the attacker), the perpetrator (from the victim of an attack), or on an object found at the [[crime scene]]. Bite marks are often found on [[child abuse|children who are abused]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Forensic dentists are responsible for six main areas of practice:

* Identification of found [[Human body|human remains]]
* Identification in [[Mass fatality incident|mass fatalities]]
* Assessment of bite mark injuries
* Assessment of cases of abuse (such as child, [[spousal abuse|spousal]] or [[elder abuse]])
* Civil cases involving [[malpractice]]
* Age estimation

==Background==
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 060921-A-4543J-003.jpg|thumb|Forensic dentistry]]

Forensic odontology is the study of dental applications in [[legal proceeding]]s. The subject covers a wide variety of topics including individual identification, mass identification, and bite mark analysis. The study of odontology in a [[legal case]] can be a piece of incriminating evidence or an aspect of wide controversy.

There have been many cases throughout history which have made use of bite marks as evidence. Bite marks are usually seen in cases involving [[sexual assault]], [[murder]], and child abuse and can be a major factor in leading to a [[conviction]]. Biting is often a sign of the perpetrator seeking to degrade the victim while also achieving complete domination.&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Douglas, John E., Mark Olshaker (1995). ''Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit.'' New York: Scribner. {{ISBN|978-0-671-01375-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bite marks can be found anywhere on a body, particularly on soft, fleshy [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] such as the [[stomach]] or [[buttocks]]. In addition, bite marks can be found on objects present at the scene of a crime. Bite marks are commonly found on a suspect when a victim attempts to defend him/herself.

==High-profile criminal cases==
Forensic odontology has played a key role in famous criminal cases:

In 1692, during the [[Salem Witch Trials]], Rev. [[George Burroughs]] was accused of [[witchcraft]] and conspiring with the [[Devil]], with biting his victims supposedly being evidence of his crimes. His bite marks and the bite marks of other people were compared to the victim's marks. The judges readily accepted the bite marks as evidence and this was the first time in what would become the United States that bite marks were used as evidence to solve a crime. He was later convicted and hanged. About two decades later, he was exonerated by the State, and his children compensated for the wrongful execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/SAL_BBUR.HTM George Burroughs]. Law2.umkc.edu. Retrieved on 2016-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first published accounts involving a conviction based on bite marks as evidence was the “Gorringe case”, in 1948, in which pathologist [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Keith Simpson]] used bite marks on the breast of the victim to seal a murder conviction against Robert Gorringe for the murder of his wife Phyllis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.forensic-dentistry.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Biblio_2_Taylor_1963_BDJ1.pdf |author=Taylor, D. V. |title=The Law and the Dentist |journal=[[British Dental Journal]] |volume=114 |year=1963 |pages=389–393 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328133927/http://www.forensic-dentistry.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Biblio_2_Taylor_1963_BDJ1.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early case was ''Doyle v. State'', which occurred in Texas in 1954. The bite mark in this case was on a piece of cheese found at the crime scene of a burglary. The defendant was later asked to bite another piece of cheese for comparison. A firearms examiner and a dentist evaluated the bite marks independently and both concluded that the marks were made by the same set of teeth. The conviction in this case set the stage for bite marks found on objects and skin to be used as evidence in future cases.&lt;ref name="Bowers"/&gt;
Another landmark case was ''People v. Marx'', which occurred in California in 1975.&lt;ref name="Dorion"/&gt; A woman was murdered by strangulation after being sexually assaulted. She was bitten several times on her nose. Walter Marx was identified as a suspect and dental impressions were made of his teeth. Impressions and photographs were also taken of the woman’s injured nose. These samples along with other models and casts were evaluated using a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional comparisons, and acetate overlays. Three experts testified that the bite marks on the woman’s nose were indeed made by Marx and he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

==Organizations==
Four organizations are dedicated to the field of forensic odontology, in the USA. These organizations include: the Bureau of Legal Dentistry (BOLD), the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO), [[American Society of Forensic Odontology (ASFO)]] and the International Organization for Forensic Odonto-Stomatology (IOFOS).Other countries have their own forensic Odontological societies, including the British Association for Forensic Odontology (BAFO) and the Australian Society of Forensic Odontology (AuSFO). In 1996, BOLD was created at the [[University of British Columbia]] to develop new technology and techniques in forensic odontology. The University of British Columbia program is the only one in North America that provides graduate training in forensic odontology.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldlab.ubc.ca |title=Bureau of Legal Dentistry |publisher=boldlab.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau of Legal Dentistry encourages the use of multiple dental impressions to create a “dental lineup”, similar to a suspect lineup used to identify alleged perpetrators of crime. Currently, dental impressions collected as evidence are compared only to those collected from a given suspect, which may bias the resulting outcome. Using multiple dental impressions in a lineup may enable forensic odontologists to significantly decrease the current bias in matching bite marks to the teeth of a suspect.&lt;ref name="Bowers"/&gt; The organization BOLD also supports the creation of a database of dental records, which could help in verifying dental uniqueness.&lt;ref name="Dorion"/&gt; This database could be created using criminal records or possibly all dental patients.

In 1984, the ABFO began making an attempt to diminish the discrepancies and increase the validity of bite mark analysis by creating bite mark methodology guidelines. The guidelines attempt to establish standard terminology in describing bite marks and that reduces the risk of biased results. The ABFO also provides advice on how to effectively collect and preserve evidence. For example, they recommend that the collection of DNA evidence and detailed photographs of bites be taken together at the crime scene. The guidelines also outline how and what a forensic odontologist should record, such as the location, contours, shape, and size of a bite mark. They also provide a system of scoring to assess the degree to which a suspect’s dental profile and bite mark match. According to the ABFO, the guidelines are not a mandate of methods to be used, but a list of generally accepted methods.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[http://abfo.org American Board of Forensic Odontology]. Abfo.org. Retrieved on 2016-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines are intended to prevent potentially useful evidence from being thrown out simply because the forensic odontologist’s collection methods were not standardized.
Kouble and Craig used a simplified version of the ABFO scoring guidelines in order to retain accuracy with a larger sample of comparisons. A numerical score was assigned to represent the degree of similarity between the bite mark and model/overlay. The higher the score, the greater the similarity. In order to simplify the model, some features that were individually scored in the ABFO guidelines such as arch size and shape were assessed together while certain distinctive features such as spacing between teeth were treated as a separate variable. The authors believe that a simplified version would increase the strength of the comparison process.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kouble RF, Craig GT |year=2004|title=A comparison between direct and indirect methods available for human bite mark analysis|journal= Journal of Forensic Science|volume= 49|issue=1|pages= 111–118|pmid=14979355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to improve guidelines used to collect dental evidence, IOFOS developed one of the most recognized systems for the collection of forensic dental evidence&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odont.uio.no/foreninger/iofos/iofos_st.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209203241/http://www.odont.uio.no/foreninger/iofos/iofos_st.htm |archivedate=2009-02-09 |title=International Organization of Forensic Odonto-Stomatology Regulations (1987) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vermylen, Y. |title=Guidelines in Forensic Odontology: legal aspects|pmid=16563684|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.02.002|year=2006|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=159|pages=S6–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a group called Forensic Odontology for Human Rights was inaugurated in Lyon during the Interpol DVI{{clarify|date=October 2017}} annual meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dentify.me|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.dentify.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, an association of civil protection called Dental Team DVI Italia was founded in [[Bari, Italy]], in order to offer pro bono services in the field of human identification and DVI Disaster Victim Identification to support Italian DVI teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dentalteamdvi.it|title=Dental Team DVI Italia - Associazione di operatori tecnici delle scienze forensi esperti nella identificazione delle vittime di disastri (D.V.I. Disaster Victim Identification, D.V.I)|author=|date=|website=www.dentalteamdvi.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bite mark analysis==
Upon collection of dental evidence, the forensic odontologist analyzes and compares the bite marks. Studies have been performed in an attempt to find the simplest, most efficient, and most reliable way of analyzing bite marks.

Bites can occur on both the victim and the suspect; [[teeth]] are used as weapon by the aggressor and in self-defense by the victim. Although they are only a small portion of most forensic dentist’s case load, bite marks represent the most challenging aspect of the discipline. In addition to the location of the bite mark the type of severity of the injury may give investigators clues as to the mental state of the offender. Bite marks may be found on the flesh of victims of a violent attack, particularly on the stomach or buttocks. Alternatively they may be found on the suspect, left by the victim during self-defense. Bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement, or change in environment after the bite. There is also no set standard by which to analyse and compare bite marks.

Factors that may affect the accuracy of bite mark identification include time-dependent changes of the bite mark on living bodies, effects of where the bite mark was found, damage on soft tissue, and similarities in dentition among individuals. Other factors include poor photography, impressions, or measurement of dentition characteristics.&lt;ref name="Al-Talabani"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Al-Talabani N, Al-Moussawy, ND, Baker FA, Mohammed HA|year=2006|title=Digital analysis of experimental human bitemarks: application of two new methods|pmid=17199623|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1372–5|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2006.00265.x|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most bite mark analysis studies use porcine skin (pigskin), because it is comparable to the skin of a human, and it is considered unethical to bite a human for study in the United States. Limitations to the bite mark studies include differences in properties of pigskin compared to human skin and the technique of using simulated pressures to create bite marks.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Martin-de las Heras S, Valenzuela A, Valverde AJ, Torres JC, Luna-del-Castillo JD |title=Effectiveness of comparison overlays generated with DentalPrint software in bite mark analysis|pmid=17209928|year=2007|volume=52|issue=1|pages=151–6|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2006.00321.x|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although similar histologically, pigskin and human skin behave in dynamically different ways due to differences in elasticity.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Furthermore, postmortem bites on nonhuman skin, such as those used in the experiments of Martin-de-las Heras et al., display different patterns to those seen in antemortem bite injuries. In recognition of the limitations of their study, Kouble and Craig&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; suggest using a [[G-clamp]] on an articulator in future studies to standardize the amount of pressure used to produce experimental bite marks instead of applying manual pressure to models on pigskin.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Future research and technological developments may help reduce the occurrence of such limitations.

Kouble and Craig compared direct methods and indirect methods of bite mark analysis. In the past, the direct method compared a model of the suspect’s teeth to a life-size photograph of the actual bite mark. In these experiments, direct comparisons were made between dental models and either photographs or "fingerprint powder lift-models." The "fingerprint powder lift" technique involves dusting the bitten skin with black fingerprint powder and using fingerprint tape to transfer the bite marks onto a sheet of [[acetate]]. Indirect methods involve the use of transparent overlays to record a suspect’s biting edges. Transparent overlays are made by free-hand tracing the occlusal surfaces of a dental model onto an acetate sheet. When comparing the “fingerprint powder lift” technique against the photographs, the use of photographs resulted in higher scores determined by a modified version of the ABFO scoring guidelines. The use of transparent overlays is considered subjective and irreproducible because the tracing can be easily manipulated. On the other hand, photocopier-generated overlays where no tracing is used is considered to be the best method in matching the correct bite mark to the correct set of models without the use of computer imaging.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;

While the photocopier-generated technique is sensitive, reliable, and inexpensive, new methods involving digital overlays have proven to be more accurate.&lt;ref name="Al-Talabani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Two recent technological developments include the 2D polyline method and the painting method. Both methods use Adobe Photoshop. Use of the 2D polyline method entails drawing straight lines between two fixed points in the arch and between incisal edges to indicate the tooth width. Use of the painting method entails coating the incisal edges of a dental model with red glossy paint and then photographing the model. Adobe Photoshop is then used to make measurements on the image. A total of 13 variables were used in analysis. Identification for both methods were based on canine-to-canine distance (one variable), incisor width (four variables), and rotational angles of the incisors (eight variables). The 2D polyline method relies heavily on accurate measurements, while the painting method depends on precise overlaying of the images. Although both methods were reliable, the 2D polyline method gave efficient and more objective results.&lt;ref name="Al-Talabani"/&gt;

===Criticism of bite mark analysis===
Recently, the scientific foundation of forensic odontology, and especially bite mark comparison, has been called into question. A 1999 study by a member of the American Board of Forensic Odontology found a 63% rate of false identifications.&lt;ref name="Not So"&gt;Santos, Fernanda (January 28, 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/weekinreview/28santos.html Evidence From Bite Marks, It Turns Out, Is Not So Elementary]. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study was based on an informal workshop during an ABFO meeting which many members did not consider a valid scientific setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/chi-041019forensics,0,7597688.story |title= From the start, a faulty science
|first= Flynn|last= McRoberts|work= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date= 2004-10-19|accessdate= 2008-07-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission recommended that bite mark evidence not be used in criminal prosecutions until it had a more firm scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texastribune.org/2016/02/12/commission-recommends-restriction-bite-mark-eviden/ Commission Wants Restriction of Bite-Mark Evidence]. The Texas Tribune (2016-02-12). Retrieved on 2016-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigative series by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' entitled "Forensics under the Microscope" examined many forensic science disciplines to see if they truly deserve the air of infallibility that has come to surround them. The investigators concluded that bite mark comparison is always subjective and no standards for comparison have been accepted across the field. The journalists discovered that no rigorous experimentation has been conducted to determine error rates for bite mark comparison, a key part of the [[scientific method]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Critics of bite mark comparison cite the case of [[Ray Krone]], an Arizona man convicted of murder on bite mark evidence left on a woman's breast. DNA evidence later implicated another man and Krone was released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/chi-0411290148nov29,0,1894615.story Bite-mark verdict faces new scrutiny.] Chicago Tribune; November 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Roy Brown was convicted of murder due in part to bite-mark evidence, and freed after DNA testing of the saliva left in the bite wounds matched someone else.&lt;ref name="Not So"/&gt;

Although bite mark analysis has been used in legal proceedings since 1870, it remains a controversial topic due to a variety of factors. DeVore&lt;ref name="DeVore"&gt;{{cite journal|author=DeVore DT|title=Bite Marks for identification? A preliminary report|pmid=5136610|year=1971|volume=11|issue=3|pages=144–5|journal=Medicine, science, and the law|doi=10.1177/002580247101100309}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbenel and Evans&lt;ref name="Barbenel"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Barbenel JC, Evans JH |title=Bite marks in skin – mechanical factors|doi=10.1016/S0015-7368(74)70908-2|year=1974|journal=Journal of the Forensic Science Society|volume=14|issue=3|pages=235–8|pmid=4443779}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the accuracy of a bite mark on skin is limited at best. Skin is not a good medium for dental impressions; it is liable to have a number of irregularities present before the imprint that could cause distortion. Also, bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement or a changing environment during and after the actual bite. Furthermore, the level of distortion tends to increase after the bite mark was made. Both studies suggest that for the bite mark to be accurately analyzed, the body must be examined in exactly the same position it was in when the bite occurred, which can be a difficult if not an impossible task to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; Bite mark distortion can rarely be quantified. Therefore, bite marks found at the scene are often analyzed under the assumption that they have undergone minimal distortion.&lt;ref name="Dorion"/&gt; Only limited research has been done in trying to quantify the level of distortion of a bite mark on human skin since the 1970s. The lack of research may largely be due to the fact that such studies are difficult to organize and are very expensive.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt;

Bite mark analysis is also controversial because dental profiles are subject to change. The loss of teeth or the alteration of arch configuration through a variety of procedures is common in human populations. The onset of oral diseases such as dental caries has been shown to alter the arch and tooth configuration and must be taken into account when comparing a dental profile to the bite mark after a significant amount of time has passed since the mark was made.&lt;ref name="Dorion"&gt;Dorion, Robert BJ. ''Bitemark Evidence''. NY: Marcel Dekker, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8247-5414-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the methods behind collecting bite mark evidence at the scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific odontologist. As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life-sized photographs to computer enhanced three-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, and there is no set standard by which to compare or analyze them.&lt;ref name="Pretty"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pretty IA, Sweet D |title=The scientific basis for human bitemark analyses – a critical review|pmid=11393946|year=2001|volume=41|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1016/S1355-0306(01)71859-X|journal=Science &amp; Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretation with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body is the result of a bite.&lt;ref name="Dorion"/&gt; Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.

One possible issue facing bite mark analysis is a lack of bite mark uniqueness in any given population. Bite mark analysis is based on the assumptions that the dental characteristics of anterior teeth involved in biting are unique amongst individuals, and this asserted uniqueness is transferred and recorded in the injury.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; However, there is very little reliable research to support these assumptions. A study performed by MacFarlane et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=MacFarlane TW, MacDonald DG, Sutherland DA |title= Statistical problems in dental identification |pmid=4613797 |year=1974 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=247–52 |journal=Journal – Forensic Science Society|doi=10.1016/s0015-7368(74)70911-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported the notion of dental uniqueness, but the study revolved around the visual assessment of a cast as opposed to the bite mark that could have been produced by the cast.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; In another study conducted by Sognnaes et al., the group tried to find uniqueness between the dental profiles of identical twins in an attempt to prove dental uniqueness in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computer comparison of bitemark patterns in identical twins|journal= Journal of the American Dental Association |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=449–451 |url=http://jada.ada.org/content/105/3/449.short|pmid=6957451|year=1982|last1=Sognnaes|first1=RF|last2=Rawson|first2=RD|last3=Gratt|first3=BM|last4=Nguyen|first4=NB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study suffered from a small sample size (n=5), with the intent to extrapolate the data to the general population. They also used plaster of paris as the substrate to simulate skin, yet the two materials have very different properties.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; In a review conducted by Strom, he references a study conducted by Berg and Schaidt which suggested that at least four to five teeth need to be present in the mark to ensure its uniqueness and make a positive identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strom F.|url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/42/1/312.full.pdf |title=Investigation of Bite-Marks|pmid=13978931|year=1963|volume=42 | issue = 1Pt 2|pages=312–6|journal=Journal of Dental Research|doi=10.1177/00220345630420013301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berg | first1 = S | last2 = Schaidt | first2 = G | year = 1954 | title = Methodik und Beweiswert des Bissspurenvergleiches | url = | journal = Kriminalwiss | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 128–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study was done long before many of the current evaluation methods, and this sheds doubt on how applicable these conclusions are today.

Rawson et al. determined that if five teeth marks can be matched to five teeth, it can be said with confidence that only one person could have caused the bite, and if eight teeth were matched to marks this would be a certainty. However, in this study the probabilities used to make this claim are based on the assumption that the position of each tooth was independent of all the others.&lt;ref name="Rawson"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rawson R. |author2=Ommen R. |author3=Kinard G. |author4=Johnson J. |author5=Yfantis A. |doi=10.1520/JFS11656J|volume= 29|issue =1 |year=1984|pages=245–253|title=Statistical evidence for the individuality of the human dentition|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; This is probably unrealistic because there are a number of ways that the dental profile can be changed. For example, braces apply force to specific teeth, in order to shift the placement of multiple teeth.

One particular case that highlighted the lack of uniqueness in bite marks involved two suspects accused of attacking a man who had sustained a bite mark injury.&lt;ref name="Pretty2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lack of dental uniqueness between two bite mark suspects|pmid=11714165|year=2001|last1=Pretty|first1=IA|last2=Turnbull|first2=MD|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1487–91|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two separate forensic dentists, one representing the prosecution and one the defense, were brought in to analyze the mark. They reported conflicting results. One found the mark to come from suspect A and the other said it was from suspect B. This disagreement resulted from the fact that even though the two suspects had dental features making them unique, the bite mark itself was not detailed enough to reflect them. Therefore, the mark could have reasonably come from either of the men.&lt;ref name="Pretty2"/&gt; The equivocal outcome demonstrated in the case emphasizes the difficulty in proving uniqueness.

Most of the controversies facing bite mark analysis are due to the lack of empirical supporting evidence. When searching the entire MedLine database from 1960 to 1999, only 50 papers in English were found that related to bite mark analysis. Of these 50 papers, most of which were published in the 1980s, only 8% came from well designed experimentation providing empirical data. The lack of research has led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis. This brings into question whether or not there is enough scientific support for bite mark analysis to be employed in court.&lt;ref name="Pretty2"/&gt;

There have been several instances when forensic dentists have made claims, accusations, and guarantees supported by bite mark evaluation that have been proven incorrect through other forensic sciences. DNA analysis has shed some light on the limitations of bite mark analysis because often the DNA from saliva surrounding the area of the bite mark proves to be a more reliable form of identification. In the case of ''Mississippi vs. Bourne'', the DNA of a suspect excluded them from the crime after a dentist claimed the bite marks on the victim matched the defendant’s teeth.&lt;ref name="Bowers"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16600549 |title=Problem-based analysis of bitemark misidentifications: the role of DNA |year=2006 |last1=Bowers |first1=CM |volume=159 Suppl 1 |pages=S104–9 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.02.032 |journal=Forensic Science International}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA sampling has been included as a task for a forensic odontologist. For a crime scene investigator, taking DNA samples is as common as taking pictures of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsgov.com/forensic-odontology.html Forensic Odontology explained]. ITSGOV: CSI and Forensics Science&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''State vs. Krone'', the defendant was sentenced to death, which was overturned. Then Krone was later reconvicted and given life in prison. Both convictions were based largely on bite mark evidence, but ten years later DNA evidence surfaced that identified the real killer and Krone was set free.&lt;ref name="Bowers"/&gt;

==Age estimation==
Not only can the age of a human specimen be narrowed by evaluating the patterns of [[tooth eruption]] and tooth wear, recent studies provide evidence that [[cementum]], the mineralized tissue that lines the surface of tooth roots, exhibits annual patterns of deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2005.09.002 |title=Incremental lines in root cementum of human teeth — A reliable age marker?|year=2006|last1=Renz|first1=H|last2=Radlanski|first2=R|authorlink2=Ralf J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4397">A '''generalist species''' is able to thrive in a wide variety of environmental conditions and can make use of a variety of different [[natural resource|resources]] (for example, a [[heterotroph]] with a varied [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]). A '''specialist species''' can thrive only in a narrow range of environmental conditions or has a limited diet. Most [[organism]]s do not all fit neatly into either group, however. Some species are highly specialized (the most extreme case being '''[[List of feeding behaviours#By food type|monophagy]]'''), others less so, and some can tolerate many different environments. In other words, there is a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] from highly-specialized to broadly-generalist species.

[[File:Waschbaer auf dem Dach.jpg|left|thumb|Generalists such as [[raccoon]]s are sometimes able to adapt to [[urban environment]]s.]]

[[Omnivore]]s are usually generalists. [[Herbivore]]s are often specialists, but those that eat a variety of plants may be considered generalists. A well-known example of a specialist animal is the [[koala]], which subsists almost entirely on [[eucalyptus]] leaves. The [[raccoon]] is a generalist because it has a natural range that includes most of North and Central America, and it is omnivorous, eating [[berries]], [[insect]]s, butterflies      ([[Asterocampa celtis|Hackberry Emperor]], for example), [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and small [[animal]]s. Monophagous organisms feed exclusively, or nearly so, on a single other species.

The distinction between generalists and specialists is not limited to animals. For example, some plants require a narrow range of temperatures, [[soil]] conditions and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] to survive while others can tolerate a broader range of conditions. A [[cactus]] could be considered a specialist species. It will die during winters at high [[latitude]]s or if it receives too much water.

When [[body weight]] is controlled for, specialist feeders such as [[insectivore]]s and [[frugivore]]s have larger [[home range]]s than generalists like some [[folivore]]s (leaf eaters). Because their food source is less abundant, they need a bigger area for [[foraging]].&lt;ref name="Krebs93"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krebs | first = J. R. | last2 = Davies | first2 = N. B. | title =  An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell  | year = 1993 | page35 = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CA31asx7zq4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=behavioral+ecology+an+introduction&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-632-03546-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example comes from the research of [[Tim Clutton-Brock]], who found that the [[black and white colobus]], a folivore generalist, needs a home range of only 15[[hectare|ha]]. On the other hand, the more specialized [[red colobus monkey]] has a home range of 70 ha, which it requires to find patchy shoots, flowers and fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Clutton-Brock|first1=T.H.|year=1975 |title=Feeding behaviour of red colobus and black and white colobus in East Africa |journal=Folia Primatologica |volume=23 |issue= 3|pages=165–207 |url= |doi=10.1159/000155671 |pmid=805763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When environmental conditions change, generalists are able to adapt, but specialists tend to fall victim to [[extinction]] much more easily.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, C.; Begon, M.; Harper, J. (2003) ''Essentials of Ecology'' (2nd edition) p.54-55 Blackwell, {{ISBN|1-4051-0328-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a species of fish were to go extinct, any specialist [[parasite]]s would [[coextinction|also face extinction]]. On the other hand, a species with a highly specialized [[ecological niche]] is more effective at [[competition (biology)|competing]] with other organisms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} For example, a fish and its [[parasite]]s are in an [[evolutionary arms race]], a form of [[co-evolution]], in which the fish constantly develops defenses against the parasite, while the parasite in turn evolves adaptations to cope with the specific defenses of its host. This tends to drive the [[speciation]] of more specialized species provided conditions remain relatively stable. This involves [[niche partitioning]] as new species are formed, and [[biodiversity]] is increased.

'''Genomatix GmbH''' is a [[computational biology]] company headquartered in [[Munich]], Germany, with a seat of business in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], U.S.A.

== History ==
Genomatix was founded in 1997 by [http://www.bioinformatik-muenchen.de/perspektive/perspektive-bioinformatik-werner/ Dr. Thomas Werner] as a spin-off from the [[Helmholtz Zentrum München]] (formerly  "GSF - National German Research Institute for Environment and Health"). Helmholtz Zentrum Munich is part of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]. Genomatix pioneered the analysis and understanding of eukaryotic [[gene regulation]].

== Genomatix software tools ==
Genomatix offers integrated solutions and databases for [[genome annotation]] and regulation analysis.

Genomatix product portfolio contains solutions for:

• Literature and pathway mining&lt;br /&gt;
• [[Transcription factor]] analysis&lt;br /&gt;
• Genome annotation integrating a wide variety of transcript sources and a special focus on regulatory regions&lt;br /&gt;
• Analysis technology for high throughput genomic technologies ([[microarrays]] and next generation [[sequencing]])

'''Literature mining'''&lt;br /&gt;
LitInspector is a literature search tool providing gene and signal transduction pathway mining within NCBI's PubMed database.&lt;ref name="LitInspector Publication"&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=19417065 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkp303 | pmc=2703902 | volume=37 | title=LitInspector: literature and signal transduction pathway mining in PubMed abstracts | year=2009 | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | pages=W135-40 | last1 = Frisch | first1 = M | last2 = Klocke | first2 = B | last3 = Haltmeier | first3 = M | last4 = Frech | first4 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LitInspector"&gt;[http://www.litinspector.org/] LitInspector start page.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personalized medicine]] developed to a major field for Genomatix.&lt;ref name="Personaliced Medicine"&gt;[http://www.genomatix.de/en/forscher.html] Genomatix and personalized medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; Genomatix is involved in several projects and international conferences e.g. 5th Santorini Conference - "Functional Genomics towards personalized health care" &lt;ref name="Santorini Conference"&gt;[http://www.santorini2010.org/] Conference about personalized health care.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 Genomatix has strongly focused on Next Generation Sequencing data analysis. Because of the large amount of data and the need for high-end computing power, Genomatix deploys its solutions as in-house installations (hardware software bundle)

Two systems are available:

1. The Genomatix Mining Station (GMS) is based on a proprietary genomic pattern recognition paradigm, or GenomeThesaurus, which allows for input of raw sequence reads plus optional quality files from any deep sequencing hardware. It provides ultra fast mapping of sequences of any length (starting from 8bp) with no practical limits on the number of point mutations and/or insertions and deletions that can be taken into account during the mapping process. Depending on the nature of the experiment, the GMS can provide SNP detection and genotyping, copy number analysis, and small RNA analysis. For ChIPseq data, the GMS delivers clustering and peak finding, and performs automated binding pattern identification. For RNAseq experiments, normalized expression values are calculated at the exon and transcript level. A special GenomeThesaurus is also provided for potential splice junctions, which allows for splice junction analysis and identification of new transcriptional units.

For genomic re-sequencing and newly sequenced genomes, a de-novo assembly will be provided.

2. The Genomatix Genome Analyzer (GGA) delivers downstream software tools and databases for the deep biological analysis of data coming from the GMS. It allows for easy integration and visualization in the terabytes of background annotation of the ElDorado genome database. GGA extensively annotates genomic coordinates and surrounding areas derived by the GMS or any other mapping procedure. Clustering and peak finding, analysis for phylogenetic conservation, large scale correlation analysis with annotated genomic elements, meta-analysis of data correlation between different experiments, pathway mining for groups of identified genes, transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis ( identification, over-representation, binding partner analysis, framework identification, phylogenetic conservation, regulatory SNP effects) and much more are all processes carried out on the GGA.

With the GGA and GMS Genomatix delivers the worldwide first integrative data analysis platform for Next Generation Sequencing analysis with custom workflows tailored towards specific needs.

Further developments will be the link-up of data from clinical sources and medical applications. Pilot projects were already started within Genomatix’ consulting platform linking genotype and phenotype information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">A '''geoxyle''' is a plant in which an enlarged, woody structure occurs beneath the surface of the ground. Such plants have developed independently in various plant lineages, mostly evolving in the [[Pliocene]] and subsequently diverging within the last two million years. In contrast to their close relatives, these plants have developed in areas with both high rainfall and a high frequency of fires. They are sometimes known as '''underground trees''', and the areas where they grow as '''underground forests'''.&lt;ref name=Maurin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Maurin, O. |author2=Davies, T.J. |author3=Burrows, J.E. |author4=Daru, B.H. |author5=Yessoufou, K. |author6=Muasya, A.M. |author7=van der Bank, M. |author8=Bond, W.J. |year=2014 |title=Savanna fire and the origins of the 'underground forests' of Africa |journal=New Phytologist |volume=204 |issue=1 |pages=201–214 |doi=10.1111/nph.12936 |pmid=25039765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geoxylic growth forms of woody [[subshrub]]s is characterised by massive [[lignotuber]]s or underground woody [[Glossary of botanical terms#Axis|axes]] from which emerge aerial shoots which may be ephemeral. These growth forms are found in [[savanna]]hs in southern Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2917">The '''Harmonised monitoring scheme''' is a long term [[river]] [[water quality]] [[environmental monitoring|monitoring]] scheme in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm DEFRA - Freshwater quality - Harmonised Monitoring Scheme] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402151656/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm |date=2013-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to the long term [[data set]]s produced by the scheme.

==Establishment==

The scheme was established in 1974 by the [[Department of the Environment]] with much of the initial planning and implementation undertaken by the [[Water Research Centre]]. It involved the creation of a network of sites across the UK. Most sites were at the downstream [[freshwater]] limits of the larger rivers although some of the largest rivers also included additional locations below major tributary confluences. Before inclusion of any location in the survey, homogeneity testing was carried out to characterise quality variations laterally and vertically within the river section chosen. For each designated point a specific sampling location was identified based on the results of the homogeneity exercise. In addition laboratories who were to undertake the analysis of samples were identified and a comprehensive [[Analytical quality control|AQC]] exercise was conducted to ensure comparability of data derived from the monitoring programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1979/AN/an9790400290 Analytical Quality Control in the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The scheme was originally intended to operate for 10 years from 1974 to 1984 to provide date to the Department of the Environment to permit the identification of national trends in water quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/research/completed-research/reports/dwi0224.pdf Co-ordination of analytical control for DOE Harmonised monitoring scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also intended to satisfy the acquirements of the EU decision on the exchange of monitoring data requirements.

==Operation==
The scheme is administered by the [[Environment Agency]] in [[England]], by [[Natural Resources Wales]] in [[Wales]] and by [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]] in [[Scotland]] and involves routine monitoring at 230 sites including 56 river systems in Scotland.

==Data==
The data produced by the scheme provides a continuous and consistent record of quality of rivers across the UK for more than 30 years and can be used to demonstrate changes in water quality over that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepa.org.uk/science_and_research/data_and_reports/water/scottish_river_water_quality.aspx SEPA -Scottish River water quality trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8537">{{hatnote|This articles deals with methodology. For the study of population in different parts of the world see [[Demographic history]].}}

'''Historical demography''' is the [[quantitative study]] of [[human population]] in the past. It is concerned with population size, with the three basic components of population change--[[fertility]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], and  [[Human migration|migration]], and with population characteristics related to those components, such as marriage, [[socioeconomic status]], and the configuration of families.

==Sources==
The sources of historical demography vary according to the period and topics of the study.

For the recent period - beginning in the early nineteenth century in most European countries, and later in the rest of the world - historical demographers make use of data collected by governments, including [[census]]es and [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]].&lt;ref name="EoPH"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/historical-demography Historical Demography] in [[Encyclopedia of Public Health]], Retrieved on 3 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early modern period, historical demographers rely heavily on ecclesiastical records of baptisms, marriages, and burials, using methods developed by French historian [[Louis Henry]], as well as hearth and poll tax records.

For population size, sources can also include the size of cities and towns, the size and density of smaller settlements, relying on [[field survey]] techniques, the presence or absence of agriculture on [[marginal land]], and inferences from historical records. For population health and life expectancy, [[paleodemography]], based on the study of skeletal remains, is another important approach for populations that precede the modern era, as is the study of ages of death recorded on funerary monuments.

The PUMS (Public User Microdata Samples) data set allows researchers to analyze contemporary and historical data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Andrews, "Public User Microdata Samples (PUMS): Do-lt-Yourself Census Data." ''Indiana Libraries'' (2014) 13#2 pp: 19-26. [https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/IndianaLibraries/article/viewFile/16733/pdf_198 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of  techniques==
Historical analysis has played a central role in the study of population, from [[Thomas Malthus]] in the eighteenth century to major twentieth-century demographers such as [[Ansley Coale]] and [[Samuel H. Preston]]. The French historian [[Louis Henry]] (1911-1991) was chiefly responsible for the development of historical demography as a distinct subfield of demography.&lt;ref name="Rosental"&gt;Paul-André Rosental, [http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=POPE&amp;ID_NUMPUBLIE=POPE_301&amp;ID_ARTICLE=POPE_301_0097 The Novelty of an Old Genre: Louis Henry and the Founding of Historical Demography], ''Population'' (English edition), Volume 58 –2003/1, Retrieved on 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, new research in historical demography has proliferated owing to the development of massive new population data collections, including the Demographic Data Base in Umeå, Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddb.umu.se/index_eng.html, Retrieved on 3 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the Historical Sample of the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iisg.nl/hsn/, Retrieved on 3 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]] (IPUMS).

According to Willigan and Lynch, the main sources used by demographic historians include archaeological methods, parish registers starting about 1500 in Europe, civil registration records, enumerations, national [[census]] beginning about 1800, genealogies and family reconstruction studies, population registers,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Cotts Watkins and Myron P. Gutmann. "Methodological issues in the use of population registers for fertility analysis." ''Historical Methods: A Journal of Quantitative and Interdisciplinary History'' (1983) 16#3: 109-120.&lt;/ref&gt; and organizational and institutional records.  Statistical methods have included model life tables, time series analysis, event history analysis, causal model building and hypothesis testing, As well as theories of the demographic transition and the epidemiological transition.&lt;ref&gt;Willigan and  Lynch, ''Sources and methods of historical demography'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David S. Reher, and Roger Schofield. ''Old and new methods in historical demography'' (Clarendon Press 1993), 426 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hunza diet''' consists of a series of selective food and drink intake practiced by the [[Hunza people]] of northern [[Pakistan]] that is argued by some to be unique and have long lasting effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undergroundhealthreporter.com/hunza-diet-health-weight-loss/|title=You Are What You Eat…Hunza Diet Provides Longevity and Happiness - Underground Health Reporter|first=Danica|last=Collins|website=undergroundhealthreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcvitamins.com/diets/hunza-diet.htm|title=The Hunza Diet|website=mcvitamins.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet mostly consists of raw food including nuts, fruits and seeds added with yogurt. The cooked meal, [[Dal|daal]] included with [[chappati]], is included for dinner. It has also been advocated for being inexpensive and mostly self-producible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/01/12-diets-in-12-months-the-hunza-diet/|title=12 Diets In 12 Months: The Hunza Diet|first=Rae|last=Johnston|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
The late Irish Dr Macarrison is believed to have traveled to this area during the days of the [[British Raj]] and tested this diet on rats in England. The results are claimed to have given the rats longer lasting lives.&lt;ref name="Luhrs1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Luhrs|title=The Simple Living Guide: A Sourcebook for Less Stressful, More Joyful Living|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WMbySartXcC&amp;pg=PA273|year=1997|publisher=Broadway Books|isbn=978-0-553-06796-5|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book about the Hunza, Jay Hoffman argued that by the ratio to cats, dogs and horses, humans should live up to 120 to 150 years and argues the Hunza diet to be the key to this longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Hunza: Secrets of the World's Healthiest and Oldest Living People|author=Jay M.

==Opponents==
While the Hunza bread is agreed to be cost-effective, it is also argued to be low in calories. It is prepared by adding two cups of flour, one cup of wheat flour, one quarter cup of wheat germ, one pack of active dry yeast, one quarter pack of light or dark brown sugar, one teaspoon of organic honey, one teaspoon of salt in addition to one quarter teaspoon of ground ginger as well as half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Three quarters of optional dried fruit must be added followed by one and a half cup of water. Two tablespoons of butter are also recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dietbites.com/article1095.html|title=Hunza Bread, Diet Recipe|website=www.dietbites.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}

An '''idler-wheel''' drive is a system used to transmit the rotation of the main shaft of a motor to another rotating device, for example the platter of a record-reproducing [[Phonograph|turntable]] or the crankshaft-to-camshaft gear train of an automobile.

==Friction drive==
An idler-wheel may be used as part of a [[friction drive]] mechanism, as in a [[phonograph]], or as a [[belt tensioner]] in a [[Belt (mechanical)|belt drive]] system.

==Idler gear==
[[File:Gears large.jpg|thumb|Gears in a machine. The middle, medium-sized gear is an idler gear.|alt=Part of a machine with three gears connected to one another.]]
An idler gear is a gear wheel that is inserted between two or more other gear wheels. The purpose of an idler gear can be two-fold. Firstly, the idler gear will change the direction of rotation of the output shaft. Secondly, an idler gear can assist to reduce the size of the input/output gears whilst maintaining the spacing of the shafts.

===Gear ratio===
An idler gear does not affect the [[gear ratio]] between the input and output shafts. Note that in a sequence of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. But, of course, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.

Likewise, the size of an idler wheel in a non-geared friction drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the output shaft. A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input shaft), therefore the output shaft is driven at a constant speed regardless of the size of the idler wheel (unless of course there is slippage, which should nor occur in most friction drive systems when operating correctly; however, there are instances where an idler wheel can double as a clutch, or if there is a sudden or unusually heavy load on the system. These situations can cause the ratio of rotations between the wheels to vary, unlike a gear system, which will always rotate at a certain rate unless something is very wrong and the gears starts skipping teeth, or teeth are broken off).

===Applications===
;Reversing
An intermediate gear which does not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an idler gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be referred to as a reverse idler. For instance, the typical [[automobile]] [[manual transmission]] engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears. Since a driven gear (gear "A") rotating clockwise will drive a second gear ("B") counterclockwise, adding a third gear to the string means that gear "C" will be spinning the same direction as "A". A typical transmission is designed with "A" and "B" gears, so when the engine spins, the outputs shaft spins the ''opposite'' direction, which drives the vehicle ''forward''. A reverse idler gear setup is actually typically an "A" and a "C" gear, which are not in contact with each other until a "B" gear is moved between them. Since the transmission is designed to move the car ''forwards'' when the output is spinning in the ''opposite'' direction from the input shaft, when added to the "B" idler gear, it forces the "C" gear to spin in the same direction as the "A" gear, and thus the input and output shafts are spinning in the same direction, which drives the car in reverse.

Another scenario is a series of rollers, such as used for pressing paper. Each roller has to be powered, but adding a motor to each one is wasteful (and it can be difficult to synchronize rotational speed with independent drive systems). One could simply add a gear onto the end of the shaft of each roller, but that means that each roller would be spinning the opposite direction of the one before (and therefore rubbing against each other as the turn). By simply adding a small idler gear between each larger gear, the result is a series of rollers, all being powered in the same direction.

;Transmission over distance
Idler gears can also transmit rotation among distant shafts in situations where it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, but the mass and rotational inertia ([[moment of inertia]]) of a gear is [[quadratic function|quadratic]] in proportion to its [[radius]]. Instead of idler gears, of course, a [[toothed belt]] or a [[roller chain]] can be used to transmit torque over distance. For short distances, a train of idlers may be used; whether an odd or even number is used determines whether the final output gear rotates the same direction as the input gear or not. For longer distances, a roller chain or belt is quieter and creates less friction, although gears are typically stronger, depending on the strength of the roller chain. A case where numerous idler gears might be used is as described above, where there are a number of output gears that need to be driven simultaneously.

[[Continuous track|'''Caterpillar track''']] '''idler wheels'''

A tracked vehicle uses a combination of wheels and rollers, including [[Sprocket|''drive sprockets'']], ''idler wheels'', ''track return rollers'' and ''road wheels''. It is quite similar in concept to a [[conveyor belt]], only instead of a machine carrying objects on top of a powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a [[Sprocket|''drive sprocket'']] (or drive wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On the opposite end of the vehicle, there is an ''idler wheel'', which provides a [[pulley|pulley wheel]]  of sorts. On some applications, the drive sprocket and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the drive sprocket and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the drive sprocket is on the front (see [[M4 Sherman]] for an example). Since the drive sprocket can be at either the front (M4 Sherman, many other WWII tanks) or the rear ([[T-90]], most modern tanks) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the drive sprocket (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the drive sprocket and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its ''rotation''), this has nothing to do with the term "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The ''road wheels'' are a series of non-powered wheels between the drive sprocket and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the drive sprocket, in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. ''Track return rollers'' may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid "road" for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created "road", while the drive sprocket forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down "fresh" track. The idler picks the "used" track back up, and returns it back to the drive sprocket in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a "track-laying machine" (not to be confused with [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see [[corduroy road]], [[plank road]]). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.

Note that there are some non-powered tracked transports (i.e. [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two idler wheels rather than a drive sprocket. There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the [[Caterpillar D9]] bulldozer (and numerous other Caterpillar brand bulldozers), [[Tucker Sno-Cat|Tucker Sno-cat]] and [[Mattracks Inc.|Mattracks]] rubber track conversion kits, which configure their tracks in the shape of a triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the drive sprocket at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one drive sprocket (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-[[axle]] truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic [[half-track]] system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on true tracked vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.

The '''instrumental temperature record''' provides the [[temperature]] of Earth's [[climate|climate system]] from the historical network of [[in situ]] measurements of surface air temperatures and ocean surface temperatures. Data are collected at thousands of meteorological stations, buoys and ships around the globe. The longest-running temperature record is the [[Central England temperature]] data series, which starts in 1659. The longest-running quasi-global record starts in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brohan, P., J.J. Kennedy, I. Harris, S.F.B. Tett, P.D.

== Total warming and trends ==

The global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature, show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C, in the period 1880 to 2012, based on multiple independently produced datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IPCC AR5|title=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (WGI AR5)|url=[http://www.climatechange2013.org/ WGI AR5]  [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_ALL_FINAL.pdf Full Report PDF, p.5]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a trend of 0.064 ± 0.015&amp;nbsp;°C per decade over that period. The trend is faster for land than ocean, faster for Arctic regions, and faster since the 1970s than the longer period.

=== Warming in the instrumental temperature record ===

Most of the observed warming occurred in two periods: around 1900 to around 1940 and around 1970 onwards;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 Chapter 2 page 193]&lt;/ref&gt; the cooling/plateau from 1940 to 1970 has been mostly attributed to [[Sulfate#Environmental effects|sulphate aerosol]].&lt;ref&gt;

Attribution of the temperature change to natural or anthropogenic (i.e., [[Anthropogenic climate change|human-induced]]) factors is an important question: see [[global warming]] and [[attribution of recent climate change]].

Land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures. Over 1979 to 2012 the trend for land was about 0.254 ± 0.050&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per CruTemp4 or 0.273 ± 0.047 per GHCN while the trend for sea surface temperatures is about 0.072 ± 0.024&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per HadISST to 0.124 ± 0.030&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per HadSST3.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 2 page 187 and page 192]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1979 to 2012, the linear warming trend for combined land and sea temperatures has been 0.155&amp;nbsp;°C [0.122 to 0.188&amp;nbsp;°C] per decade according to AR5.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 2 p193]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report found that the instrumental temperature record for the past century included urban heat island effects but that these were primarily local, having a negligible influence on global temperature trends (less than 0.006&amp;nbsp;°C per decade over land and zero over the oceans).&lt;ref name="trenberth summary of observations"&gt;

While record-breaking years can attract considerable public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend. Some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to "warmest year" statistics; for example, [[Gavin Schmidt]] stated "the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or not."&lt;ref name="Gavin Schmidt 201501"&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmidt |first=Gavin |authorlink=Gavin Schmidt | title=Thoughts on 2014 and ongoing temperature trends | website=RealClimate | date=22 January 2015 | url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2015/01/thoughts-on-2014-and-ongoing-temperature-trends/ | accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the 2015 and 2016 records, Schmidt stated that the [[2014–16 El Niño event]] was "a factor ... but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it"; he attributed about 90% of the warming in 2016 to [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|title = 2016 hottest year ever recorded – and scientists say human activity to blame|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/18/2016-hottest-year-ever-recorded-and-scientists-say-human-activity-to-blame|first = Damian|last = Carrington|date = January 19, 2017|accessdate = January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent with Schmidt's comment, the NASA / NOAA announcement stated that "[g]lobally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean" and that the impact of El Niño warming was estimated to have "increased the annual global temperature anomaly for 2016 by 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.12 degrees Celsius)."&lt;ref name = NASA-NOAA2016&gt;{{cite press release|url = https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-data-show-2016-warmest-year-on-record-globally|title = NASA, NOAA Data Show 2016 Warmest Year on Record Globally|date = January 19, 2017|accessdate = January 20, 2017|first1 = Sean|last1 = Potter|first2 = Michael|last2 = Cabbage|first3 = Leslie|last3 = McCarthy|publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comments from climate scientists reported in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' showed strong agreement in attributing the warming primarily to anthropogenic climate change, with some contribution from El Niño warming, though there were differing views on the significance of individual records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Scientists react to Earth's warmest year: 'We are heading into a new unknown'|first = Jason|last = Samenow|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/01/18/scientists-react-to-earths-warmest-year-we-are-heading-into-a-new-unknown/|date = January 18, 2017|accessdate = January 20, 2017|newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Deke Arndt]] leads the monitoring group at NOAA's [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] and offered an analogy in a report on [[NPR]]: "The long-term warming is a lot like riding up an escalator over time.

==Influences on global temperature==

{{Main article|Global warming|Attribution of recent climate change}}

[[Greenhouse gas]]es trap outgoing radiation warming the atmosphere which in turn warms the land.

[[El Niño]] generally tends to increase global temperatures. [[La Niña]], on the other hand, usually causes years which are cooler than the short-term average.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2014/13 | title = NOAA National Climatic Data Center, State of the Climate: Global Analysis for Annual 2014 | accessdate = 2015-01-21 | publisher = [[NOAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Niño is the warm phase of the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) and La Niña the cold phase.

[[Aerosols]] diffuse incoming radiation generally cooling the planet. Volcanoes are the largest source but there are also anthropogenic sources. There are several other effects such as clouds. Some aerosols like carbon black have warming effects.

[[Land use]] change like deforestation can increase greenhouse gases through burning [[biomass]]. [[Albedo]] can also be changed.

[[Solar irradiance|Incoming solar radiation]] varies very slightly, with the main variation controlled by the approximately 11-year [[Solar cycle|solar magnetic activity cycle]].

==Absolute temperatures v. anomalies==

Records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as [[:wikt:anomaly|anomalies]] rather than as absolute temperatures. A temperature anomaly is measured against a reference value or long-term average.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the reference value is 15&amp;nbsp;°C, and the measured temperature is 17&amp;nbsp;°C, then the temperature anomaly is +2&amp;nbsp;°C (i.e., 17&amp;nbsp;°C −15&amp;nbsp;°C).

Temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances (of the order of 1000&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances. By comparison, absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances.

The Earth's average surface absolute temperature for the 1961–1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land, oceans and sea ice regions, with a best estimate of 14&amp;nbsp;°C (57.2&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="jonesreview"&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones PD, New M, Parker DE, Martin S, Rigor IG |date=1999 |title=Surface air temperature and its changes over the past 150 years |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1029/1999RG900002/abstract |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=173–199 |doi=10.1029/1999RG900002 |bibcode=1999RvGeo..37..173J }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate is uncertain, but probably lies within 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C of the true value.&lt;ref name="jonesreview" /&gt; Given the difference in uncertainties between this absolute value and any annual anomaly, it's not valid to add them together to imply a precise absolute value for a specific year.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/abs_temp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global record from 1850 ==

The period for which reasonably reliable instrumental records of near-surface temperature exist with quasi-global coverage is generally considered to begin around 1850. Earlier records exist, but with sparser coverage and less standardized instrumentation.

The temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships. On land, temperature sensors are kept in a [[Stevenson screen]] or a [[MMTS (meteorology)|maximum minimum temperature system]] (MMTS). The sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets. The land and marine records can be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-6.htm | title=Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis – Figure 2.6 | publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] | author=[[John T.

Most meteorological observations are taken for use in weather forecasts. Centers such as [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts|ECMWF]] show [http://www.ecmwf.int/products/forecasts/d/overview/monitoring/coverage/dcover!ssmi!00!pop!od!oper!w_coverage!latest!obs/ instantaneous map of their coverage]; or the Hadley Centre show the coverage for the [http://www.meto.gov.uk/research/hadleycentre/CR_data/Annual/HadCRUTanm_2000.gif average of the year 2000]. Coverage for earlier in the 20th and 19th centuries would be significantly less. While temperature changes vary both in size and direction from one location to another, the numbers from different locations are combined to produce an estimate of a global average change.

Temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world's surface except for Atlantic Ocean south of Greenland, the [[southeastern United States]], and parts of [[Bolivia]]. Warming is strongest over inland areas in Asia and North America as well as south-eastern Brazil and some areas in the South Atlantic and Indian oceans.

Since 1979 temperature increase is considerably stronger over land while cooling has been observed over some oceanic regions in the Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere; the spatial pattern of ocean temperature trend in those regions is possibly related to the [[Pacific Decadal Oscillation]] and [[Antarctic oscillation|Southern Annular Mode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter3.pdf|format=PDF|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Chapter 3|accessdate=2009-03-14|date=2007-02-05|pages=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal temperature trends are positive over most of the globe but weak cooling is observed over the mid latitudes of the southern ocean but also over eastern Canada in spring because of strengthening of the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]]. Warming is stronger over northern Europe, China and North America in winter, Europe and Asia interior in spring, Europe and north Africa in summer and northern North America, Greenland and eastern Asia in autumn.
Enhanced warming over north Eurasia is partly linked to the [[Arctic oscillation|Northern Annular Mode]],&lt;ref name="Polyakov 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polyakov |first=I.V. |first2=R.V. |last2=Bekryaev |first3=U.S. |last3=Bhatt |first4=R.L. |last4=Colony |first5=A.P. |last5=Maskshtas |first6=D. |last6=Walsh |first7=R.V. |last7=Bekryaev |first8=G.V. |last8=Alekseev |year=2003 |title=Variability and trends of air temperature in the Maritime Arctic |journal=J.

The most recent climate model simulations give a range of results for changes in global-average temperature. Some models show more warming in the troposphere than at the surface, while a slightly smaller number of simulations show the opposite behaviour. There is no fundamental inconsistency among these model results and observations at the global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/tmlw0602.pdf Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere – Understanding and Reconciling Differences]&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite records used to show much smaller warming trends for the troposphere which were considered to disagree with model prediction; however, following revisions to the satellite records, the trends are now similar.

The IPCC fifth assessment report concluded "assessment of the large body of studies comparing various long-term radiosonde and MSU products since AR4 is hampered by data set version changes, and inherent data uncertainties. These factors substantially limit the ability to draw robust and consistent inferences from such studies about the true long-term trends or the value of different data products".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC 5AR WG1 Chapter 2 page 196]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet addiction disorder (IAD)''', also known as '''problematic Internet use''' or '''pathological Internet use''', is excessive [[Internet]] use that interferes with daily life. Addiction, defined by Webster Dictionary as a "compulsive need for and use of a habit-forming substance characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal", was traditionally used to depict a person's dependence on the substance. More recently, the concept has been applied to behavioral dependence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Constance|date=2001-11-02|title='Behavioral' Addictions: Do They Exist?|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5544/980|journal=Science|volume=294|issue=5544|pages=980–982|doi=10.1126/science.294.5544.980|issn=0036-8075|pmid=11691967}}&lt;/ref&gt; including internet use.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caught in the net : how to recognize the signs of Internet addiction--and a winning strategy for recovery|last=S.|first=Young, Kimberly|date=1998|publisher=J. Wiley|isbn=9780471191599|location=New York|oclc=38130573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of Internet addiction evolves together with the development and spread of the Internet. As adolescents (12–17 years) and emerging adults (18–29 years) access the Internet more than any other age groups and undertake a higher risk of overuse of the Internet, the problem of Internet addiction disorder is most relevant to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=E.

Excessive use of the Internet has been found by various studies to disrupt individuals' time use and have a series of health consequences. But the existence of Internet addiction as a mental disorder is not yet well recognized. The current version of ''[[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)]]'' noted that Internet gaming disorder (one type of IAD) is a condition that requires more research in order to be considered as a full disorder in 2013.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campanella|first=M.|last2=Mucci|first2=F.|last3=Baroni|first3=S.|last4=Nardi|first4=L.|last5=Marazziti|first5=D.|date=2015|title=Prevalence of Internet Addiction: A Pilot Study in a Group of Italian Students|script-title=|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/723c/c63367664ab92115bfa4f6ba02b71346f4bb.pdf|journal=Clinical Neuropsychiatry|volume=4|pages=90–93|citeseerx=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==

=== Internet Addiction In Nepal ===
Even though the world is innovating a new technology everyday, people are being addicted to the vast source of opportunities i.e internet. Today, it has differ so much regarding the purpose of the innovation of such technologies and how they are being used by the people.  According to the NTA report, one in Two Nepalese uses internet. A research shows that [https://www.anilpathak.com.np/2018/02/why-nepalese-students-should-do-blogging.html internet addiction is high] among the undergraduates in Nepal.

=== Complications ===

==== Health consequences ====
'''Mental health consequences'''

A longitudinal study of Chinese high school students (2010) suggests that individuals with moderate to severe risk of Internet addiction are 2.5 times more likely to develop depressive symptoms than their IA-free counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lam|first=Lawrence T.|last2=Peng|first2=Zi-Wen|date=2010-10-04|title=Effect of Pathological Use of the Internet on Adolescent Mental Health|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/383813|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|volume=164|issue=10|pages=901–6|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.159|pmid=20679157|issn=1072-4710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brain function consequences'''

Using an age- and gender-matched Chinese adolescent sample, Yan Zhou and associates (2009) demonstrate that IA adolescents have a lower [[gray matter]] density in the "left anterior cingulate cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex, left insula, and left lingual gyrus" than adolescents in the control group, indicating the presence of brain structural changes in Internet addicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-07-01|title=Gray matter abnormalities in Internet addiction: A voxel-based morphometry study|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X09005890|journal=European Journal of Radiology|volume=79|issue=1|pages=92–95|doi=10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.10.025|pmid=19926237|issn=0720-048X|author=Zhou Yan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results have been confirmed by CB Weng and colleagues (2011) with a group of 17-year-olds who were diagnosed [[Online game addiction|online game addiction (OGA)]] and another group without addiction. In their study, adolescents who were addicted had "lower gray matter volume in left orbitofrontal cortex, left medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral insula, left posterior cingulate cortex, and left supplementary motor area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weng|first=CB|last2=Qian|first2=RB|last3=Fu|first3=XM|last4=Lin|first4=B|last5=Ji|first5=XB|last6=Niu|first6=CS|last7=Wang|first7=YH|date=2012|title=[A voxel-based morphometric analysis of brain gray matter in online game addicts].|journal=Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi|volume=92|issue=45|pages=3221–3|issn=0376-2491|via=|pmid=23328472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social consequences ====
The best-documented evidence of Internet addiction so far is time-disruption, which subsequently results in interference with regular social life, including academic, professional performance and daily routines.&lt;ref name=":332"/&gt; Some studies also reveal that IA can lead to disruption of social relationships in Europe and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=":292"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is, however, also noted by others that IA is beneficial for peer relations in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chin-Chung|first=Lin|last2=Tsai|first2=Sunny S. J.|date=1999|title=Internet Addiction among High Schoolers in Taiwan|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED437912|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Keith W. Beard (2005) articulates that "an individual is addicted when an individual’s psychological state, which includes both mental and emotional states, as well as their scholastic, occupational and social interactions, is impaired by the overuse of [Internet]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beard|first=Keith W.|date=2005-02-01|title=Internet Addiction: A Review of Current Assessment Techniques and Potential Assessment Questions|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=8|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1089/cpb.2005.8.7|pmid=15738688|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of its complex nature, some scholars do not provide a definition of Internet addiction disorder and throughout time, different terms are used to describe the same phenomenon of excessive Internet use.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Internet addiction disorder is used interchangeably with '''problematic Internet use''', '''pathological Internet use''', and '''Internet addictive disorder'''. In some cases, this behavior is also referred to as '''Internet overuse''', '''problematic computer use''', '''compulsive Internet use''', '''Internet abuse''', '''harmful use of the Internet''', and '''Internet dependency'''.

'''Physical Symptoms'''

Physical Symptoms include a weakened immune system due to lack of sleep. Loss of exercise, increased risk for Carpel Tunnel Syndrome and eye and back strain.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Larry D., et al. "Social Networking Is Addictive and Can Lead to Psychological Disorders." ''Are Social Networking Sites Harmful?'', edited by Noah Berlatsky, Greenhaven Press, 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Withdrawal'''

Symptoms of withdrawal might include agitation, depression, anger and anxiety when the person is away from technology. These psychological symptoms might even turn into physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, tense shoulders and shortness of breath.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Larry D., et al. "Social Networking Is Addictive and Can Lead to Psychological Disorders." ''Are Social Networking Sites Harmful?'', edited by Noah Berlatsky, Greenhaven Press, 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

====Online gambling addiction====
According to David Hodgins, a professor of psychology at the University of Calgary, online gambling is considered to be as serious as pathological gambling. It is known as an "isolated disorder" which means that those who have a gambling problem prefer to separate themselves from interruptions and distractions. Because gambling is available online, it increases the opportunity for problem gamblers to indulge in gambling without social influences swaying their decisions. This is why this disorder has become more a problem at this date in time and is why it is so difficult to overcome. The opportunity to gamble online is almost always available in this century opposed to only having the opportunity in a public forum at casinos for example. Online gambling has become quite popular especially with today's adolescents. Today's youth has a greater knowledge of modern software and search engines along with a greater need for extra money. So not only is it easier for them to find opportunities to gamble over any subject, but the incentive to be granted this money is desperately desired.

====Online gaming addiction (Internet gaming disorder)====
{{Main|Video game addiction}}
[[Video game addiction]] is a known issue around the world. Incidence and severity grew in the 2000s, with the advent of broadband technology, games allowing for the creation of avatars, 'second life' games, and MMORPGs ([[massive multiplayer online role playing games]]). World of Warcraft has the largest MMORPG community on-line and there have been a number of studies about the addictive qualities of the game. Addicts of the game range from children to mature adults. A well-known example is Ryan van Cleave, a university professor whose life declined as he became involved in online gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Lush, Tamara|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/29/world-of-warcraft-video-game-addict|title=At war with World of Warcraft|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=2012-03-15|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Doan, MD, PhD, a physician with a research background in neuroscience, battled his own addictions with video games, investing over 20,000 hours of playing games over a period of nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hooked-on-games.com/about-the-book.html|title=About|author1=Andrew Doan |author2=Brooke Strickland |work=hooked-on-games.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online gaming addiction may be considered in terms of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s theory of [[operant conditioning]], which claims that the frequency of a given behaviour is directly linked to rewarding and punishment of that behavior. If a behaviour is rewarded, it is more likely to be repeated. If it is punished, it becomes suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickyee.com/eqt/skinner.html|title=The Virtual Skinner Box|accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orzack, a clinical psychologist at McLean Hospital in Massachusetts claims that 40 percent of World of Warcraft (WoW) players are addicted. Orzack says that the best way to optimize the desired behaviour in the subject is to provide rewards for correct behaviour, and then adjust the number of times the subject is required to exhibit that behaviour before a reward is provided. For instance, if a rat must press a bar to receive food, then it will press faster and more often if it doesn't know how many times it needs to press the bar. An equivalent in [[World of Warcraft]] would be purple (epic) [[Looting (gaming)|loot drops]].&lt;ref name = "doctor"&gt;{{cite web|author=Reimer, Jeremy|title=Doctor claims 40 percent of World of Warcraft players are addicted|work=ARS Technica|date= August 2006|accessdate=2012-03-15|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/08/7459/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players in World of Warcraft will often spend weeks hunting for a special item which is based on a chance system, sometimes with only a 0.01% chance of it being dropped by a slain monster. The rarity of the item and difficulty of acquiring the item gives the player a status amongst their peers once they obtain the item.

[[Online Gamers Anonymous]], an American non-profit organization formed in 2002, is a twelve-step, self-help, support and recovery organization for gamers and their loved ones who are suffering from the adverse effects of addictive computer gaming. It offers resources such as discussion forums, online chat meetings, Skype meetings and links to other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Gamers Anonymous [12-step support group]|url=http://olganon.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://internetandtechaa.wordpress.com/ Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous (ITAA)] founded in 2009, is a 12-step program supporting users coping with digital distractions.

Jim Rossignol, a finance journalist who reports on Internet gaming has described how he overcame his own addiction, and channeled his compulsion into a desirable direction as a reporter of Internet gaming and gaming culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rossignol, Jim|year=2009|title=The Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472033973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Communication addiction disorder (compulsive talking)====
{{Main|Communication addiction disorder}}
Communication addiction disorder (CAD) is a supposed behavioral disorder related to the necessity of being in constant communication with other people, even when there is no practical necessity for such communication. CAD had been linked to Internet addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J.B. (1999) [http://psychcentral.com/archives/walther_cad.pdf "Communication Addiction Disorder: Concern over media, behavior and effects] [APA conference talk]".&lt;/ref&gt; Users become addicted to the social elements of the Internet, such as Facebook and YouTube. Users become addicted to one-on-one or group communication in the form of social support, relationships and entertainment. However interference with these activities can result in conflict and guilt. This kind of addiction is called '''social network addiction'''.

Social network addiction is a dependence of people by connection, updating and control of their and their friends social network page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Echeburua E. |author2=de Corral P. | year = 2010 | title = Addiction to new technologies and to online social networking in young people: A new challenge | url = | journal = Adicciones | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 91–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Virtual reality addiction====
{{Main|Virtual reality addiction}}
Virtual reality addiction is an addiction to the use of virtual reality or virtual, immersive environments. Currently, interactive virtual media (such as social networks) are referred to as virtual reality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William H. Davidow|title=Interactive technologies give us a quick fix, and that's not a good thing|work=IEEE Spectrum|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gadgets/virtual-reality-is-addictive-and-unhealthy|date= 31 Jul 2012|accessdate=29 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas future virtual reality refers to computer-simulated, immersive environments or worlds. [https://www.netaddictionrecovery.com/our-mission/press-release/603-pr-dangers-of-vr-gaming.html Experts warn about the dangers of virtual reality], and compare the use of virtual reality (both in its current and future form) to the use of drugs, bringing with these comparisons the concern that, like drugs, users could possibly become addicted to virtual reality.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Social factors ===
'''Interpersonal difficulties'''

It is argued that interpersonal difficulties such as introversion, social problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebeling-Witte|first=Susan|last2=Frank|first2=Michael L.|last3=Lester|first3=David|date=2007-10-01|title=Shyness, Internet Use, and Personality|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=10|issue=5|pages=713–716|doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.9964|pmid=17927542|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poor face-to-face communication skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leung|first=Louis|date=2007-04-01|title=Stressful Life Events, Motives for Internet Use, and Social Support Among Digital Kids|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=10|issue=2|pages=204–214|doi=10.1089/cpb.2006.9967|pmid=17474837|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt; often lead to internet addiction. Internet-based relationships offer a safe alternative for people with aforementioned difficulties to escape from the potential rejections and anxieties of interpersonal real-life contact.&lt;ref name=":37"/&gt;

'''A lack of social support'''

Individuals who lack sufficient social connection and social support are found to run a higher risk of Internet addiction. They resort to virtual relationships and support to alleviate their loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morahan-Martin|first=Janet|date=1999-10-01|title=The Relationship Between Loneliness and Internet Use and Abuse|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=2|issue=5|pages=431–439|doi=10.1089/cpb.1999.2.431|pmid=19178216|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=b69ae0ef-0cde-4967-ba0b-8b4390f3368f@sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=25121069&amp;db=a9h|title=Excessive Internet Use: The Role of Personality, Loneliness and Social Supp...: Discovery Service for University of Chicago.|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of fact, the most prevalent applications among Internet addicts are chat rooms, interactive games, instant messaging, or social media.&lt;ref name=":37"/&gt; Some empirical studies reveal that conflict between parents and children and not living with mother significantly associated with IA after one year.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ko|first=Chih-Hung|last2=Yen|first2=Ju-Yu|last3=Chen|first3=Cheng-Sheng|last4=Yeh|first4=Yi-Chun|last5=Yen|first5=Cheng-Fang|date=2009-10-05|title=Predictive Values of Psychiatric Symptoms for Internet Addiction in Adolescents|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/382237|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|volume=163|issue=10|pages=937–43|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.159|pmid=19805713|issn=1072-4710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protective factors such as quality communication between parents and children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eijnden|first=Regina J.

=== Psychological factors ===
Prior addictive or psychiatric history are found to influence the likelihood of being addicted to the Internet.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Sun-Mi|last2=Sung|first2=Min-Je|last3=Shin|first3=Kyoung-Min|last4=Lim|first4=Ki Young|last5=Shin|first5=Yun-Mi|date=2013-08-01|title=Does Psychopathology in Childhood Predict Internet Addiction in Male Adolescents?|journal=Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development|volume=44|issue=4|pages=549–555|doi=10.1007/s10578-012-0348-4|pmid=23242708|issn=0009-398X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals with prior psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety turn to compulsive behaviors to avoid the unpleasant emotions and situation of their psychiatric problems and regard being addicted to the Internet a safer alternative to substance addictive tendency. But it is generally unclear from existing research which is the cause and which is the effect partially due to the fact that comorbidity is common among Internet addicts.

The most common co-morbidities that have been linked to IAD  are major depression and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD). The rate of ADHD and IAD associating is as high as 51.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Przepiorka|first=Aneta Małgorzata|last2=Blachnio|first2=Agata|last3=Miziak|first3=Barbara|last4=Czuczwar|first4=Stanisław Jerzy|date=2014-04|title=Clinical approaches to treatment of Internet addiction|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharep.2013.10.001|journal=Pharmacological Reports|volume=66|issue=2|pages=187–191|doi=10.1016/j.pharep.2013.10.001|issn=1734-1140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet addicts with no previous significant addictive or psychiatric history are argued to develop an addiction to the some of the features of Internet use: anonymity, easy accessibility, and its interactive nature.&lt;ref name=":37"/&gt;

=== Biological factors ===
Most recent research has focused on the biological causes of Internet addiction. For a systematic review of the kind, please refer to the 2017 Springer book edited by Christian Montag and Martin Reuter: '''''Internet Addiction: Neuroscientific Approaches and Therapeutical Implications Including Smartphone Addiction (3nd edition)'''''.

=== Other factors ===
Parental educational level, age at first use of the Internet, and the frequency of using social networking sites and gaming sites are found to be positively associated with excessive Internet use among adolescents in some European countries, as well as in the USA.&lt;ref name=":292"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsitsika|first=Artemis|last2=Janikian|first2=Mari|last3=Schoenmakers|first3=Tim M.|last4=Tzavela|first4=Eleni C.|last5=Ólafsson|first5=Kjartan|last6=Wójcik|first6=Szymon|last7=Macarie|first7=George Florian|last8=Tzavara|first8=Chara|last9=Richardson|first9=Clive|date=2014-05-22|title=Internet Addictive Behavior in Adolescence: A Cross-Sectional Study in Seven European Countries|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=17|issue=8|pages=528–535|doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0382|pmid=24853789|issn=2152-2715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramachandran|first=Shankar|date=2015-10-01|title= Technology: Smart tablet or just a new drug?

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of Internet addiction disorder is empirically difficult. Various screening instruments have been employed to detect Internet addiction disorder. Current diagnoses are faced with multiple obstacles.

=== Difficulties ===
Given the newness of the Internet and the inconsistent definition of Internet addiction disorder, practical diagnosis is far from clearcut. With the first research initiated by Kimberly S. Young in 1996, the scientific study of Internet addiction has merely existed for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Internet Addiction|last=Brand|first=Matthias|date=2017|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319462752|series=Studies in Neuroscience, Psychology and Behavioral Economics|pages=19–34|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-46276-9_2|chapter = Theoretical Models of the Development and Maintenance of Internet Addiction}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few obstacles are present in creating an applicable diagnostic method for Internet addiction disorder.
* ''Wide and extensive use of the Internet:'' Diagnosing Internet addiction is often more complex than substance addiction as internet use has largely evolved into be an integral or necessary part of human lives. The addictive or problematic use of the internet is thus easily masked or justified.&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Internet Addiction|last=Young|first=Kimberly|date=2017|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319462752|series=Studies in Neuroscience, Psychology and Behavioral Economics|pages=3–18|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-46276-9_1|chapter = The Evolution of Internet Addiction Disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Internet is largely a pro-social, interactive, and information-driven medium, while other established addiction behaviors such as gambling are often seen as a single, anti-social behavior that has very little socially redeeming value. Many so-called Internet addicts do not suffer from the same damage to health and relationships that are common to established addictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/01/fashion/thursdaystyles/hooked-on-the-web-help-is-on-the-way.html|title=Hooked on the Web: Help Is on the Way|last=Kershaw|first=Sarah|date=2005-12-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Screening instruments ===
'''DSM-based instruments'''

Most of the criteria utilized by research are adaptations of listed mental disorders (e.g., pathological gambling) in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ''(DSM)'']] handbook.&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt;

Dr. Ivan K. Goldberg, who first broached the concept of Internet addiction, adopted a few criteria for IAD on the basis of DSM-IV, including “hoping to increase time on the network” and “dreaming about the network.”&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt;  By adapting the [[DSM-IV codes|DSM-IV]] criteria for [[pathological gambling]], Dr. Kimberly S. Young (1998) proposed one of the first integrated sets of criteria, ''Diagnostic Questionnaire (YDQ)'', to detect Internet addiction. A person who fulfills any '''five''' of the eight adapted criteria would be regarded as Internet addicted:&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Kimberly S.|date=1998-01-01|title=Internet Addiction: The Emergence of a New Clinical Disorder|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=1|issue=3|pages=237–244|doi=10.1089/cpb.1998.1.237|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yellowlees|first=Peter M.|last2=Marks|first2=Shayna|title=Problematic Internet use or Internet addiction?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=23|issue=3|pages=1447–1453|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2005.05.004|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Preoccupation with the Internet;
# A need for increased time spent online to achieve the same amount of satisfaction;
# Repeated efforts to curtail Internet use;
# Irritability, depression, or mood lability when Internet use is limited;
# Staying online longer than anticipated;
# Putting a job or relationship in jeopardy to use the Internet;
# Lying to others about how much time is spent online; and
# Using the Internet as a means of regulating mood.
While Young's YDQ assessment for IA has the advantage of simplicity and ease of use, Keith W. Beard and Eve M. Wolf (2001) further asserted that all of the first five (in the order above) and at least one of the final three criteria (in the order above) be met to delineate Internet addiction in order for a more appropriate and objective assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beard|first=Keith W.|last2=Wolf|first2=Eve M.|date=2001-06-01|title=Modification in the Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Internet Addiction|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=4|issue=3|pages=377–383|doi=10.1089/109493101300210286|pmid=11710263|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young further extended her 8-question YDQ assessment to the now most widely used Internet Addiction Test (IAT),&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":242"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Cecilia|last2=Li|first2=Angel Yee-lam|date=2014-12-01|title=Internet Addiction Prevalence and Quality of (Real) Life: A Meta-Analysis of 31 Nations Across Seven World Regions|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=17|issue=12|pages=755–760|doi=10.1089/cyber.2014.0317|pmid=25489876|issn=2152-2715|pmc=4267764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Widyanto|first=Laura|last2=McMurran|first2=Mary|title=The Psychometric Properties of the Internet Addiction Test|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=7|issue=4|pages=443–450|doi=10.1089/cpb.2004.7.443|pmid=15331031|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of 20 items with each on a 5-point [[Likert scale]]. Questions included on the IAT expand upon Young's earlier 8-question assessment in greater detail and include questions such as "Do you become defensive or secretive when anyone asks you what you do online?" and "Do you find yourself anticipating when you go online again?". A complete list of questions can be found in Dr. Kimberly S. Young's 1998 book '''''Caught in the Net: How to Recognize the Signs of Internet Addiction and A Winning Strategy for Recovery''''' and Drs. Laura Widyanto and Mary McMurran's 2004 article titled '''''The Psychometric Properties of the Internet Addiction Test'''''. The Test score ranges from 20 to 100 and a higher value indicates a more problematic use of the Internet:
* 20–39 = average Internet users,
* 40–69 = potentially problematic Internet users, and

Over time, a considerable number of screening instruments have been developed to diagnose Internet addiction, including the Internet Addiction Test (IAT),&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; the Internet-Related Addictive Behavior Inventory (IRABI),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brenner|first=V.|date=1997|title=Psychology of computer use: XLVII.

Although the various screening methods are developed from diverse contexts, four dimensions manifest themselves across all instruments:&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Northrup|first=Jason C.|last2=Lapierre|first2=Coady|last3=Kirk|first3=Jeffrey|last4=Rae|first4=Cosette|date=2015-07-28|title=The Internet Process Addiction Test: Screening for Addictions to Processes Facilitated by the Internet|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/5/3/341|journal=Behavioral Sciences|volume=5|issue=3|pages=341–352|doi=10.3390/bs5030341|pmid=26226007|pmc=4600140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Excessive use'': compulsive Internet use and excessive online time-use;
* ''Withdrawal symptoms'': withdrawal symptoms including feelings such as depression and anger, given restricted Internet use;
* ''Tolerance'': the need for better equipment, increased internet use, and more applications/software;
* ''Negative repercussions:'' Internet use caused negative consequences in various aspects, including problematic performance in social, academic, or work domains.
More recently, researchers Mark D. Griffiths (2000) and Dr. Jason C. Northrup and colleagues (2015) claim that Internet per se is simply the ''medium'' and that the people are in effect addicted to ''processes'' facilitated by the Internet.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":342"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=M.|date=2000|title=Internet addiction-time to be taken seriously?|url=|journal=Addiction Research|volume=8 | issue = 5 |pages=413–418|via=|doi=10.3109/16066350009005587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT),&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Northrup and associates further decompose the internet addiction measure into four addictive processes: Online video game playing, online social networking, online sexual activity, and web surfing.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Internet Process Addiction Test (IPAT)&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; is created to measure the processes to which individuals are addicted.

Screening methods that heavily rely on DSM criteria have been accused of lacking consensus by some studies, finding that screening results generated from prior measures rooted in DSM criteria are inconsistent with each other.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chou|first=Chien|last2=Hsiao|first2=Ming-Chun|title=Internet addiction, usage, gratification, and pleasure experience: the Taiwan college students' case|journal=Computers &amp; Education|volume=35|issue=1|pages=65–80|doi=10.1016/s0360-1315(00)00019-1|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of studies being conducted in divergent contexts, studies constantly modify scales for their own purposes, thereby imposing a further challenge to the standardization in assessing Internet addiction disorder.&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt;

'''Single-question instruments'''

Some scholars and practitioners also attempt to define Internet addiction by a single question, typically the time-use of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soule|first=L. C.|last2=Shell|first2=L. W.|last3=Kleen|first3=B. A.|date=2003|title=Exploring Internet addiction: Demographic characteristics and stereotypes of heavy Internet users|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08874417.2003.11647553|journal=Journal of Computer Information Systems|volume=44 | issue = 1 |pages=64–73|eissn=|via=|doi=10.1080/08874417.2003.11647553|doi-broken-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Internet use can cause negative health consequences is, however, not clear from such a measure.&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt; The latter of which is critical to whether IAD should be defined as a mental disorder.

=== Classification ===
As many scholars have pointed out, the Internet serves merely as a ''medium'' through which tasks of divergent nature can be accomplished.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":342"/&gt; Treating disparate addictive behaviors under the same umbrella term is highly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuss|first=D.|last2=Lopez-Fernandez|first2=O.|title=Internet-use related addiction: The state of the art of clinical research|journal=European Psychiatry|volume=33|doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.01.1038|year=2016|page=S303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Kimberly S. Young (1999) asserts that Internet addiction is a broad term which can be decomposed into several subtypes of behavior and impulse control problems, namely,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Kimberly S.|date=1999-10-01|title=The Research and Controversy Surrounding Internet Addiction|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=2|issue=5|pages=381–383|doi=10.1089/cpb.1999.2.381|pmid=19178209|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Cybersexual addiction''''': compulsive use of adult websites for cybersex and cyberporn;
** ''Main article:'' [[Internet sex addiction]].
* '''''Cyber-relationship addiction''''': Over-involvement in online relationships;
* '''''Net compulsions''''': Obsessive online gambling, shopping or day-trading;
* '''''Information overload''''': Compulsive web surfing or database searches;
* '''''Computer addiction''''': Obsessive computer game playing.
** ''Main article:'' [[Video game addiction]].

==Treatment: therapies==
Current interventions and strategies used as treatments for Internet addiction stem from those practiced in substance abuse disorder. In the absence of "methodologically adequate research", treatment programs are not well corroborated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petersen|first=K|last2=Weymann|first2=N|last3=Schelb|first3=Y|last4=Thiel|first4=R|last5=Thomasius|first5=R|date=2009|title=Pathologischer Internetgebrauch – Epidemiologie, Diagnostik, komorbide Störungen und Behandlungsansätze|journal=Fortschritte der Neurologie · Psychiatrie|language=de|volume=77|issue=5|pages=263–271|doi=10.1055/s-0028-1109361|pmid=19418384|issn=0720-4299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychosocial treatment is the approach most often applied.&lt;ref name=":232"/&gt; In practice, rehab centers usually devise a combination of multiple therapies.&lt;ref name=":222"/&gt;

=== Psychosocial Treatment ===
'''Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy'''

The [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral therapy]] with Internet addicts (CBT-IA) is developed in analogy to therapies for impulse control disorder.&lt;ref name=":37"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Kimberly S.|date=2007-10-01|title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy with Internet Addicts: Treatment Outcomes and Implications|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=10|issue=5|pages=671–679|doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.9971|pmid=17927535|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several key aspects are embedded in this therapy:&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orzack|first=Maressa Hecht|last2=Voluse|first2=Andrew C.|last3=Wolf|first3=David|last4=Hennen|first4=John|date=2006-06-01|title=An Ongoing Study of Group Treatment for Men Involved in Problematic Internet-Enabled Sexual Behavior|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=9|issue=3|pages=348–360|doi=10.1089/cpb.2006.9.348|pmid=16780403|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Learning time management strategies;
* Recognizing the benefits and potential harms of the Internet;
* Increasing self-awareness and awareness of others and one’s surroundings;
* Identifying “triggers” of Internet “binge behavior,” such as particular Internet applications, emotional states, maladaptive cognitions, and life events;
* Learning to manage emotions and control impulses related to accessing the Internet, such as muscles or breathing relaxation training;
* Improving interpersonal communication and interaction skills;
* Improving coping styles; and
* Cultivating interests in alternative activities.
Three phases are implemented in the CBT-IA therapy:&lt;ref name=":37"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# Behavior modification to control Internet use: Examine both computer behavior and non-computer behavior and manage Internet addicts' time online and offline;
# Cognitive restructuring to challenge and modify cognitive distortions: Identify, challenge, and modify the rationalizations that justify excessive Internet use;
# Harm reduction therapy to address co-morbid issues: Address any co-morbid factors associated with Internet addiction, sustain recovery, and prevent relapse.
Symptom management of CBT-IA treatment has been found to sustain 6 months post-treatment.&lt;ref name=":37"/&gt;

[http://restorerecovery.net/ RESTORE RECOVERYTM] is a training program that aims to standardize the CBT-IA application and assist practitioners' practice in assessing and treating Internet addiction disorder.

'''Motivational Interviewing'''

The [[Motivational interviewing|motivational interviewing approach]] is developed based on therapies for [[alcohol abuse]]rs.&lt;ref name=":37"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This therapy is a directive, patient-centered counseling style for eliciting behavior change through helping patients explore and resolve ambivalence with a respectful therapeutic manner. It does not, however, provide patients with solutions or problem solving until patients' decision to change behaviors.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Several key elements are embedded in this therapy:&lt;ref name=":37"/&gt;
* Asking open-ended questions;
* Giving affirmations;
* Reflective listening.
Other psychosocial treatment therapies include '''reality therapy''', '''Naikan cognitive psychotherapy''', '''group therapy''', '''family therapy''', and '''multimodal psychotherapy.'''&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

=== Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ===
Scholars have also evaluated the effect of 2/100-Hz transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on Internet addicts. Two Chinese studies found that 2/100- Hz TENS, which adjusts the release of central neurotransmitter, can effectively reduce the online time of adolescent Internet addicts and mitigate IA syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=朱天民|last2=金荣疆|last3=钟晓鸣|last4=陈骥|last5=李辉|date=2008|title=电针结合心理干预对网瘾患者焦虑状态及血清NE变化的影响|url=http://www.cqvip.com/qk/95999x/200808/28043298.html|journal=中国针灸|volume=28|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-YWYB200701007.htm|title=TREATMENT ON 27 ADOLESCENTS WITH INTERNET ADDICTION BY 2/100 HZ HAN'S ACUPOINT NERVE STIMULATOR(HANS)--《Chinese Journal of Drug Dependence》2007年01期|website=en.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pharmacologic Therapy ===
As we have discovered, IAD may be associated with a co-morbidity. So it's no surprise that treating a related disorder will also help in the treatment of IAD. When addicts were treated with certain anti-depressants it reduced time online by 65% and also reduced cravings of being online. The anti-depressants that have been most successful  are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as ecitalopram and a heterocyclic atypical anti-depressant called buproprion. A psychostimulant, methylphenidate has also shown beneficial effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Przepiorka|first=Aneta Małgorzata|last2=Blachnio|first2=Agata|last3=Miziak|first3=Barbara|last4=Czuczwar|first4=Stanisław Jerzy|date=2014-04|title=Clinical approaches to treatment of Internet addiction|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharep.2013.10.001|journal=Pharmacological Reports|volume=66|issue=2|pages=187–191|doi=10.1016/j.pharep.2013.10.001|issn=1734-1140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different samples, methodologies, and screening instruments are employed across studies and therefore one should take caution interpreting and comparing the above-listed figures.

==Terminology==
The notion of "Internet Addictive Disorder" was initially conjured up by Dr. Ivan K. Goldberg in 1995 as a joke to parody the complexity and rigidity of [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's (APA)]] "[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)]]." In his first narration, Internet addictive disorder was described as having the symptoms of "important social or occupational activities that are given up or reduced because of Internet use," "fantasies or dreams about the Internet," and "voluntary or involuntary typing movements of the fingers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/01/13/just-click-no|title=Just Click No|last=Wallis|first=David|date=1997-01-06|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-02-21|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of Internet addiction disorder has troubled researchers ever since its inception. In general, no standardized definition has been provided despite that the phenomenon has received extensive public and scholar recognition.&lt;ref name=":332"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chou|first=Chien|last2=Condron|first2=Linda|last3=Belland|first3=John C.|date=2005-12-01|title=A Review of the Research on Internet Addiction|journal=Educational Psychology Review|volume=17|issue=4|pages=363–388|doi=10.1007/s10648-005-8138-1|issn=1040-726X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byun|first=Sookeun|last2=Ruffini|first2=Celestino|last3=Mills|first3=Juline E.|last4=Douglas|first4=Alecia C.|last5=Niang|first5=Mamadou|last6=Stepchenkova|first6=Svetlana|last7=Lee|first7=Seul Ki|last8=Loutfi|first8=Jihad|last9=Lee|first9=Jung-Kook|date=2008-12-10|title=Internet Addiction: Metasynthesis of 1996–2006 Quantitative Research|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=12|issue=2|pages=203–207|doi=10.1089/cpb.2008.0102|pmid=19072075|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some of the commonly used definitions.

In 1998, Dr. Jonathan J. Kandell defined Internet addiction as "a psychological dependence on the Internet, regardless of the type of activity once logged on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kandell|first=Jonathan J.|date=1998-01-01|title=Internet Addiction on Campus: The Vulnerability of College Students|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=1|issue=1|pages=11–17|doi=10.1089/cpb.1998.1.11|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English psychologist Mark D. Griffiths (1998) conceived Internet addiction as a subtype of broader '''[[technology addiction]]''', and also a subtype of '''[[behavioral addiction]]s'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-06638-003|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous ===
 
	
Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous (ITAA), founded in 2009, is a 12-step program supporting users coping with digital distractions such as computers and smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://internetandtechaa.wordpress.com/|website=Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous|access-date=2018-10-10|title=Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are face to face meetings in some US cities.  English-speaking telephone and online meetings take place over a conference line most days of the week, at varying times that allow people worldwide to attend. Like 12 step fellowships such as Overeaters Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous, or Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, most members find that they can't choose to not use technology at all. ITAA members come up with their own definitions of abstinence or problem behaviors, such as not using the computer or internet at certain hours or locations or not going to certain websites or categories of websites that have proven problematic in the past. Meetings provide a source of live support for people who are trying to build connections with people outside the computer, to share struggles and victories, and to learn to better function in life once less of it is spent on problematic technology use.

=== Public concern ===
Internet addiction has raised great public concern in Asia and some countries consider Internet addiction as one of the major issues that threatens public health, in particular among adolescents.&lt;ref name=":43"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Xui-qin|last2=Li|first2=Meng-chen|last3=Tao|first3=Ran|date=2010-10-01|title=Treatment of Internet Addiction|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=12|issue=5|pages=462–470|doi=10.1007/s11920-010-0147-1|pmid=20697848|issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
Internet addiction is commonly referred to as "electronic opium"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uVJtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=youth+and+internet+addiction+in+china#v=onepage&amp;q=youth%20and%20internet%20addiction%20in%20china&amp;f=false|title=Youth and Internet Addiction in China|last=Bax|first=Trent|date=2013-08-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135096953}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "electronic heroin" in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/28/electronic-heroin-china-boot-camps-internet-addicts|title='Electronic heroin': China's boot camps get tough on internet addicts|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=2017-08-28|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the People's Republic of China is the first country to formally classify Internet addiction a clinical disorder by recognizing ''Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Internet Addiction'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2008-11/08/content_1143277.htm|title=我国首个《网络成瘾临床诊断标准》通过专家论证|website=www.gov.cn|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/08/14/a-teen-checked-into-an-internet-addiction-camp-in-china-he-was-dead-two-days-later/|title=A teen checked into an Internet-addiction camp in China.

==== South Korea ====
Being almost universally connected to the Internet and boasting online gaming as a professional sport, South Korea deems Internet addiction one of the most serious social issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1569831/First-boot-camp-for-internet-addicted-teenagers.html|title=First boot camp for internet-addicted teenagers|last=Leonard|first=Tom|date=2007-11-19|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes it as a "national crisis".&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/koreas-internet-addicts|title=Korea’s Internet Addicts|work=News|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 80% of the South Korean population have smartphones. According to government data, about 2 million of the country's population (less than 50 million) have Internet addiction problem, and approximately 68,000 10-19-year-old teenagers are addicted to the Internet, accounting for roughly 10 percent of the teenage population.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-internet-horses/horses-to-the-rescue-of-koreas-internet-addicted-teens-idUSBRE90803020130109|title=Horses to the rescue of Korea's Internet-addicted teens|last=|first=|date=2013|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-02-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the very young generation are faced with the same problem: Approximately 40% of South Korean children between age 3 to 5 are using smartphones over three times per week. According to experts, if children are constantly stimulated by smartphones during infancy period, their brain will struggle to balance growth and the risk of Internet addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kidspot.com.au/parenting/real-life/in-the-news/internetaddicted-teens-are-being-sent-to-rehab-to-get-clean/news-story/4742e6e0dc580d8b7497c235b485f1dc|title=Internet-addicted teens are being sent to rehab to "get clean"|last=Smith|first=Leesa|website=www.kidspot.com.au|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And because of the Internet addiction, so many tragedies happened in South Korea: A mother, tired of playing online games, killed her 3-year-old son. A couple, obsessed with online child-raising games, left their young daughter die of malnutrition. A 15-year-old teenager killed his mother for not letting himself play online games and then committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-south-korea-a-rehab-camp-for-internet-addicted-teenagers/2016/01/24/9c143ab4-b965-11e5-85cd-5ad59bc19432_story.html|title=In South Korea, a rehab camp for Internet-addicted teenagers|last=Fifield|first=Anna|date=2016-01-24|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Internet gaming addict stabbed his sister after playing violent games. Another addict killed one and injured seven others.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

In response, the South Korea government has launched the first Internet prevention center in the world, the Jump Up Internet Rescue School, where the most severely addicted teens are treated with full governmental financial aid.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; As of 2007, the government has built a network of 140 Internet-addiction counseling centers besides treatment programs at around 100 hospitals.&lt;ref name=":322"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/technology/18rehab.html|title=In Korea, a Boot Camp Cure for Web Obsession|last=Fackler|first=Martin|date=2007-11-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, counselor- and instructor-led music therapy and [[Equine-assisted therapy|equine therapy]] and other real-life group activities including military-style obstacle courses and therapeutic workshops on pottery and drumming are used to divert IAs' attention and interest from screens.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":322" /&gt;

In 2011, the Korean government introduced the "[[Shutdown law]]", also known as the "Cinderella Act", to prevent children under 16 years old from playing online games from midnight (12:00) to 6 a.m.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

== Mistreatment in China ==
In the absence of guidance from China’s Health Ministry and a clear definition of Internet addiction, dubious treatment clinics have sprouted up in the country.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; As part of the treatment, some clinics and camps impose [[corporal punishment]] upon patients of Internet addiction and some conducted [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)]] against patients, the latter of which has caused wide public concern and controversy.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.sohu.com/20090423/n263582767.shtml|title=暗访杨永信网瘾戒治中心：杨永信和传销一个样-搜狐健康|website=health.sohu.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few salient mistreatment practices have been well-documented by news reports:

=== Involuntary confinement ===
One of the most commonly resorted treatments for Internet-addicted adolescents in China is inpatient care, either in a legal or illegal camp. It is reported that children were sent to "correction" against their will. Some are seized and tied by staff of the camp, some are drugged by their parents, and some are tricked into treatment.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zqb.cyol.com/content/2009-05/07/content_2655336.htm|title="戒网专家"电击治网瘾惹争议|website=zqb.cyol.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zqb.cyol.com/content/2009-05/07/content_2655346.htm|title=一个网戒中心的生态系统|website=zqb.cyol.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/the-digital-addiction-that-has-----teens-wearing-nappies-so-they-dont-need-a-toilet-break/news-story/5e0d321846a93337dc9f0260fc0ffc23|title=It’s the addiction gripping thousands of Chinese teenagers|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporal punishment ===
In many camps and clinics, corporal punishment is frequently used to "correct" Internet addiction disorder. The types of corporal punishment practiced include, but not limited to, kilometers-long hikes, intense squats, standing, starving, and confinement.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/08/19/china.internet/|title=China probe of abuse at Web addiction camp - CNN.com|last=CNN|first=By Deb Krajnak|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zqb.cyol.com/content/2009-08/07/content_2793216.htm|title=我在'网瘾集中营'的生活|website=zqb.cyol.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infzm.com/content/28960|title=南方周末 - 86条规定|website=www.infzm.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a physical-abuse-caused death case of an adolescent Internet-addict was reported in 2009, the Chinese government has officially inhibited physical violence to "wean" teens from the Internet.&lt;ref name=":372"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-43701020091105|title=China bans physical punishment for Internet addicts|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=IN|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; But multiple abuse and death cases of Internet addicts have been reported after the ban.

Among Internet addiction rehab centers that use corporal punishment in treatment, Yuzhang Academy in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, is the most heavily discussed. In 2017, the Academy was accused of using severe corporal punishment against students, the majority of which are Internet addicts. Former students claimed that the Academy hit problematic students with iron rulers, "whip them with finger-thick steel cables", and lock students in small cells week long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jx.ifeng.com/a/20171031/6110398_0.shtml|title=南昌豫章书院深陷"暴力门" 学生称"绝望"|website=jx.ifeng.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1073055.shtml|title=Shock over abusive methods used at Internet addiction center - Global Times|last=Times|first=Global|website=www.globaltimes.cn|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several suicidal cases emerged under the great pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://v.qq.com/x/cover/u14ize2tlofphve/k056764cn0m.html|title=独家专访引爆豫章书院事件当事人：曾被铁棍打 吞牙膏自杀未遂_网罗天下_腾讯视频|last=Team|first=Tencent VFE|website=v.qq.com|language=zh-CN|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the Academy stopped operating after extensive media exposure and police intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1855676|title=南昌豫章书院学生陆续被接走，警方正调查书院是否涉嫌违法_教育家_澎湃新闻-The Paper|website=www.thepaper.cn|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electroconvulsive therapy ===
In China, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is legally used for schizophrenia and mood disorders. Its off-label practices in treating adolescent Internet addicts has raised great public concern and stigmatized the legal use of ECT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Yi-lang|last2=Jiang|first2=Wei|last3=Ren|first3=Yan-ping|last4=Ma|first4=Xin|last5=Cotes|first5=Robert O.|last6=McDonald|first6=William M.|title=Electroconvulsive Therapy in China|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00124509-201212000-00003|journal=The Journal of ECT|volume=28|issue=4|pages=206–212|doi=10.1097/yct.0b013e31825957b1|pmid=22801297|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most reported and controversial clinic treating Internet addiction disorder is perhaps the Linyi Psychiatric Hospital in Shandong Province.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; Its center for Internet addiction treatment was established in 2006 by [[Yang Yongxin|Yongxin Yang]].&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.qq.com/a/20090525/000061.htm|title=杨永信网瘾中心再追踪：女孩唱舞娘也遭电击_科技_腾讯网|website=tech.qq.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various interviews of Yongxin Yang confirm that Yang has created a special therapy, ''xingnao'' ("brain-waking") therapy, to treat Internet addiction. As part of the therapy, electroconvulsive therapy is implemented with currents of 1-5 milliampere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infzm.com/content/31386|title=南方周末 - "电击"可治网瘾？卫生部叫停|website=www.infzm.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Yang put it, the electroconvulsive therapy only involves sending a small current through the brain and will not harm the recipient.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/14/china-electric-shock-internet-addiction|title=China bans electric shock treatment used to 'cure' young internet addicts|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=2009-07-14|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a psychiatric hospital, patients are deprived of personal liberty and are subject to electroconvulsive treatment at the will of hospital staffs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; And before admission, parents have to sign contracts in which they deliver their guardianship of kids partially to the hospital and acknowledge that their kids will receive ECT.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Frequently, ECT is employed as a punishment method upon patients who breaks any of the center's rules, including "eating chocolate, locking the bathroom door, taking pills before a meal and sitting on Yang's chair without permission".&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; It is reported in a CCTV-12 segment that a DX-IIA electroconvulsive therapy machine is utilized to correct Internet addiction. The machine was, later on, revealed to be illegal, inapplicable to minor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discover.news.163.com/09/0827/11/5HNJ2QQD000125LI.html|title=杨永信"神话"破灭背后的媒体漩涡_网易新闻|last=网易|website=discover.news.163.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.163.com/09/0817/07/5GTEB79O000915BF.html|title=《新闻调查》曝光杨永信电击真相_网易科技|last=网易|website=tech.163.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can cause great pain and muscle spasm to recipients.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; Many former patients in the hospital later on stood out and reported that the ECT they received in the hospital was extremely painful, tore up their head,&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; and even caused incontinence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2009-08-24/07433376981.shtml|title=经济半小时：杨永信网戒中心入账可达8100万_互联网_科技时代_新浪网|website=tech.sina.com.cn|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;An Interview of the Internet addiction treatment center in Linyi Psychiatric Hospital is accessible via the following [http://tv.cntv.cn/video/C10435/5300e9841e654ed85d4c4887d0220369 link].Since neither the safety nor the effectiveness of the method was clear, [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|the Chinese Ministry of Health]] banned electroconvulsive therapy in treating Internet addiction disorder in 2009.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/gzdt/2009-07/13/content_1364381.htm|title=卫生部通知停止电刺激治疗"网瘾"技术临床应用|website=www.gov.cn|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug ===
In Yang's clinic, patients are forced to take psychiatric medication&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; in addition to ''Jiewangyin'', a type of medication invented by himself. Neither the effectiveness nor applicability of the medication has been assessed, however.

=== Physical abuse and death ===
At clinics and rehab centers, at least 12 cases of physical abuse have been revealed by media in the recent years including 7 deaths.&lt;ref name=":123"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/224591/chinas-cure-for-teenage-internet-addiction-is-worse-than-the-supposed-disease/#/h/79366,1/|title=China’s cure for teenage internet addiction is worse than the supposed disease|last=Kuo|first=Lily|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/sh/2014/06-19/6299977.shtml|title=盘点12起被曝光戒网瘾学校事件:9成涉体罚 致7人亡-中新网|last=chinanews|website=www.chinanews.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a 15-year-old, Senshan Deng, was found dead 8 hours after being sent to an Internet-addiction center in Nanning, Guangxi Province. It is reported that the teenager was beaten by his trainers during his stay in the center.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

In 2009, another 14-year-old teenager, Liang Pu, was taken to hospital with water in the lungs and kidney failure after a similar attack in Sichuan Province.&lt;ref name=":372" /&gt;

In 2014, a 19-year-old, Lingling Guo, died in an Internet-addiction center with multiple injuries on head and neck in Zhengzhou, Henan Province.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

In 2016, after escaping from an Internet addiction rehab center, a 16-year-old girl tied and starved her mother to death in revenge of the being sent to treatment in Heilongjiang Province.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

In August 2017, an 18-year-old Internet addict, Li Ao, was found dead with 20 external scars and bruises two days after his parents sent him to a military-style boot camp in Fuyang city, Anhui Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-40920488|title=China 'internet addict' death sparks fury|date=2017-08-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Korea Computer Center''' ('''KCC''') is the [[North Korea]]n government [[information technology]] research center. It was founded on October 24, 1990.&lt;ref name="KCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/kcc/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231222441/http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/kcc/ |archivedate=2014-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; KCC, which administers the [[.kp]] [[country code]] [[top-level domain]], employs more than 1,000 people.&lt;ref name=ref2013031605&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

KCC operates eight development and production centers, as well as eleven regional information centers.  It runs the [[KCC Information Technology College]] and its Information Technology Institute.  The KCC has branch offices in [[China]], [[Germany]], [[Syria]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It has an interest in [[Linux]] research, and started the development of the [[Red Star OS]] distribution localised for North Korea.&lt;ref name="KCC" /&gt;

KCC is a part of the political establishment and not entirely an IT company ''per se''. Its technological state and general modernity are seen as lagging well behind the rest of the world, even with the general [[zeitgeist]] in [[North Korea]]. For example, the [[.kp]] [[ccTLD]] was registered in 2007, but KCC did not manage to get a working registry for three years, despite the support of a European company. KCC has still not implemented a working [[ccTLD]] infrastructure, something the [[North Korean government]] has had as a goal for several years.

While KCC mainly works on projects within  North Korea, it has since 2001 served clients in [[Europe]], [[China]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://38north.org/2011/10/ptjia102611/ |title=North Korea: An Up-and-Coming IT-Outsourcing Destination |author=Paul Tjia |date=18 November 2011 |work=38 North, [[School of Advanced International Studies]] |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jean H. |last=Lee |title=North Korea's 'Digital Revolution' Under Way |date=25 July 2011 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/25/digital-revolution-north-korea_n_908368.html |work=AP |publisher=Huffingtom Post |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates [[Naenara]], North Korea's official web portal.

      <comment>It looks like this tangential sentence is only here to advance a particular belief. It's not relevant to the description of what late-term abortion is, which is the purpose of this section. (Plus in any case, a ''pregnancy'' can't be alive or dead.)</comment>

Retrieved 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is a termination of [[pregnancy]] that is performed during a later stage of pregnancy. Late termination of pregnancy is [[Abortion in the United States#By trimester of pregnancy|more controversial]] than abortion in general because it results in the death of a [[fetus]] that is more developed and sometimes [[fetal viability|able to survive independently]]. Given the complex, gradual nature of [[human fetal development]], the definition of "late" in this context is not precise, and different medical publications have discussed the varying [[gestational age]] points that can be involved.

==Definition==
A late termination of pregnancy often refers to an induced ending of pregnancy after the [[Gestational age|20th week]] of [[gestation]]. The exact point when a pregnancy becomes late-term, however, is not clearly defined. Some sources define an abortion after 16 weeks as "late".&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, Aida and Forrest, Jacqueline Darroch. (1988). [http://www.holysmoke.org/fem/fem0543.htm Why Do Women Have Abortions]. ''Family Planning Perspectives, 20 (4)'', 169-176. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weihe, Pál, Steuerwald, Ulrike,  Taheri, Sepideh, Færø, Odmar, Veyhe, Anna Sofía, &amp; Nicolajsen, Did. (2003). [http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/publications/2003/87-7972-477-9/pdf/87-7972-478-7.pdf The Human Health Programme in the Faroe Islands 1985-2001]. In ''AMAP Greenland and the Faroe Islands 1997-2001''. Danish Ministry of Environment. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Three articles published in 1998 in the same issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' could not agree on the definition. Two of the ''JAMA'' articles chose the 20th week of gestation to be the point where an abortion procedure would be considered late-term.&lt;ref&gt;Sprang, M.L, and Neerhof, M.G. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/744 Rationale for banning abortions late in pregnancy]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8),'' 744-747.&lt;br /&gt;Grimes, D.A. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/747 The continuing need for late abortions]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8)'', 747-750.&lt;/ref&gt; The third ''JAMA'' article chose the third trimester, or 27th week of gestation.&lt;ref name="Jama2"&gt;Gans Epner, J.E., Jonas, H.S., Seckinger, D.L. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/724 Late-term abortion]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8)'', 724-729.&lt;/ref&gt;

The point at which an abortion becomes late-term is often related to the "[[Fetus#Viability|viability]]" (ability to survive outside the [[uterus]]) of the [[fetus]]. Sometimes late-term abortions are referred to as post-viability abortions.

==Mental health==
While a single first-trimester abortion carried no more mental health risk than carrying a pregnancy to term, abortion could not be proven safe in other cases as far as mental health was concerned. Women who terminate a pregnancy because of abnormalities discovered through fetal screenings have a similar risk of negative mental health outcomes as women who miscarry a wanted pregnancy or experience a stillbirth or the death of a newborn. However, "the differing patterns of psychological experiences observed among women who terminate an unplanned pregnancy versus those who terminate a planned and wanted pregnancy highlight the importance of taking pregnancy intendedness and wantedness into account when seeking to understand psychological reactions to abortion."&lt;ref name="apa-2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion/index.aspx | title = Mental Health and Abortion | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | year = 2008 | accessdate = April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2013 found that most women seeking late-term abortion "fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous."  The study data did not include any women who were having abortions "on grounds of fetal anomaly or life endangerment." The researchers concluded that "Bans on abortion after 20 weeks will disproportionately affect young women and women with limited financial resources."&lt;ref name=Foster2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Diana|title=Who Seeks Abortions at or After 20 Weeks?|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date=December 2013|volume=45|issue=4|pages=210–218|doi=10.1363/4521013|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4521013.html|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an earlier study published in 1987, the Alan Guttmacher Institute collected questionnaires from 1,900 women in the United States who came to clinics to have abortions. Of the 1,900 questioned, 420 had been pregnant for 16 or more weeks. These 420 women were asked to choose among a list of reasons they had not obtained the abortions earlier in their pregnancies.  The results were as follows:&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;
* 71% of women were unaware they were pregnant or misjudged gestation
* 48% of women found it hard to make arrangements for abortion
* 33% of women were afraid to tell their partner or parents
* 24% of women took longer to decide whether to have an abortion
* 8% of women had an abortion after a change in their relationship status
* 8% of women were initially pressured not to have abortion
* 6% of women chose to have an abortion because of a change in circumstances after becoming pregnant
* 6% of women were not properly educated on how timing affects abortion
* 5% of women were unaware that abortion was available to them
* 2% A fetal problem was diagnosed late in pregnancy
* 11% Other

=== England and Wales ===
The NHS records the reasons given for abortions at all stages of development. In 2015, 2,877 abortions were performed at 20 weeks or above. Of these, 23 (0.8%)&lt;!-- Ground A (alone, or with B, C, D) or F or G  --&gt; were performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, 1,801&lt;!-- C (alone) --&gt; (63%) were performed for mental or physical health reasons, and 1046&lt;!-- Ground E (alone, or with A, B, C or D)  --&gt; (36%) were performed because of foetal abnormalities. (The data do not sum up to 100% because multiple reasons could be recorded for each abortion.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/529344/Abortion_Statistics_2015_v3.pdf|title=Report on abortion statistics in England and Wales for 2015|last=Department of Health|first=|date=17 May 2016|issue=|doi=|volume=|page=31 (Table 7b)|pmid=|access-date=2016-10-24|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal restrictions==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Intact dilation and extraction]] --&gt;
As of 1998, among the 152 most populous countries, 54 either banned abortion entirely or permitted it only to save the life of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;Anika Rahman, Laura Katzive and Stanley K. Henshaw. [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.pdf A Global Review of Laws on Induced Abortion, 1985-1997], International Family Planning Perspectives (Volume 24, Number 2, June 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, 49 of the 152 most populous countries were without restriction as to reason, but 44 of these imposed limits after a particular [[gestational age]]:&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

* 12 weeks (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Rep., Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Norway, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine, Tajikistan,  Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan)
* 13 weeks (Italy)
* 14 weeks (Austria, Cambodia, Germany, Hungary, and Romania)
* 18 weeks (Sweden)
* 24 weeks (Singapore)
* no limit (Canada, China, and North Korea)
* viability (Netherlands and to some extent the United States)

In these countries, abortions after the general gestational age limit are allowed only under restricted circumstances, which include, depending on country, risk to the woman's life, physical or mental health, fetal malformation, cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape, or poor socio-economic conditions. For instance, in Italy, abortion is allowed on request up until 90 days, after which it is allowed only if the pregnancy or childbirth pose a threat to the woman’s life, a risk to physical health of the woman, a risk to mental health of the woman; if there is a risk of fetal malformation; or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or other sexual crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313162004/http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark provides a wider range of reasons, including social and economic ones, which can be invoked by a woman who seeks an abortion after 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm|title=DENMARK|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions at such stages must in general be approved by a doctor or a special committee, unlike early abortions which are performed on demand. The ease with which the doctor or the committee allows a late term abortion varies significantly by country, and is often influenced by the social and religious views prevalent in that region.

Some countries, like Canada, China (Mainland only) and Vietnam have no legal limit on when an abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act}}
The [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions on abortion, including ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'',  allow states to impose more restrictions on post-viability abortions than during the earlier stages of pregnancy.

As of December 2014, forty-two states had bans on late-term abortions that were not [[Facial challenge|facially]] unconstitutional under ''Roe v. Wade'' or [[enjoined]] by court order.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Guttmacher Institute. (April 1, 2007). [http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PLTA.pdf State Policies on Later-Term Abortions]. ''State Policies in Brief.''  Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' ruled that Congress may ban certain late-term abortion techniques, "both previability and postviability",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annas|first1=George J.|title=The Supreme Court and Abortion Rights|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=24 May 2007|volume=2007|issue=356|pages=2201–2207|doi=10.1056/NEJMhle072595|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle072595|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it had done in banning [[intact dilation and extraction]] with the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Warren M.|title=Did I violate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2003/10/did_i_violate_the_partialbirth_abortion_ban.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=Slate.com|date=22 Oct 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has held that bans must include exceptions for threats to the woman's life, physical health, and mental health, but four states allow late-term abortions only when the woman's life is at risk; four allow them when the woman's life or physical health is at risk, but use a definition of health that pro-choice organizations believe is impermissibly narrow.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  Note that just because a portion of a state's law is found to be unconstitutional does not mean that the entire law will be deemed unconstitutional: "[I]nvalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief," meaning the court could declare that only those parts of the law that are violative of the Constitution are invalid (declaratory relief), or that the court can prohibit the state from enforcing those portions of the law (injunctive relief).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/04-1144.html 546 U.S. 320] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen states prohibit abortion after a certain number of weeks' gestation (usually 22 weeks from the last menstrual period).&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court held in ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' that a statute may create "a presumption of viability" after a certain number of weeks, in which case the physician must be given an opportunity to rebut the presumption by performing tests.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=492&amp;invol=490 492 U.S. 490] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Because this provision is not explicitly written into these state laws, as it was in the Missouri law examined in ''Webster'', pro-choice organizations believe that such a state law is unconstitutional, but only "to the extent that it prohibits pre-viability abortions".&lt;ref name="Delaware"&gt;NARAL Pro-Choice America. (2007). "[http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/in_your_state/who-decides/state-profiles/delaware.html?templateName=lawdetails&amp;issueID=3&amp;ssumID=2516 Delaware]."  ''Who Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States.'' Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten states (although Florida's enforcement of such laws are under [[permanent injunction]]) require a second physician's approval before a late-term abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement of "confirmation by two other physicians" (rather than one other physician) because "acquiescence by co-practitioners has no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly infringes on the physician's right to practice".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=179 410 U.S. 179] (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-choice organizations, such as the [[Guttmacher Institute]], posit that some of these state laws are unconstitutional, based on these and other Supreme Court rulings, at least to the extent that these state laws require approval of a second or third physician.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

Thirteen states have laws that require a second physician to be present during late-term abortion procedures in order to treat a fetus if born alive.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt; The Court has held that a doctor's right to practice is not infringed by requiring a second physician to be present at abortions performed after viability in order to assist in the case of a living fetus.&lt;ref&gt;''Planned Parenthood Ass'n v. Ashcroft'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/462/476/case.html 462 U.S. 476], 486-90 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are at least four medical procedures associated with late-term abortions:
* [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E)
* Early [[labor induction]] (sometimes called "induction abortion")
* [[Intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX or D&amp;X), sometimes referred to as "[[Partial birth abortion#Partial-birth abortion|''partial-birth abortion'']]"
* [[Hysterotomy abortion]]

==Viability==
There is no sharp limit of development, age, or weight at which humans automatically become viable.&lt;ref name="developinghuman"&gt;Moore, Keith and Persaud, T.

Such degrees are generally preparation for legal careers; but while their curricula may be reviewed by legal authority, they do not themselves confer a license. A legal license is granted (typically by examination) and exercised locally; while the law degree can have local, international, and world-wide aspects- e.g., in Britain the [[Legal Practice Course]] is required to become a British [[solicitor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/becomingasolicitor.law|title=Becoming a Solicitor|publisher=The Law Society (UK)|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/students/students.page|title=Solicitor's Regulation Authority Student and Training information|publisher=Solicitor's Regulation Authority|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) to become a [[barrister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |title=How to Become a Barrister |publisher=The Bar Council (UK) |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218134750/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |archivedate=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first academic degrees were all law degrees-and the first law degrees were [[doctorate]]s. The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the [[glossators]] of the 11th century, which were schools of law.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, et al. (1915). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first European university, that of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the [[glossator]] school in that city. It is from this history that it is said that the first academic title of doctor applied to scholars of law. The degree and title were not applied to scholars of other disciplines until the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; And at the [[University of Bologna]] from its founding in the 12th century until the end of the 20th century the only degree conferred was the doctorate, usually earned after five years of intensive study after secondary school.

==Types of degrees==
The type of law degree conferred differs according to the jurisdiction.  Some examples include;

[[Image:Juris Doctor diploma.jpg|right|thumb|A typical Juris Doctor diploma from the United States, here from [[Suffolk University Law School]] in 2008.]]

* ''[[Bacharel em Direito]]'' (Bachelor of Laws) or ''[[Bacharel em Ciências Jurídicas e Sociais]]'' (Bachelor of Laws and Social Sciences), in [[Brazil]], is an undergraduate degree. The abbreviation for Bachelor is ''Bel.''. To be a Lawyer and be admitted at the [[Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil]] (Brazilian Bar Association), the Bachelor must be approved at the Brazilian Bar Exam, if the Selection and Registration Committee accept the new member he/she will be consider an [[Advogado]] (Attorney at Law/Advocate).
* [[Bachelor of Laws]] also referred to as a B.A. in Law (B.L.) or an LL.B. (Hons) in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.  It is an [[undergraduate]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Langbein, “Scholarly and Professional Objectives in Legal Education: American Trends and English Comparisons,” Pressing Problems in the Law, Volume 2: What are Law Schools For?, Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (B.C.L.) degree is similar in nature, historically distinguished from [[canon law]].
* [[Master of Laws]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Also referred to as an LL.M. from its Latin name, Legum Magister. It is an advanced academic degree pursued by those holding a professional law degree or a degree in a relevant field.
* ''[[Laurea]] di Dottore in Giurisprudenza'' for graduates before the [[Bologna Process]] reforms, or ''[[Laurea Magistrale]] in  Giurisprudenza'' after the [[Bologna Process]] reforms, in [[Italy]].  It is a masters level degree,&lt;ref&gt;See University of Ferrarra. [http://www.unife.it/giurisprudenza/ls.giurisprudenza Faculty of Law] (in Italian).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3105">In [[mathematics]], the '''map segmentation''' problem is a kind of [[optimization problem]]. It involves a certain geographic region that has to be partitioned into smaller sub-regions in order to achieve a certain goal. Typical optimization objectives include:&lt;ref name=rag14&gt;{{cite book | url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1614472017 | title=Geometric Partitioning Algorithms for Fair Division of Geographic Resources | publisher=A Ph.D. thesis submitted to the faculty of university of Minnesota | author=Raghuveer Devulapalli (Advisor: John Gunnar Carlsson) | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minimizing the workload of a fleet of vehicles assigned to the sub-regions;
* Balancing the consumption of a resource, as in [[fair cake-cutting]].
* Determining the optimal locations of supply depots;
* Maximizing the surveillance coverage.

Fair division of land has been an important issue since ancient times, e.g. in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/147876|jstor=147876|title=Urban and Rural Land Division in Ancient Greece|journal=Hesperia|volume=50|issue=4|pages=327|year=1981|last1=Boyd|first1=Thomas D.|last2=Jameson|first2=Michael H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notation ==
There is a geographic region denoted by C ("cake").

A partition of C, denoted by X, is a list of disjoint subregions whose union is C:
:&lt;math&gt;C = X_1\sqcup\cdots\sqcup X_n&lt;/math&gt;

There is a certain set of additional parameters (such as: obstacles, fixed points or probability density functions), denoted by P.

There is a real-valued function denoted by G ("goal") on the set of all partitions.

The map segmentation problem is to find:
:&lt;math&gt;\arg\min_X G(X_1,\dots,X_n \mid P)&lt;/math&gt;
where the minimization is on the set of all partitions of C.

Often, there are geometric shape constraints on the partitions, e.g., it may be required that each part be a [[convex set]] or a [[connected set]] or at least a [[measurable set]].

== Examples ==
1. '''Red-blue partitioning''': there is a set &lt;math&gt;P_b&lt;/math&gt; of blue points and a set &lt;math&gt;P_r&lt;/math&gt; of red points. Divide the plane into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; regions such that each region contains approximately a fraction &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; of the blue points and &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; of the red points. Here:
* The cake ''C'' is the entire plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;;
* The parameters ''P'' are the two sets of points;
* The goal function ''G'' is
:: &lt;math&gt;G(X_1,\dots,X_n) := \max_{i\in \{1,\dots, n\}} \left( \left |\frac{|P_b\cap X_i| - |P_b|} n \right| + \left| \frac{|P_r\cap X_i| - |P_r|} n\right| \right).&lt;/math&gt;
: It equals 0 if each region has exactly a fraction &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; of the points of each color.

== Related problems ==
* A [[Voronoi diagram]] is a specific type of map-segmentation problem.
* [[Fair cake-cutting]], when the cake is two-dimensional, is another specific map-segmentation problem when the cake is two-dimensional, like in the [[Hill–Beck land division problem]].
* The [[Stone–Tukey theorem]] is related to a specific map-segmentation problem.

'''''Maud''''', named for [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway]], was a ship built for [[Roald Amundsen]] for his second expedition to the [[Arctic]]. Designed for his intended voyage through the [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]], the vessel was built in [[Asker]], a suburb of the capital, [[Oslo]].

''Maud'' was launched in June 1916&lt;ref name=june16&gt;[https://www.norwegianamerican.com/featured/unsinking-a-ship-maud-returns-home/ Unsinking a ship: Maud returns home - Roald Amundsen and Maud]&lt;/ref&gt; or 17 June 1917&lt;ref name=june17&gt;[http://www.maudreturnshome.no/project/ Maud Returns Home]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Vollen, Akershus|Vollen]] and [[Ceremonial ship launching|ceremonially christened]] by Amundsen crushing a chunk of ice against her bow:
{{quote|It is not my intention to dishonor the glorious grape, but already now you shall get the taste of your real environment. For the ice you have been built, and in the ice you shall stay most of your life, and in the ice you shall solve your tasks. With the permission of our Queen, I christen you Maud|Roald Amundsen&lt;ref name=june16/&gt;}}

==Career and fate==
She lived up to her christening, as she remained in the ice until 2016. Whereas other vessels used in Amundsen's polar explorations, ''[[Gjøa]]'' and ''[[Fram]]'', have been preserved at the [[Norwegian Maritime Museum]], ''Maud'' had a more rugged fate. After sailing through the [[Northeast Passage]], which did not go as planned and took six years between 1918 and 1924, she ended up in [[Nome, Alaska]] and in August 1925 was sold on behalf of Amundsen's creditors in [[Seattle, Washington]].

The buyer was the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which renamed her ''Baymaud''. She was to be used as a supply vessel for Company outposts in [[Northern Canada#Sub-divisions|Canada's western Arctic]]. Prior to her final voyage ''Baymaud'' was given a refit in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. (The work was supervised by Tom Hallidie, who later went on to design the RCMP vessel ''[[St. Roch (ship)|St. Roch]]'', based on ''Maud.'') In the winter of 1926 she was frozen into the ice at [[Cambridge Bay]], where she sank in 1930. The wreck lay just offshore, across the inlet from the community's former Hudson's Bay Company store. Nearby is the site of the former [[Cambridge Bay LORAN Tower]], built in 1947.

In 1990 the ship was sold by the Hudson's Bay Company to Asker with the expectation that she would be returned to the town. Although a Cultural Properties Export permit was issued, the price tag to repair and move the ship was 230 million [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] ($43,200,000) and the permit expired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorenorth.com/library/weekly/aa082799.htm Underwater Treasure of Cambridge Bay]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nunavut News/North Monday August 20, 2007 "Saving the Maud"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwnhc.ca/research/archrep/archrep96/central.htm Cambridge Bay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201230638/http://www.pwnhc.ca/research/archrep/archrep96/central.htm |date=2010-12-01 }}, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 an Asker-based company, Tandberg Eiendom AS, in the project Maud Returns Home&lt;ref name="MaudReturnsHome"&gt;[http://www.maudreturnshome.no/ Maud Returns Home]&lt;/ref&gt; announced a plan to return ''Maud'' to Norway. They intend to build a museum in [[Vollen, Akershus|Vollen]] to house her, near where she was built and had purchased a barge to move her. Concern about the plan came from the community of Cambridge Bay, [[Parks Canada]], the [[Government of Nunavut]], the [[International Polar Heritage Committee]], and some people in her intended destination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/16557_norway_wants_amundsens_maud_back_from_nunavut/ Norway wants Amundsen’s Maud back from Nunavut]&lt;/ref&gt; Initial refusal of a new export permit from the federal government, on the grounds of a lack of a full archeological study was later reversed on appeal in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674Ottawa_nixes_export_permit_for_maud/ Ottawa nixes export permit for Maud]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaudReturnsHome" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/norwegians-set-to-repatriate-maud-after-reversing-export-permit-refusal/article534560/ Norwegians set to repatriate ''Maud'' after reversing export permit refusal]&lt;/ref&gt; The salvage operation was under way in the summer of 2015, with a plan to return the hull to Norway in the summer of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maudreturnshome.no Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1116">'''Milligram per cent''' is a traditional symbol used to denote a unit of measure of [[concentration]]. The traditional use of the 'mg%' symbol was meant to indicate the mass (in [[milligrams]]) of that chemical in 100 [[litre|milliliters]] of solution (e.g., blood).
The meaning of the symbol 'percent' is  {{sfrac|1|100}}, therefore the accurate meaning of the notation 'mg%' is 'mg/100', which is a unit of [[mass]], not a concentration. Therefore, for [[dimensional analysis]] purposes, when denoting a concentration of mass divided by [[volume]], it has largely been replaced by units such as 'mg/dL' or the [[International System of Units]] equivalent.

For example, a [[blood alcohol content|plasma ethanol concentration]] incorrectly denoted as 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg% can be written as '0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/dL' (or '1&amp;nbsp;mg/L', etc.) meaning a mass of 0.1 milligrams of [[ethyl alcohol]] per 100 milliliter [[volume]] of plasma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5171">In cognitive psychology, the '''missing letter effect''' refers to the finding that, when people are asked to [[consciously]] detect target letters while reading text, they miss more letters in frequent, function words (e.g. the letter "h" in "the") than in less frequent, content words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The effect is usually measured using a paper-and-pencil procedure, where readers are asked to circle a target letter every time they come across it while reading a short passage.  The missing letter effect is more likely to appear when reading words that are part of a normal sequence, than when words are embedded in a mixed-up sequence (e.g. readers asked to read backwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Two primary hypotheses tried to explain the missing letter effect: [[Alice F. Healy|Healy]] (1994) emphasized identification processes playing a crucial role, almost entirely focusing on word frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Koriat &amp; Greenberg (1994) viewed the structural role of the word within a sentence (i.e. function words vs. content words) to be crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A new model called the guidance-organization model was recently proposed to potentially explain the missing letter effect. It is a combination of the two models proposed by Healy, Koriat, and Greenberg.  As Greenberg et al. explain: "The time spent processing high-frequency function words at the whole-word level is relatively short, thereby enabling the fast and early use of these words to build a tentative structural frame."&lt;ref&gt;

They suggest that attention disengages faster from functional words than content words leading to the missing letter effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">In 1938, [[Henry Murray]]  developed a system of [[needs]] as part of his theory of personality, which he called 'personology.' He argued that everyone had a set of universal basic needs, with individual differences on these needs leading to the uniqueness of personality through varying dispositional tendencies for each need; in other words, specific needs are more important to some than to others. In his theory, Murray argues that needs and presses (another component of the theory) acted together to create an internal state of disequilibrium; the individual is then driven to engage in some sort of behavior to reduce the tension. Murray believed that the study of personality should look at the entire person over the course of their lifespan – that people needed to be analysed in terms of complex interactions and whole systems rather than individual parts – and an individual's behaviors, needs and their levels, etc. are all part of that understanding. Murray also argued that there was a biological (specifically neurological) basis for personality and behavior&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Explorations in Personality|date=1938|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flett|first1=Gordon L|title=Personality theory and research: an international perspective|date=2014|publisher=Wiley Global Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Needs ==

Murray defines a need as a drive that has the potential to prompt a behavior from the person. For example, the need for affiliation may drive a person to join social organization. Needs are often influenced by environmental stimulus or 'presses,' another component of Murray's theory.

Individual differences in levels of needs lead to the uniqueness of a person's personality; in other words, specific needs may be more important to some than to others. According to Murray, human needs are psychogenic in origin, function on an unconscious level, and can play a major role in defining personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frustration of these psychogenic needs plays a central role in the origin of [[psychological pain]].&lt;ref name="Shneidman_1996"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Shneidman ES | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Suicidal Mind | edition = | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | year = 1996 | pages =  | isbn = | chapter =  | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=rn4pf7-dca0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+suicidal+mind&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qIGjSw106n&amp;sig=A2b8DvJxC9gwoHPAJiiiEFaqdeU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N74RUMWMDKjmiwKX8oHIAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20suicidal%20mind&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that these needs could be measured by projective tests, specifically one he had developed, known as the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT). Unlike [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], Murray's needs are not based on a hierarchy; individuals may be high in one and low in the other, and multiple needs may be affected by a single action.

Murray differentiated each need as unique, but recognized commonalities among them, codified at least partially in his categorization system. Behaviors may meet more than one need:  for instance, performing a difficult task for your fraternity may meet the needs of both achievement and affiliation. While each need is important in and of itself, he also believed that needs can support or conflict with one another, and can be interrelated. He coined the term 'subsidation of needs' to describe when two or more needs are combined in order to satisfy a more powerful need, and the term 'fusion of needs' to describe when a single action satisfies more than one need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, the need for dominance may conflict the need with affiliation when overly controlling behavior drives away family, romantic partners, and friends. A need may be a purely internal state, but more often it is evoked by a press.

== Presses ==

Murray argued environmental factors play a role in how psychogenic needs are displayed in behavior. He used the term 'presses' to describe external influences on motivation that may influence an individual's level of a need as well as their subsequent behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 'press' of an object is what it can do for or to the subject.

Any stimulus with the potential to affect the individual in a positive or negative way is referred to as 'pressive,' and everything else is referred to as inert. 'Pressive Perception' is how the subject interprets a press as either a positive or negative stimulus. 'Pressive Apperception' refers to the subjects anticipation that the stimulus will be perceived as either positive or negative. Murray notes that both Pressive Perception and Apperception are largely unconscious. Presses may have positive or negative effects, may be mobile (affecting the subject if they do nothing) or immobile (affecting the subject if they take an action), and may be an alpha press (real effects) or a beta press (merely perceived).

== Needs by Category ==
Murray divides needs into several binary categories; Manifest (Overt) or Latent (Covert), Conscious or Unconscious, and Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Manifest (sometimes called overt) needs are those that are allowed to be directly expressed, while latent (sometimes called covert) needs are not outwardly acted on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Paul|last2=Culbertson|first2=Amy L.|last3=Magnusson|first3=Paul|title=Human Needs: A Literature Review and Cognitive Life Span Model|journal=Navy Personnel Research and Development Center|date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conscious needs as those that a subject can self-report, while Unconscious needs are all others. This is distinct from manifest vs latent in that a person may directly express a need they are unaware of, or not express a need they are aware of. The categorization most commonly referred to is the division between Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs.

=== Primary/Viscerogenic Needs ===
Primary (Viscerogenic) needs are defined by Murray&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as needs involving some biological process and arise in response to certain stimuli or events that drive the body towards a certain outcome ('positive' or 'negative').For example, dehydration would trigger a "need for water," which in turn drives a person to seek out and intake water. The first six primary needs; Air, Water, Food, Sentience, Sex, and Lactation, are considered 'positive' needs, as they drive a person towards a certain object or action. The remaining seven; Expiration, Urination, Defecation, and the four avoidance needs (see 'Retraction' below), are considered to be 'negative' needs as they drive a person away from an object (or in some cases towards the expulsion of an object).

=== Secondary/Psychogenic Needs ===
Secondary (Psychogenic) needs emerge from or are influenced by primary needs. Murray identified 17 secondary needs, each belonging to one of eight need domains: Ambition, Materialism, Status, Power, Sado-Masochism, Social-Conformance, Affection, and Information. Needs in each domain have similar themes underpinning them; for instance, the Ambition domain contains all those needs which relate to achievement and recognition.

==Applications==

===Personality testing===

Murray's system of needs has influenced the creation of personality testing, including both objective and subjective measures&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. A personality test is a questionnaire or other standardized instrument designed to reveal aspects of an individual's character or psychological makeup. Murray's system of needs directly influenced the development of a variety of personality measures, including the ''Personality Research Form'' and the ''Jackson Personality Inventory''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Thematic apperception test.|date=1943|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Thematic apperception test===

Henry Murray, along with [[Christiana Morgan]], developed the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) as a tool to assess personality. The TAT is based on the assumption that human unconscious needs are directed towards an external stimulus. Murray and Morgan created the TAT to evaluate "press" and "need," which Murray emphasized in his theory of personality. The TAT is administered  by an  assessor, who chooses a subset of cards (generally concerning a particular theme, or those that they feel best suit the subject) out of the 32 available; Murray recommended selecting 20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cramer|first1=P|title=Storytelling, narrative, and the Thematic Apperception Test.|date=2004|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each card features various ambiguous scenes which relate to interpersonal situations. The test-taker is asked to give a detailed explanation of what they see. For example, an explanation may include a narrative of what is happening and what may unfold, and what the characters in the scene are feeling or thinking. From this narrative, the assessor uses Murray's theoretical themes to infer personality characteristics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Further research===

Murray's theory of personality was the basis for several areas of further psychological research. Three of the needs he identified–the [[need for power]], the [[need for affiliation]], and the [[need for achievement]]–were later the subject of substantial study and considered especially significant; used to develop theories such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], [[David McClelland]]'s 'Achievement Motivation Theory', aspects of [[Richard Boyatzis]]' competency-based models of management effectiveness, and more.

Murray's concept of the 'press' and his emphasis on the importance of environmental events (and their subjective interpretation) were also highly significant to later psychological research. Behavioral psychology-pioneered by [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]-focused on environmental events, while cognitive psychology included a focus on subjective interpretation of events, based on another one of Murray's ideas (his categorization of presses as either Alpha or Beta).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Salem health: psychology &amp; mental health|last1=Piotrowski|first1=Nancy A|date=2010|publisher=Salem Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Although Murray's theory has had a substantial influence on personality testing and research, some critics say that his system of needs is too broad and rather subjective. One criticism of this hierarchy is that it lacks the objective criterion for needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Determinants, Dynamics, and Potentials|last=Cervone|first=Daniel|last2=Vittorio Caprara|first2=Gian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521587484|location=|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be said that some of the needs can conflict with each other like achievement and nurturance, which deal with opposing ideas of having to obstacles with achievement being active and nurturance being passive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When evaluating the TAT, critics have claimed that the test has a low test-retest reliability and validity. This could possibly be due to contrasting instructions from the experimenters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many species of [[Staphylinidae]] (commonly known as “rove beetles”) have developed complex interspecies relationships with ants, known as [[myrmecophily]]. Rove Beetles are among the most rich and diverse families of myrmecophilous beetles, with a wide variety of relationships with ants. Ant associations range from near free-living species which prey only on ants, to obligate [[inquilines]] of ants, which exhibit extreme morphological and chemical adaptations to the harsh environments of ant nests. Some species are fully integrated into the host colony, and are cleaned and fed by ants. Many of these, including species in tribe Clavigerini, are [[Myrmecophagy|myrmecophagous]], placating their hosts with glandular secretions while eating the brood&lt;ref&gt;Lapeva-Gjonova, Albena (April 2013). “Ant-Associated Beetle Fauna in Bulgaria: A Review and New Data”. ''Psyche'' (Cairo: Hindawi Pub. Co.) 2013: 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Staphylinidae is currently considered to be the largest family of beetles, with over 58,000 species described. As such, many myrmecophilous species are unknown. The majority of studied myrmecophilous Rove Beetles belong to the subfamily [[Aleocharinae]], including the commonly studied genera ''[[Pella (genus)|Pella]]'', ''[[Dinarda]]'', ''[[Tetradonia]]'', ''[[Ecitomorpha]]'', ''[[Ecitophya]]'', ''[[Atemeles]]'', and ''[[Limechusa]]'', and to the subfamily [[Pselaphinae]], which includes ''[[Claviger]]'' and ''[[Adranes]]''. There are also representatives of [[Scydmaenidae]], which includes 117 myrmecophilous species in 20 genera&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, Sean (2000). "Ant-Like Stone Beetles, Ants, and Their Associations (Coleoptera: Scydmaenidae; Hymenoptera: Formicidae; Isoptera)". ‘’J. N. Y. Entomol. Soc.’’ (NYC: N. Y. Entomol. Soc.) 108 (3/4): 273–303.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aleocharinae possess defensive glands on their abdomens, which are used in myrmecophilous species to prevent attacks by their host ant and in more extreme cases to integrate completely into the colony. Many Pselephinae species have [[trichomes]], tufts of hairs which hold placating pheromones. Pselephines have evolved trichomes independently at least four times, most notably in all members of Clavigerini, but also in ''Attapsenius'' and ''Songius'' genera.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Joe; Eldredge, Taro (10 Dec 2012), "The Bizarre, Beetle-Biased World of Social Insect Exploitation", ‘’Scientific American’’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and Behavior==
Due to their large number and diversity, myrmecophilous Rove Beetles occupy an array of behaviors. Myrmecophilous interactions can be generalized into categories, in three of which Staphylinids can be found. The synecthrans, or “persecuted guests,” the synoeketes, or “tolerated guests,” and the symphiles, or “true guests.”&lt;ref&gt;Mynhardt, Glené (2013). "Declassifying Myrmecophily in the Coleoptera to Promote the Study of Ant-Beetle Symbioses". ‘’Psyche’’ (Cairo: Hindawi pub co) 2013: 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synecthrans===

Synecthran Staphylinids live on the periphery of the host colony and are not accepted into the colony. The majority are in the subfamily Aleocharinae, having defensive glands on their terminal abdominal segments. Species in this group, such as those in the genus ''Pella'', commonly lay their eggs in the refuse heaps of their host ant, where the larvae feed on the discarded carcasses of ants. If detected by the host ant, the larvae enters a typical defense position, facing the ant with its abdomen tip raised. Usually this behavior results in the ant palpating the beetle’s abdomen and stopping the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Holldobler, B.; Moglich, M.; Maschwitz, U. (1981). "Myrmecophilic Relationship Of ''Pella'' (coleoptera: Staphylinidae) To ''Lasius fuliginosus'' (hymenoptera: Formicidae)". ''Psyche''(Cairo: Hindawi Pub Co.) 88: 347–374&lt;/ref&gt; At least two members of ''Pella, P. funestus'' and ''P. humeralis'', produce several of their host ant’s alarm pheromones to avoid aggression.&lt;ref name="skills"&gt;Stoeffler, Michael; S. Maier, Tanja; Till, Tolasch; L. M. Steidle, Johannes (2007). "Foreign-language Skills in Rove-Beetles? Evidence for Chemical Mimicry of Ant Alarm Pheromones in Myrmecophilous ''Pella'' Beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae)". ‘’J Chem Ecol’’ (NYC: Springer Pub) 33: 1382–1392&lt;/ref&gt; Other species, like members of ''Myrmechusa, Aenictonia'', and ''Anommatochara'', prey on raiding columns or on the nests of Driver ants (''[[Dorylus]]'').&lt;ref name="social"&gt;R. Herman, Henry, ed.; H. Kistner, David (1979). ‘’Social Insects’’ 1,3. Waltham: Academic Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Myrmechusa'' species attack the ants from the rear before pulling them from the main column. If pursued, they rapidly wave their abdomens through the air, releasing a noticeable scent. Ants encountering this scent seem disoriented and take almost 20 minutes to recover.&lt;ref&gt;. Koblick, Tonya; H. Kistner, David. "A Revision of the Species of the Genus ''Myrmechusa'' from Tropical Africa with Notes on Their Behavior and Their Relationship to the Pygostenini (Coleoptera: 
Staphylinidae)". “Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am” 58 (1): 28–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synoeketes===
[[File:Vatesus with ants.jpg|thumbnail|Loricate ''Vatesus'' Sp. with host ants]]
Synoeketetic Staphylinids live in close contact with their host ants but are not integrated into the colony. These species may be further categorized as neutral, mimetic, loricate, and symphiloid synoeketes. Neutral synoeketes ignore and are ignored by their host, but feed on refuse. There are few Staphylinid neutral synoeketes, but some are found in the genus ''Athetini'', which live in the debris and fungal chambers of leaf cutter ants (''[[Atta (genus)|Atta]]'').&lt;ref name="social" /&gt; Mimetic synoeketes are myrmecoid, resembling their host ant morphologically. Many mimetic species are guests of Driver ants, which are blind. Driver ants however have strong senses of touch, suggesting mimics fool their hosts tactilely. It is also possible that mimicry may reduce predation from more visual animals, such as birds. Loricate, or “tear-drop shaped”, synoeketes are “defensive forms”. They typically exhibit long tapering bodies with broad thoraxes and smooth bodies, which prevent aggressing ants from gripping them. Symphiloids strongly resemble “true guests,” but are not fully integrated into the colony. They are often mimics, and in some species have developed trichomes.&lt;ref&gt;M. Wheeler, William (1960). ‘’Ants: Their Structure, Development, and Behavior.’’ 9. NYC: Columbia Univ Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Syneoketes generally live on or inside of ant nests, where they feed on refuse and may steal food from their hosts. There is some overlap between synoeketes and other categories, especially in loricate species and synecthrans, and symphiloids and symphiles, where the behavior of “true guests” may be difficult to determine.

===Symphiles===
[[File:Myrmecoid staphylinidae.jpg|thumbnail|Myrmecoids ''Labidopullus ashei, Beyeria vespa, Pseudomimeciton'' sp., and ''Ecitophya bicolor'']]
Symphilic Staphylinids have been fully integrated into the host ant’s society. Symphilic species have undergone complex morphological adaptations, many becoming myrmecoid. Most have developed trichomes, which secrete appeasement pheromones. The most extreme adaptations, found in members of tribe Clavigerini, include the reduction of mouthparts for [[trophallaxis]] and the fusing of many body and antennal segments. While most symphiles use antennal contact to stimulate food giving from their host, at least one member of Clavigerini, ''Claviger testaceus'', secretes a chemical to induce regurgitation from its host ant ''[[Lasius flavus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cammaerts, R. (1992). "Stimuli inducing the regurgitation of the workers of ''Lasius flavus'' (Formicidae) upon the myrmecophilous beetle ''Claviger testaceus'' (Pselaphidae)". “Behavioural Processes” (ScienceDirect) 28 (1-2): 81–95&lt;/ref&gt; Symphiles typically take on many roles in the colony, raising young, feeding and grooming adults, and helping transport food and larvae. Many Staphylinids are capable of following ant pheromone trails, although they are not limited to following trails laid by their host ant. This allows symphiles of army ants to migrate with the colony.&lt;ref&gt;W. Rettenmeyer, Carl; D. Akre, Roger (1968). "Trail-Following by Guests of Army Ants (Hymenoptera: 
Formicidae: Ecitonini)". ''J. Kans. Entomol. Soc.'' (Kans. Entomol. Soc.) 41 (2): 165–174&lt;/ref&gt; Most species are [[Kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasites]] being fed by other members of the colony, often through [[trophallaxis]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Joseph|date=2016|title=Myrmecophily in beetles (Coleoptera): evolutionary patterns and biological mechanisms.|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/84320/1/mn22_65-108_printable.pdf|journal=Myrmecological News|volume=201, 22|pages=65-108|via=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Almost all species have also been observed feeding on the brood. Some of these species die if kept away from the appropriate ant colonies, and others lay their own eggs in ant brood galleries, effectively making them [[Obligate parasite|obligate parasites]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Chemical Mimicry==
[[Chemical mimicry]] refers to the production of one species’ chemical signals by another species. Many myrmecophilous Staphylinids have evolved chemical mimicry to deter or placate ants. Synecthrans, as non tolarated guests, primarily produce defensive secretions. ''Pella'' species produce two compounds found in their host ant ''[[Lasius fuliginosus]]'', [[undecane]] and sulcatone, which elicit aggressive and panic reactions respectively. Although it seems counterintuitive to release an aggressive alarm pheromone as a defense, the presence of sulcatone stops the aggression response to undecane. Ants exposed to the defensive secretion act less aggressively and avoid the odor.

For Staphylinids accepted into the host colony chemical mimicry is used more for camouflage. The majority of the chemical signals used are cuticular hydrocarbons, which are produced in the cuticle of the host ant at certain concentrations and are palpated to determine the identity of an ant. Species in close contact with their host ants are able to pick up the host’s hydrocarbons and imitate the ant’s hydrocarbon pattern, thus appearing in scent at least to be the same species as the host ant. As hydrocarbon patterns are specific to an individual colony, the Rove Beetles are generally restricted to one nest. The production of a new hydrocarbon pattern takes time, during which the beetle is vulnerable to detection and attack.&lt;ref name="skills" /&gt; Some species, such as ''[[Zyras comes]]'', produce volatile pheromones as well as cuticular hydrocarbons, which may provide it more protection than contact based pheromones while traveling with its host in foraging trails.&lt;ref&gt;Akino, Toshiharu (2002). "Chemical camouflage by myrmecophilous beetles ''Zyras comes'' (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and Diaritiger fossulatus (Coleoptera: Pselaphidae) to be integrated into the nest of ''Lasius fuliginosus'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)". ''Chemoecology'' (NYC: Springer pub) 12 (2): 83–89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parallel Scale Nomogram.svg|right|400px|thumb|A typical parallel-scale nomogram. This example calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17 are substituted into the equation. The isopleth crosses the scale for T at just under 4.65.]]

A '''nomogram''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] νόμος ''nomos'', "law" and γραμμή ''grammē'', "line"), also called a '''nomograph''', '''alignment chart''' or '''abaque''', is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer [[Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne|Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne]] (1862-1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel [[coordinate system]] invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard [[Cartesian coordinates]].

A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an ''index line'' or ''isopleth''.

Nomograms flourished in many different contexts for roughly 75 years because they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are obtained very quickly and reliably by simply drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a [[slide rule]], or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. In addition, nomograms naturally incorporate implicit or explicit [[domain knowledge]] into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. 
[[Image:Smith chart gen.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|An impedance [[Smith chart]] (with no data plotted)]]

Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device, and like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned. While the slide rule is intended to be a general-purpose device, a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation, with tables of values effectively built into the construction of the [[Scale (ratio)|scales]]. Nomograms are typically used in applications where the level of accuracy  they offer is sufficient and useful. Alternatively, a nomogram can be used to check an answer obtained from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation. 

Other types of graphical calculators such as '''intercept charts''', '''trilinear diagrams''' and '''hexagonal charts''' are sometimes called nomograms. Other such examples include the [[Smith chart]], a graphical calculator used in [[electronics]] and [[systems analysis]], [[thermodynamic diagram]]s and [[tephigram]]s, used to plot the vertical structure of the atmosphere and perform calculations on its stability and humidity content. These do not meet the strict definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths.

==Description==
[[Image:Components of a Nomogram.png|right|300px|thumb|Components of a parallel-scale nomogram]]
A nomogram for a three-variable equation typically has three scales, although there exist nomograms in which two or even all three scales are common. Here two scales represent known values and the third is the scale where the result is read off.  The simplest such equation is ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for the three variables ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. An example of this type of nomogram is shown on the right, annotated with terms used to describe the parts of a nomogram.

More complicated equations can sometimes be expressed as the sum of functions of the three variables. For example, the nomogram at the top of this article could be constructed as a parallel-scale nomogram because it can be expressed as such a sum after taking logarithms of both sides of the equation.

The scale for the unknown variable can lie between the other two scales or outside of them. The known values of the calculation are marked on the scales for those variables, and a line is drawn between these marks. The result is read off the unknown scale at the point where the line intersects that scale. The scales include 'tick marks' to indicate exact number locations, and they may also include labeled reference values. These scales may be [[linear]], [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], or have some more complex relationship.

The sample isopleth shown in red on the nomogram at the top of this article calculates the value of ''T'' when ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7.30 and ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.17. The isopleth crosses the scale for ''T'' at just under 4.65; a larger figure printed in high resolution on paper would yield ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.64 to three-digit precision. Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables.

Straight scales are useful for relatively simple calculations, but for more complex calculations the use of simple or elaborate curved scales may be required. Nomograms for more than three variables can be constructed by incorporating a grid of scales for two of the variables, or by concatenating individual nomograms of fewer numbers of variables into a compound nomogram.

==Applications==
Nomograms have been used in an extensive array of applications. A sample includes

* The original application by d'Ocagne, the automation of complicated [[cut and fill]] calculations for earth removal during the construction of the French national railway system. This was an important proof of concept, because the calculations are non-trivial and the results translated into significant savings of time, effort, and money.
* The design of channels, pipes and weirs for regulating the flow of water.
* The work of [[Lawrence Henderson]], in which nomograms were used to correlate many different aspects of blood physiology. It was the first major use of nomograms in the United States and also the first medical nomograms anywhere. Nomograms continue to be used extensively in medical fields.
* Ballistics calculations prior to fire control systems, where calculating time was critical.
* Machine shop calculations, to convert blueprint dimensions and perform calculations based on material dimensions and properties. These nomograms often included markings for standard dimensions and for available manufactured parts.
* Statistics, for complicated calculations of properties of distributions and for operations research including the design of acceptance tests for quality control.
* Operations Research, to obtain results in a variety of optimization problems.
* Chemistry and chemical engineering, to encapsulate both general physical relationships and empirical data for specific compounds.
* Aeronautics, in which nomograms were used for decades in the cockpits of aircraft of all descriptions. As a navigation and flight control aid, nomograms were fast, compact and easy-to-use calculators.
* Astronomical calculations, as in the post-launch orbital calculations of [[Sputnik 1]] by P.E. Elyasberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin Yu.A.Mozzhorin Memories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018165625/http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin |date=2007-10-18 }} at the website of Russian state archive for scientific-technical documentation&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engineering work of all kinds: Electrical design of filters and transmission lines, mechanical calculations of stress and loading, optical calculations, and so forth.
* Military, where complex calculations need to be made in the field quickly and with reliability not dependent on electrical devices.
*[[Seismology]], where nomograms have been developed to estimate earthquake [http://web.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/geog458558/labs/nomogram.html magnitude]

==Examples==

===Parallel-resistance/thin-lens===
[[Image:Nomogramparallelresistance.svg|right|200px|thumb|Parallel [[electrical resistance]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below performs the computation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1/A+1/B}=\frac{AB}{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;

This nomogram is interesting because it performs a useful nonlinear calculation using only straight-line, equally graduated scales. While the diagonal line has a scale &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; times larger than the axes scales, the numbers on it exactly match those directly below or to its left, and thus it can be easily created by drawing a straight line diagonally on a sheet of [[graph paper]].

''A'' and ''B'' are entered on the horizontal and vertical scales, and the result is read from the diagonal scale.  Being proportional to the [[harmonic mean]] of ''A'' and ''B'', this formula has several applications.  For example, it is the [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel-resistance formula]] in [[electronics]], and the [[Thin lens|thin-lens equation]] in [[optics]].

In the example, the red line demonstrates that parallel resistors of 56 and 42&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]s have a combined resistance of 24&amp;nbsp;ohms. It also demonstrates that an object at a distance of 56&amp;nbsp;cm from a [[lens (optics)|lens]] whose [[focal length]] is 24&amp;nbsp;cm forms a [[real image]] at a distance of 42&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Chi-squared test computation===
[[Image:chisquarenomo3.png|right|200px|thumb|[[Chi-squared distribution]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below can be used to perform an approximate computation of some values needed when performing a familiar statistical test, [[Pearson's chi-squared test]]. This nomogram demonstrates the use of curved scales with unevenly spaced graduations.

The relevant expression is

:&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

The scale along the top is shared among five different ranges of observed values: A, B, C, D and E. The observed value is found in one of these ranges, and the tick mark used on that scale is found immediately above it. Then the curved scale used for the expected value is selected based on the range. For example, an observed value of 9 would use the tick mark above the 9 in range A, and curved scale A would be used for the expected value. An observed value of 81 would use the tick mark above 81 in range E, and curved scale E would be used for the expected value. This allows five different nomograms to be incorporated into a single diagram.

In this manner, the blue line demonstrates the computation of

:(9 &amp;minus; 5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ 5 = 3.2

and the red line demonstrates the computation of

:(81 &amp;minus; 70)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 70 = 1.7

In performing the test, [[Yates's correction for continuity]] is often applied, and simply involves subtracting 0.5 from the observed values. A nomogram for performing the test with Yates's correction could be constructed simply by shifting each "observed" scale half a unit to the left, so that the 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ... graduations are placed where the values 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... appear on the present chart.

===Food risk assessment===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food [[risk assessment]] nomogram]]
Although nomograms represent mathematical relationships, not all are mathematically derived.  The following one was developed graphically to achieve appropriate end results that could readily be defined by the product of their relationships in subjective units rather than numerically. The use of non-parallel axes enabled the non-linear relationships to be incorporated into the model.

The numbers in square boxes denote the axes requiring input after appropriate assessment.

The pair of nomograms at the top of the image determine the probability of occurrence and the availability, which are then incorporated into the bottom multistage nomogram.

Lines 8 and 10 are ‘tie lines’ or ‘pivot lines’ and are used for the transition between the stages of the compound nomogram.

The final pair of parallel logarithmic scales (12) are not nomograms as such, but reading-off scales to translate the risk score (11, remote to extremely high) into a sampling frequency to address safety aspects and other ‘consumer protection’ aspects respectively.  This stage requires political ‘buy in’ balancing cost against risk.  The example uses a three-year minimum frequency for each, though with the high risk end of the scales different for the two aspects, giving different frequencies for the two, but both subject to an overall minimum sampling of every food for all aspects at least once every three years.

This [[risk assessment]] nomogram was developed by the [[Public analyst|UK Public Analyst Service]] with funding from the [[Food Standards Agency|UK Food Standards Agency]] for use as a tool to guide the appropriate frequency of sampling and analysis of food for official food control purposes, intended to be used to assess all potential problems with all foods, although not yet adopted.

===Sample size estimation===
[[File:Power0501.pdf|thumb|Nomograph for Sample Size Estimation]]

This nomograph can be used to estimate the sample size requirements for statistical analyses. It uses four parameters: ''&amp;alpha;'' (fixed), effect size (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;''), statistical power, and number of cases ''N'' (two scales for ''&amp;alpha;'' = .05 (liberal) or .01 (conservative)).

The hypothesized effect size in the population can either be expressed as a correlation coefficient (''&amp;rho;'') or a normalized difference in means (''&amp;delta;'') for a [[T-test]]. The normalized difference is equal to the absolute value of the difference between two population means (''&amp;mu;''₁ &amp;minus; ''&amp;mu;''₂), divided by the pooled standard deviation (''s'').

The statistical power desired is estimated by 1 &amp;minus; ''&amp;beta;'', where ''&amp;beta;'' is equal to the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;II error. A [[type II error|''Type&amp;nbsp;II'' error]] is failing to reject the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact the null hypothesis is false in the population and should be rejected. Cohen (1977)&lt;ref name=Cohen_1977&gt;Cohen, J. (1977). ''Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences'', 2nd.&amp;nbsp;ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; recommends using power equal to 0.80 or 80%, for a ''&amp;beta;'' = 0.20&amp;nbsp;.

The sample size or number of cases required is reported for two standard levels of statistical significance (''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 or 0.05). The value of ''&amp;alpha;'' is the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;I error. A [[type I error|''Type&amp;nbsp;I'' error]] is rejecting the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., claiming that either ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact it ''is'' true (the value ''is'' zero) in the population and should ''not'' be rejected. The most commonly used values of &amp;alpha; are 0.05 or 0.01&amp;nbsp;.

To find the sample size requirements for a given statistical analysis, estimate the effect size expected in the population (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'') on the left hand axis, select the desired level of power on the right hand axis, and draw a line between the two values.

Where the line intersects with either the ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.05 or ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 middle axis will indicate the sample size required to achieve statistical significance of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05 or 0.01, respectively (for the previously given parameters).

For instance, if one estimates the population correlation (''&amp;rho;'') to be 0.30, and desires statistical power equal to 0.80, then to obtain a significance level of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05, the sample size requirement would be ''N'' = 70 cases rounded up (more precisely approximately 68&amp;nbsp;cases using interpolation).

'''ProMusa''' is a platform of scientists and other stakeholders to facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge on banana. It is managed by [[Bioversity International]], through funding from the [[CGIAR]] Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas.

== History ==
Promusa was initiated in 1997 by the [[World Bank]] and [[International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain|INIBAP]] as a global program to co-ordinate and improve research on banana improvement. Its aim was to increase interactions between pathologists and the world’s few banana breeders in order to maximize the outputs of breeding and accelerate the impact of banana improvement efforts.

At the start, the program had five interlinked thematic working groups (Genetic Improvement, Fusarium wilt, Sigatoka diseases, Nematodes and Viruses), coordinated by a secretariat which was provided by INIBAP.&lt;ref&gt;Sharrock, S., Orjeda, G. and Frison, E.A. 1998. [http://www.musalit.org/seeMore.php?id=4783  ProMusa - a global programme for Musa improvement]. p.337-344. In: Galán Saúco, V. (ed.). Proceedings of First International Symposium on Banana in the Subtropics, Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Spain, 1997/11/10-14. Acta Horticulturae 490. ISHS, Leuven, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by a steering committee and operated under a program support group composed of major donors and stakeholders.

In 2006, the program was reorganized into three working groups (Crop Production, Crop Protection and Crop Improvement). Since 2006, ProMusa also provides the basic structure for the Section on Banana and Plantain (SEBA) of the [[International Society for Horticultural Science]] (ISHS).

== Membership and organizational structure ==
Membership to ProMusa is open to anyone interested in banana. ProMusa is overseen by a steering committee composed of the ProMusa coordinator, the chair and vice-chair of each of the three working groups and ISHS-SEBA, a representative of the global ''Musa'' genetic resources network [[MusaNet]] and a representative of each of four regional banana R&amp;D networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promusa.org/article7 http://www.promusa.org/article7]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bioversity International provides the Secretariat of ProMusa.

== Main activities ==
In alliance with ISHS, ProMusa organizes scientific symposia, oversees the development of an online, collaboratively built and peer-reviewed compendium of knowledge on bananas (Musapedia), and produces a newsletter that puts in context scientific breakthroughs on banana and highlights relevant news and events (InfoMus@).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promusa.org/article8 http://www.promusa.org/article8]&lt;/ref&gt; ProMusa also manages three databases: a repository of references on banana (Musalit); an image bank on banana (Musarama), and a contacts database (Musacontacts).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6565">{{About|a class of formal languages as they are studied in mathematics and theoretical computer science|computer languages that allow a function to call itself recursively  |Recursion (computer science)}}

In [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[computer science]], a [[formal language]] (a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of finite sequences of [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s taken from a fixed [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]) is called '''recursive''' if it is a [[recursive set|recursive subset]] of the set of all possible finite sequences over the alphabet of the language. Equivalently, a formal language is recursive if there exists a [[total Turing machine]] (a [[Turing machine]] that halts for every given input) that, when given a finite sequence of symbols as input, accepts it if it belongs to the language and rejects it otherwise. Recursive languages are also called '''decidable'''.

The concept of '''decidability''' may be extended to other [[models of computation]]. For example one may speak of languages decidable on a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]].  Therefore, whenever an ambiguity is possible, the synonym for "recursive language" used is '''Turing-decidable language''', rather than simply ''decidable''.

The class of all recursive languages is often called '''[[R (complexity)|R]]''', although this name is also used for the class [[RP (complexity)|RP]].

This type of language was not defined in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of {{Harv|Chomsky|1959}}. All recursive languages are also [[recursively enumerable language|recursively enumerable]]. All [[regular language|regular]], [[context-free language|context-free]] and [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]] languages are recursive.

== Definitions ==

There are two equivalent major definitions for the concept of a recursive language:

# A recursive formal language is a [[recursive set|recursive]] [[subset]] in the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible words over the [[alphabet]] of the [[formal language|language]].
# A recursive language is a formal language for which there exists a [[Turing machine]] that, when presented with any finite input [[literal string|string]], halts and accepts if the string is in the language, and halts and rejects otherwise. The Turing machine always halts: it is known as a [[Machine that always halts|decider]] and is said to ''decide'' the recursive language.

By the second definition, any [[decision problem]] can be shown to be decidable by exhibiting an [[algorithm]] for it that terminates on all inputs. An [[undecidable problem]] is a problem that is not decidable.

== Examples ==

As noted above, every context-sensitive language is recursive. Thus, a simple example of a recursive language is the set ''L={abc, {{not a typo|aabbcc}}, {{not a typo|aaabbbccc}}, ...}'';
more formally, the set
: &lt;math&gt;L=\{\,w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w=a^nb^nc^n \mbox{ for some } n\ge 1 \,\}&lt;/math&gt; 
is context-sensitive and therefore recursive.

Examples of decidable languages that are not context-sensitive are more difficult to describe. For one such example, some familiarity with [[mathematical logic]] is required: [[Presburger arithmetic]] is the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition (but without multiplication). While the set of [[First-order_logic#Formulas|well-formed formulas]] in Presburger arithmetic is context-free, every deterministic Turing machine accepting the set of true statements in Presburger arithmetic has a worst-case runtime of at least &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{cn}}&lt;/math&gt;, for some constant ''c''&gt;0 {{harv|Fischer|Rabin|1974}}. Here, ''n'' denotes the length of the given formula. Since every context-sensitive language can be accepted by a [[linear bounded automaton]], and such an automaton can be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with worst-case running time at most &lt;math&gt;c^n&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''c'' {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}, the set of valid formulas in Presburger arithmetic is not context-sensitive. On positive side, it is known that there is a deterministic Turing machine running in time at most triply exponential in ''n'' that decides the set of true formulas in Presburger arithmetic {{harv|Oppen|1978}}. Thus, this is an example of a language that is decidable but not context-sensitive.

== Closure properties ==

Recursive languages are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are two recursive languages, then the following languages are recursive as well:
* The [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt;
* The image φ(L) under an [[Homomorphism#Formal language theory|e-free homomorphism]] φ
* The concatenation &lt;math&gt;L \circ P&lt;/math&gt;
* The union &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt;
* The intersection &lt;math&gt;L \cap P&lt;/math&gt;
* The complement of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;
* The set difference &lt;math&gt;L - P&lt;/math&gt;

The last property follows from the fact that the set difference can be expressed in terms of intersection and complement.

'''Scandinavian design''' is a [[design]] movement characterized by simplicity, [[minimalism]] and functionality that emerged in the early 20th century, and which flourished in the 1950s, in the five [[Nordic countries]] of [[Danish design|Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's The Deal With Scandinavian Furniture?|url=https://emfurn.com/blogs/elite-modern-furniture-blog/whats-the-deal-with-scandinavian-furniture|website=EMFURN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the Danish ''Selskabet for Dekorativ Kunst'' (Company for Decorative Arts) launched its ''{{ill |Skønvirke |da}}'' (literally "Graceful Work") magazine. Its title became the name of a new Danish style of arts and crafts, to rival [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Jugendstil]].&lt;ref name=Rekkali&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rekkali |first1=Zeynep |title=Danish Design: The birth, rise, fall and resurrection |url=https://danish.tm/article/danish-design-birth-rise-fall-resurrection/ |publisher=Danish |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s, designers such as [[Alvar Aalto]] (furniture, textiles),&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{cite web |title=Scandinavian design |url=https://www.scandinavia-design.fr/design-scandinave_en.html |publisher=Scandinavia design |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arne Jacobsen]] (chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Borge Mogensen]] (furniture),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Hans J.

The [[Lunning Prize]], awarded to outstanding Scandinavian designers between 1951 and 1970, was instrumental in making Scandinavian design a recognized commodity, and in defining its profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krondahl |first1=Hans |title=Tema Lunning Prize winners |url=http://runeberg.org/tema/lunning.html |publisher=Runeberg |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the [[Brooklyn Museum]] held its "Design in Scandinavia" exhibition, and a fashion for "Scandinavian Modern" furniture began in America.&lt;ref name=Rekkali/&gt;{{sfn|Englund|Schmidt|Wood|2007}}{{sfn|Halén|Wickman|2003}} Scandinavian design is by no means limited to furniture and household goods. It has been applied to industrial design, such as of consumer electronics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingdal |first1=Cecilie |title=Let there be light |url=https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/stories/cecilie-ingdal |publisher=[[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobile phones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The new old principles of HMD's #Nokia design |url=http://nokiamob.net/2017/08/15/the-new-old-principles-of-hmds-nokia-design/ |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=3 January 2018 |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Gavin |title=Designed to Delight |url=https://www.volvocars.com/intl/cars/new-models/xc60/stories/scandinavian-design |publisher=[[Volvo]] |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Scandinavian design has been the subject of scholarly debate, exhibitions and marketing agendas since the 1950s. Many emphasize the democratic design ideals that were a central theme of the movement and are reflected in the rhetoric surrounding contemporary Scandinavian and international design. Others, however, have analyzed the reception of Scandinavian design abroad, seeing in it a form of myth-making and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leary, Erin |title='The Total Absence of Foreign Subjects': The Racial Politics of US Interwar Exhibitions of Scandinavian Design |journal=Design and Culture |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=283–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish Design is a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century. Influenced by the German [[Bauhaus]] school, many [[Danish people|Danish]] designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and production, such as [[Arne Jacobsen]]'s 1958 [[Egg (chair)|Egg chair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Chair|url=http://www.aram.co.uk/egg-chair.html|publisher=Aram|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poul Henningsen]]'s 1926 [[PH-lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  title=The PH lamp |  publisher=Visit Denmark |  deadurl=yes |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215054112/http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  archivedate=2012-02-15 |  df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]], conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design. The emphasis was on furniture but [[architecture]], silver, ceramics, [[glass]] and textiles also benefitted from the trend. Denmark's [[late industrialisation]] combined with a tradition of high-quality [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] formed the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netpublikationer.dk/UM/8584/pdf/Furniture20and20Indust43D234.pdf | title=Furniture and Industrial Design | publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Denmark| accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===In Iceland===

Design in Iceland is a relatively young tradition, starting in the 1950s but now growing rapidly. The country's limited options for manufacturing and its constrained choice of materials have both forced designers to be innovative, though wool remains a staple material, whether felted or knitted. Iceland's Museum of Design and Applied Art, aiming to record Icelandic design from 1900 onwards, opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design and Architecture {{!}} General information |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDICDESIGN/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iceland Academy of the Arts was also founded in 1998, soon followed by  its Faculty of Architecture and Design, which has promoted a distinctively Icelandic character in the nation's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iceland Design Centre |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDDESIGNCENTRE/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===In Sweden===
{{see|Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design}}

Swedish design is considered minimalist, with an emphasis on functionality and simple clean lines. This has applied especially to furniture. Sweden is known for traditional crafts including glass and [[Sami people|Sami]] handicrafts. Swedish design was pioneered by [[Anders Beckman]] (graphics), [[Bruno Mathsson]] (furniture), [[Märta Måås-Fjetterström]] and [[Astrid Sampe]] (textile), and [[Sixten Sason]] (industrial). Organisations that promote design in Sweden are [[Svensk Form]], the Swedish society of crafts and design, founded in 1845; the [[Swedish Industrial Design Foundation]], known as SVID; the [[Swedish Arts Council]]; and the [[Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design]] (known as ArkDes) on the island of [[Skeppsholmen]] in Stockholm, beside the [[Moderna Museet|modern art museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stylish functionality |url=https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/swedish-design/|publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], '''solfège''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|s|ɒ|l|f|ɛ|dʒ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|Solfège}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|s|ɒ|l|ˈ|f|ɛ|ʒ}}; {{IPA-fr|sɔlfɛʒ|lang}}) or '''solfeggio''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɒ|l|ˈ|f|ɛ|dʒ|i|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|solˈfeddʒo|lang}}), also called '''sol-fa''', '''solfa''', '''solfeo''', among many names, is a [[music education]] method used to teach [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Sight singing#Sight-singing|sight singing]] of [[Western classical music|Western music]]. Solfège is a form of [[solmization]], and though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the systems used in other music cultures such as ''[[swara]]'', ''durar mufaṣṣalāt'' and ''[[Jianpu]]'' are discussed in their respective articles.

[[Syllable]]s are assigned to the notes of the scale and enable the musician to audiate, or mentally hear, the pitches of a piece of music which he or she is seeing for the first time and then to sing them aloud. Through the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (and much later in some [[shapenote]] publications) various interlocking 4, 5 and 6-note systems were employed to cover the octave. The [[tonic sol-fa]] method popularized the seven syllables commonly used in English-speaking countries: ''do'' (or ''doh'' in [[tonic sol-fa]]),&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 2nd Ed.(1998) {{page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''re'', ''mi'', ''fa'', ''so(l)'', ''la'', and ''si'' (or ''ti''), see [[Fixed do solfège|below]]).

There are two current ways of applying solfège: 1) [[#Fixed do solfège|fixed do]], where the syllables are always tied to specific pitches (e.g. "do" is always "C-natural") and 2) [[#Movable do solfège|movable do]], where the syllables are assigned to [[scale degree]]s ("do" is always the first degree of the [[major scale]]).

==Etymology==
[[Italian language|Italian]] "solfeggio" and English/French "solfège" derive from the names of two of the syllables used: ''sol'' and ''fa''.&lt;ref name="mw-solfeggio"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The generic term "[[solmization]]", referring to any system of denoting pitches of a musical scale by syllables, including those used in India and Japan as well as solfège, comes from French ''solmisatio'', from the Latin solfège syllables ''sol'' and ''mi''.&lt;ref name="mw-solmization"&gt;

The verb "to sol-fa" means to sing a passage in solfège.&lt;ref name="mw-sol-fa"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In eleventh-century [[Italy]], the music theorist [[Guido of Arezzo]] invented a notational system that named the six pitches of the [[hexachord]] after the first syllable of each line of the Latin [[hymn]] ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', the "Hymn to St. John the Baptist", yielding ''ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la''.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, Norman (1997), ''Europe'', pp.271-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNaught"/&gt; Each successive line of this hymn begins on the next [[scale degree]], so each pitch's name was the syllable sung at that pitch in this hymn.

[[Image:Ut Queant Laxis MT.png|thumb|Sheet Music for Ut Queant Laxis|386x386px]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Ut'''&lt;/u&gt; queant laxīs&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;'''re'''&lt;/u&gt;sonāre fībrīs
&lt;u&gt;'''Mī'''&lt;/u&gt;ra gestōrum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;'''fa'''&lt;/u&gt;mulī tuōrum,
&lt;u&gt;'''Sol'''&lt;/u&gt;ve pollūtī&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;'''la'''&lt;/u&gt;biī reātum,
&lt;u&gt;'''S'''&lt;/u&gt;ancte &lt;u&gt;'''I'''&lt;/u&gt;ōhannēs.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words were written by [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the 8th century. They translate as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
So that your servants may,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with loosened voices,
Resound the wonders&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of your deeds,
Clean the guilt&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from our stained lips,
O St. John.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Ut" was changed in the 1600s in Italy to the [[open syllable]] Do,&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; at the suggestion of the musicologue [[Giovanni Battista Doni]] (based on the first syllable of his surname), and Si (from the initials for "Sancte Iohannes") was added to complete the diatonic scale. In [[English people|Anglophone]] countries, "si" was changed to "ti" by [[Sarah Glover]] in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might [[Tonic sol-fa|begin with a different letter]].&lt;ref&gt;This also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp&lt;/ref&gt; "Ti" is used in [[tonic sol-fa]] (and in the famed American show tune "[[Do-Re-Mi]]").

An alternative theory argues that the solfège syllables (''do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti'') derive from the syllables of an [[Arabic music|Arabic]] solmization system درر مفصّلات ''Durar Mufaṣṣalāt'' ("Separated Pearls") ([[Arabic alphabet|''dāl, rā', mīm, fā', ṣād, lām, tā''']]), mentioned in the works of [[Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski]] in 1680 and later discussed by [[Jean-Benjamin de La Borde]] in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;''Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalum'' (1680) {{OCLC|61900507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Essai sur la Musique Ancienne et Moderne'' (1780) {{OCLC|61970141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Farmer |first=Henry George |authorlink=Henry George Farmer |year=1988 |title=Historical facts for the Arabian Musical Influence |publisher=Ayer Publishing |isbn=0-405-08496-X |oclc=220811631 |pages=72–82 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Guido d'Arezzo: Medieval Musician and Educator |first=Samuel D. |last=Miller |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education |volume=21 |issue=3 |date=Autumn 1973 |pages=239–45 |doi=10.2307/3345093 |jstor=3345093 |publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1973, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Elizabethan England==

In the [[Elizabethan era]], England and its related territories used only four of the syllables: mi, fa, sol, and la. "Mi" stood for modern si, "fa" for modern do or ut, "sol" for modern re, and "la" for modern mi. Then, fa, sol and la would be repeated to also stand for their modern counterparts, resulting in the scale being "fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa". The use of "fa", "sol" and "la" for two positions in the scale is a leftover from the Guidonian system of so-called "mutations" (i.e. changes of hexachord on a note, see [[Guidonian hand]]). This system was largely eliminated by the 19th century, but is still used in some [[shape note]] systems, which give each of the four syllables "fa", "sol", "la", and "mi" a different shape.

An example of this type of solmization occurs in Shakespeare's ''King Lear'', I, 2 (see {{slink||Cultural references}}).

==Modern use==
There are two main types of solfège ''[[#Movable do solfège|Movable do]]'' and ''[[#Fixed do solfège|Fixed Do]]''.

===Movable do solfège===
In ''Movable do'', or ''tonic sol-fa'', each syllable corresponds to a [[scale degree]]. This is analogous to the Guidonian practice of giving each degree of the hexachord a solfège name, and is mostly used in Germanic countries, [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Countries, and the United States.

One particularly important variant of movable do, but differing in some respects from the system described below, was invented in the nineteenth century by [[Sarah Ann Glover]], and is known as [[tonic sol-fa]].

In Italy, in 1972, [[Roberto Goitre]] wrote the famous method "Cantar leggendo", which has come to be used for choruses and for music for young children.

The pedagogical advantage of the movable-Do system is its ability to assist in the theoretical understanding of music; because a tonic is established and then sung in comparison to, the student infers melodic and chordal implications through his or her singing. Thus, while fixed-do is more applicable to instrumentalists, movable-do is more applicable to theorists and, arguably, composers.

====Major====
Movable do is frequently employed in [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Japan]] (with 5th being so,and 7th being si), [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Hong Kong]], and English-speaking Canada. The movable do system is a fundamental element of the [[Kodály method]] used primarily in [[Hungary]], but with a dedicated following worldwide. In the movable do system, each solfège syllable corresponds not to a pitch, but to a scale degree: The first degree of a major scale is always sung as "do", the second as "re", etc. (For minor keys, see below.) In movable do, a given tune is therefore always sol-faed on the same syllables, no matter what key it is in.

The solfège syllables used for movable do differ slightly from those used for fixed do, because the English variant of the basic syllables ("ti" instead of "si") is usually used, and chromatically altered syllables are usually included as well.

If, at a certain point, the key of a piece modulates, then it is necessary to change the solfège syllables at that point. For example, if a piece begins in C major, then C is initially sung on "do", D on "re", etc. If, however, the piece then modulates to G major, then G is sung on "do", A on "re", etc., and C is then sung on "fa".

====Minor====
Passages in a minor key may be sol-faed in one of two ways in movable do: either starting on do (using "me", "le", and "te" for the lowered third, sixth, and seventh degrees, and "la" and "ti" for the raised sixth and seventh degrees), which is referred to as "do-based minor", or starting on la (using "fi" and "si" for the raised sixth and seventh degrees). The latter (referred to as "la-based minor") is sometimes preferred in choral singing, especially with children.

The choice of which system is used for minor makes a difference as to how you handle modulations. In the first case ("do-based minor"), when the key moves for example from C major to C minor the syllable do keeps pointing to the same note, namely C, (there's no "mutation" of do's note), but when the key shifts from C major to A minor (or A major), the scale is transposed from do = C to do = A. In the second case ("la-based minor"), when the key moves from C major to A minor the syllable do keeps point to the same note, again C, but when the key moves from C major to C minor the scale is transposed from do = C to do = E-flat.

===Fixed do solfège===
[[Image:French keyboard.png|right|250px|thumb|The names of the notes in Romance languages.]]

In ''Fixed do'', each syllable corresponds to the name of a note. This is analogous to the Romance system naming pitches after the solfège syllables, and is used in Romance and Slavic countries, among others, including Spanish speaking countries.

In the major [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages, the syllables Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and
Si are used to name notes the same way that the letters C, D, E, F, G, A, and B are used to name notes in English. For native speakers of these languages, solfège is simply ''singing the names of the notes'', omitting any modifiers such as "sharp" or "flat" in order to preserve the rhythm. This system is called '''fixed do''' and is used in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Romania]], [[Latin America]]n countries and in French-speaking Canada as well as countries such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[Armenia]], [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Iran]], [[Taiwan]], [[Middle East]], [[Turkey]], and [[Israel]] where non-Romance languages are spoken. In the United States of America, the fixed-do system is principally taught at The [[Juilliard School]] in New York City and the [[Curtis Institute]] of Music in Philadelphia.

{{Traditional fixed do}}

In the fixed do system, shown above, accidentals do not affect the syllables used. For example, C, C{{music|sharp}}, and C{{music|flat}} (as well as {{nowrap|C{{music|doublesharp}}}} and {{nowrap|C{{music|doubleflat}}}}, not shown above) are all sung with the syllable "do".

====Chromatic variants====
Several chromatic fixed-do Systems that have also been devised to account for chromatic notes (and even for double-sharp and double-flat variants) are as follows:

=== Comparison of the two systems ===

Movable Do corresponds to our psychological experience of normal tunes.  If the song is sung a tone higher it is still perceived to be the same song, and the notes have the same relationship to each other, but in a fixed Do all the note names would be different. A movable Do emphasizes the musicality of the tune as the psychological perception of the notes is always relative to a key for the vast majority of people that do not have absolute pitch.

Sotorrio&lt;ref&gt;Sotorrio, José A (2002). ''Tone Spectra -and the Natural Elements of Music''. (1st Ed) Spectral Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that fixed-do is preferable for serious musicians, as music involving complex modulations and vague tonality is often too ambiguous with regard to key for any movable system. That is, without a prior analysis of the music, any movable-do system would inevitably need to be used like a fixed-do system anyway, thus causing confusion. With fixed-do, the musician learns to regard any syllable as the tonic, which does not force them to make an analysis as to which note is the tonic when ambiguity occurs. Instead, with fixed-do the musician will already be practiced in thinking in multiple/undetermined tonalities using the corresponding syllables.

In comparison to the movable do system, which draws on short-term [[relative pitch]] skills involving comparison to a pitch identified as the tonic of the particular piece being performed, fixed do develops long-term relative pitch skills involving comparison to a pitch defined independently of its role in the piece, a practice closer to the definition of each note in absolute terms as found in [[absolute pitch]].  The question of which system to use is a controversial subject among music educators in schools in the United States. While movable do is easier to teach and learn, some feel that fixed do leads to stronger sight-reading and better [[ear training]] because students learn the relationships between specific pitches as defined independently, rather than only the function of intervals within melodic lines, chords, and chord progressions.&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/sight-singing_folder/sight-singing.pdf ''Learning to Sight-Sing: The Mental Mechanics of Aural Imagery.''] Minneapolis: Thinking Applied, 2008, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this argument is only valid if the fixed do is used with chromatic solfège syllables.

If a performer has been trained using fixed do, particularly in those rare cases in which the performer has [[absolute pitch]] or well-developed long-term relative pitch, the performer may have difficulty playing music scored for [[transposing instruments]]: Because the "[[concert pitch]]" note to be performed differs from the note written in the sheet music, the performer may experience [[cognitive dissonance]] when having to read one note and play another. Especially in the early stages of learning a piece, when the performer has yet to gain familiarity with the melodic line of the piece as expressed in relative terms, he or she may have to mentally re-transpose the sheet music in order to restore the notes to concert pitch.

Those trained in fixed-do will argue that their act is the analogue of reading aloud in a language. Just as one reads this very sentence without parsing it grammatically, so too fixed-do is the direct sounding of the music. Where the movable-do system requires constant real-time analysis of the tonality and modulations in the score, in fixed-do the musician uses knowledge of the changing tonality to understand for example that the pitch class c-natural is the supertonic in B-Flat major or minor, and the dominant when the music modulates to F-major, but the c-note remains the same pitch.

Instrumentalists who begin [[sight-singing]] for the first time in college as music majors find movable do to be the system more consistent with the way they learned to read music.

For choirs, sight-singing fixed do using chromatic movable do syllables (see below) is more suitable than sight-singing movable do for reading [[atonal]] music, [[polytonal]] music, [[pandiatonic]] music, music that modulates or changes key often, or music in which the composer simply did not bother to write a [[key signature]]. It is not uncommon for this to be the case in modern or contemporary choral works.

==Note names==

In the countries with fixed-do, these seven syllables (with Si instead of Ti) are used to name the notes of the C-Major scale, instead of the letters C, D, E, F, G, A and B. (For example, they would say, "Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] is in Re minor, but its third movement is in [[B-flat major|Si-bemol major]].") In [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] countries, the letters are used for this purpose, and the solfège syllables are encountered only for their use in sight-singing and ear training. (They would say, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is in "d-Moll" (D minor).)

== Other possibilities to denote Solfège ==

===Rainbow Colors assigned by Isaac Newton===

[[Isaac Newton]]{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} had associated the seven solfège syllables with the seven colors of the [[rainbow]] and surmised that each color vibrated accordingly (a concept possibly related to the modern view of [[chromesthesia]]). Thus, red has the least amount of vibration while violet vibrates the most.

==Cultural references==
*The various possibilities to distinguish the notes acoustically, optically and by ways of speech and [[signed language|signs]] made the '''Solfège'' a possible [[syllabary]] for an [[International Auxiliary Language]] (IAL/LAI). This was, in the latter half of the [[19th century]], realised in the musical language [[Solresol]].

*In [[King Lear]] (Act 1, Scene 2) [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] exclaims to himself right after Edgar's entrance so that Edgar can hear him: "''O, these eclipses do portend these divisions''". Then in the 1623 [[First Folio]] (but not in the 1608 Quarto) he adds "''Fa, so, la, mi''". This Edmund probably sang (see [[#Solmization in Elizabethan England|Elizabethan solmisation]]) to the tune of ''Fa'', ''So'', ''La'', ''Ti'' (e.g. F, G, A, B in C major), i.e. an ascending sequence of three whole tones with an ominous feel to it: see [[tritone#Historical uses|tritone (historical uses)]].

*In ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', the song "[[Do-Re-Mi]]" is built around solfège.  Maria sings it with the von Trapp children to teach them to sing the major scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19065">'''Spatial citizenship''' describes the ability of individuals and groups to interact and participate in societal [[space|spatial]] decision making through the [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] production and use of geo-media (geographic media such as [[map]]s, [[virtual globe]]s, [[GIS]], and the [[Geoweb]]). Spatial citizens are lay users who are able to use geo-media to question existing perspectives on action in space (e.g. [[Convention (norm)|social rule]]s, [[spatial planning]]) and to produce, communicate, and negotiate alternative spatial visions.

Spatial citizenship is an educational approach at the intersection of [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and geography education. Its main theoretical reference points are [[Emancipation|emancipatory]] forms of [[citizenship]] and the "reflexive appropriation of space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boscaljon |first=Daniel |date=Spring 2014 |title=The reflexive appropriation of space |journal=Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies |volume=15 |pages=3–11 |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1438&amp;context=ijcs |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference points in citizenship education ==
Spatial citizenship can be distinguished from traditional citizenship education approaches in many respects: 
* Spatial citizenship respects multiple institutional and locational setups. It is de-linked from traditional national "citizenship" as it is not tied to the nation or local state as predefined spatial entities. Spatial citizenship is based upon the principles of [[human rights]] and [[democracy|democratic negotiation]] to ensure a basis for conciliation and compromise.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} It is based on the concept of activist citizenship (in contrast to [[active citizenship]]) formulated by Katharyne Mitchell and Sarah Elwood, who challenge unquestioned social rules that limit participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elwood |first1=Sarah |last2=Mitchell |first2=Katharyne |date=Winter 2013 |title=Another politics is possible: neogeographies, visual spatial tactics, and political formation |journal=Cartographica |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=275–292 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katharyne_Mitchell/publication/265895477_Another_Politics_Is_Possible_Neogeographies_Visual_Spatial_Tactics_and_Political_Formation/links/54c07e490cf28eae4a696b59.pdf |quote=Recognizing neogeography as a site of political formation paves the way toward realizing its broader potential in the development and practice of a critical spatial citizenship. We develop these arguments from a three-year neogeography project conducted with young teens. [...] As an example of neogeography politics conceived as strategy, Gryl and Jekel (2012) argue that collaborative online "geo-media" (which has been termed neogeography in this article) can be sites for the development and practice of critical spatial citizenship. They argue that this critical spatial citizenship depends upon citizens' abilities to engage in "strategic practices" (de Certeau 1984), such as having the cartographic and spatial thinking skills necessary to use geo-media in ways that will be recognized by policymakers or other citizens and to use these platforms to disseminate their own spatial narratives or challenge those put forth by others. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spatial citizenship refers to an open and flexible conception of social institutions. It supplants the notion of belonging to one specific place with the notion of belonging to multiple and fluid [[community|communities]] that may or may not be linked with a particular location on the Earth's surface. Angharad Stephens and Vicki Squire have argued that societal negotiation processes have shifted away from fixed communities due to new information technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stephens |first1=Angharad Closs |last2=Squire |first2=Vicki |date=June 2012 |title=Politics through a web: citizenship and community unbound |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=551–567 |doi=10.1068/d8511 |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13714/1/13714.pdf |quote=What happens to citizenship when the nation and the state are no longer assumed to be the inevitable starting points from which politics is defined? This article considers how a refusal of the nation as political community and a questioning of the state as guarantor of rights and responsibilities reconfigure our understandings of citizenship. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Vânia |last2=Gryl |first2=Inga |date=2013 |chapter=Where do critical thinking and spatial citizenship meet?

This links to concepts of emancipated citizenship education (e.g. Bennett, Wells &amp; Rank 2009; Mitchell &amp; Elwood 2012) aimed to challenge existing frameworks of rules, referring to an ideological approach that considers power relations and divergent interests in society as driving forces. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spatial citizenship draws special attention to [[web community|web communities]] and geo-social networks. A spatial citizen is a 'self-actualizing citizen' who, in contrast to the 'dutiful citizen' concept of the past, is able to use [[Web 2.0]] and [[cloud computing|cloud]]-based applications to compare different and potentially contradicting information sources and communicate his/her own alternative ideas via [[collaboration|collaborative]] web tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=W.

== Reference points in social geography: appropriation of space ==
Spatial citizenship has become a conceptual reference point in theories of action-oriented [[social geography]] and new [[cultural geography]].&lt;ref name="Jekel2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jekel |first1=Thomas |last2=Gryl |first2=Inga |last3=Schulze |first3=Uwe |date=2015 |chapter=Education for spatial citizenship |editor1-last=Solari |editor1-first=Osvaldo Muñiz |editor2-last=Demirci |editor2-first=Ali |editor3-last=Schee |editor3-first=Joop |title=Geospatial technologies and geography education in a changing world: geospatial practices and lessons learned |location=Tōkyō; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=35–49 |isbn=9784431555186 |oclc=900306594 |doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55519-3_4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches contend that human beings constantly appropriate spaces, as they attach meanings to geographically located physical matter in order to prepare it for their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Werlen |first=Benno |date=1993 |title=Society action and space: an alternative human geography |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0415069653 |oclc=25372963 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}

In these theories, spaces are regarded as being [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]. To a large extent, the attachment of meaning works unconsciously, following socially accepted, mainstream categories and [[discourse]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Meanings given to physical objects determine the actions deemed possible. For instance, a field of asphalt in a city centre might have multiple meanings: it may be interpreted as a parking area as well as a place for ball games, with both meanings competing for dominance. As soon as one meaning becomes superior, which is a result of [[Power (social and political)|social power relations]], the other meaning may decline, become invisible, and eventually is not used anymore. The superiority of a specific meaning over another one might be supported by artifacts representing meanings attached, such as signs on buildings, structural modifications of the physical environment, or symbols and explanations of the socio-cultural significance of places and objects in spatial representations visualized via geo-media.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A mature appropriation of space therefore includes the conscious attachment of meaning as well as awareness of meanings being attached to places by others. It includes a sensibility to the multitude of meanings transported and hidden by a mainstream discourse. Keys to the mature appropriation of space are therefore the [[deconstruction]] of socially produced meanings, as well as the ability to communicate one's own, potentially contradictory meanings and negotiate them with others. This process is often mediated through the formation of a collective spatialized identity. Given that space – its uses and symbolic significance – is often the site of social and political struggle, it becomes the container for action while at the same time shaping the group development of a "us". In particular, when groups re-imagine public space for political usages, this expression of spatial citizenship is the outcome of a spatially informed collective identity.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;Sbicca, Joshua and Perdue, Robert. (2014). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14742837.2013.822782 Protest Through Presence: Spatial Citizenship and Identity Formation in Contestations of Neoliberal Crises] Social Movement Studies, Volume 13, Issue 4 pp. 309-327&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spatial citizenship in the geoinformation society ==
Geographic media (geo-media) are especially important for attaching meaning to places as they clearly connect location, information and visualization. In addition to this, geo-media represents mainly single meanings out of the many that are possible. Nowadays, geo-media have become more and more present in everyday life due to [[mobile computing]] in combination with [[Geoweb]] applications. For instance, maps on [[smart phone]]s guide people in their everyday actions, but at the same time limit their opportunities for action by limiting the variety of potential meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Florian |date=2014 |chapter=Everyday geomedia use and the appropriation of space |editor1-last=Jekel |editor1-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Sanchez |editor2-first=Eric |editor3-last=Gryl |editor3-first=Inga |editor4-last=Juneau-Sion |editor4-first=Caroline |editor5-last=Lyon |editor5-first=John |title=Learning and teaching with geomedia |location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages=10–28 |isbn=9781443862134 |oclc=885014629 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDxQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of spatial citizenship understand geo-media as instruments of [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] and [[communication]].
* Reflection on geo-media means reflecting on the limitations of previously given meanings by using theories of [[critical cartography]] to ask which aspects of potential relevance for a certain spatial problem or decision making are included and excluded in the given meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harley |first=John Brian |date=Summer 1989 |title=Deconstructing the map |journal=Cartographica |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=1–20 |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008?rgn=main;view=fulltext |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, self-reflection requires being aware of one's own, [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[hypothesis]] construction while using geo-media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacEachren |first1=Alan M. |last2=Buttenfield |first2=Barbara P. |last3=Campbell |first3=James B. |last4=DiBiase |first4=David W. |last5=Monmonier |first5=Mark |date=1992 |chapter=Visualization |editor1-last=Abler |editor1-first=Ronald |editor2-last=Marcus |editor2-first=Melvin G. |editor3-last=Olson |editor3-first=Judy M. |title=Geography's inner worlds: pervasive themes in contemporary American geography |series=Occasional publications of the Association of American Geographers |volume=2 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |pages=99–137 |isbn=0813518296 |oclc=25008961 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both aspects allow for a more mature appropriation of space with geo-media, while being aware of and gaining insight into the construction process of meanings attached to space.
* Communication with geo-media means communicating using spatial representations. Thanks to [[usability|user-friendly]] [[web mapping]] tools within the Geoweb, users ([[prosumer]]s) can easily produce their own geo-media and share it web-wide. Collaboration features allow for the negotiation of constructions of space with other users, for example through [[volunteered geographic information]] (VGI). The study of spatial citizenship examines subjectivity, impact on everyday action, social power relations, competition, and negotiation in VGI.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Spatial citizenship also aims at increasing awareness of [[geographic information]] produced involuntarily by users through automatic data collection that many Geoweb platforms (especially mobile phones) include to support the interests of service providers (see [[location-based service]]s).

== Education ==
The goal of education for spatial citizenship is to enable learners to achieve a reflexive appropriation of space as the basis for mature action in space by reflective geo-media use and active, reflective geo-media production.&lt;ref name="Jekel2015"/&gt; Using a broad variety of learning environments orientated toward the learners' needs, the educational approach of spatial citizenship is applicable at different levels from [[primary education|primary]] to [[tertiary education]]. Apart from technological proficiency, spatial citizenship education aims at two additional main competencies:
* Being able to achieve a reflective use of geo-media, while understanding the process of the social construction of spaces, with the result of either consciously accepting given meanings or producing alternative meanings.
* Being able to communicate alternative meanings effectively with geo-media and using geo-media as instruments to support [[argumentation]] in negotiation processes on contradictory meanings.

== Scientific response ==
The [[European Commission]]-funded project SPACIT furthers education for spatial citizenship by developing teacher training standards, [[curriculum|curricula]], and learning modules for teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SPACIT: education for spatial citizenship |url=http://www.spatialcitizenship.org/ |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2012-10-29 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another EU-funded project, digital-earth.eu, linked with the SPACIT project by connecting stakeholders using or interested in using geo-media in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital-earth.eu |url=http://www.digital-earth.eu/ |publisher=[[European Commission]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910112227/http://www.digital-earth.eu/ |archivedate=2015-09-10 |accessdate=2016-04-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supported spatial citizenship through the creation of [[Standards-based education reform|educational standards]], the collection of best-practice examples, and the provision of learning environments applicable to teachers in everyday classroom situations. Digital-earth.eu also promoted these concepts related to spatial citizenship in political circles concerned with the development of the Europe2020 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europe2020: Europe's growth strategy |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=2012-11-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Those firmly rooted in knowledge''' is a recurring theme in the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]]. This term is of special interest for the [[Shi'a]].

==Qur'an==
The term and its like is used in [[Al-Imran]] {{Quran-usc|3|7}} and {{Quran-usc|4|162}}.

==Sunni view==
All those who speak truth, their hearts are firm in belief, do not commit any unlawful acts, those who are well grounded in their knowledge of [[Din_(Arabic)|Deen]], their knowledge translates into their actions, does not swear or take false oaths, does not consume wealth unlawfully.

Sunni view that '''those firmly rooted in knowledge''' are the body of Muslim Jurists ({{lang-ar|[[Ulema]]|script=Latn|italic=yes}}) who interpret the [[Divine Law]] ({{lang-ar|[[sharia]]|script=Latn|italic=yes}}), deriving the [[Islamic]] [[Jurisprudence]] ({{lang-ar|[[Fiqh]]|script=Latn|italic=yes}}). 

'''[[Ulema]]''' is the plural of '''[['alim|Alim]]''', Arabic for [[wikt:knowledgeable|knowledgeable]]. This connects to the Arabic for knowledge, [[Ilm (Arabic)|ilm]], the last word of this term: "al-rasikhuna fi 'l-''''ilm'''"

==Shi'a view==
Shi'a view '''those firmly rooted in knowledge''' to be [[Muhammad]]'s [[household]] and ({{lang-ar|[[Ahl al-Bayt]]|script=Latn|italic=yes}}) himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.swipnet.se/islam/books/imamate/lesson21.htm Lesson Twenty-One: The Sources of the Imam's Knowledge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Al-Imran]] {{Quran-usc|3|7}} for some hadith in this regard.

[[File:Tracking Mountain Lions.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife employee uses radio telemetry to track mountain lions.]]
Since its inception in the 1960s, '''wildlife radio telemetry''' has become a valuable tool to track the movement and [[Ethology|behavior of animals]]. This technique uses the transmission of [[radio signal]]s to locate a transmitter attached to the animal of interest.  It is often used to obtain location data on the animal's preferred [[habitat]], [[home range]], and to understand [[population dynamics]].&lt;ref name=Silvy&gt;{{cite book|author=Silvy, Nova J.|title=The Wildlife Techniques Manual|volume=Vol. 1|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different types of [[radio telemetry]] techniques include [[very high frequency]] (VHF) transmitters, [[global positioning system]] (GPS) tracking, and [[Animal migration tracking#Satellite tracking|satellite tracking]].&lt;ref name=Farve&gt;{{cite web|author=Farve, Rey|title=Demonstration of Satellite/GPS Telemetry for Monitoring Fine-Scale Movements of Lesser Prairie-Chickens|work=Technology and Development at the USDA Forest Service|publisher=United States Forest Service|accessdate=3 April 2016|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/programs/im/satellite_gps_telemetry/wildlifetrackingtelementry.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances in technology have improved radio telemetry techniques by increasing the efficacy of data collection. However, studies involving radio telemetry should be reviewed in order to determine if newer techniques, such as collars that transmit the location to the operator via satellites, are actually required to accomplish the goals of the study.&lt;ref name=MoE&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks Resources Inventory Branch for the Terrestrial Ecosystems Task Force Resources Inventory Committee|title=Wildlife Radio-telemetry|location=Victoria, B.C.|publisher=Resources Inventory Committee|year=1998|series=Ser. 2.0|url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hts/risc/pubs/tebiodiv/wildliferadio/|accessdate=3 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917061003/https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hts/risc/pubs/tebiodiv/wildliferadio/|archivedate=17 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmitters==
The operator attaches a transmitter to an animal that gives off unique electromagnetic radio signals, which allows the animal to be located. Transmitters are available in a variety of forms and consist of an antenna, a power source, and the electronics required to produce a signal. Transmitters are chosen based on the behavior, size, and life history of the specific species being studied. In order to reduce the impact of the transmitter on the animal's behavior and quality of life, transmitters typically weigh no more than five percent of the animal's body weight.&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt; Unfortunately, the smaller the transmitter, the weaker and shorter-lived it is. Transmitters are often designed to fall off the animal at the conclusion of the study due to the unlikelihood of recapturing the tagged animals.&lt;ref name=Silvy/&gt; 
Large animals require transmitters in the form of collars, which leave room for the animal to grow without falling off. Ear tag transmitters are commonly attached to the ear of large animals that have changing neck sizes. Lightweight, adhesive transmitters are glued to the backs of smaller animals, such as bats. Necklace packs are transmitters that fit around the neck of upland game birds. Subcutaneous transmitters are applied to aquatic animals, which allows them to freely navigate underwater. Whip antennas are an omni-directional transmitter design that produces more signal over a greater distance. A harness loop antenna design, implemented for small birds, involves a transmitter being wrapped around the body.&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt;

==Receivers==
The operator uses an antenna that is attached to a receiver, which is programmed to the transmitter's frequency, to pick up the electromagnetic signals given off by the transmitter affixed to the target animal.&lt;ref name=Silvy/&gt; Receiver antennas may be hand-held or mounted on an object, and they are available in a variety of forms and functions.  These antennas are also tuned to the proper frequency for the transmitter. The receiver produces a tone that increases in loudness or has a visual signal strength indicator that pulses as the operator approaches the transmitter.&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt; 
Omnidirectional antennas have no additional elements and are used to determine the presence or absence of a signal, not its exact location. Elements are added segments of an antenna to increase the range of detectability of the receiver. Adcock antennas consist of two elements and are used to locate the direction of the signal. Loop antennas are small and useful for locating low frequency transmitters. The Yagi antenna contains 3 or 4 elements and is a strong, directional antenna commonly used to determine the location of a transmitter. Antennas can also be affixed to towers. This allows the antenna to be positioned higher, avoiding interference from buildings and trees. Boat, aircraft, and vehicle-mounted antennas allow the operator to exploit a larger area while tracking.&lt;ref name=MoE/&gt;

==Tracking animals==
Direct tracking and triangulation methods allow the operator to locate a tagged animal. Direct or VHF tracking involves using a directional antenna to follow the signal given off by the transmitter to the exact location of the tagged animal.&lt;ref name=Farve/&gt; The operator rotates the antenna until the loudest signal is found. The operator follows the signal, checking the direction of the signal frequently until he or she reaches the tagged animal. Triangulation is often used when an animal is on private or inaccessible property because it allows the operator to remotely determine the location of the tagged animal. The operator obtains three or more azimuths or bearings from locations around the signal and calculates the intersection of the azimuths to estimate the location of the transmitted animal.&lt;ref name=Silvy/&gt; 
Global positioning tracking involves a receiver that picks up signals from satellites to determine the location of a transmitted animal over time. The GPS transmitter is attached to an animal and records the location of the animal on the device by estimating the time taken for radio signals from at least three satellites to travel to the GPS transmitter. The data is collected by recapturing the animal to remove the GPS transmitter or remotely downloading the data off the transmitter. These units are often heavier and shorter-lived than the ones used for VHF tracking. Global positioning tracking is useful for migrating animals because their locations can accurately be determined, regardless of the distance they are from the operator.&lt;ref name=Farve/&gt;
Satellite tracking is similar to [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] and allows animal movement to be tracked globally. This form of tracking is useful for remote or inaccessible areas. Many of these systems implement platform terminal transmitters (PTT) that send electromagnetic signals to Argos equipment found on satellites. The Argos receivers estimate the distance to the transmitter to determine its location. This data is received by the Argos data collection relay system. The PTT transmitters require larger batteries, causing them to be heavier than VHF transmitters. Satellite tracking is more accurate at locating larger animals that are more exposed to the sky, such as birds or animals living in prairies, open deserts, or savannas.&lt;ref name=Farve/&gt;

==Applications==
Wildlife radio telemetry has advanced the research opportunities available for studying animal populations. It can be applied to many areas of management and research to determine the habitat use of tagged animals, such as roost and foraging habitat preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trivelpiece|first=Wayne Z.|last2=Bengtson|first2=John L.|last3=Trivelpiece|first3=Susan G.|last4=Volkman|first4=Nicholas J.|date=1986-01-01|title=Foraging Behavior of Gentoo and Chinstrap Penguins as Determined by New Radiotelemetry Techniques|jstor=4087187|journal=The Auk|volume=103|issue=4|pages=777–781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio telemetry has been used to study the home range and movement of populations. Specific migratory routes and dispersal behavior can be followed through radio tracking. Survivorship is often monitored with radio telemetry by studying age and [[mortality rate]]s.&lt;ref name=Silvy/&gt;
