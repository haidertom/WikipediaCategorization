'''Action theory''' (or '''theory of action''') is an area in [[philosophy]] concerned with [[Theory|theories]] about the processes [[Causality|causing]] [[Will (philosophy)|willful]] [[Motor system|human bodily movements]] of a more or less complex kind. This [[List of academic disciplines|area of thought]] involves epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, jurisprudence, and philosophy of mind, and has attracted the strong interest of philosophers ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Third Book). With the advent of [[psychology]] and later [[neuroscience]], many theories of action are now subject to [[empirical test]]ing.

Philosophical action theory, or the '''philosophy of action''', should not be confused with [[sociological]] theories of [[social action]], such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] established by [[Talcott Parsons]].

== Overview ==
Basic action theory typically describes action as behavior caused by an ''agent'' in a particular ''situation''. The agent's ''desires'' and ''beliefs'' (e.g. my wanting a glass of water and believing the clear liquid in the cup in front of me is water) lead to bodily behavior (e.g. reaching over for the glass). In the simple theory (see [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]), the desire and belief jointly cause the action. [[Michael Bratman]] has raised problems for such a view and argued that we should take the concept of intention as basic and not analyzable into beliefs and desires.

In some theories a desire plus a belief about the means of satisfying that desire are always what is behind an action. Agents aim, in acting, to maximize the satisfaction of their desires. Such a theory of prospective rationality underlies much of [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s within the more sophisticated framework of [[rational choice]]. However, many theories of action argue that rationality extends far beyond calculating the best means to achieve one's ends. For instance, a belief that I ought to do X, in some theories, can directly cause me to do X without my having to want to do X (i.e. have a desire to do X). Rationality, in such theories, also involves responding correctly to the reasons an agent perceives, not just acting on wants.

While action theorists generally employ the language of [[causality]] in their theories of what the nature of action is, the issue of what causal determination comes to has been central to controversies about the nature of [[free will]].

Conceptual discussions also revolve around a precise definition of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] in philosophy. Scholars may disagree on which bodily movements fall under this category, e.g. whether thinking should be analysed as action, and how complex actions involving several steps to be taken and diverse intended consequences are to be summarised or decomposed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6487">This ''Law'' or ''Rule'' was formulated by [[Henry Alford]] (1810-1871) as a rule of biblical interpretation. It appeared in his monumental multi-volume work completed in 1861, ''The Greek Testament'', which is still consulted today. He presented this rule as follows with specific reference to the first resurrection in Rev. 20:4–6:

:“If, in a passage where two resurrections are mentioned, where certain "souls lived" at the first, and the rest of the "dead lived" only at the end of a specified period after that first, - if in such a passage the first [[resurrection]] may be understood to mean spiritual rising with [[Christ]], while the second means literal rising from the grave; then there is an end of all significance in language, and Scripture is wiped out as a definite testimony to anything. If the first resurrection is spiritual, then so is the second, which I suppose none will be hardy enough to maintain. But if the second is literal, then so is the first, which in common with the whole [[Early Christianity|primitive Church]] and many of the best modern expositors, I do maintain, and receive as an article of faith and hope.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Alford, ''The Greek Testament'', 4 volume ed., Vol. IV, s.v. Rev. 20:5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Eldon Ladd]] refers to this Law and cites the quote above in support of his position on [[Historic Premillennialism]] and the interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]] chapter 20. Ladd writes:

:"Natural inductive [[exegesis]] suggests that both words are to be taken in the same way, referring to [[Resurrection of the dead|literal resurrection]]. We can do no better than to repeat the oft-quoted words of Henry Alford ..."&lt;ref&gt;George Eldon Ladd, "Historic Premillennialism", in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views, ed. Robert G. Clouse (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1977), pp. 37–38. Note: Ladd documents his citation as from a printing of Alford's work by Lee and Shephard, Boston, 1872, IV:732 (cp. Ladd, p. 214, note 10).&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief form of the quote from Alford above may also be found in works by Alva J. McClain,&lt;ref&gt;''The Greatness of the Kingdom: An Inductive Study of the Kingdom of God'' (Winona Lake, IN: BMH Books, 1959), p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Seiss]],&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Seiss, ''The Apocalypse: Lectures on the Book of Revelation'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, n.d., 4th reprint ed. 1962), pp. 461, 464.&lt;/ref&gt; and J. Barton Payne.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Biblical Prophecy'' (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1980), p. 618, s.v. Prediction 32.&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthier citation including the statement above is found in the works of [[William Eugene Blackstone]],&lt;ref&gt;W. E. B., ''Jesus Is Coming'' (Old Tappan, NJ: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1898, 1908, 1932), pp. 58–59. Blackstone documents this quote as from Alford's 2nd ed. (London: Rivington's, 1854), IV:726.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George N. H. Peters]]:&lt;ref&gt;''The Theocratic Kingdom'', 3 vols. (Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1952), II:291. Peters also referenced Alford's statement at II:281, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It will have been long ago anticipated by the readers of this commentary, that I cannot consent to distort its words from their plain sense and chronological place in the prophecy, on account of any considerations of difficulty, or any risk of abuses which the doctrine of the Millennium may bring with it. Those who lived next to the Apostles, and the whole Church for three hundred years, understood them in the plain literal sense; and it is a strange sight in these days to see expositors who are among the first in reverence of antiquity, complacently casting aside the most cogent instance of unanimity which primitive antiquity presents. As regards the text itself, no legitimate treatment of it will extort what is known as the spiritual interpretation now in fashion. If, in a passage where ''two resurrections'' are mentioned, where certain ''souls came to life'' at the first, and the rest of the ''dead came to life'' only at the end of a specified period after the first [v. 5a]—if in such a passage the first resurrection may be understood to mean ''spiritual'' rising with Christ, while the second means ''literal'' rising from the grave—then there is an end of all significance in language, and Scripture is wiped out as a definite testimony to anything. If the first resurrection is spiritual, then so is the second, which I suppose no one will be hardy enough to maintain. But if the second is literal, then so is the first, which in common with the primitive church and many of the best modern expositors, I do maintain and receive as an article of faith and hope."

[[Wayne Grudem]] cites the rule only to discredit it:

:"There is no fixed rule in any [[language]] that when a word is used twice in close succession it ''must'' be used in the same sense both times. It is best simply to choose from the possible senses the one that best fits the context in each case."&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Grudem, ''1 Peter'', Vol. 17 in the ''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries'' (Grand Rapids: [[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]], 1988), p. 171, s.v. 1 Pet. 4:6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] has been cited concerning Alford as follows:

:“When I’m stumped with a ... [[grammar|grammatical]] or [[syntax|syntactical]] or logical [question] in [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], I go to Henry Alford. Henry Alford ... comes closer more consistently than any other commentator to asking my kinds of questions.”&lt;ref&gt;John Piper, "The Chief Design of My Life: Mortification and Universal Holiness, Reflections on the Life and Thought of John Owen", presented January 25, 1994 at the annual Bethlehem Conference for Pastors, s.v. the "Question and Answer" session from 1:30:11–1:30:31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asimov's Guide to the Bible''''' is a work by [[Isaac Asimov]] that was first published in two volumes in 1968 and 1969, covering the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] (including [[Deuterocanonical books|the Catholic Old Testament, or deuterocanonical, books]] (See [[Catholic Bible]]) and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Old Testament books, or ''[[Deuterocanonical books#Eastern Orthodoxy|anagignoskomena]]'', along with the [[2 Esdras|Fourth Book of Ezra]]), respectively.  He combined them into a single 1296-page volume in 1981. They included maps by the artist [[Rafael Palacios (artist)|Rafael Palacios]].

Including numerous black-and-white maps, the guide goes through the books of the [[Bible]] in the order of the [[King James Version]] to the extent possible, explaining the historical and geographical setting of each one, and the political and historical influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the main characters. His appendix "Guides to the Old and New Testament" include biblical verse, footnotes, references and subject indices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46480">'''Attachment measures''' refer to the various procedures used to assess [[attachment theory|attachment]] in children and adults.

Researchers have developed various ways of assessing patterns of attachment in children. A variety of methods allow children to be classified into four attachment pattern groups: secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, and disorganized/disoriented, or assess [[Attachment disorder|disorders of attachment]]. These patterns are also referred to as Secure (Group B); Anxious/Resistant (Group C); Avoidant (Group A) and Disorganized/Controlling (Group D). The disorganized/controlling attachment classification is thought to represent a breakdown in the attachment-caregiving partnership such that the child does not have an organized behavioral or representational strategy to achieve protection and care from the attachment figure. Each pattern group is further broken down into several sub-categories. A child classified with the disorganized/controlling attachment will be given a "next best fit" organized classification.

Attachment in adults is commonly measured using the Adult Attachment Interview, the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System, and self-report questionnaires. Self-report questionnaires assess attachment style, a personality dimension that describes attitudes about relationships with romantic partners.  Adult attachment style is thought to be similar to childhood attachment patterns. There is some research that shows a link between childhood attachment patterns and attachment personality dimensions with romantic partners,&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton I, Munholland KA (1999). "Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited". In Cassidy J, Shaver PR. Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications. New York: Guilford Press. pp. 89–114. {{ISBN|1-57230-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process. Hazan, Cindy; Shaver, Phillip Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 52(3), Mar 1987, 511-524. https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511&lt;/ref&gt; but correlations are mild to moderate. The most common approach to defining attachment style is a two-dimension approach in defining attachment style.  One dimension deals with anxiety about the relationship, and the other dimension dealing with avoidance in the relationship. Another approach defines four adult attachment style categories: secure, preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant.

==Measures of attachment in infants==
{{Main|Attachment in children | Attachment theory}}
Some methods are based on observation of infants and toddlers either in natural or 'arranged' situations. Other methods, suitable for older children, are based on asking children to complete "attachment story stems," draw a picture of their family, or describe their relationships.

===Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)===
{{Main|Attachment in children}}
The Strange Situation procedure was formulated to observe attachment relationships between a caregiver and children between the age of nine and 18 months. It was developed by [[Mary Ainsworth]], a [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]]&lt;ref name="Ainsworth,1978a"&gt;Ainsworth. Mary D. (1978) ''Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-89859-461-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was devised to enable children to be classified into the attachment styles known as ''secure'', ''anxious-avoidant'' and ''anxious-ambivalent''. As research accumulated and atypical patterns of attachment became more apparent it was further developed by Main and Solomon in 1986 and 1990 to include the new category of disorganized/disoriented attachment.&lt;ref name="Main and Solomom 1986"&gt;Main, M. and Solomon, J. (1986) 'Discovery of an insecure disorganized/dioriented attachment pattern:procedures, findings and implications for the classification of behavior.' In t. Braxelton and M.Yogman (eds) ''Affective development in infancy.'' Norwood, NJ: Ablex&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Main and Solomon 1990"&gt;Main, m. and Solomon, J. (1990) 'Procedures for identifying infants as disorganized/disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation' In M.Greenberg, D. Cicchetti and E. Cummings (eds) ''Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research and intervention.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this procedure the child is observed playing for 20 minutes while caregivers and strangers enter and leave the room, recreating the flow of the familiar and unfamiliar presence in most children's lives. The situation varies in stressfulness and the child's responses are observed.  The child experiences the following situations:

#Mother (or other familiar caregiver) and baby enter room.
#Mother sits quietly on a chair, responding if the infant seeks attention.
#A stranger enters, talks to the mother then gradually approaches infant with a toy.  The mother leaves the room.
#The stranger leaves the infant playing unless he/she is inactive and then tries to interest the infant in toys.  If the infant becomes distressed this episode is ended.
#Mother enters and waits to see how the infant greets her.  The stranger leaves quietly and the mother waits until the baby settles, and then she leaves again.
#The infant is alone.  This episode is curtailed if the infant appears to be distressed.
#The stranger comes back and repeats episode 3.
#The mother returns and the stranger goes.  Reunion behaviour is noted and then the situation is ended.

Two aspects of the child's behaviour are observed:
* The amount of exploration (e.g. playing with new toys) the child engages in throughout, and
* The child's reactions to the departure and return of its caregiver.

==Measures of attachment in toddlerhood and early-middle childhood==
As the SSP is not suitable beyond 18 months of age, other measures have been developed for older ages groups, which include observational measures (in a controlled or naturalistic environment), representational methods and interview methods. Some are developed for research purposes whereas others have been developed for clinical use. Effective training of evaluators is essential, as some items to be assessed require interpretation reliability (e.g., child is "suddenly aggressive toward mother for no reason").&lt;ref name="Andreason &amp; West"&gt;Andreassen, C., &amp; West, J. (2007). Measuring socioemotional functioning in a national birth cohort study. Infant Mental Health Journal, 28(6), 627-646.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controlled observational methods===

====Preschool strange situation====
Although originally designed for 1-year-old children, Ainsworth’s strange situation has been adapted to measure the attachment and exploratory behavior of children between the ages of 2-4½ years-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=A. F.|title=Preschoolers' competence with a peer: Relations with attachment and peer experience|journal=Child Development|year=1977|volume=48|issue=4|pages=1277–1287|doi=10.2307/1128485}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental feature of the strange situation is that the situation the child is placed in must elicit stress. If the strange situation fails to stress the child, it cannot serve as an adequate environment for the measurement of attachment.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenberg|first1=M. T.|last2=Cicchetti|first2=D.|last3=Cummings|first3=E. M.|title=Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research, and intervention|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preschool strange situation features several alterations to facilitate the creation of stress in older children. These modifications include a slightly longer separation, changes in the role and/or gender of the stranger, and changes in the instructions to the caregiver. Some versions of the preschool strange situations omit the stranger altogether, thus leaving the child alone in the room throughout both separations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=J.|last2=George|first2=C.|title=Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|pages=287–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coding system used to interpret the attachment style expressed by the child has also been modified. Rather than focusing entirely on the expression of specific behaviors and emotions, the revised coding system assesses ways in which a variety of behaviors, such as talking, are organized to maintain and negotiate proximity and contact. Cassidy, Marvin and the MacArthur Working group published a version of the Strange Situation procedure designed for children within the age group of 3- to 4-years-old. In addition to categorizing a child’s attachment as secure, insecure/avoidant, insecure/ambivalent, and insecure/disorganized, the measure includes a seven-point avoidance scale and nine-point security scale.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt;

====Main &amp; Cassidy attachment classification system====
This system, devised in 1988, analyses the reunion of child and parent after a 1-hour separation. It is aimed at 6-year-olds and classifies their attachment status.&lt;ref name="Main &amp; Cassidy"&gt;Main, M. &amp; Cassidy, J. (1988) "Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period. ''Developmental Psychology 24,'' 415-426.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preschool Assessment of Attachment (PAA)====
The PAA was devised by P.Crittenden for the purpose of assessing patterns of attachment in 18-month to 5-year-old children. Like the SSP it involves an observation which is then coded. The classifications include all the SSP categories plus patterns that develop during the second year of life. The three basic strategies for negotiating interpersonal relationships are modified to fit preschoolers and the patterns are renamed ''secure/balanced'', or Type B, ''defended'', or Type A and ''coercive'' or Type C. It is also intended to be able to distinguish the unendangered from the endangered compulsive and obsessive subpatterns that may have implications for emotional and behavioral development.&lt;ref name="Crittenden 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crittenden PM |title=Quality of attachment in the preschool years |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=4 |pages=209–41 |year=1992 |url=http://www.patcrittenden.com/Preschool-assesment.html |accessdate=2008-01-06 |doi=10.1017/S0954579400000110 |issue=02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314161203/http://www.patcrittenden.com/Preschool-assesment.html |archivedate=2008-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marschak Interaction Method (MIM)====
The MIM is a structured observation of the interaction between parent and child. The MIM was created by [[Marianne Marschak]] in the 1960s at the [[Yale Child Study Center]]. Salo &amp; Makela (2006) of [[Finland]] have standardized and published a rating scale for the MIM for research purposes. [[Anne Stewart]] has developed the MIM Behavior Rating Scale (MIMBRS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theraplay.org/index.php/mim-research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturalistic observational methods===

====Attachment Q-set====
This method, devised by Waters and Deane in 1985, utilizes [[Q methodology|Q-Sort methodology]]. It is based on a set period of observation of children aged 1 – 5 in a number of environments. It consists of nearly 100 items intended to cover the spectrum of attachment related behaviors including secure base and exploratory behaviors, affective response and social cognition.&lt;ref name="Waters and Deane 1985"&gt;Waters, E. and Deane, K. (1985) 'Defining and assessing individual differences in attachment relationships: Q-methodology and the organization of behavior in infancy and early childhood.'  In I. Bretherton and E. Waters (eds) ''Growing pains of attachment theory and research: Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development 50,'' Serial No. 209 (1-2), 41-65&lt;/ref&gt; The observer sorts the cards  corresponding to the degree to which the child exhibits the item, which is then scored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaughn|first1=B. E.|last2=Waters|first2=E.|title=Attachment behavior at home and in the laboratory: Q-sort  observations and strange situation classifications of one-year-olds.|journal=Child Development|year=1990|volume=61|pages=1965–1973|doi=10.2307/1130850|pmid=2083508}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall score for each child will result in a variable ranging from +1.0 (i.e., very secure) to -1.0 (i.e., very insecure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clements|first1=M.|last2=Barnett|first2=D.|title=Parenting and attachment among toddlers with congenital   anomalies: Examining the strange situation and attachment Q-sort.|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|year=2002|volume=23|issue=6|pages=625–642|doi=10.1002/imhj.10040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its ability to classify secure attachment, the score derived from the Q-set measure does not classify the type of insecure attachment.&lt;ref name="Waters and Deane 1985" /&gt;

===Representational (story stem, narrative and picture) methods===
This approach uses dolls and narrative to enact a story. The dolls represent family members. The interviewer enacts the beginning of the story and then hands the dolls over for the child to complete it with varying degrees of prompting and encouragement. These techniques are designed to access the child's internal working models of their attachment relationships. Methods include the MacArthur Story Stem Battery (MSSB) and the Attachment Story Completion Test, developed in 1990 for children between the age of 3 to 8 years; the Story Stem Assessment Profile (SSAP) developed in 1990 for children aged 4 – 8; the Attachment Doll Play Assessment developed in 1995 for children age 4.5-11; the Manchester Child Attachment Story Task (MCAST) developed in 2000 for children aged 4.5 - 8.5.

====Attachment Story Completion Task (ASCT)====
The Attachment Story Completion Task (ASCT) is a semi-projective attachment measure designed by Inge Bretherton and colleagues to assess the internal working model of children between the age of 3 to 9 years old (though it requires modification when used with older children).  The measure evaluates a child's attachment style by analyzing how a child resolves a stress inducing story. In a 30-minute recorded interview, five story stems are presented through the use of props, such as small family figures. The stories are designed to access how that child interacts with their primary caregiver in five situations: separation, confrontation, fear, reunion, and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=G|author2=Pfeffer, CR|title=Attachment disorganization in prepubertal children with severe emotional disturbance.|journal=Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic|year=1998|volume=62|issue=4|pages=490–525|pmid=9810111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interviewer prompts the child to complete each story by saying "show me, or tell me what happens next."  The information derived from the interview is later coded according to the organization and content of the story completion. Avoidant attachment, for example, can be disclosed by a child refusing to acknowledge the attachment issue presented in the story stem (through claiming that the event did not take place). A child may also avoid addressing attachment by focusing solely on minor details, such as how the  protagonist is dressed. Secure attachment, alternately, is indicated when a child provides coherent and constructive resolutions to the stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=J.|last2=George|first2=C.|title=Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|pages=102–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[http://www.bbmh.manchester.ac.uk/mcast/ Manchester Child Attachment Story Task] (MCAST)====
The MCAST is a semi-structured doll play 'story stem' methodology, developed by Jonathan Green, Charlie Stanley, Ruth Goldwyn and Vicky Smith,&lt;ref&gt;Green, J.M., Stanley, C., Smith, V., &amp; Goldwyn, R. (2000). A new method of evaluating attachment representations on young school age children - the Manchester Child Attachment Story Task. Attachment and Human Development, 2, 42-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldwyn, R., Green, J.M, Stanley, C., &amp; Smith V. (2000). The Manchester Child Attachment Story Task: Relationship with parental AAI, SAT and child behaviour.  Attachment and Human Development, 2, 65-78.&lt;/ref&gt; to evaluate and understand the internal (mental) representations of their attachment relationship with a specific primary caregiver in children of 4 to 8.5 years. The concepts and procedures used have a basis in the Strange Situation Procedure and Adult Attachment Interview, and involves 4 story stem vignettes involving two dolls representing the caregiver-child dyad of interest and a dolls house, presented with affective arousal to mobilise attachment representations in a way that children of this age range find accessible and engaging. Responses are usually videotaped in order to reliably rate aspects of the child's represented narrative content and behaviour, and the child's own behaviour, to ascertain an attachment classification, with a particular focus on disorganised attachment, as well as providing other supporting ratings. Clinical development of the MCAST started in 1992, validation was published in 2000, and it has been since used in a range of cultural contexts&lt;ref&gt;Barone, L., Del Guidice, M., Fossati, A., Manaresi, F., Actis Perinitti, B., Colle, L., &amp; Veglia, F. (2009). Psychometric Properties of the Manchester Child Attachment Story Task: an Italian multicentre study. International Journal of Behavioural Development. 33 (2) 185-190.&lt;/ref&gt; and clinical and at-risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;Wan, M.W. &amp; Green, J. (2010). Negative and atypical story content themes depicted by children with behaviour problems. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 51, 1125-1131&lt;/ref&gt; Training is required for its use.

====Picture response techniques====
Like the stem stories, these techniques are designed to access the child's internal working models of attachment relationships. The child is shown attachment related pictures and asked to respond. Methods include the Separation Anxiety Test (SAT) developed in 1972 for children aged between 11 and 17. Revised versions have been produced for 4 - 7-year-olds. The SAT was doctored.

===Interview methods===

====Child Attachment Interview (CAI)====
This is a semi-structured interview designed by Target et al. (2003) for children aged 7 to 11. It is based on the Adult Attachment Interview, adapted for children by focussing on representations of relationships with parents and attachment related events. Scores are based on both verbal and non-verbal communications.&lt;ref name="Target et al. 2003"&gt;Target, M., Fonagy, P. and Schmueli-Goetz, Y. (2003) 'Attachment representations in school-age children: the development of the Child Attachment Interview (CAI).' ''Journal of Child Psychotherapy 29,'' 2, 171-186&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disturbances of Attachment Interview (DAI)====
Disturbances of Attachment Interview developed, by Smyke and Zeanah, (1999), is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. This method is designed to pick up not only [[reactive attachment disorder]] but also Zeannah et al.'s (1993) suggested new alternative categories of [[Attachment disorder#Boris and Zeanah's typology|disorders of attachment]].&lt;ref name="Smyke and Zeanah"&gt;Smyke, A. and Zeanah, C. (1999)'Disturbances of Attachment Interview'. Available on the ''Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'' website at www.jaacap.com&lt;/ref&gt; It covers 12 items, namely having a discriminated, preferred adult, seeking comfort when distressed, responding to comfort when offered, social and emotional reciprocity, emotional regulation, checking back after venturing away from the care giver, reticence with unfamiliar adults, willingness to go off with relative strangers, self endangering behavior, excessive clinging, vigilance/hypercompliance and role reversal.

==Measures of attachment in adolescents==

===Attachment Interview for Childhood and Adolescence (AICA)===
This is a version of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) rendered age appropriate for adolescents. The classifications of ''dismissing, secure, preoccupied'' and ''unresolved'' are the same as under the AAI described below.

==Criticism==
Existing measures have not necessarily been developed to a useful level. "Behavioral observation is a natural starting point for assessing attachment disorders because behavioral descriptions... have been central to the development of the concept...  despite the fact that observations have figured prominently... no established observational protocol has been established" &lt;ref name="O'Connor et al. 2003"&gt;O'Connor, T., &amp; Zeanah, C.H. (2003)."Attachment disorders: Assessment strategies and treatment approaches." Attachment &amp; Human Development, 5(3):223-244, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, questionable measures of attachment in school-age children have been presented. For example, a protocol for establishing attachment status was described by Sheperis and his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Sheperis et al. 2003"&gt;Sheperis, C.J., Doggett, R.A., Hoda, N.E., Blanchard, T., Renfro-Michael, E.L., Holdiness, S.H., &amp; Schlagheck, R. (2003). "The development of an assessment protocol for Reactive Attachment Disorder."Journal of Mental Health Counseling, 25(4):291-310&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this protocol was validated against another technique, the Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire, that was itself poorly validated and that is based on a nonconventional view of attachment.

===Reception and development of SSP===
Psychiatrist [[Michael Rutter]] describe the limitations of the procedure in the following terms;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Clinical Implications of Attachment Concepts|journal= Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume= 36|issue= 4|pages= 552–553|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x|pmid=7650083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Mother-Child face to face.jpg|thumb|190px|Mother and child]]
"It is by no means free of limitations (see Lamb, Thompson, Gardener, Charnov &amp; Estes, 1984).&lt;ref name="Lamb et al.,"&gt;Lamb, Thompson, Gardener, Charnov &amp; Estes, (1984). Security of Infantile attachment as assessed in the 'Strange Situation'; its study and biological interpretations. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 7, 127-147&lt;/ref&gt; To begin with, it is very dependent on brief separations and reunions having the same meaning for all children. This maybe a major constraint when applying the procedure in cultures, such as that in Japan (see Miyake et al.,, 1985),&lt;ref name="Miyake et al.,"&gt;Miyake,  Chen, &amp; Campos (1985). Infant temperament and mother's mode of interaction and attachment in Japan; an interim report; In I. Bretherton &amp; E Waters (Eds), Growing points of attachment theory and research. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50, Serial No 209, 276-297.&lt;/ref&gt; where infants are rarely separated from their mothers in ordinary circumstances. Also, because older children have a cognitive capacity to maintain relationships when the older person is not present, separation may not provide the same stress for them. Modified procedures based on the Strange Situation have been developed for older preschool children (see Belsky et al., 1994; Greenberg et al., 1990)&lt;ref name="Belsky et al.,"&gt;Belsky, J. &amp; Cassidy, J. (1994). Attachment Theory and Evidence. In M. Rutter &amp; D. Hay (Eds) Development Through Life; A Handbook For Clinicians (pp. 373-402). Oxford; Blackwell Scientific Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg et al., 1990."&gt;Greenberg, M. T., Cicchetti, D. &amp; Cummings, M. (Eds), (1990). Attachment in the preschool years; theory research and intervention. Chicago; University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is much more dubious whether the same approach can be used in middle childhood. Also, despite its manifest strengths, the procedure is based on just 20 minutes of behaviour. It can be scarcely expected to tap all the relevant qualities of a child's attachment relationships. Q-sort procedures based on much longer naturalistic observations in the home, and interviews with the mothers have developed in order to extend the data base (see Vaughn &amp; Waters, 1990).&lt;ref name="Vaughn et al.,"&gt;Vaughn, B. E. &amp; Waters, E.  (1990). Attachment behaviour at home and in the laboratory" ''Child Development'' 61, 1965-1973.&lt;/ref&gt; A further constraint is that the coding procedure results in discrete categories rather than continuously distributed dimensions. Not only is this likely to provide boundary problems, but also it is not at all obvious that discrete categories best represent the concepts that are inherent in attachment security. It seems much more likely that infants vary in their degree of security and there is need for a measurement systems that can quantify individual variation".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ecological validity and universality of Strange Situation attachment classification distributions===
With respect to the ecological validity of the Strange Situation, a meta-analysis of 2,000 infant-parent dyads, including several from studies with non-Western language and/or cultural bases found the global distribution of attachment categorizations to be A (21%), B (65%), and C (14%) &lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M. H. &amp; Kroonenberg, P.M."&gt;Van IJzendoorn, M.H., &amp; Kroonenberg, P.M.  (1988).  Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: A meta-analysis of the strange-situation" ''Child Development'' 59, 147-156.&lt;/ref&gt;  This global distribution was generally consistent with Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) original attachment classification distributions.

However, controversy has been raised over a few cultural differences in these rates of 'global' attachment classification distributions.  In particular, two studies diverged from the global distributions of attachment classifications noted above.  One study was conducted in North [[Germany]] &lt;ref name="Grossmann K.E., et al."&gt;Grossmann, K.E., Grossmann, K., Huber, F., &amp; Wartner, U. (1981).  German children's behavior toward their mothers at 12 months and their fathers at 18 months in Ainsworth's strange situation.  International Journal of Behavioral Development, 4, 157-184.&lt;/ref&gt; in which more avoidant (A) infants were found than global norms would suggest, and the other in [[Sapporo]], [[Japan]] &lt;ref name="Takahashi, K."&gt;Takahashi, K. (1986). Examining the Strange-Situation procedure with Japanese mothers and 12-month old infants" ''Developmental Psychology'' 22, 265-270.&lt;/ref&gt; where more resistant (C) infants were found.  Of these two studies, the Japanese findings have sparked the most controversy as to the meaning of individual differences in attachment behavior as originally identified by Ainsworth et al. (1978).

In a recent study conducted in Sapporo, Behrens, et al., 2007.&lt;ref name="Behrens, K. Y., Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E."&gt;Behrens, K. Y., Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E. (2007). Mothers’ Attachment Status as Determined by the Adult Attachment Interview Predicts Their 6-Year-Olds’ Reunion Responses: A Study Conducted in Japan" ''Developmental Psychology'' 43, 1553–1567.&lt;/ref&gt; found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name= "Main, M., &amp; Cassidy, J."&gt;Main, M., &amp; Cassidy, J.  (1988).  Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period" ''Developmental Psychology'' 24, 415-426.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to these findings supporting the global distributions of attachment classifications in Sapporo, Behrens et al. also discuss the Japanese concept of [[amae]] and its relevance to questions concerning whether the insecure-resistant (C) style of interaction may be engendered in Japanese infants as a result of the cultural practice of [[amae]].

===Attachment measurement: discrete or continuous?===
Regarding the issue of whether the breadth of infant attachment functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, it should be noted that continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports [see Richters et al., 1998;&lt;ref name="Richters, J. E., Waters, E., &amp; Vaughn, B. E."&gt;Richters, J. E., Waters, E., &amp; Vaughn, B. E. (1988). Empirical classification of infant-mother relationships from interactive behavior and crying during reunion" ''Child Development'' 59, 512-522.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marinus van IJzendoorn|Van IJzendoorn]] et al., 1990).&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M . H., &amp; Kroonenberg, P. M."&gt;Van IJzendoorn, M. H., &amp; Kroonenberg, P. M. (1990). Cross-cultural consistency of coding the strange situation. Infant Behavior and Development, 13, 469-485.&lt;/ref&gt;] The original Richter’s et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases.&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M . H., &amp; Kroonenberg, P. M."/&gt; Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult the paper by Fraley and Spieker &lt;ref name="Fraley, C. R. &amp; Spieker, S. J."&gt;Fraley, C. R., &amp; Spieker, S. J. (2003). Are Infant Attachment Patterns Continuously or Categorically Distributed? A Taxometric Analysis of Strange Situation Behavior" ''Developmental Psychology'' 39, 387-404.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters &amp; T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.

==Measures in adults==
{{Main|Attachment in adults|Attachment theory}}
The three main ways of measuring attachment in adults include the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP), and self-report questionnaires. The AAI, AAP, and the self-report questionnaires were created with somewhat different aims in mind. Shaver and Fraley note:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If you are a novice in this research area, what is most important for you to know is that self-report measures of romantic attachment and the AAI were initially developed completely independently and for quite different purposes. One asks about a person's feelings and behaviors in the context of romantic or other close relationships; the other is used to make inferences about the defenses associated with an adult's current state of mind regarding childhood relationships with parents. In principle, these might have been substantially associated, but in fact they seem to be only moderately related--at least as currently assessed. One kind of measure receives its construct validity mostly from studies of romantic relationships, the other from prediction of a person's child's behavior in Ainsworth's Strange Situation. Correlations of the two kinds of measures with other variables are likely to differ, although a few studies have found the AAI to be related to marital relationship quality and a few have found self-report romantic attachment measures to be related to parenting." (Shaver &amp; Fraley, 2004) 
&lt;ref name="Shaver, Fraley, 2004"&gt;Shaver, P.A. &amp; Fraley, R.C. (2004). Self-report measures of adult attachment. Online article. Retrieved June 20, 2006, from http://www.psych.uiuc.edu/~rcfraley/measures/measures.html .&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The AAI, the AAP, and the self-report questionnaires offer distinct, but equally valid, perspectives on adult attachment. It's therefore worthwhile to become familiar with each approach.

===Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)===
Developed by Carol George, Nancy Kaplan, and Mary Main in 1984, this is a quasi-clinical semi-structured interview that takes about one hour to administer.  It involves about twenty questions and has extensive research validation to support it.  A good description can be found in Chapter 25 of Attachment Theory, Research and Clinical Applications (2nd ed.), edited by J. Cassidy and P. R. Shaver, Guilford Press, NY, 2008. The chapter title is "The Adult Attachment Interview: Historical and Current Perspectives," and is written by E. Hesse. The interview taps into adult representation of attachment (i.e. [[Attachment theory#Internal working model|internal working models]]) by assessing general and specific recollections from their childhood. The interview is coded based on quality of discourse (especially coherence) and content. Categories are designed to predict parental stances on Berkeley infant data. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Parental AAI Attachment status includes:
*'''Autonomous''': They value attachment relationships, describe them in a balanced way and as influential. Their discourse is coherent, internally consistent, and non-defensive in nature.
*'''Dismissing''': They show memory lapses. Minimize negative aspects and deny personal impact on relationships. Their positive descriptions are often contradicted or unsupported. The discourse is defensive.
*'''Preoccupied''': Experience continuing preoccupation with their own parents. Incoherent discourse. Have angry or ambivalent representations of the past.
*'''Unresolved/Disorganized''': Show trauma resulting from unresolved loss or abuse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some of the strongest external validation of the measures involves its demonstrated ability to predict interviewees' children's classifications in the Strange Situation. The measure also has been shown to have some overlap with attachment constructs measured by the less time-intensive measures of the peer/romantic attachment tradition (Hazan &amp; Shaver, Bartholomew), as reported by Shaver, P. R., Belsky, J., &amp; Brennan, K. A. (2000).&lt;ref name="Shaver, Belsky, Brennan, 1987"&gt;Shaver, P. R., Belsky, J., &amp; Brennan, K. A. (2000). The adult attachment interview and self-reports of romantic attachment: Associations across domains and methods. Personal Relationships, 7, 25-43.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are important differences in what is measured by the AAI—rather than being a measure of romantic attachment, it taps primarily into a person's state of mind regarding their attachment in their family of origin (nuclear family).

===Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP)===
Developed by Carol George and Malcolm West in 1999, this is a free response task that involved telling stories in response to eight picture stimuli (1 warm-up &amp; 7 attachment scenes). A good description can be found in George and West's 1999 paper in the journal Attachment and Human Development.  A book describing the measure is forthcoming from Guilford Press in spring 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Carol George, Malcolm L. West (2012). ''The Adult Attachment Projective Picture System, Attachment Theory and Assessment in Adults''. New York London: The Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAP identifies the same adult attachment groups as the AAI, as described above.  In addition to providing adult group classifications, the AAP is also used to code attachment defensive processing patterns, attachment synchrony, and personal agency.

The strongest concurrent validation of the measure is the correspondence between AAP and AAI classification agreement.  The AAP is demonstrated to be increasingly useful in clinical and neurobiological settings. The AAP is being used to assess attachment in adults and adolescents.

===Self-report questionnaires===
Hazan and Shaver created the first questionnaire to measure attachment in adults. 
&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver, 1987"&gt;Hazan, C., &amp; Shaver, P. (1987). Romantic love conceptualized as an attachmenpt process" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 52, 511-524.&lt;/ref&gt;
Their questionnaire was designed to classify adults into the three attachment styles identified by Ainsworth. The questionnaire consisted of three sets of statements, each set of statements describing an attachment style:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Secure - I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I don't often worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me.
* Avoidant - I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, love partners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.
*Anxious/Ambivalent - I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn't really love me or won't want to stay with me. I want to merge completely with another person, and this desire sometimes scares people away.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
People participating in their study were asked to choose which set of statements best described their feelings. The chosen set of statements indicated their attachment style. Later versions of this questionnaire presented scales so people could rate how well each set of statements described their feelings.

One important advance in the development of attachment questionnaires was the addition of a fourth style of attachment. Bartholomew and Horowitz presented a model that identified four categories or styles of adult attachment. 
&lt;ref name="Bartholomew, K. &amp; Horowitz, L.M. (1991"&gt;Bartholomew, K. &amp; Horowitz, L.M. (1991). Attachment styles among young adults: A test of a four-category model" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 61, 226-244.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Their model was based on the idea attachment styles reflected people's thoughts about their partners and thought about themselves. Specifically, attachment styles depended on whether or not people judge their partners to be generally accessible and responsive to requests for support, and whether or not people judge themselves to be the kind of individuals towards which others want to respond and lend help. They proposed four categories based on positive or negative thoughts about partners and on positive or negative thoughts about self.

Bartholomew and Horowitz used this model to create the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ-CV). The RQ-CV consisted of four sets of statements, each describing a category or style of attachment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Secure - It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or having others not accept me.
* Dismissive - I am comfortable without close emotional relationships. It is very important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient, and I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me.
* Preoccupied - I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them.
* Fearful - I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tests demonstrated the four attachment styles were distinct in how they related to other kinds of psychological variables. Adults indeed appeared to have four styles of attachment instead of three attachment styles.

David Schmitt, together with a large number of colleagues, validated the attachment questionnaire created by Bartholomew and Horowitz in 62 cultures. 
&lt;ref name="Schmitt, etal, 2004"&gt;Schmitt, D.P., et al. (2004). Patterns and universals of adult romantic attachment across 62 cultural regions. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35, 367-402.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The distinction of thoughts about self and thoughts about partners proved valid in nearly all cultures. However, the way these two kinds of thoughts interacted to form attachment styles varied somewhat across cultures. The four attachment styles had somewhat different meanings across cultures.

A second important advance in attachment questionnaires was the use of independent items to assess attachment. Instead of asking people to choose between three or four sets of statements, people rated how strongly they agreed with dozens of individual statements. The ratings for the individual statements were combined to provide an attachment score. Investigators have created several questionnaires using this strategy to measure adult attachment.

Two popular questionnaires of this type are the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire and the Experiences in Close Relationships - Revised (ECR-R) questionnaire. The ECR was created by Brennan, Clark, and Shaver in 1998. 
&lt;ref name="Brennan, Clark, Shaver, 1998"&gt;Brennan, K.A., Clark, C.L., &amp; Shaver, P.R. (1998). Self-report measurement of adult romantic attachment: An integrative overview. In J.A. Simpson &amp; W.S. Rholes (Eds.), Attachment theory and close relationships (pp. 46-76). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ECR-R was created by Fraley, Waller, and Brennan in 2000. 
&lt;ref name="Fraley, Waller, Brennan,2000"&gt;Fraley, R.C., Waller, N.G., &amp; Brennan, K.A. (2000). An item-response theory analysis of self-report measures of adult attachment" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 78, 350-365.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the ECR and ECR-R reveal that the questionnaire items can be grouped into two dimensions of attachment. One group of questionnaire items deal with how anxious a person is about their relationship. These items serve as a scale for anxiety. The remaining items deal with how avoidant a person is in their relationship. These items serve as a scale for avoidance. Many researchers now use scores from the anxiety and avoidance scales to perform statistical analyses and test hypotheses.

Scores on the anxiety and avoidance scales can still be used to classify people into the four adult attachment styles. 
&lt;ref name="Brennan, Clark, Shaver, 1998"/&gt; 
&lt;ref name="Bartholomew, Shaver, 1998"&gt;Bartholomew, K. &amp; Shaver, P.R. (1998). Methods of assessing adult attachment. In J. A. Simpson &amp; W. S. Rholes (Eds.), Attachment theory and close relationships, pp. 25-45. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name="Collins, Freeney, 2004"&gt;Collins, N.L. &amp; Freeney, B.C. (2004). An Attachment Theory Perspective on Closeness and Intimacy. In D.J. Mashek &amp; A. Aron (Eds.), Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy, pp. 163-188. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The four styles of attachment defined in Bartholomew and Horowitz's model were based on thoughts about self and thoughts about partners. The anxiety scale in the ECR and ECR-R reflect thoughts about self. Attachment anxiety relates to beliefs about self-worth and whether or not one will be accepted or rejected by others. The avoidance scale in the ECR and ECR-R relates to thoughts about partners. Attachment avoidance relates to beliefs about taking risks in approaching or avoiding other people. Combinations of anxiety and avoidance can thus be used to define the four attachment styles. The secure style of attachment is characterized by low anxiety and low avoidance; the preoccupied style of attachment is characterized by high anxiety and low avoidance; the dismissive avoidant style of attachment is characterized by low anxiety and high avoidance; and the fearful avoidant style of attachment is characterized by high anxiety and high avoidance.

'''Behavioral neuroscience''', also known as '''biological psychology''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Breedlove|Breedlove]], Watson, [[Mark Rosenzweig (psychologist)|Rosenzweig]], ''Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience'', 6/e, {{ISBN|978-0-87893-705-9}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; '''biopsychology''', or '''psychobiology''',&lt;ref name="webby"&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;va=psychobiology  Psychobiology], Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of the principles of [[biology]] to the study of [[physiological]], [[Genetics|genetic]], and [[Developmental biology|developmental mechanisms]] of behavior in humans and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, R.K. 1993, "INTRODUCTION: A Biopsychology Festschrift in Honor of Lelon J. Peacock", Journal of General Psychology, vol. 120, no. 1, pp. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Behavioral neuroscience as a scientific discipline emerged from a variety of scientific and philosophical traditions in the 18th and 19th centuries. In philosophy, people like [[René Descartes]] proposed physical models to explain animal and human behavior. Descartes, for example, suggested that the [[pineal gland]], a midline unpaired structure in the brain of many organisms, was the point of contact between mind and body. Descartes also elaborated on a theory in which the [[pneumatics]] of bodily fluids could explain [[reflex]]es and other motor behavior. This theory was inspired by moving statues in a garden in Paris.&lt;ref name="Carlson" &gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil|title=Physiology of Behavior (9th Ed.) |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |pages=11–14 |year=2007 |isbn=0-205-46724-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other philosophers also helped give birth to [[psychology]]. One of the earliest textbooks in the new field, ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' by [[William James]], argues that the scientific study of psychology should be grounded in an understanding of biology:

{{quote|Bodily experiences, therefore, and more particularly brain-experiences, must take a place amongst those conditions of the mental life of which Psychology need take account.  The spiritualist and the associationist must both be 'cerebralists,' to the extent at least of admitting that certain peculiarities in the way of working of their own favorite principles are explicable only by the fact that the brain laws are a codeterminant of their result.

Our first conclusion, then, is that a certain amount of brain-physiology must be presupposed or included in Psychology.&lt;ref name="James" &gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=William |title=The Principles of Psychology, Vol. One |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |pages=4–5 |year=1950/1890 |isbn=0-486-20381-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The emergence of both psychology and behavioral neuroscience as legitimate sciences can be traced from the emergence of physiology from [[anatomy]], particularly [[neuroanatomy]]. Physiologists conducted experiments on living organisms, a practice that was distrusted by the dominant anatomists of the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Shepherd" &gt;{{cite book |last=Shepherd |first=Gordon M.|title=Foundations of the Neuron Doctrine |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-19-506491-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influential work of [[Claude Bernard]], [[Charles Bell]], and [[William Harvey]] helped to convince the scientific community that reliable data could be obtained from living subjects.

Even before the 18th and 19th century, behavioral neuroscience was beginning to take form as far back as 1700 B.C.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/courses/1010/mangels/neuro/history/history.html |title=History of Neuroscience |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question that seems to continually arise is what is the connection between the mind and body. The debate is formally referred to as the [[mind-body problem]]. There are two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem; [[monism]] and [[mind-body dualism|dualism]].&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] are two of several philosophers who participated in this debate. Plato believed that the brain was where all mental thought and processes happened.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In contrast, Aristotle believed that the brain served the purpose of cooling down the emotions derived from the heart.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; The mind-body problem was a stepping stone toward attempting to understand the connection between the mind and body.

Another debate arose about was localization of function or [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]] versus [[equipotentiality]] which played a significant role in the development in behavioral neuroscience. As a result of localization of function research, many famous people found within psychology have come to various different conclusions. [[Wilder Penfield]] was able to develop a map of the cerebral cortex through studying epileptic patients along with Rassmussen.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; Research on localization of function has led behavioral neuroscientist to a better understanding of which parts of the brain control behavior. This is best exemplified through the case study of [[Phineas Gage]].

The term "psychobiology" has been used in a variety of contexts, emphasizing the importance of biology, which is the discipline that studies organic, neural and cellular modifications in behavior, plasticity in neuroscience, and biological diseases in all aspects, in addition, biology focuses and analyzes behavior and all the subjects it is concerned about, from a scientific point of view. In this context, psychology helps as a complementary, but important discipline in the neurobiological sciences. The role of psychology in this questions is that of a social tool that backs up the main or strongest biological science.  The term "psychobiology" was  first used in its modern sense by [[Knight Dunlap]] in his book ''An Outline of Psychobiology (1914)''.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last=Dewsbury
  |first=Donald
  |title=Psychobiology

  |volume=46
  |issue=3
  |pages=198–205
  |year=1991
  |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.46.3.198
  |pmid=2035930
  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dunlap also was the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal ''Psychobiology''. In the announcement of that journal, Dunlap writes that the journal will publish research "...bearing on the interconnection of mental and physiological functions", which describes the field of behavioral neuroscience even in its modern sense.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury" /&gt;

==Relationship to other fields of psychology and biology==
In many cases, humans may serve as experimental subjects in behavioral neuroscience experiments; however, a great deal of the experimental literature in behavioral neuroscience comes from the study of non-human species, most frequently rats, mice, and monkeys. As a result, a critical assumption in behavioral neuroscience is that organisms share biological and behavioral similarities, enough to permit extrapolations across species. This allies behavioral neuroscience closely with [[comparative psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[neurobiology]]. Behavioral neuroscience also has paradigmatic and methodological similarities to [[neuropsychology]], which relies heavily on the study of the behavior of humans with nervous system dysfunction (i.e., a non-experimentally based biological manipulation).

Synonyms for behavioral neuroscience include biopsychology, biological psychology, and psychobiology.&lt;ref name = "Breedlove et al 2007"&gt;[[Marc Breedlove|S. Marc Breedlove]], [[Mark Rosenzweig (psychologist)|Mark Rosenzweig]] and Neil V. Watson (2007). Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience 6e. Sinauer Associates. {{ISBN|978-0-87893-705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physiological psychology]] is a subfield of behavioral neuroscience, with an appropriately narrower definition

== Research methods ==

The distinguishing characteristic of a behavioral neuroscience experiment is that either the [[independent variable]] of the experiment is biological, or some [[dependent variable]] is biological. In other words, the [[nervous system]] of the organism under study is permanently or temporarily altered, or some aspect of the nervous system is measured (usually to be related to a behavioral variable).

===Disabling or decreasing neural function===

* [[Lesions]] – A classic method in which a brain-region of interest is naturally or intentionally destroyed to observe any resulting changes such as degraded or enhanced performance on some behavioral measure. Lesions can be placed with relatively high accuracy "Thanks to a variety of brain 'atlases' which provide a map of brain regions in 3-dimensional "[[stereotactic surgery|stereotactic coordinates]].
** Surgical lesions –  Neural tissue is destroyed by removing it surgically.
** Electrolytic lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed through the application of electrical shock trauma.
** Chemical lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed by the infusion of a [[neurotoxin]].
** Temporary lesions – Neural tissue is temporarily disabled by cooling or by the use of [[anesthetics]] such as [[tetrodotoxin]].
* [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] – A new technique usually used with human subjects in which a magnetic coil applied to the scalp causes unsystematic electrical activity in nearby cortical neurons which can be experimentally analyzed as a functional lesion.
* [[Receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand|Synthetic ligand injection]] – A receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand (RASSL) or Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), permits spatial and temporal control of [[G protein]] signaling [[in vivo]]. These systems utilize G protein-coupled receptors ([[GPCR]]) engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic small molecules [[ligands]], like [[clozapine N-oxide]] (CNO), and not to their natural ligand(s).  RASSL's represent a GPCR-based [[chemogenetic]] tool. These synthetic ligands upon activation can decrease neural function by G-protein activation. This can with Potassium attenuating neural activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Hu|title=Silencing synapses with DREADDs|journal=Neuron|volume=82|issue=4|pages=723–725|pmc=4109642|year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychopharmacological manipulations – A chemical [[receptor antagonist]] induces neural activity by interfering with [[neurotransmission]]. Antagonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure into the ventricles or into specific brain structures.  For example, [[NMDA]] [[antagonist]] [[AP5]] has been shown to inhibit the initiation of [[long term potentiation]] of excitatory synaptic transmission (in rodent fear conditioning) which is believed to be a vital mechanism in learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Jeansok J.; DeCola, Joseph P.; Landeira-Fernandez, Jesus; Fanselow, Michael S. "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist APV blocks acquisition but not expression of fear conditioning." Behavioral Neuroscience. Vol 105(1), Feb 1991, 126-133. {doi|10.1037/0735-7044.105.1.126}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Optogenetic]] inhibition – A light activated inhibitory protein is expressed in cells of interest. Powerful millisecond timescale neuronal inhibition is instigated upon stimulation by the appropriate frequency of light delivered via fiber optics or implanted LEDs in the case of vertebrates,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider et al. "Controlling Neuronal Activity." American Journal of Psychiatry 165:562, May 2008 {{doi|10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08030444}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via external illumination for small, sufficiently translucent invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, et al.

=== Enhancing neural function ===

* Electrical stimulation – A classic method in which neural activity is enhanced by application of a small electric current (too small to cause significant cell death).
* Psychopharmacological manipulations – A chemical [[receptor agonist]] facilitates neural activity by enhancing or replacing endogenous [[neurotransmitters]]. Agonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure.
* Synthetic Ligand Injection – Likewise, G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-DREADDs can be used to modulate cellular function by innervation of brain regions such as Hippocampus. This innervation results in the amplification of γ-rhythms, which increases motor activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Susan|title=Grateful DREADDs: Engineered Receptors Reveal How Neural Circuits Regulate Behavior|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews|date=2012|volume=37|pages=296–297|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v37/n1/full/npp2011179a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] – In some cases (for example, studies of [[motor cortex]]), this technique can be analyzed as having a stimulatory effect (rather than as a functional lesion).
* [[Optogenetic]] excitation – A light activated excitatory protein is expressed in select cells. [[Channelrhodopsin]]-2 (ChR2), a light activated cation channel, was the first bacterial opsin shown to excite neurons in response to light,&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Wang, Boyden, and Deisseroth. "Channelrhodopsin-2 and optical control of excitable cells." Nature Methods. VOL.3 NO.10. OCTOBER 2006&lt;/ref&gt; though a number of new excitatory optogenetic tools have now been generated by improving and imparting novel properties to ChR2&lt;ref&gt;Gradinaru et al. "Molecular and Cellular Approaches for Diversifying and Extending Optogenetics." Cell. 2010. {{doi|10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring neural activity ===
* Optical techniques – Optical methods for recording neuronal activity rely on methods that modify the optical properties of neurons in response to the cellular events associated with action potentials or neurotransmitter release.
** [[Voltage sensitive dyes]] (VSDs) were among the earliest method for optically detecting action potentials. VSDs commonly become fluorescent in response to a neuron's change in voltage, rendering individual action potentials detectable.&lt;ref&gt;Ebner, T. J. and Chen, G. "Use of voltage-sensitive dyes and optical recordings in the central nervous system." Progress in Neurobiology
Volume 46, Issue 5, August 1995, 463-506. {{doi|10.1016/0301-0082(95)00010-S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetically encoded voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Micah S. Siegel and Ehud Y. Isacoff. "A Genetically Encoded Optical Probe of Membrane Voltage."Neuron, Vol. 19, 735–741, October, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Calcium imaging]] relies on dyes&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan, Hoa, Sholomenkoa, and Yeea. "Real-time imaging of neurons retrogradely and anterogradely labelled with calcium-sensitive dyes." Journal of Neuroscience Methods. Vol 46, Issue 2, February 1993, 91-106. {{doi|10.1016/0165-0270(93)90145-H}}&lt;/ref&gt; or genetically encoded proteins&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Heim and Oliver Griesbeck. "Genetically Encoded Indicators of Cellular Calcium Dynamics Based on Troponin C and Green Fluorescent Protein." The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 279, 14280-14286. April 2, 2004 {{doi|10.1074/jbc.M312751200}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fluoresce upon binding to the calcium that is transiently present during an action potential.
** [[Synapto-pHluorin]] is a technique that relies on a [[fusion protein]] that combines a synaptic vesicle membrane protein and a pH sensitive fluorescent protein. Upon synaptic vesicle release, the chimeric protein is exposed to the higher pH of the synaptic cleft, causing a measurable change in fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;Gero Miesenböck, Dino A. De Angelis  &amp;  James E. Rothman1. "Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins." ''Nature'' 394, 192-195 (9 July 1998) | {{doi|10.1038/28190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Single-unit recording]] – A method whereby an electrode is introduced into the brain of a living animal to detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip. Normally this is performed with sedated animals but sometimes it is performed on awake animals engaged in a behavioral event, such as a thirsty rat whisking a particular sandpaper grade previously paired with water in order to measure the corresponding patterns of neuronal firing at the decision point.&lt;ref&gt;von Heimendahl, M., Itskov, P., Arabzadeh, E., &amp; Diamond, M. (2007). Neuronal activity in rat barrel cortex underlying texture discrimination. PLoS Biol, 5(11), e305.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multielectrode recording – The use of a bundle of fine electrodes to record the simultaneous activity of up to hundreds of neurons.
* [[fMRI]] – Functional magnetic resonance imaging, a technique most frequently applied on human subjects, in which changes in cerebral blood flow can be detected in an [[MRI]] apparatus and are taken to indicate relative activity of larger scale brain regions (i.e., on the order of hundreds of thousands of neurons).
* [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] - Positron Emission Tomography detects particles called photons using a 3-D nuclear medicine examination. These particles are emitted by injections of radioisotopes such as fluorine. PET imaging reveal the pathological processes which predict anatomic changes making it important for detecting, diagnosing and characterising many pathologies&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo, T., Knight, K., Dunleavy, R., &amp; Shah, S. N. (2015). Techniques, Benefits, and Challenges of PET-MR. Radiologic technology, 86(4), 393-412.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Electroencephalography]] – Or EEG; and the derivative technique of [[event-related potential]]s, in which scalp electrodes monitor the average activity of neurons in the cortex (again, used most frequently with human subjects). This technique uses different types of electrodes for recording systems such as needle electrodes and saline-based electrodes. EEG allows for the investigation of mental disorders, sleep disorders and physiology. It can monitor brain development and cognitive engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Sanei, S., &amp; Chambers, J. A. (2013). EEG signal processing. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Functional neuroanatomy – A more complex counterpart of [[phrenology]]. The expression of some anatomical marker is taken to reflect neural activity. For example, the expression of [[immediate early genes]] is thought to be caused by vigorous neural activity. Likewise, the injection of [[2-deoxyglucose]] prior to some behavioral task can be followed by anatomical localization of that chemical; it is taken up by neurons that are electrically active.
* [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] – Magnetoencephalography shows the functioning of the human brain through the measurement of electromagnetic activity.  Measuring the magnetic fields created by the electric current flowing within the neurons identifies brain activity associated with various human functions in real time, with millimeter spatial accuracy.  Clinicians can noninvasively obtain data to help them assess neurological disorders and plan surgical treatments.

=== Genetic techniques ===

* [[Quantitative trait loci|QTL mapping]] – The influence of a gene in some behavior can be statistically inferred by studying [[inbred strains]] of some species, most commonly mice. The recent sequencing of the [[genome]] of many species, most notably mice, has facilitated this technique.
* [[Selective breeding]] – Organisms, often mice, may be bred selectively among inbred strains to create a [[recombinant congenic strain]]. This might be done to isolate an experimentally interesting stretch of [[DNA]] derived from one strain on the background genome of another strain to allow stronger inferences about the role of that stretch of DNA.
* [[Genetic engineering]] – The genome may also be experimentally-manipulated; for example, [[knockout mice]] can be engineered to lack a particular gene, or a gene may be expressed in a strain which does not normally do so (the 'transgenic'). Advanced techniques may also permit the expression or suppression of a gene to occur by injection of some regulating chemical.

Available at: http://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/otago032670.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although this method is often focused in computer science, it has begun to move towards other areas of study.For example, psychology is one of these areas. Computational models allow researchers in psychology to enhance their understanding of the functions and developments in nervous systems. Examples of methods include the modelling of neurons, networks and brain systems and theoretical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, P. S., &amp; Sejnowski, T. J. (2016). The computational brain. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational methods have a wide variety of roles including clarifying experiments, hypothesis testing and generating new insights.

=== Limitations and advantages ===

Different manipulations have advantages and limitations. Neural tissue destroyed as a primary consequence of a surgery, electric shock or neurotoxin can confound the results so that the physical trauma masks changes in the fundamental neurophysiological processes of interest.
For example, when using an electrolytic probe to create a purposeful lesion in a distinct region of the rat brain, surrounding tissue can be affected: so, a change in behavior exhibited by the [[experimental group]] post-surgery is to some degree a result of damage to surrounding neural tissue, rather than by a lesion of a distinct brain region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirby|first1=Elizabeth D.|last2=Jensen|first2=Kelly|last3=Goosens|first3=Ki A.|last4=Kaufer|first4=Daniela|title=Stereotaxic Surgery for Excitotoxic Lesion of Specific Brain Areas in the Adult Rat|pmc=3476400|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|issue=65|pages=4079|doi=10.3791/4079|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abel and Lattal 2001"/&gt; Most genetic manipulation techniques are also considered permanent.&lt;ref name="Abel and Lattal 2001"/&gt; Temporary lesions can be achieved with advanced in genetic manipulations, for example, certain genes can now be switched on and off with diet.&lt;ref name="Abel and Lattal 2001"/&gt; Pharmacological manipulations also allow blocking of certain neurotransmitters temporarily as the function returns to its previous state after the drug has been metabolized.&lt;ref name="Abel and Lattal 2001"&gt;T Abel, KM Lattal (2001) "Molecular mechanisms of memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval" ''Current Opinion in Neurobiology''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topic areas ==

In general, behavioral neuroscientists study similar themes and issues as academic psychologists, though limited by the need to use nonhuman animals. As a result, the bulk of literature in behavioral neuroscience deals with mental processes and behaviors that are shared across different animal models such as:

*Sensation and perception
*Motivated behavior (hunger, thirst, sex)
*Control of movement
*Learning and memory
*Sleep and biological rhythms
*Emotion

However, with increasing technical sophistication and with the development of more precise noninvasive methods that can be applied to human subjects, behavioral neuroscientists are beginning to contribute to other classical topic areas of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics, such as:

*Language
*Reasoning and decision making
*Consciousness

Behavioral neuroscience has also had a strong history of contributing to the understanding of medical disorders, including those that fall under the purview of [[clinical psychology]] and [[biological psychopathology]] (also known as abnormal psychology). Although [[animal models]] do not exist for all mental illnesses, the field has contributed important therapeutic data on a variety of conditions, including:

*[[Parkinson's disease]], a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills and speech.
*[[Huntington's disease]], a rare inherited neurological  disorder whose most obvious symptoms are abnormal body movements and a lack of coordination. It also affects a number of mental abilities and some aspects of personality.
*[[Alzheimer's disease]], a neurodegenerative disease that, in its most common form, is found in people over the age of 65 and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and by neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes.
*[[Clinical depression]], a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in usual activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure.
*[[Schizophrenia]], a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a mental illness characterized by impairments in the perception or expression of reality, most commonly manifesting as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions or disorganized speech and thinking in the context of significant social or occupational dysfunction.
*[[Autism]], a brain development disorder that impairs social interaction and communication, and causes restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old.
*[[Anxiety]], a physiological state characterized by cognitive, somatic, emotional, and behavioral components. These components combine to create the feelings that are typically recognized as fear, apprehension, or worry.
*[[Drug abuse]], including [[alcoholism]].

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in graphic arts and books are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">In classical [[tragedies]], the '''catastasis''' (pl. ''catastases'') is the third part of an ancient [[drama]], in which the intrigue or action that was initiated in the [[epitasis]], is supported and heightened, until ready to be unravelled in the [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. It also refers to the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]], the '''catastasis''' is that part of a speech, usually the [[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], in which the orator sets forth the subject matter to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not a classical one; it was invented by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Scaliger]] in his ''Poetics'' (published posthumously in 1561).&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Walker, ''Shakespeare and the Classical Tradition: An Annotated Bibliography, 1961-1991'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002: {{ISBN|0-8240-6697-9}}), p. 639; Scaliger wrote: "catastasis est vigor ac status fabulae, in qua res miscetur in ea fortunae tempestate, in quam subducta est."&lt;/ref&gt; It "is more or less equivalent to the ''summa epitasis'' of Donatus and Latomus and to what Willichius sometimes called the ''extrema epitasis'',"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin T.

'''Causality''' (also referred to as '''causation''',&lt;ref&gt;'The action of causing; the relation of cause and effect' [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''cause and effect''') is what connects one process (the ''cause'') with another process or state (the ''[[Result|effect]]''),{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} where the first is partly responsible for the second, and the second is partly dependent on the first. In general, a process has many causes,&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Multiple causation has been defended, and even taken for granted, by the most diverse thinkers [...]  simple causation is suspected of artificiality on account of its very simplicity. Granted, the assignment of a single cause (or effect) to a set of effects (or causes) may be a superficial, nonilluminating hypothesis. But so is usually the hypothesis of simple causation. Why should we remain satisfied with statements of causation, instead of attempting to go beyond the first simple relation that is found?

which are said to be causal [[factor (disambiguation)|factor]]s for it, and all lie in its [[past]] (more precise: none lie in its future). An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in its [[future]]. Causality is [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] prior to notions of [[time and space]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Robb|Robb, A.A.]] (1911). ''Optical Geometry of Motion'', W.

Causality is an [[abstraction]] that indicates how the world progresses,{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=July 2018}} so basic a concept that it is more apt as an explanation of other concepts of progression than as something to be explained by others more basic.

[[Aristotelian philosophy]] uses the word "cause" to mean "explanation" or "answer to a why question", including [[Aristotle]]'s material, formal, efficient, and final "causes"; then the "cause" is the [[Explanandum|explanans]] for the [[explanandum]]. In this case, failure to recognize that different kinds of "cause" are being considered can lead to futile debate. Of [[Four causes|Aristotle's four explanatory modes]], the one nearest to the concerns of the present article is the "efficient" one.

The topic of causality remains a staple in [[contemporary philosophy]].

==Concept==

===Metaphysics===
The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as [[metaphysics]].

====Ontology====
A general metaphysical question about cause and effect is what kind of [[entity]] can be a cause, and what kind of entity can be an effect.

One viewpoint on this question is that cause and effect are of one and the same kind of entity, with causality an asymmetric relation between them. That is to say, it would make good sense grammatically to say either "''A'' is the cause and ''B'' the effect" or "''B'' is the cause and ''A'' the effect", though only one of those two can be actually true. In this view, one opinion, proposed as a metaphysical principle in [[process philosophy]], is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process, event, becoming, or happening.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead, A.N.]] (1929). ''Process and Reality. An Essay in Cosmology. Gifford Lectures Delivered in the University of Edinburgh During the Session 1927–1928'', Macmillan, New York, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is 'his tripping over the step was the cause, and his breaking his ankle the effect'. Another view is that causes and effects are 'states of affairs', with the exact natures of those entities being less restrictively defined than in process philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Malet Armstrong|Armstrong, D.M.]] (1997). ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|0-521-58064-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;89, 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint on the question is the more classical one, that a cause and its effect can be of different kinds of entity. For example, in Aristotle's efficient causal explanation, an action can be a cause while an [[enduring]] object is its effect. For example, the generative actions of his parents can be regarded as the efficient cause, with Socrates being the effect, Socrates being regarded as an enduring object, in philosophical tradition called a 'substance', as distinct from an action.

====Epistemology====
Since causality is a subtle metaphysical notion, considerable effort is needed to establish knowledge of it in particular empirical circumstances.

====Geometrical significance====
Causality has the properties of antecedence and contiguity.&lt;ref name="Born"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sklar"/&gt; These are topological, and are ingredients for space-time geometry. As developed by [[Alfred Robb]], these properties allow the derivation of the notions of time and space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Robb|Robb, A.A.]] (1936). [https://archive.org/details/geometryoftimean032218mbp ''Geometry of Time and Space''], Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Jammer]] writes "the Einstein postulate ... opens the way to a straightforward construction of the causal topology ... of Minkowski space."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Jammer|Jammer, M.]] (1982). 'Einstein and quantum physics', pp. 59–76 in ''Albert Einstein: Historical and Cultural Perspectives; the Centennial Symposium in Jerusalem'', edited by G. Holton, Y. Elkana, Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, {{ISBN|0-691-08299-5}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Causal efficacy propagates no faster than light.&lt;ref&gt;Naber, G.L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime: An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-7837-0}}, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the notion of causality is metaphysically prior to the notions of time and space. In practical terms, this is because use of the relation of causality is necessary for the interpretation of empirical experiments. Interpretation of experiments is needed to establish the physical and geometrical notions of time and space.

===Necessary and sufficient causes===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Causes of schizophrenia]] --&gt;
{{hatnote|A similar concept occurs in logic, for this see [[Necessary and sufficient conditions]]}}

Causes may sometimes be distinguished into two types: necessary and sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Epp, Susanna S.: "Discrete Mathematics with Applications, Third Edition", pp. 25–26. Brooks/Cole – Thomson Learning, 2004. {{ISBN|0-534-35945-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third type of causation, which requires neither necessity nor sufficiency in and of itself, but which contributes to the effect, is called a "contributory cause."

;Necessary causes: If ''x'' is a necessary cause of ''y'', then the presence of ''y'' necessarily implies the prior occurrence of ''x''. The presence of ''x'', however, does not imply that ''y'' will occur.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sufficient causes: If ''x'' is a sufficient cause of ''y'', then the presence of ''x'' necessarily implies the subsequent occurrence of ''y''. However, another cause ''z'' may alternatively cause ''y''. Thus the presence of ''y'' does not imply the prior occurrence of ''x''.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;
;Contributory causes: For some specific effect, in a singular case, a factor that is a contributory cause is one among several co-occurrent causes. It is implicit that all of them are contributory. For the specific effect, in general, there is no implication that a contributory cause is necessary, though it may be so. In general, a factor that is a contributory cause is not sufficient, because it is by definition accompanied by other causes, which would not count as causes if it were sufficient. For the specific effect, a factor that is on some occasions a contributory cause might on some other occasions be sufficient, but on those other occasions it would not be merely contributory.&lt;ref name="Riegelman"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[J. L. Mackie]] argues that usual talk of "cause" in fact refers to '''INUS''' conditions ('''i'''nsufficient but '''n'''on-redundant parts of a condition which is itself '''u'''nnecessary but '''s'''ufficient for the occurrence of the effect).&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;Mackie, John L. The Cement of the Universe: A study in Causation. Clarendon Press, Oxford, England, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is a short circuit as a cause for a house burning down. Consider the collection of events: the short circuit, the proximity of flammable material, and the absence of firefighters. Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to the house's burning down (since many other collections of events certainly could have led to the house burning down, for example shooting the house with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth). Within this collection, the short circuit is an insufficient (since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire) but non-redundant (because the fire would not have happened without it, everything else being equal) part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect. So, the short circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of the house burning down.

===Contrasted with conditionals===
{{more citations needed|section|reason=Want to read more, want to examine source|date=January 2017}} 
[[Indicative conditional|Conditional]] statements are ''not'' statements of causality. An important distinction is that statements of causality require the antecedent to precede or coincide with the consequent in time, whereas conditional statements do not require this temporal order. Confusion commonly arises since many different statements in English may be presented using "If ..., then ..." form (and, arguably, because this form is far more commonly used to make a statement of causality). The two types of statements are distinct, however.

For example, all of the following statements are true when interpreting "If ..., then ..." as the material conditional:

# ''If Barack Obama is president of the United States in 2011, then Germany is in Europe.''
# ''If George Washington is president of the United States in 2011, then &lt;arbitrary statement&gt;.''

The first is true since both the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and the [[consequent]] are true. The second is true in [[sentential logic]] and indeterminate in natural language, regardless of the consequent statement that follows, because the antecedent is false.

The ordinary [[indicative conditional]] has somewhat more structure than the material conditional. For instance, although the first is the closest, neither of the preceding two statements seems true as an ordinary indicative reading. But the sentence:

* ''If Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon did not write Macbeth, then someone else did.''
intuitively seems to be true, even though there is no straightforward causal relation in this hypothetical situation between Shakespeare's not writing Macbeth and someone else's actually writing it.

Another sort of conditional, the [[counterfactual conditional]], has a stronger connection with causality, yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples of causality. Consider the following two statements:

# ''If A were a triangle, then A would have three sides.''
# ''If switch S were thrown, then bulb B would light.''

In the first case, it would not be correct to say that A's being a triangle ''caused'' it to have three sides, since the relationship between triangularity and three-sidedness is that of definition. The property of having three sides actually determines A's state as a triangle. Nonetheless, even when interpreted counterfactually, the first statement is true. An early version of Aristotle's "four cause" theory is described as recognizing "essential cause". In this version of the theory, that the closed polygon has three sides is said to be the "essential cause" of its being a triangle.&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"/&gt; This use of the word 'cause' is of course now far obsolete. Nevertheless, it is within the scope of ordinary language to say that it is essential to a triangle that it has three sides.

A full grasp of the concept of conditionals is important to [[understanding]] the literature on causality. In everyday language, loose conditional statements are often enough made, and need to be interpreted carefully.

===Questionable cause===
{{Main|Questionable cause}}

Fallacies of questionable cause, also known as causal fallacies, ''non-causa pro causa'' (Latin for "non-cause for cause"), or false cause, are [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]] where a cause is incorrectly identified.

==Theories==
{{Main|Causal model}}

===Counterfactual theories===
{{Main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Subjunctive conditionals are familiar from ordinary language. They are of the form, if A ''were'' the case, then B ''would'' be the case, or if A ''had been'' the case, then B ''would have been'' the case. Counterfactual conditionals are specifically subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents are in fact false, hence the name. However the term used technically may apply to conditionals with true antecedents as well.

Psychological research shows that people's thoughts about the causal relationships between events influences their judgments of the plausibility of counterfactual alternatives, and conversely, their [[counterfactual thinking]] about how a situation could have turned out differently changes their judgments of the causal role of events and agents. Nonetheless, their identification of the cause of an event, and their counterfactual thought about how the event could have turned out differently do not always coincide.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; People distinguish between various sorts of causes, e.g., strong and weak causes.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. &amp; Johnson-Laird, P.N. (1976). Language and Perception. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in the [[psychology of reasoning]] shows that people make different sorts of inferences from different sorts of causes, as found in the fields of cognitive linguistics&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., &amp; Johnson, M. (2003). ''Metaphors we live by''. University of Chicago press.&lt;/ref&gt; and accident analysis&lt;ref&gt;Branford, K. (2007). ''An investigation into the validity and reliability of the AcciMap approach''. Doctoral dissertation, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang, H. (2015). ''Development of New Methods to Support Systemic Incident Analysis.'' Doctoral dissertation, Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; for example.

In the philosophical literature, the suggestion that causation is to be defined in terms of a counterfactual relation is made by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]]. Hume remarks that we may define the relation of cause and effect such that "where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding|date=1748|location=Sec. VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More full-fledged analysis of causation in terms of counterfactual conditionals only came in the 20th century after development of the possible world semantics for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals. In his 1973 paper "Causation," [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] proposed the following definition of the notion of ''causal dependence'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Causation|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1973|volume=70|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:An event E ''causally depends'' on C if, and only if, (i) if C had occurred, then E would have occurred, and (ii) if C had not occurred, then E would not have occurred.

Causation is then defined as a chain of causal dependence. That is, C causes E if and only if there exists a sequence of events C, D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, E such that each event in the sequence depends on the previous.

Note that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal judgements or how we reason about causation, but rather to give a metaphysical account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of events. If correct, the analysis has the power to explain certain features of causation. Knowing that causation is a matter of counterfactual dependence, we may reflect on the nature of counterfactual dependence to account for the nature of causation. For example, in his paper "Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow," Lewis sought to account for the time-directedness of counterfactual dependence in terms of the semantics of the counterfactual conditional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow|journal=Nous|date=1979|volume=13|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; If correct, this theory can serve to explain a fundamental part of our experience, which is that we can only causally affect the future but not the past.

===Probabilistic causation===
{{Main|Probabilistic causation}}
Interpreting causation as a [[Determinism|deterministic]] relation means that if ''A'' causes ''B'', then ''A'' must ''always'' be followed by ''B''. In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] cause [[cancer]] or [[emphysema]]. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation. Informally, ''A'' ("The person is a smoker") probabilistically causes ''B'' ("The person has now or will have cancer at some time in the future"), if the information that ''A'' occurred increases the likelihood of ''B''s occurrence. Formally, P{''B''|''A''}≥ P{''B''} where P{''B''|''A''} is the conditional probability that ''B'' will occur given the information that ''A'' occurred, and P{''B''}is the probability that ''B'' will occur having no knowledge whether ''A'' did or did not occur. This intuitive condition is not adequate as a definition for probabilistic causation because of its being too general and thus not meeting our intuitive notion of cause and effect.  For example, if ''A'' denotes the event "The person is a smoker," ''B'' denotes the event "The person now has or will have cancer at some time in the future" and ''C'' denotes the event "The person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future," then the following three relationships hold: P{''B''|''A''} ≥ P{''B''}, P{''C''|''A''} ≥ P{''C''} and P{''B''|''C''} ≥ P{''B''}.  The last relationship states that knowing that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that he will have cancer.  The reason for this is that having the information that the person has emphysema increases the likelihood that the person is a smoker, thus indirectly increasing the likelihood that the person will have cancer.  However, we would not want to conclude that having emphysema causes cancer. Thus, we need additional conditions such as temporal relationship of ''A'' to ''B'' and a rational explanation as to the mechanism of action. It is hard to quantify this last requirement and thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Causal calculus===
When experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal, the derivation of cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause diseases, usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in [[causal graphs]] such as [[Bayesian network]]s or [[path analysis (statistics)|path diagrams]]. The theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between ''conditional probabilities'', as in &lt;math&gt;P(cancer|smoking)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''interventional probabilities'', as in &lt;math&gt;P(cancer|do(smoking))&lt;/math&gt;. The former reads: "the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke, having started, unforced by the experimenter, to do so at an unspecified time in the past", while the latter reads: "the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past". The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter, while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention. It is specifically characteristic of [[quantum mechanics|quantal phenomena]] that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter, as described quantitatively by the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]].{{Vague|date=June 2016}} In classical [[thermodynamics]], [[thermodynamic process|processes]] are initiated by interventions called [[thermodynamic operation]]s. In other branches of science, for example [[astronomy]], the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention.

The theory of "causal calculus"&lt;ref name=Pearl&gt;Pearl, Judea (2000). ''Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; permits one to infer interventional probabilities from conditional probabilities in causal [[Bayesian network]]s with unmeasured variables. One very practical result of this theory is the characterization of [[confounding variables]], namely, a sufficient set of variables that, if adjusted for, would yield the correct causal effect between variables of interest. It can be shown that a sufficient set for estimating the causal effect of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is any set of non-descendants of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-separate &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; after removing all arrows emanating from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This criterion, called "backdoor", provides a mathematical definition of "confounding" and helps researchers identify accessible sets of variables worthy of measurement.

===Structure learning===
While derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph, parts of the causal structure can, under certain assumptions, be learned from statistical data. The basic idea goes back to [[Sewall Wright]]'s 1921 work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year = | title = Correlation and Causation | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural Research | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 557–585 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]]. A "recovery" algorithm was developed by Rebane and Pearl (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Rebane, G. and Pearl, J., "The Recovery of Causal Poly-trees from Statistical Data", ''Proceedings, 3rd Workshop on Uncertainty in AI'', (Seattle) pp. 222–228, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; which rests on Wright's distinction between the three possible types of causal substructures allowed in a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG):

# &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;X \leftarrow Y \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;

Type 1 and type 2 represent the same statistical dependencies (i.e., &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are independent given &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;) and are, therefore, indistinguishable within purely [[cross-sectional data]]. Type 3, however, can be uniquely identified, since &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent. Thus, while the ''skeletons'' (the graphs stripped of arrows) of these three triplets are identical, the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable. The same distinction applies when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; have common ancestors, except that one must first condition on those ancestors. Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and, then, orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independencies observed.&lt;ref name="Pearl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirites, P. and Glymour, C., "An algorithm for fast recovery of sparse causal graphs", ''Social Science Computer Review'', Vol. 9, pp. 62–72, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirtes, P. and Glymour, C. and Scheines, R., ''Causation, Prediction, and Search'', New York: Springer-Verlag, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verma, T. and Pearl, J., "Equivalence and Synthesis of Causal Models", ''Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence'', (July, Cambridge, Massachusetts), pp. 220–227, 1990. Reprinted in P. Bonissone, M. Henrion, L.N. Kanal and J.F.\ Lemmer (Eds.), ''Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence 6'', Amsterdam: Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V., pp. 225–268, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative methods of structure learning search through the ''many'' possible causal structures among the variables, and remove ones which are strongly incompatible with the observed [[correlation]]s. In general this leaves a set of possible causal relations, which should then be tested by analyzing time series data or, preferably, designing appropriately controlled [[experiment]]s. In contrast with Bayesian Networks, [[path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] (and its generalization, [[structural equation model]]ing), serve better to estimate a known causal effect or to test a causal model than to generate causal hypotheses.

For nonexperimental data, causal direction can often be inferred if information about time is available. This is because (according to many, though not all, theories) causes must precede their effects temporally. This can be determined by statistical [[time series]] models, for instance, or with a statistical test based on the idea of [[Granger causality]], or by direct experimental manipulation. The use of temporal data can permit statistical tests of a pre-existing theory of causal direction. For instance, our degree of confidence in the direction and nature of causality is much greater when supported by [[cross-correlation]]s, [[ARIMA]] models, or [[Cross-spectrum|cross-spectral analysis]] using vector time series data than by [[cross-sectional data]].

===Derivation theories===
Nobel Prize laureate [[Herbert A. Simon]] and philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]]&lt;ref name="SimRes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Herbert | last2 = Rescher | first2 = Nicholas | year = 1966 | title = Cause and Counterfactual | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 323–340 | doi=10.1086/288105}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the asymmetry of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry of any mode of implication that contraposes. Rather, a causal relation is not a relation between values of variables, but a function of one variable (the cause) on to another (the effect). So, given a system of equations, and a set of variables appearing in these equations, we can introduce an asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering. The system of equations must have certain properties, most importantly, if some values are chosen arbitrarily, the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial discovery that is perfectly causal. They postulate the inherent serialization of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical fields, including physics and economics.

===Manipulation theories===
Some theorists have equated causality with manipulability.&lt;ref name="Collingwood"&gt;Collingwood, R. (1940) ''An Essay on Metaphysics.'' Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gasking"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gasking | first1 = D | year = 1955 | title = Causation and Recipes | url = | journal = Mind | volume = 64 | issue = 256| pages = 479–487 | doi=10.1093/mind/lxiv.256.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MenPrice"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menzies | first1 = P. | last2 = Price | first2 = H. | year = 1993 | title = Causation as a Secondary Quality | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 187–203 | doi=10.1093/bjps/44.2.187| citeseerx = 10.1.1.28.9736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vonWright"&gt;von Wright, G. (1971) ''Explanation and Understanding.'' [[Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Under these theories, ''x'' causes ''y'' only in the case that one can change ''x'' in order to change ''y''. This coincides with commonsense notions of causations, since often we ask causal questions in order to change some feature of the world. For instance, we are interested in knowing the causes of crime so that we might find ways of reducing it.

These theories have been criticized on two primary grounds. First, theorists complain that these accounts are [[Begging the question|circular]]. Attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction. But describing manipulations in non-causal terms has provided a substantial difficulty.

The second criticism centers around concerns of [[anthropocentrism]]. It seems to many people that causality is some existing relationship in the world that we can harness for our desires. If causality is identified with our manipulation, then this intuition is lost. In this sense, it makes humans overly central to interactions in the world.

Some attempts to defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that don't claim to reduce causality to manipulation. These accounts use manipulation as a sign or feature in causation without claiming that manipulation is more fundamental than causation.&lt;ref name="Pearl" /&gt;&lt;!-- Pearl, Judea (2000) ''Causality'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-77362-8&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, James (2003) ''Making Things Happen: A Theory of Causal Explanation''. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-515527-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process theories===
Some theorists are interested in distinguishing between causal processes and non-causal processes (Russell 1948; Salmon 1984).&lt;ref name="Salmon"&gt;Salmon, W. (1984) ''Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, B. (1948) ''Human Knowledge''. Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists often want to distinguish between a process and a [[pseudo-process]]. As an example, a ball moving through the air (a process) is contrasted with the motion of a shadow (a pseudo-process). The former is causal in nature while the latter is not.

Salmon (1984)&lt;ref name="Salmon" /&gt; claims that causal processes can be identified by their ability to transmit an alteration over space and time. An alteration of the ball (a mark by a pen, perhaps) is carried with it as the ball goes through the air. On the other hand, an alteration of the shadow (insofar as it is possible) will not be transmitted by the shadow as it moves along.

These theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is not causal relationships or causal interactions, but rather identifying causal processes. The former notions can then be defined in terms of causal processes.

===Science===
For the scientific investigation of efficient causality, the cause and effect are each best conceived of as temporally transient processes.

Within the conceptual frame of the [[scientific method]], an investigator sets up several distinct and contrasting temporally transient material processes that have the structure of [[experiment]]s, and records candidate material responses, normally intending  to determine causality in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949). ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, p. 18: "... scientific work will always be the search for causal interdependence of phenomena."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one may want to [[know]] whether a high intake of [[carrot]]s causes humans to develop the [[bubonic plague]]. The quantity of carrot intake is a process that is varied from occasion to occasion. The occurrence or non-occurrence of subsequent bubonic plague is recorded. To establish causality, the experiment must fulfill certain criteria, only one example of which is mentioned here. For example, instances of the hypothesized cause must be set up to occur at a time when the hypothesized effect is relatively unlikely in the absence of the hypothesized cause; such unlikelihood is to be established by empirical evidence. A mere observation of a [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] is not nearly adequate to establish causality. In nearly all cases, establishment of causality relies on repetition of experiments and probabilistic reasoning. Hardly ever is causality established more firmly than as more or less probable. It is often most convenient for establishment of causality if the contrasting material states of affairs are fully comparable, and differ through only one variable factor, perhaps measured by a real number. Otherwise, experiments are usually difficult or impossible to interpret.

In some sciences, it is very difficult or nearly impossible to set up material states of affairs that closely test hypotheses of causality. Such sciences can in some sense be regarded as "softer".

====Physics====
{{Main|Causality (physics)}}

One has to be careful in the use of the word cause in physics. Properly speaking, the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each temporally transient processes. For example, force is a useful concept for the explanation of acceleration, but force is not by itself a cause. More is needed. For example, a temporally transient process might be characterized by a definite change of force at a definite time. Such a process can be regarded as a cause. Causality is not inherently implied in [[equations of motion]], but postulated as an additional [[constraint (classical mechanics)|constraint]] that needs to be satisfied (i.e. a cause always precedes its effect). This constraint has mathematical implications&lt;ref name=kinsler2011&gt;

Causality is one of the most fundamental and essential notions of physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1910/2005). 'On Boltzmann’s Principle and some immediate consequences thereof', unpublished manuscript of a 1910 lecture by Einstein, translated by B. Duplantier and E. Parks, reprinted on pp. 183–199 in ''Einstein,1905–2005, Poincaré Seminar 2005'', edited by  T. Damour, O. Darrigol, B. Duplantier, V. Rivasseau, Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, {{ISBN|3-7643-7435-7}}, from ''Einstein, Albert: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'', 1987–2005, Hebrew University and Princeton University Press; p. 183: "All natural science is based upon the hypothesis of the complete causal connection of all events."&lt;/ref&gt; Causal efficacy cannot propagate faster than light. Otherwise, reference coordinate systems could be constructed (using the [[Lorentz transform]] of [[special relativity]]) in which an observer would see an effect precede its cause (i.e. the postulate of causality would be violated).

Causal notions appear in the context of the flow of mass-energy. For example, it is commonplace to argue that causal efficacy can be propagated by waves (such as electromagnetic waves) only if they propagate no faster than light. Wave packets have [[group velocity]] and [[phase velocity]]. For waves that propagate causal efficacy, both of these must travel no faster than light. Thus light waves often propagate causal efficacy but [[matter wave|de Broglie waves]] often have phase velocity faster than light and consequently cannot be propagating causal efficacy.

Causal notions are important in general relativity to the extent that the existence of an arrow of time demands that the universe's semi-Riemannian manifold be orientable, so that "future" and "past" are globally definable quantities.

====Engineering====
A [[causal system]] is a [[system]] with output and internal states that depends only on the current and previous input values. A system that has ''some'' dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible past or current input values) is termed an '''acausal''' system, and a system that depends ''solely'' on future input values is an [[anticausal system]]. Acausal filters, for example, can only exist as postprocessing filters, because these filters can extract future values from a memory buffer or a file.

====Biology, medicine and epidemiology====
[[Austin Bradford Hill]] built upon the work of [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and suggested in his paper "The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?" that aspects of an association such as strength, consistency, specificity and temporality be considered in attempting to distinguish causal from noncausal associations in the epidemiological situation. (See [[Bradford-Hill criteria]].) He did not note however, that temporality is the only necessary criterion among those aspects. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used in epidemiology to help enlighten causal thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiolero|first=A|author2=Paradis, G |author3=Kaufman, JS |title=Assessing the possible direct effect of birth weight on childhood blood pressure: a sensitivity analysis|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1 January 2014|volume=179|issue=1|pages=4–11|pmid=24186972|doi=10.1093/aje/kwt228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychology====
{{Main|Causal reasoning}}
Psychologists take an empirical approach to causality, investigating how people and non-human animals detect or infer causation from sensory information, prior experience and [[innatism|innate knowledge]].

;Attribution
[[Attribution theory]] is the [[theory]] concerning how people explain individual occurrences of causation. [[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution]] can be external (assigning causality to an outside agent or force—claiming that some outside thing motivated the event) or internal (assigning causality to factors within the person—taking personal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] or [[accountability]] for one's actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the event). Taking causation one step further, the type of attribution a person provides influences their future behavior.

The intention behind the cause or the effect can be covered by the subject of [[action (philosophy)|action]]. See also [[accident]]; [[blame]]; [[intent (law)|intent]]; and responsibility.

;Causal powers
Whereas [[David Hume#Causation|David Hume]] argued that causes are inferred from non-causal observations, [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed that people have innate assumptions about causes. Within psychology, [[Patricia Cheng]] (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheng | first1 = P.W. | year = 1997 | title = From Covariation to Causation: A Causal Power Theory | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 104 | issue = 2| pages = 367–405 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.104.2.367}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to reconcile the Humean and Kantian views. According to her power PC theory, people filter observations of events through a basic belief that causes have the power to generate (or prevent) their effects, thereby inferring specific cause-effect relations.

;Causation and salience
Our view of causation depends on what we consider to be the relevant events. Another way to view the statement, "Lightning causes thunder" is to see both lightning and thunder as two perceptions of the same event, viz., an electric discharge that we perceive first visually and then aurally.

;Naming and causality
David Sobel and Alison Gopnik from the Psychology Department of UC Berkeley designed a device known as ''the blicket detector'' which would turn on when an object was placed on it. Their research suggests that "even young children will easily and swiftly learn about a new causal power of an object and spontaneously use that information in classifying and naming the object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gopnik |first1=A |first2=David M. |last2=Sobel |title=Detecting Blickets: How Young Children Use Information about Novel Causal Powers in Categorization and Induction |journal=Child Development |date=September–October 2000 |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=1205–1222 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00224 |pmid=11108092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Perception of launching events
Some researchers such as Anjan Chatterjee at the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Fugelsang at the University of Waterloo are using neuroscience techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal launching events in which one object causes another object to move. Both temporal and spatial factors can be manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straube |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2010.00028 |pmid=20463866 |title=Space and time in perceptual causality |year=2010 |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |first1=B |last2=Chatterjee |first2=A |volume=4 |page=28 |pmc=2868299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[Causal Reasoning (Psychology)]] for more information.

====Statistics and economics====
[[Statistics]] and [[economics]] usually employ pre-existing data or experimental data to infer causality by regression methods. The body of statistical techniques involves substantial use of [[regression analysis]]. Typically a linear relationship such as

:&lt;math&gt;y_i = a_0 + a_1x_{1,i} + a_2x_{2,i} + ... + a_kx_{k,i} + e_i&lt;/math&gt;

is postulated, in which &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th observation of the dependent variable (hypothesized to be the caused variable), &lt;math&gt;x_{j,i}&lt;/math&gt; for ''j''=1,...,''k'' is the ''i''th observation on the ''j''th independent variable (hypothesized to be a causative variable), and &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; is the error term for the ''i''th observation (containing the combined effects of all other causative variables, which must be uncorrelated with the included independent variables). If there is reason to believe that none of the &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;s is caused by ''y'', then estimates of the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; are obtained. If the null hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;a_j=0&lt;/math&gt; is rejected, then the alternative hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;a_{j} \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt; and equivalently that &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; causes ''y'' cannot be rejected. On the other hand, if the null hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;a_j=0&lt;/math&gt; cannot be rejected, then equivalently the hypothesis of no causal effect of &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; on ''y'' cannot be rejected. Here the notion of causality is one of contributory causality as discussed [[Causality#Necessary and sufficient causes|above]]: If the true value &lt;math&gt;a_j \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, then a change in &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; will result in a change in ''y'' ''unless'' some other causative variable(s), either included in the regression or implicit in the error term, change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect; thus a change in &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is ''not sufficient'' to change ''y''. Likewise, a change in &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is ''not necessary'' to change ''y'', because a change in ''y'' could be caused by something implicit in the error term (or by some other causative explanatory variable included in the model).

The above way of testing for causality requires belief that there is no reverse causation, in which ''y'' would cause &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;. This belief can be established in one of several ways. First, the variable &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; may be a non-economic variable: for example, if rainfall amount &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is hypothesized to affect the futures price ''y'' of some agricultural commodity, it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount (provided that cloud seeding is never attempted). Second, the [[instrumental variables]] technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables (instruments) that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable. Third, the principle that effects cannot precede causes can be invoked, by including on the right side of the regression only variables that precede in time the dependent variable; this principle is invoked, for example, in testing for [[Granger causality]] and in its multivariate analog, [[vector autoregression]], both of which control for lagged values of the dependent variable while testing for causal effects of lagged independent variables.

Regression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors (explanatory variables). This helps to avoid false inferences of causality due to the presence of a third, underlying, variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable: its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression, so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect effect through the potentially causative variable of interest.

Given the above procedures, coincidental (as opposed to causal) correlation can be probabilistically rejected if data samples are large and if regression results pass [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] tests showing that the correlations hold even for data that were not used in the regression.

===Metaphysics===
The [[determinism|deterministic]] world-view holds that the history of the [[universe]] can be exhaustively represented as a [[chain of events|progression of events]] following one after as cause and effect.&lt;ref name="Sklar"&gt;Sklar, L. (1995). Determinism, pp. 117–119 in ''A Companion to Metaphysics'', edited by Kim, J. Sosa, E., Blackwell, Oxford UK, pp. 177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] version of this holds that there is no such thing as "[[free will]]". [[Compatibilism]], on the other hand, holds that determinism is compatible with, or even necessary for, free will.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, G. (1995). Free will, pp. 175–182 in ''A Companion to Metaphysics'', edited by Kim, J. Sosa, E., Blackwell, Oxford UK, pp. 177–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
[[File:Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram.svg|thumb|Used in management and engineering, an [[Ishikawa diagram]] shows the factors that cause the effect. Smaller arrows connect the sub-causes to major causes.]]
For quality control in manufacturing in the 1960s, [[Kaoru Ishikawa]] developed a cause and effect diagram, known as an [[Ishikawa diagram]] or fishbone diagram. The diagram categorizes causes, such as into the six main categories shown here. These categories are then sub-divided. Ishikawa's method identifies "causes" in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process. These groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams. The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control, and they are used in other areas of management and in design and engineering. Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. It seems that Ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gregory | first1 = Frank Hutson | year = 1992 | title = Cause, Effect, Efficiency &amp; Soft Systems Models, Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42 |issn=0160-5682 | url = | journal = Journal of the Operational Research Society | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 333–344 | doi=10.1057/jors.1993.63| title-link = s:Cause, Effect, Efficiency &amp; Soft Systems Models }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanities===

====History====
In the discussion of history, events are sometimes considered as if in some way being agents that can then bring about other historical events. Thus, the combination of poor harvests, the hardships of the peasants, high taxes, lack of representation of the people, and kingly ineptitude are among the ''causes'' of the [[French Revolution]]. This is a somewhat [[Plato]]nic and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] view that [[Concretization|reifies]] causes as [[Ontology|ontological entities]]. In Aristotelian terminology, this use approximates to the case of the ''efficient'' cause.

Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event—something that happens—but a change".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur (1965) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur (1965) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, Mark (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86–116.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, John L. (2002), ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes.&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, John L. (2002), ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history:  the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Christopher (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Law ====
{{Main|Causation (law)}}
According to [[law]] and [[jurisprudence]], '''legal cause''' must be demonstrated to hold a [[defendant]] liable for a [[crime]] or a [[tort]] (i.e. a civil wrong such as negligence or trespass). It must be proven that causality, or a "sufficient causal link" relates the defendant's actions to the criminal event or damage in question. Causation is also an essential legal element that must be proven to qualify for remedy measures under [[international trade law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dukgeun Ahn &amp; William J. Moon, Alternative Approach to Causation Analysis in Trade Remedy Investigations, ''Journal of World Trade''|ssrn=1601531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
Note the concept of omnicausality in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] theology, which is the belief that God has set in motion all events at the dawn of time; he is the determiner and the cause of all things. It is therefore an attempt to rectify the apparent [[incompatibilism|incompatibility]] between determinism and the existence of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent god]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Hindu philosophy===
{{See also|Karma}}

[[Vedic period]] (c. 1750–500 BCE) literature has karma's Eastern origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishan|first1=Y.|title=The Vedic Origins of the Doctrine of Karma|journal=South Asian Studies|date=6 August 2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=51–55|doi=10.1080/02666030.1988.9628366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is the belief held by [[Sanathana Dharma]] and major religions that a person's actions cause certain effects in the current life and/or in future [[reincarnation|life]], positively or negatively. The various philosophical schools ([[darsanas]]) provide different accounts of the subject. The doctrine of '''satkaryavada''' affirms that the effect inheres in the cause in some way. The effect is thus either a real or apparent modification of the cause. The doctrine of '''asatkaryavada''' affirms that the effect does not inhere in the cause, but is a new arising. See [[Nyaya]] for some details of the theory of causation in the Nyaya school. In [[Brahma Samhita]], Brahma describes Krishna as the prime cause of all causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://vedabase.net/bs/5/1/en | title=Brahma Samhita, Chapter 5: Hymn to the Absolute Truth | publisher=Bhaktivedanta Book Trust | accessdate=19 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507215250/http://vedabase.net/bs/5/1/en | archive-date=7 May 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-18-13.html Bhagavad-gītā 18.14] identifies five causes for any action (knowing which it can be perfected): the body, the individual soul, the senses, the efforts and the supersoul.

According to [[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams]], in the [[Nyāya]] causation theory from Sutra I.2.I,2 in the [[Vaisheshika]] philosophy, from causal non-existence is effectual non-existence; but, not effectual non-existence from causal non-existence. A cause precedes an effect.  With a threads and cloth metaphors, three causes are:
	
# Co-inherence cause: resulting from substantial contact, 'substantial causes', threads are substantial to cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's material cause.	
# Non-substantial cause: Methods putting threads into cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's formal cause.
# Instrumental cause:  Tools to make the cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's efficient cause.

Monier-Williams also proposed that  Aristotle's and the Nyaya's causality are considered conditional aggregates necessary to man's productive work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co7Mkn2SUQ8C | title=Indian Wisdom or Examples of the Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus | publisher=Oxford | author=Williams, Monier | year=1875 | location=London | page=81 | isbn=9781108007955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
{{See also|Pratītyasamutpāda}}

The general or universal definition of pratityasamutpada (or "dependent origination" or "dependent arising" or "interdependent co-arising") is that everything arises in dependence upon multiple causes and conditions; nothing exists as a singular, independent entity. A traditional example in Buddhist texts is of three sticks standing upright and leaning against each other and supporting each other. If one stick is taken away, the other two will fall to the ground.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Causality in the [[Chittamatrin]] Buddhist school approach, [[Asanga]]'s (c. 400 CE) mind-only Buddhist school, asserts that objects cause consciousness in the mind's image. Because causes precede effects, which must be different entities, then subject and object are different. For this school, there are no objects which are entities external to a perceiving consciousness. The Chittamatrin and the [[Yogachara]] [[Svatantrika]] schools accept that there are no objects external to the observer's causality.  This largely follows the [[Nikayas]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkins|first1=Jeffrey|title=Meditation on Emptiness|date=15 June 1996|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0861711109|page=367|edition=Rep Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lusthaus|first1=Dan|title=What is and isn't Yogācāra|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro.html|website=Yogacara Buddhism Research Associations|publisher=Yogacara Buddhism Research Associations: Resources for East Asian Language and Thought, A.

The [[Abhidharmakośakārikā#Karma|Abhidharmakośakārikā]] approach is [[Vasubandhu]]'s [[Abhidharma]] commentary text in the [[Sarvāstivāda]] school (c. 500 CE).  It has four intricate causal conditioning constructions with the: 1) root cause, 2) immediate antecedent, 3) object support, and 4) predominance. Then, the six causes are: 1) instrumentality (kāraṇahetu), deemed the primary factor in result production; 2) simultaneity or coexistence, which connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity, explaining the homogenous flow that evokes phenomena continuity; 4) association, which operates only between mental factors and explains why consciousness appears as assemblages to mental factors; 5) dominance, which forms one's habitual cognitive and behaviorist dispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the actively wholesome or unwholesome result. The four conditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining phenomenal experience: for instance, each conscious moment acts both as the homogenous cause, as well as the immediate antecedent consciousness condition rise, and its concomitants, in a subsequent moment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Vaibhashika]] (c. 500 CE) is an [[early buddhist school]] which favors direct object contact and accepts simultaneous cause and effects. This is based in the consciousness example which says, intentions and feelings are mutually accompanying mental factors that support each other like poles in tripod.  In contrast, simultaneous cause and effect rejectors say that if the effect already exists, then it cannot effect the same way again. How past, present and future are accepted is a basis for various Buddhist school's causality viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkins|first1=Jeffrey|title=Meditation on Emptiness|date=15 June 1996|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0861711109|page=339|edition=Rep Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klien|first1=Anne Carolyn|title=Knowledge And Liberation: Tibetan Buddhist Epistemology In Support Of Transformative Religious Experience|date=1 January 1987|publisher=Snow Lion|isbn=978-1559391146|page=101|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o2SutnTaXXAC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;q=vaibh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ika%20simultaneous%20causality|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartley|first1=Christopher|title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Hindu and Buddhist Ideas from Original Sources|date=30 July 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|edition=Kindle|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rn-8BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;q=vaibh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ika%20simultaneous%20causality|accessdate=30 January 2016|isbn=9781472528513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baha’i===

The Baha'i concept of causation has been a unifying force for this young religion.  The belief in a common biological and ideological ancestry has made it possible for Baha'is to recognize Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad.  Unfortunately, this has led to the systematic persecution of Baha'is by many caliphates.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Lake, [https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-30/iran-s-secret-shunning-of-a-minority-faith "Iran's Secret Shunning of a Minority Faith"], ''Bloomberg'', January 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Four causes|Potentiality and actuality}}

[[Aristotle]] identified four kinds of answer or explanatory mode to various "Why?" questions. He thought that, for any given topic, all four kinds of explanatory mode were important, each in its own right. As a result of traditional specialized philosophical peculiarities of language, with translations between ancient Greek, Latin, and English, the word 'cause' is nowadays in specialized philosophical writings used to label Aristotle's four kinds.&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"&gt;Graham, D.W.

Here Aristotle insists that all four modes of explanation are called for in the study of natural phenomena, and that the job of "the student of nature is to bring the why-question back to them all in the way appropriate to the science of nature" (''Phys.'' 198 a 21–23). The best way to understand this methodological recommendation is the following: the science of nature is concerned with natural bodies insofar as they are subject to change, and the job of the student of nature is to provide the explanation of their natural change. The factors that are involved in the explanation of natural change turn out to be matter, form, that which produces the change, and the end of this change. Note that Aristotle does not say that all four explanatory factors are involved in the explanation of each and every instance of natural change. Rather, he says that an adequate explanation of natural change may involve a reference to all of them. Aristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the four causes: the form and the end often coincide, and they are formally the same as that which produces the change (''Phys.'' 198 a 23–26).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Efficient cause]], which imparts the first relevant ''movement'', as a human lifts a rock or raises a statue. This is the main topic of the present article.
* [[Final cause]], the criterion of completion, or the [[Telos (philosophy)|end]]; it may refer to an action or to an inanimate process. Examples: Socrates takes a walk after dinner for the sake of his health; earth falls to the lowest level because that is its nature.

Of Aristotle's four kinds or explanatory modes, only one, the 'efficient cause' is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article. The other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition, structure and dynamics, and, again, criterion of completion. The word that Aristotle used was {{math|αἰτία}}. For the present purpose, that Greek word would be better translated as "explanation" than as "cause" as those words are most often used in current English. Another translation of Aristotle is that he meant "the four Becauses" as four kinds of answer to "why" questions.&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"/&gt;

Aristotle assumed efficient causality as referring to a basic fact of experience, not explicable by, or reducible to, anything more fundamental or basic.

In some works of Aristotle, the four causes are listed as (1) the essential cause, (2) the logical ground, (3) the moving cause, and (4) the final cause. In this listing, a statement of essential cause is a demonstration that an indicated object conforms to a definition of the word that refers to it. A statement of logical ground is an argument as to why an object statement is true. These are further examples of the idea that a "cause" in general in the context of Aristotle's usage is an "explanation".&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"/&gt;

The word "efficient" used here can also be translated from Aristotle as "moving" or "initiating".&lt;ref name="Graham 1987"/&gt;

Efficient causation was connected with [[Aristotelian physics]], which recognized the [[four classical elements|four elements]] (earth, air, fire, water), and added the [[Aether (classical element)|fifth element]] (aether). Water and earth by their intrinsic property ''gravitas'' or heaviness intrinsically fall toward, whereas air and fire by their intrinsic property ''levitas'' or lightness intrinsically rise away from, Earth's center—the motionless center of the universe—in a straight line while accelerating during the substance's approach to its natural place.

As air remained on Earth, however, and did not escape Earth while eventually achieving infinite speed—an absurdity—Aristotle inferred that the universe is finite in size and contains an invisible substance that held planet Earth and its atmosphere, the [[sublunary sphere]], centered in the universe. And since celestial bodies exhibit perpetual, unaccelerated motion orbiting planet Earth in unchanging relations, Aristotle inferred that the fifth element, ''aither'', that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves in perpetual circles, the only constant motion between two points. (An object traveling a straight line from point ''A'' to ''B'' and back must stop at either point before returning to the other.)

Left to itself, a thing exhibits ''natural motion'', but can—according to [[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—exhibit ''enforced motion'' imparted by an efficient cause. The form of plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and reproduction, the form of animals adds locomotion, and the form of humankind adds reason atop these. A rock normally exhibits ''natural motion''—explained by the rock's material cause of being composed of the element earth—but a living thing can lift the rock, an ''enforced motion'' diverting the rock from its natural place and natural motion. As a further kind of explanation, Aristotle identified the final cause, specifying a purpose or criterion of completion in light of which something should be understood.

Aristotle himself explained,

{{Quotation|''Cause'' means

(a) in one sense, that as the result of whose presence something comes into being—e.g., the bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup, and the classes which contain these [i.e., the '''material cause'''];

(b) in another sense, the form or pattern; that is, the essential formula and the classes which contain it—e.g. the ratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the octave—and the parts of the formula [i.e., the '''formal cause'''].

(c) The source of the first beginning of change or rest; e.g. the man who plans is a cause, and the father is the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which is changed [i.e., the '''efficient cause'''].

(d) The same as "end"; i.e. the final cause; e.g., as the "end" of walking is health. For why does a man walk? "To be healthy", we say, and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause [the '''final cause'''].

(e) All those means towards the end which arise at the instigation of something else, as, e.g., fat-reducing, purging, drugs and instruments are causes of health; for they all have the end as their object, although they differ from each other as being some instruments, others actions [i.e., necessary conditions].|Metaphysics, Book 5, section 1013a, translated by Hugh Tredennick&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1013a Aristotle. Aristotle in 23 Volumes, Vols.17, 18, translated by Hugh Tredennick. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1933, 1989.] (hosted at perseus.tufts.edu.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle further discerned two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and accidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects are assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, and actual effects to operating causes.

Averting [[infinite regress]], Aristotle inferred the first mover—an [[unmoved mover]]. The first mover's motion, too, must have been caused, but, being an unmoved mover, must have moved only toward a particular goal or desire.

====Middle Ages====
In line with Aristotelian cosmology, [[Thomas Aquinas]] posed a hierarchy prioritizing Aristotle's four causes: "final &gt; efficient &gt; material &gt; formal".&lt;ref name="The Thomist article"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Thomist|author=William E. May|title=Knowledge of Causality in Hume and Aquinas|date=April 1970|accessdate=6 April 2011|url=http://www.thomist.org/journal/1970,%20vol.%2034/April/1970%20April%20A%20May%20web.htm|volume=34|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501095157/http://www.thomist.org/journal/1970%2C%20vol.%2034/April/1970%20April%20A%20May%20web.htm|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas sought to identify the first efficient cause—now simply ''[[first cause]]''—as everyone would agree, said Aquinas, to call it ''God''. Later in the Middle Ages, many scholars conceded that the first cause was God, but explained that many earthly events occur within God's design or plan, and thereby scholars sought freedom to investigate the numerous ''secondary causes''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

====After the Middle Ages====
&lt;!--[[David Hume]] links here--&gt;
{{See also|Humean definition of causality}}
For Aristotelian philosophy before Aquinas, the word cause had a broad meaning. It meant 'answer to a why question' or 'explanation', and Aristotelian scholars recognized four kinds of such answers. With the end of the [[Middle Ages]], in many philosophical usages, the meaning of the word 'cause' narrowed. It often lost that broad meaning, and was restricted to just one of the four kinds. For authors such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], in the field of political thinking, and [[Francis Bacon]], concerning [[science]] more generally, Aristotle's moving cause was the focus of their interest. A widely used modern definition of causality in this newly narrowed sense was assumed by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="The Thomist article"/&gt; He undertook an epistemological and metaphysical investigation of the notion of moving cause. He denied that we can ever perceive cause and effect, except by developing a habit or custom of mind where we come to associate two types of object or event, always contiguous and occurring one after the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=David|last=Hume|title= A Treatise of Human Nature|origyear=1739|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&amp;Itemid=28|editor-last=Selby-Bigge|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Part III, section XV of his book ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', Hume expanded this to a list of eight ways of judging whether two things might be cause and effect. The first three:

:1. "The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time."
:2. "The cause must be prior to the effect."
:3. "There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect. 'Tis chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation."
And then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our experience and which are "the source of most of our philosophical reasonings":
:4. "The same cause always produces the same effect, and the same effect never arises but from the same cause. This principle we derive from experience, and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings."
:5. Hanging upon the above, Hume says that "where several different objects produce the same effect, it must be by means of some quality, which we discover to be common amongst them."
:6. And "founded on the same reason": "The difference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from that particular, in which they differ."
And then two more:
:7. "When any object increases or diminishes with the increase or diminution of its cause, 'tis to be regarded as a compounded effect, deriv'd from the union of the several different effects, which arise from the several different parts of the cause."
:8. An "object, which exists for any time in its full perfection without any effect, is not the sole cause of that effect, but requires to be assisted by some other principle, which may forward its influence and operation."

In 1949, physicist [[Max Born]] distinguished determination from causality. For him, determination meant that actual events are so linked by laws of nature that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can be made from sufficient present data about them. For him, there are two kinds of causation, which we may here call nomic or generic causation, and singular causation. Nomic causality means that cause and effect are linked by more or less certain or probabilistic general laws covering many possible or potential instances; we may recognize this as a probabilized version of criterion 3. of Hume mentioned just above. An occasion of singular causation is a particular occurrence of a definite complex of events that are physically linked by antecedence and contiguity, which we may here recognize as criteria 1. and 2. of Hume mentioned just above.&lt;ref name="Born"&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949).

'''The Centre for Development Studies''' (CDS), [[Trivandrum]], Kerala, India is a social science research institution. Its main objective is to promote research, teaching and training in disciplines relevant to development. 

The institute was established in 1971 by the economist [[Professor]] [[K. N. Raj]].

== Overview ==
Set up in 1971 by the late legendary economist Professor K.N. Raj, the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) is a self-governing institution known for its research in applied economics and topics germane to socio-economic development, pedagogy, and training programmes.  TCDS is housed in Prasanth Nagar, a hamlet off the [[Thiruvananthapuram]] city. It is easily accessible by road, rail and air.  The 10 acre campus is designed and delivered by late [[Laurie Baker]].  The K. N. Raj Library at CDS is one of the biggest repositories of books in South India with over 1,700,000 titles in economics and related disciplines and subscribing to about 260 print and 1800 online professional journals. It has a faculty strength of about 20.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Research at CDS is organised into six distinct themes:

* [[Agriculture]] and [[Natural Resource]]
* [[Gender]], [[Human migration|Migration]], [[Population]]
* [[Health]] and [[Education]]
* [[Poverty]], [[Vulnerability]] and [[Social security|Social Security]]
* [[Industry]]
* [[Trade]] and [[Technology]]
There is a seventh cross-cutting theme, analysing the impact of globalisation on each of the six themes.

The teaching programme of the CDS includes:

*A two-year M.A. Programme in [[Applied Economics]]
*A two-year M.Phil. Programme in [[Applied Economics]]
*A four-year Ph.D. Programme in [[Economics]].
All three programmes are affiliated to [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi.  The [[University of Kerala]] also has recognised CDS as a Centre for its doctoral studies. Besides, it has a number of short-duration occasional training programmes.

==The Organizational Structure==
The core financial support to the Centre comes from the Government of Kerala and the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]]. [[Reserve Bank of India]] and the [[Planning Commission of India]] have instituted endowment units for research in selected areas at CDS.  The Union Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs has established a migration unit at CDS to study issues relating to international migration from India.

The governance of CDS rests with the Governing Body consisting of academicians from across India. It follows a unique{{cn|date=August 2018}} style of decentralization in governance through various bodies assisting the Director in the management.

The present chairman of the Governing Body is Shri. K. M. Chandrasekhar. The current Director is Professor Sunil Mani.

The '''circumscription theory''' is a  theory of the role of warfare in [[state formation]] in [[political anthropology]], created by anthropologist [[Robert L. Carneiro|Robert Carneiro]]. The theory has been summarized in one sentence by Schacht: “In areas of circumscribed agricultural land, population pressure led to warfare that resulted in the evolution of the state”.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Robert M., “Circumscription Theory: A Critical Review,” American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 439, March/April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graber, Robert B., and Paul Roscoe, “Introduction: Circumscription and the Evolution of Society,” American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 406, March/April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The more circumscribed is an agricultural area, Carneiro argues, the sooner it politically unifies.

==Outline of the theory==

The theory begins with some assumptions. Warfare usually disperses people rather than uniting them. Environmental circumscription occurs when an area of productive agricultural land is surrounded by a less productive area such as the mountains, desert, or sea. Application of [[extensive agriculture]] would bring severely diminishing returns.

If there is no environmental circumscription, then losers in a war can migrate out from the region and settle somewhere else. If there is environmental circumscription, then losers in warfare are forced to submit to their conquerors, because migration is not an option and the populations of the conquered and conqueror are united. The new state organization strives to alleviate the population pressure by increasing the productive capacity of agricultural land through, for instance, more intensive cultivation using irrigation.

==Primary and secondary state development==

''Primary state development'' occurred in the six original states of the Nile Valley, Peru, Mesoamerican, Yellow River Valley China, Indus River Valley, and Mesopotamia. ''Secondary state development'' occurred in states that developed from contact with already existing states. Primary state development occurred in areas with environmental circumscription.

The presumption, under the Carneiro Hypothesis, is that agricultural intensification, and the social coordination and coercion necessary to achieve this end was a result of warfare in which vanquished populations could not disperse; the coercive coordination necessary for increased production of surplus is, under Carneiro's hypothesis, a causal factor in the origins of the State.  For example, the mountainous river valleys of Peru which descend to the Pacific coast were severely environmentally circumscribed. Amazonian populations could always disperse and maintain sparse contact with other, potentially hostile, neighbors, whereas Andean coastal populations could not.

==Criticism==

Carneiro's theory has been criticized by the Dutch "early state school" emerging in the 1970s around cultural anthropologist [[Henri J. M. Claessen|Henri J.M. Claessen]], on the ground that considerable contrary evidence can be found to Carneiro's theory. There are also cases of circumscribed environments and violent cultures which have failed to develop states, for example in the narrow highland valleys of interior Papua New Guinea, or the north west Pacific coastlines of North America.  Also for example, the formation of some early states in East Africa, Sri Lanka, and Polynesia do not easily fit with Carneiro's model. Hence Claessen's school developed a "complex interaction model" to explain early state formation, in which factors such as ecology, social and demographic structures, economic conditions, conflicts, and ideology become aligned in ways which favour state organisation.&lt;ref&gt;For some other criticisms see, e.g., [https://www.academia.edu/30911274/Circumscription_Theory_of_the_Origins_of_the_State_A_Cross-Cultural_Re-Analysis Circumscription Theory of the Origins of the State: A Cross-Cultural Re-Analysis. ''Cliodynamics'' 7/2 (2016): 187–203].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development and revision==

The theory has since been applied to many other contexts, with some arguing it can be applied globally.&lt;ref&gt;One of the leading experts on [[world-systems theory]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], noted in 1990 that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system. "World State Formation: Historical Processes and Emergent Necessity," California: Institute for research on World System, working paper 1, 1990, http://irows.ucr.edu/papers/irows1.txxt&lt;/ref&gt; Carneiro has since also revised his theory in various ways. He has argued that population ''concentration'' can act as a lower level impetus for tribal conflict than geographic circumscription. He has also argued that, in addition to the necessities of conquest, a more important reason for creation of chiefdoms was the rise of war chiefs who use their military loyalists to [[coup d'etat|take over a group of villages]] and become [[Paramount chief|paramount chiefs]].&lt;ref name="Car2012"&gt;Carneiro, Robert. 2012. [https://www.socionauki.ru/journal/files/seh/2012_2/005-030.pdf The Circumscription Theory: A Clarification, Amplification, and Reformulation]. Social Evolution &amp; History 11(2): 5–30&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6060">'''Cognitive archaeology''' is a [[archaeological theory|theoretical]] perspective in [[archaeology]] which focuses on the ways that ancient societies [[thought]] and the [[symbol]]ic structures that can be perceived in past [[material culture]].

Cognitive archaeologists often [[Research|study]] the role that [[ideology]] and differing organizational approaches would have had on ancient peoples. The way that these abstract ideas are manifested through the remains that these peoples have left can be investigated and debated often by drawing inferences and using approaches developed in fields such as [[semiotics]], [[psychology]] and the wider [[science]]s.

Humans do not behave under the influence of their senses alone but also through their past experiences such as their upbringing. These experiences contribute to each individual's unique view of the world, a kind of [[cognitive map]] that guides them. Groups of people living together tend to develop a shared view of the world and similar cognitive maps which in turn influence their group material culture.

Archaeologists have always tried to imagine what motivated people but early efforts to understand how they thought were unstructured and speculative. Since the rise of [[processualism]] these approaches have become more scientific, paying close attention to the [[Archaeological context]] of archaeological finds and all possible interpretations. For example, a prehistoric [[bâton de commandement]] served an unknown purpose but using cognitive archaeology to interpret it would involve evaluating all its possible functions using clearly defined procedures and comparisons. By applying logic and experimental evidence, the most likely functions can be isolated.

The multiple interpretations of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], [[archaeological site]] or symbol are affected by the archaeologist's own experiences and ideas as well as those of the distant cultural tradition that created it. [[Cave art]] for example may not have been [[art]] in the modern sense at all but perhaps the product of [[ritual]]. Similarly, it would likely have described activities that were perfectly obvious to the people who created it but the [[symbology]] employed will be different from that used today or at any other time.

Some archaeologists such as [[Lewis Binford]] have critiqued cognitive archaeology, stating that it is only people's actions rather than their thoughts that are preserved in the archaeological record. However it can be argued that even this evidence of actions is still the product of human thought and would have been governed by a multitude of experiences and perspectives. Thus one can see Cognitive Archaeology as a development of [[Processual archaeology|Processual Archaeology]] in that the combination of material culture and actions can be further developed into a study of the ideas which drove action and used objects. This method attempts to avoid the pitfalls of [[Post-processual archaeology|Post-Processual Archaeology]] by retaining the 'scientific' aspects of Processual Archaeology while reaching for the higher social levels of ideas.

==Examples==
Archaeologist [[Thomas Huffman]] defines cognitive archaeology as the study of prehistoric ideology: the ideals, values, and beliefs that constitute a society's worldview. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00438243.1986.9979990|title=Cognitive studies of the iron age in Southern Africa|year=1986|last1=Huffman|first1=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Huffman|journal=World Archaeology|volume=18|pages=84-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive archaeologists use the principles of sociocultural anthropology to investigate such diverse things as material symbols, the use of space, political power, and religion. For example, Huffman uses oral history sources from [[Zimbabwe]] and Portuguese documents to attempt to explain symbols discovered in the ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]], specifically connecting the [[Shona people]]'s historical association of the right with men and the left with women to the placement of entrances to stone structures. This cognitive archaeological approach may be problematic in its logical leaps and incomplete use of archaeological sources, as historian [[David Beach (historian)| David Beach]] has pointed out, demonstrating the care that must be used when attempting to explain deep-time intentionality using archaeological evidence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/204698|title=Cognitive Archaeology and Imaginary History at Great Zimbabwe|year=1998|last1=Beach|first1=David|authorlink=David Beach (historian)|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=39|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational logic''' is the use of [[logic]] to perform or reason about [[computation]]. It bears a similar relationship to [[computer science]] and engineering as [[mathematical logic]] bears to [[mathematics]] and as [[philosophical logic]] bears to [[philosophy]]. It is synonymous with "[[logic in computer science]]".

The term “Computational Logic” came to prominence with the founding of the [[ACM Transactions on Computational Logic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tocl.acm.org official website of ACM Transactions on Computational Logic&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was apparently introduced by J.A. Robinson in a 1970 paper in the Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Machine Intelligence Workshop, Edinburgh, 1970, entitled "Computational Logic: The Unification Computation" (Machine Intelligence 6:63-72, Edinburgh University Press, 1971). The expression is used in the second paragraph with a footnote claiming that *computational logic* (the emphasis is in the paper) is "surely a better phrase than 'theorem proving', for the branch of artificial intelligence which deals with how to make machines do deduction efficiently". This sounds like coining the term; no reference to a previous use is mentioned. In 1972 the Metamathematics Unit at the University of Edinburgh was renamed “The Department of Computational Logic” in the School of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bundy/ Professor [[Alan Bundy]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; The term was then used by [[Robert S. Boyer]] and [[J Strother Moore]], who worked in the Department in the early 1970s, to describe their work on program verification and automated reasoning. They also founded a company [http://www.computationallogic.com/ Computational Logic Inc.] of the same name.

The term “Computational Logic” has also come to be associated with [[logic programming]], because much of the early work in logic programming in the early 1970s also took place in the Department of Computational Logic in Edinburgh. It was reused in the early 1990s to describe work on extensions of logic programming in the EU Basic Research Project “Compulog” and in the associated Network of Excellence. Krzysztof Apt, who was the co-ordinator of the Basic Research Project Compulog-II, reused and generalized the term when he founded the ACM Transactions on Computational Logic in 2000 and became its first Editor-in-Chief.

[[Image:Arthur Devis 001.jpg|thumb|''Sir George and Lady Strickland in the Grounds of Boynton Hall'', oil on canvas, 1751. A conversation piece by [[Arthur Devis (1712–1787)|Arthur Devis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/3921/sir-george-and-lady-strickland-in-the-grounds-of-boynton-hall-arthur-devis&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''conversation piece''' is an informal group [[portrait]], especially those painted in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] in the 18th century, beginning in the 1720s. They are distinguished by their portrayal of the group apparently engaged in genteel conversation or some activity, very often outdoors. Typically the group will be members of a family, but friends may be included, and some groups are of friends, members of a society or hunt, or some other grouping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/conversation-piece Glossary: Conversation Piece.] The National Gallery. Retrieved 7 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the paintings are relatively small, about the same size as a half-length portrait but in horizontal or "landscape" format; others are much larger.

==Origins==
[[File:Johan Zoffany - Tribuna of the Uffizi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Zoffany]] paints a group of Englishmen in Rome for the [[Grand Tour]], united only by their wealth and love of art; unlike most conversation pieces, this was not a commissioned work.]]
The genre was developed from 17th century portraiture in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Gaunt (art historian)|Gaunt, William]]. (1964) ''A concise history of English painting''. London: [[Thames and Hudson]], p. 58. {{ISBN|0500200165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  compositions of merrymaking companies (''vrolijk gezelschap'') and garden parties (''buitenpartij'') painted by artists such as [[Dirck Hals]], [[David Vinckbooms]], [[Adriaen van de Venne]] and [[Willem Buytewech]] were an important influence on the genre.  In addition, representations of elegant companies and balls by [[Hieronymus Janssens]] and the works of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], in particular his ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'' ([[Prado Museum]]), gave an impetus and direction to the development of the genre.  In this last work, Rubens showed how a garden could be used as a setting for amorous dalliance and courtship.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Tavener, ''Nicolas Lancret: Dance Before a Fountain'', Holmes Getty Publications, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Low Countries many group portraits were painted, both of family groups and groups such as Governors or Regents of institutions, or militia officers. [[Frans Hals]], [[Rembrandt]] and other artists had adopted a variety of poses to liven up the group portrait, for example the famous ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]''.  The name derives from the Italian term, also used in English, ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' for a similarly informal painting of the [[Virgin and Child]] with saints, a genre developed in the Renaissance.

==Varieties==
There are many varieties of conversation piece. People may be portrayed sharing common activities such as hunts, meals, or musical parties. Dogs and/or horses are also frequently featured. [[Arthur Devis (1712–1787)|Arthur Devis]] was a regional painter famous for his small conversation pieces, popular with the gentry of [[Cheshire]]. [[William Hogarth]] also worked in the genre, and parodied it in his print ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'', which depicted a group of men whose conversation has degenerated into drunken incoherence. [[Johann Zoffany]] specialized in complicated conversation pieces, and most portraits by [[George Stubbs]] take this form, with horses and carriages in the composition. [[Joshua Reynolds]] would on request produce conversation pieces in the [[Grand Manner]], and at his usual near-life scale.

==Conversation starters==
The phrase "conversation piece" later acquired a different meaning. It came to refer to objects that were perceived to be interesting enough to spark conversation about them. They provide a stimulus for prop-based [[conversation opener]]s. The original conversation pieces sometimes depicted a group united in conversation about an object, which would typically be an item linked to science or scholarship.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

During his academic career he has contributed to the sociology of religion and culture, publishing various works in this field of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blasi|first1=Anthony|title=Sociology of Religion Searchable Bibliographic Database|url=http://www.thearda.com/rrh/resources/citations.asp?searchterms=cristi%E1n+parker&amp;incTitle=T&amp;incAuthor=T&amp;incAnnotation=T&amp;incPubInfo=T&amp;incBooks=T&amp;incPublications=T&amp;incTheses=T&amp;incDissertations=T&amp;pubStartYear=&amp;pubEndYear=&amp;p=Z&amp;c=ZABCDEF&amp;m=50&amp;sf=Citations&amp;t=Search+Citations&amp;pg=citations.asp|website=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 he published a book on popular religions and modernization in Latin America, under the title “Otra Lógica en América Latina, Religión popular y modernización capitalista”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Otra Lógica en América Latina, Religión popular y modernización capitalista|date=1996|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|location=Santiago y México|isbn=9567083088|pages=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has authored or coautored 22 books and 81 book chapters and 91 publications in scientific journals; he has also given conferences in no less than 15 Chilean universities and in 30 universities in America, Europe and Asia (258 presentations or conferences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/c6b930_d8da955aeffc4ae9bfcdc1b4fcff1727.pdf|website=Parker Sociologo|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been Director of the School of Sociology, Dean of Social Science (1989-1995) at the [[Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano]], and then he was Vice-president of Research and Development (2002-2003) and Director of the  [[:es:Instituto de Estudios Avanzados (Universidad de Santiago de Chile)|Institute for Advanced Studies]] of the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (2005- 2010).
He has been a consultant for [[UNICEF]], [[UNDP]], [[ECLAC]], FLACSO-Ecuador, and various public agencies in Chile, among them ministries of Education, of Development and Justice. In addition he has lectured in Research Methodology in the Academia Diplomática de Chile (2004-2012) and the Master's program in Military History and Strategic Thought of the War Academy of the Chilean Army (2004-2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Cristián|title=Bio / CV|url=http://www.parkersociologo.com/|website=Parker Sociologo|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to Sociology==
It has been stated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cipriani|first1=Roberto|title=Manual de Sociología de la Religión|date=2011|publisher=Siglo Veintiuno Editores|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=978-987-629-194-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that the work of C. Parker enables a complete knowledge of popular culture with an empathic and participative approach on the “culture of the poor”. His contribution to the sociology of religion, underscoring its cultural character, rich in creativity, has led to the reevaluation of lived religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=Meredith|title=Lived Religion. Faith and Practice in Everyday Life|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195368338|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., to the noninstitutional character of religion. That is why his criticisms of the ecclesiocentric bias of the sociology of western religion have been the subject of relevant publications.
According to Roberto Cipriani, Cristián Parker in his work “has analyzed with scientífic rigor the crossing of popular and official culture, revealing congruences and incongruences, points of contact and contrast through theoretical and empirical work made along a trip that has lasted 30 years, aimed at discovering what he calls the “other logic” of popular culture (...). On the other hand, an extensive analysis of the relation between religion and politics from a democratic perspective is not missing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cipriani|first1=Roberto|title=Manual de Sociología de la Religión|date=2011|publisher=Siglo Veintiuno Editores|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=978-987-629-194-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of C. Parker is consulted by specialists and those interested in Latin America’s sociocultural and religious evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Llambías|first1=Jaime|title=América Latina : interrogantes y prespectivas|date=2013|publisher=York University Bookstore|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55014-583-0|pages=205–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Parker has contributed to the sociology of development, especially in his analysis of new ways of understanding the relation between culture and development. In particular, he has conducted research on the social representations of social actors challenged by the radical scientific and technological innovations in the context of unequal globalization and on the environmental crisis, climate change, and energy transition in South American societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Cristian|last2=Letelier|first2=Mario|last3=Muñoz|first3=Juan|title=Elites, climate change and agency in a developing society: the Chilean case|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=20 March 2013|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1337–1363|doi=10.1007/s10668-013-9444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social commitment==
During the time in which Chile was governed under the dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]], he became an active actor of a Catholic church and of the ecumenical efforts in defense of human rights and the return to democracy. In those days he became committed with the Church's base communities that fought inspired by the Liberation Theology.
As the country turned to democracy, and after the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988]] and the election of [[Patricio Aylwin]] as president of the democratic Concertación, he oriented his life toward academic work.
During this time he has contributed in key and strategic issues of the social sciences for the construction of democracy in Chile: development of indigenous people, overcoming poverty, social and political participation of youngsters, ethics and democracy, and the challenges of climate change and sustainable development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63785">{{Earthquakes}}
'''Earthquake engineering''' is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with [[earthquake]]s in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels.&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to [[seismic loading]]; it is considered as a subset of [[structural engineering]], [[geotechnical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[applied physics]], etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and from the [[social sciences]], especially [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[finance]].

The main objectives of earthquake engineering are:
* Foresee the potential consequences of strong [[earthquakes]] on [[urban areas]] and civil infrastructure.
* Design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with [[building code]]s.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignCodes&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design Codes and Procedures|author=Berg, Glen V.|year=1983|publisher=EERI|isbn=0-943198-25-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Earthquake engineering structures|properly engineered structure]] does not necessarily have to be extremely strong or expensive. It has to be properly designed to withstand the seismic effects while sustaining an acceptable level of damage.

{{main article|Seismic loading}}

'''Seismic loading''' means application of an earthquake-generated excitation on a structure (or geo-structure). It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.geoengineer.org/|title=Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering|website=earthquake.geoengineer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with adjacent structures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/2006/200608.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030041059/http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/2006/200608.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[gravity wave]]s from [[tsunami]]. The loading that is expected at a given location on the Earth's surface is estimated by engineering [[seismology]]. It is related to the [[seismic hazard]] of the location.

== Seismic performance ==
{{Main article|Seismic analysis}}

'''Earthquake''' or '''seismic performance''' defines a structure's ability to sustain its main functions, such as its [[safety]] and [[Serviceability (structure)|serviceability]], ''at'' and ''after'' a particular earthquake exposure. A structure is normally considered ''safe'' if it does not endanger the lives and [[well-being]] of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing. A structure may be considered ''serviceable'' if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designed.

Basic concepts of the earthquake engineering, implemented in the major building codes, assume that a building should survive a rare, very severe earthquake by sustaining significant damage but without globally collapsing.&lt;ref name=RecommendedLateralForce&gt;{{cite book|title= Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary|author=Seismology Committee|year=1999|publisher= Structural Engineers Association of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it should remain operational for more frequent, but less severe seismic events.

=== Seismic performance assessment ===

Engineers need to know the quantified level of the actual or anticipated seismic performance associated with the direct damage to an individual building subject to a specified ground shaking.
Such an assessment may be performed either experimentally or analytically.

==== Experimental assessment ====
Experimental evaluations are expensive tests that are typically done by placing a (scaled) model of the structure on a [[earthquake shaking table|shake-table]] that simulates the earth shaking and observing its behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc652Zp5qWk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=182 |title=Shaking Table Test on Conventional Wooden House (1) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such kinds of experiments were first performed more than a century ago.&lt;ref name=SeismicExperiments&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Experiments on the Fracturing and Overturning of Columns|author=Omori, F.|year=1900|publisher=Publ. Earthquake Invest. Comm. In Foreign Languages, N.4, Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only recently has it become possible to perform 1:1 scale testing on full structures.

Due to the costly nature of such tests, they tend to be used mainly for understanding the seismic behavior of structures, validating models and verifying analysis methods. Thus, once properly validated, computational models and numerical procedures tend to carry the major burden for the seismic performance assessment of structures.

==== Analytical/Numerical assessment ====
[[File:Shaking NDC.jpg|thumb|left|Snapshot from [[shake-table video]] of a 6-story non-ductile concrete building [[destructive testing]]]]

'''Seismic performance assessment''' or [[seismic analysis|seismic structural analysis]] is a powerful tool of earthquake engineering which utilizes detailed modelling of the structure together with methods of structural analysis to gain a better understanding of seismic performance of building and [[non-building structure]]s. The technique as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.

In general, seismic structural analysis is based on the methods of [[structural dynamics]].&lt;ref name=DynamicsOfStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author=Chopra, Anil K.|year=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-855214-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the most prominent instrument of seismic analysis has been the earthquake [[response spectrum]] method which also contributed to the proposed building code's concept of today.&lt;ref name=EarthquakeSpectra&gt;{{cite book|title= Earthquake Spectra and Design|author1=Newmark, N.M. |author2=Hall, W.J. |year=1982|publisher=[[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute|EERI]]|isbn=0-943198-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such methods are good only for linear elastic systems, being largely unable to model the structural behavior when damage (i.e., [[non-linearity]]) appears. Numerical ''step-by-step integration'' proved to be a more effective method of analysis for multi-degree-of-freedom [[structural system]]s with significant [[non-linearity]] under a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] process of ground motion excitation.&lt;ref name=DynamicsofStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Dynamics of Structures|author1=Clough, Ray W. |author2=Penzien, Joseph |year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-011394-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, numerical analysis is conducted in order to evaluate the seismic performance of buildings. Performance evaluations are generally carried out by using nonlinear static pushover analysis or  nonlinear time-history analysis. In such analyses, it is essential to achieve accurate non-linear modeling of structural components such as beams, columns, beam-column joints, shear walls etc. Thus, experimental results play an important role in determining the modeling parameters of individual components, especially those that are subject to significant non-linear deformations. The individual components are then assembled to create a full non-linear model of the structure. Thus created models are analyzed to evaluate the performance of buildings.

The capabilities of the structural analysis software are a major consideration in the above process as they restrict the possible component models, the analysis methods available and, most importantly, the numerical robustness. The latter becomes a major consideration for structures that venture into the non-linear range and approach global or local collapse as the numerical solution becomes increasingly unstable and thus difficult to reach. There are several commercially available Finite Element Analysis software's such as CSI-SAP2000 and CSI-PERFORM-3D and Scia Engineer-ECtools which can be used for the seismic performance evaluation of buildings. Moreover, there is research-based finite element analysis platforms such as [[OpenSees]], RUAUMOKO and the older DRAIN-2D/3D, several of which are now open source.

== Research for earthquake engineering ==
[[File:FPB testing-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Earthquake shaking table|Shake-table]] testing of [[Earthquake engineering#Friction pendulum bearing|Friction Pendulum Bearings]] at EERC]]

Research for earthquake engineering means both field and analytical investigation or experimentation intended for discovery and scientific explanation of earthquake engineering related facts, revision of conventional concepts in the light of new findings, and practical application of the developed theories.

The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) is the main United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education in all fields of earthquake engineering. In particular, it focuses on experimental, analytical and computational research on design and performance enhancement of structural systems.[[File:E-Defense Shake Table.jpg|thumb|E-Defense Shake Table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-mEDsqZK-I&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=71 |title=Miki_house_test |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]] (EERI) is a leader in dissemination of [[earthquake engineering research]] related information both in the U.S. and globally.

A definitive list of earthquake engineering research related [[Earthquake shaking table|shaking tables]] around the world may be found in Experimental Facilities for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.fr/html/nsd/docs/2004/csni-r2004-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The most prominent of them is now E-Defense Shake Table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bosai.go.jp/hyogo/ehyogo/|title=The NIED ‘E-Defence’ Laboratory in Miki City]|accessdate=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Japan]].{{clear}}

The NEES network features 14 geographically-distributed, shared-use laboratories that support several types of experimental work:&lt;ref name="nees"/&gt; geotechnical centrifuge research, [[earthquake shaking table|shake-table]] tests, large-scale structural testing, tsunami wave basin experiments, and field site research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nees.org/5am/sessions.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075316/http://www.nees.org/5am/sessions.php |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating universities include: [[Cornell University]]; [[Lehigh University]]; [[Oregon State University]]; [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]; [[University at Buffalo]], [[State University of New York]]; [[University of California, Berkeley]]; [[University of California, Davis]]; [[University of California, Los Angeles]]; [[University of California, San Diego]]; [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]; [[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]]; [[University of Minnesota]]; [[University of Nevada, Reno]]; and the [[University of Texas, Austin]].&lt;ref name="nees"/&gt;

[[File:Seismic Testing of Crane.jpg|thumb|left|NEES at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|Buffalo]] testing facility]]

The equipment sites (labs) and a central data repository are connected to the global earthquake engineering community via the NEEShub website.  The NEES website is powered by HUBzero software developed at [[Purdue University]] for [[nanoHUB]] specifically to help the scientific community share resources and collaborate.  The cyberinfrastructure, connected via [[Internet2]], provides interactive simulation tools, a simulation tool development area, a curated central data repository, animated presentations, user support, telepresence, mechanism for uploading and sharing resources, and statistics about users and usage patterns.

This cyberinfrastructure allows researchers to: securely store, organize and share data within a standardized framework in a central location; remotely observe and participate in experiments through the use of synchronized real-time data and video; collaborate with colleagues to facilitate the planning, performance, analysis, and publication of research experiments; and conduct computational and hybrid simulations that may combine the results of multiple distributed experiments and link physical experiments with computer simulations to enable the investigation of overall system performance.

These resources jointly provide the means for collaboration and discovery to improve the seismic design and performance of civil and mechanical infrastructure systems.

=== Earthquake simulation ===

The very first '''earthquake simulations''' were performed by statically applying some ''horizontal inertia forces'' based on [[scale factor|scaled]] [[peak ground acceleration]]s to a mathematical model of a building.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Building Structures|author1=Lindeburg, Michael R. |author2=Baradar, Majid |year=2001|publisher=Professional Publications|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the further development of computational technologies, [[statics|static]] approaches began to give way to [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] ones.

Dynamic experiments on building and non-building structures may be physical, like [[Earthquake shaking table|shake-table testing]], or virtual ones. In both cases, to verify a structure's expected seismic performance, some researchers prefer to deal with so called "real time-histories" though the last cannot be "real" for a hypothetical earthquake specified by either a building code or by some particular research requirements. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to engage an earthquake simulation which is the seismic input that possesses only essential features of a real event.

Sometimes earthquake simulation is understood as a re-creation of local effects of a strong earth shaking.

=== Structure simulation ===
[[File:Kinematically equivalent building models on a shake-table.jpg|thumb|Concurrent experiments with two building models which are ''kinematically equivalent'' to a real prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvD5D2uhliM |title=Base isolation for earthquake engineering |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Theoretical or experimental evaluation of anticipated seismic performance mostly requires a '''structure simulation''' which is based on the concept of structural likeness or similarity. [[Similitude (model)|Similarity]] is some degree of [[analogy]] or [[Nominalism|resemblance]] between two or more objects. The notion of similarity rests either on exact or approximate repetitions of [[patterns]] in the compared items.

In general, a building model is said to have similarity with the real object if the two share ''geometric similarity'', ''kinematic similarity'' and ''dynamic similarity''. The most vivid and effective type of similarity is the ''kinematic'' one. ''Kinematic similarity'' exists when the paths and velocities of moving particles of a model and its prototype are similar.

The ultimate level of ''kinematic similarity'' is ''kinematic equivalence'' when, in the case of earthquake engineering, time-histories of each story lateral displacements of the model and its prototype would be the same.

== Seismic vibration control ==

'''Seismic vibration control''' is a set of technical means aimed to mitigate seismic impacts in building and [[non-building]] structures. All seismic vibration control  devices may be classified as ''passive'', ''active'' or ''hybrid''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics-animations.com/Physics/English/spri_txt.htm |title=Passive and active vibration isolation systems – Theory |publisher=Physics-animations.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; where:

* ''passive control devices'' have no [[feedback]] capability between them, structural elements and the ground;
* ''[[Active vibration control|active control devices]]'' incorporate real-time recording instrumentation on the ground integrated with earthquake input processing equipment and [[actuator]]s within the structure;
* ''hybrid control devices'' have combined features of active and passive control systems.&lt;ref name=ActiveHybrid&gt;{{cite book|title= Active, Hybrid and Semi-Active Structural Control|author1=Chu, S.Y. |author2=Soong, T.T. |author3=Reinhorn, A.M. |year=2005|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-470-01352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ground [[seismic waves]] reach up and start to penetrate a base of a building, their energy flow density, due to reflections, reduces dramatically: usually, up to 90%. However, the remaining portions of the incident waves during a major earthquake still bear a huge devastating potential.

After the seismic waves enter a [[superstructure]], there are a number of ways to control them in order to soothe their damaging effect and improve the building's seismic performance, for instance:

* to [[Dissipator (building design)|dissipate]] the wave energy inside a [[superstructure]] with properly engineered [[damper (mast)|damper]]s;
* to disperse the wave energy between a wider range of frequencies;
* to [[absorption (acoustics)|absorb]] the [[resonant]] portions of the whole wave frequencies band with the help of so-called ''[[mass damper]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211_fall2002.web.dir/Eva_Burk/Eva's%201st%20page.htm |title=Slide 2 |publisher=Ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyrus tomb.jpg|thumb|[[Mausoleum]] of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], the oldest [[base isolation|base-isolated]] structure in the world]]
Devices of the last kind, abbreviated correspondingly as TMD for the tuned (''passive''), as AMD for the ''active'', and as HMD for the ''hybrid mass dampers'', have been studied and installed in [[high-rise building]]s, predominantly in Japan, for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takenaka.co.jp/takenaka_e/quake_e/seishin/seishin.htm|title=想いをかたちに 未来へつなぐ　竹中工務店|website=www.takenaka.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is quite another approach: partial suppression of the seismic energy flow into the [[superstructure]] known as seismic or [[base isolation]].

For this, some pads are inserted into or under all major load-carrying elements in the base of the building which should substantially decouple a [[superstructure]] from its [[Substructure (engineering)|substructure]] resting on a shaking ground.

The first evidence of earthquake protection by using the principle of base isolation was discovered in [[Pasargadae]], a city in ancient Persia, now Iran, and dates back to the 6th century BCE. Below, there are some samples of seismic vibration control technologies of today.

=== Dry-stone walls control ===
[[File:Machupicchu intihuatana.JPG|thumb|left|Dry-stone walls of [[Machu Picchu]] Temple of the Sun, [[Peru]]]]People of [[Inca civilization]] were masters of the polished 'dry-stone walls', called [[ashlar]], where blocks of stone were cut to fit together tightly without any [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The Incas were among the best stonemasons the world has ever seen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/inca1/qanda.html |title=Live Event Q&amp;As |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many junctions in their masonry were so perfect that even blades of grass could not fit between the stones.

[[Peru]] is a highly [[seismic]] land and for centuries the mortar-free [[construction]] proved to be apparently more earthquake-resistant than using mortar. The stones of the dry-stone walls built by the Incas could move slightly and resettle without the walls collapsing, a passive [[vibration control|structural control]] technique employing both the principle of energy dissipation (coulomb damping) and that of suppressing [[resonant]] amplifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/civilization/first.html |title=Clark, Liesl; "First Inhabitants"; PBS online, Nova; updated Nov. 2000 |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tuned mass damper ===
{{Main article|Tuned mass damper}}
[[File:Taipei 101 Tuned Mass Damper.png|thumb|left|[[Tuned mass damper]] in [[Taipei 101]], the world's third tallest [[skyscraper]]]]

Typically the [[tuned mass damper]]s are huge concrete blocks mounted in [[skyscraper]]s or other structures and move in opposition to the [[resonance frequency]] oscillations of the structures by means of some sort of spring mechanism.

The [[Taipei 101]] skyscraper needs to withstand [[typhoon]] winds and earthquake [[tremor]]s common in this area of Asia/Pacific. For this purpose, a steel [[pendulum]] weighing 660 metric tonnes that serves as a tuned mass damper was designed and installed atop the structure. Suspended from the 92nd to the 88th floor, the pendulum sways to decrease resonant amplifications of lateral displacements in the building caused by earthquakes and strong [[Wind|gusts]].

=== Hysteretic dampers ===
A '''hysteretic damper''' is intended to provide better and more reliable seismic performance than that of a conventional structure by increasing the dissipation of [[seismic loading|seismic input]] energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.structuremag.org/OldArchives/2004/july/Structural%20Practices.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514012858/http://www.structuremag.org/OldArchives/2004/july/Structural%20Practices.pdf |date=May 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five major groups of hysteretic dampers used for the purpose, namely:

:* '''Fluid viscous dampers (FVDs)'''
Viscous Dampers have the benefit of being a supplemental damping system. They have an oval hysteretic loop and the damping is velocity dependent. While some minor maintenance is potentially required, viscous dampers generally do not need to be replaced after an earthquake. While more expensive than other damping technologies they can be used for both seismic and wind loads and are the most commonly used hysteretic damper.

:* '''Friction dampers (FDs)'''
Friction dampers tend to be available in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates on the principle of a [[Coulomb damping|coulomb damper]]. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience [[stick-slip phenomenon]] and [[Cold welding]]. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop and as long as the building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.

:* '''Metallic yielding dampers (MYDs)'''
Metallic yielding dampers, as the name implies, yield in order to absorb the earthquake's energy. This type of damper absorbs a large amount of energy however they must be replaced after an earthquake and may prevent the building from settling back to its original position.

:* '''Viscoelastic dampers (VEDs)'''
Viscoelastic dampers are useful in that they can be used for both wind and seismic applications, they are usually limited to small displacements. There is some concern as to the reliability of the technology as some brands have been banned from use in buildings in the United States.

:* '''Straddling pendulum dampers (swing)'''

=== Base isolation ===
Base isolation seeks to prevent the kinetic energy of the earthquake from being transferred into elastic energy in the building. These technologies do so by isolating the structure from the ground, thus enabling them to move somewhat independently. The degree to which the energy is transferred into the structure and how the energy is dissipated will vary depending on the technology used.

:* '''Lead rubber bearing'''
[[File:LRBtest.jpg|thumb|LRB being tested at the [[UCSD]] Caltrans-SRMD facility]]

Lead rubber bearing or LRB is a type of [[base isolation]] employing a heavy [[damping]].  It was invented by [[William Robinson (scientist)|Bill Robinson]], a New Zealander.&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/earthquakes/4 |title=4. Building for earthquake resistance – Earthquakes – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy damping mechanism incorporated in [[vibration control]] technologies and, particularly, in base isolation devices, is often considered a valuable source of suppressing vibrations thus enhancing a building's seismic performance. However, for the rather pliant systems such as base isolated structures, with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping, the so-called "damping force" may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake.  The video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yXgu4aS8HE |title=LBRtest |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a Lead Rubber Bearing being tested at the [[UCSD]] Caltrans-SRMD facility. The bearing is made of rubber with a lead core. It was a uniaxial test in which the bearing was also under a full structure load. Many buildings and bridges, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, are protected with lead dampers and lead and rubber bearings. [[Te Papa Tongarewa]], the national museum of New Zealand, and the New Zealand [[The Beehive|Parliament Buildings]] have been fitted with the bearings. Both are in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] which sits on an [[active fault]].&lt;ref name="teara.govt.nz"/&gt;

:* '''Springs-with-damper base isolator'''
[[File:GERB spring with damper.jpg|thumb|Springs-with-damper close-up]]

Springs-with-damper base isolator installed under a three-story town-house, [[Santa Monica]], California is shown on the photo taken prior to the 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]] exposure. It is a [[base isolation]] device conceptually similar to ''Lead Rubber Bearing''.

One of two three-story town-houses like this, which was well instrumented for recording of both vertical and horizontal [[acceleration]]s on its floors and the ground, has survived a severe shaking during the [[Northridge earthquake]] and left  valuable recorded information for further study.

:* '''Simple roller bearing'''
Simple roller bearing is a [[base isolation]] device which is intended for protection of various building and non-building structures against potentially damaging [[seismic loading|lateral impacts]] of strong earthquakes.

This metallic bearing support may be adapted, with certain precautions, as a seismic isolator to skyscrapers and buildings on soft ground. Recently, it has been employed under the name of ''[[metallic roller bearing]]'' for a housing complex (17 stories) in [[Tokyo, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okumuragumi.co.jp/en/technology/building.html |title=Building Technology + Seismic Isolation System – Okumura Corporation |language=ja |publisher=Okumuragumi.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''Friction pendulum bearing'''
[[File:FPB testing.jpg|thumb|FPB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfl-VueWTGE&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=27 |title=Hybrid Simulation of Base Isolated Structures |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; shake-table testing]]

Friction pendulum bearing (FPB) is another name of '''friction pendulum system''' (FPS). It is based on three pillars:&lt;ref name=FPS&gt;{{Citation |title=A Simple Pendulum Technique for Achieving Seismic Isolation |last1=Zayas |first1=Victor A. |last2=Low |first2=Stanley S. |last3=Mahin |first3=Stephen A. | author3-link=Stephen A.

== Seismic design ==

'''Seismic design''' is based on authorized engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to [[design]] or [[seismic retrofit|retrofit]] structures subject to earthquake exposure.&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignOfBuildingStructures/&gt; Those criteria are only consistent with the contemporary state of the knowledge about [[earthquake engineering structures]].&lt;ref name=EarthquakeDesignCriteria&gt;{{cite book|title= Earthquake Design Criteria|author1=Housner, George W. |author2=Jennings, Paul C. |year=1982|publisher=EERI|isbn=1-888577-52-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a building design which exactly follows seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |title=Earthquake-Resistant Construction |publisher=Nisee.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915091405/http://nisee.berkeley.edu/bertero/html/earthquake-resistant_construction.html |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of poor seismic design may be enormous. Nevertheless, seismic design has always been a [[trial and error]] process whether it was based on physical laws or on empirical knowledge of the [[seismic performance|structural performance]] of different shapes and materials.

[[File:San Francisco in ruins view from Captive Airship above Folsom 1906.jpg|thumb|[[San Francisco]] after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and fire]]
To practice [[seismic design]], seismic analysis or seismic evaluation of new and existing civil engineering projects, an [[engineer]] should, normally, pass examination on ''Seismic Principles''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pels.ca.gov/applicants/plan_civseism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which, in the State of California, include:
* Seismic Data and Seismic Design Criteria
* Seismic Characteristics of Engineered Systems
* Seismic Forces
* Seismic Analysis Procedures
* Seismic Detailing and Construction Quality Control

To build up complex structural systems,&lt;ref name=SeismicDesignHandbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Handbook|author=Edited by Farzad Naeim|year=1989|publisher=VNR|isbn=0-442-26922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; seismic design largely uses the same relatively small number of basic structural elements (to say nothing of vibration control devices) as any non-seismic design project.

Normally, according to building codes, structures are designed to "withstand" the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings.

Seismic design is carried out by understanding the possible [[failure mode]]s of a structure and providing the structure with appropriate [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[stiffness]], [[ductility]], and [[configuration (geometry)|configuration]]&lt;ref name=BuildingConfiguration&gt;{{cite book|title= Building Configuration &amp; Seismic Design|author1=Arnold, Christopher |author2=Reitherman, Robert |year=1982|publisher=A Wiley-Interscience Publication|isbn=0-471-86138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure those modes cannot occur.

=== Seismic design requirements ===
'''Seismic design requirements''' depend on the type of the structure, locality of the project and its authorities which stipulate applicable seismic design codes and criteria.&lt;ref name="RecommendedLateralForce"/&gt; For instance, [[California Department of Transportation]]'s requirements called ''The Seismic Design Criteria'' (SDC) and aimed at the design of new bridges in California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/earthquake_engineering/SDC/SDCPage.html |title=Template for External Caltrans Pages |publisher=Dot.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate an innovative seismic performance-based approach.

[[File:Metsamor aerien.jpg|thumb|The [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] was closed after the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asbarez.com/2007/12/07/strategy-to-close-metsamor-plant-presented |title=Strategy to Close Metsamor Plant Presented &amp;#124; Asbarez Armenian News |publisher=Asbarez.com |date=1995-10-26 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]The most significant feature in the SDC design philosophy is a shift from a ''force-based assessment'' of seismic demand to a ''displacement-based assessment'' of demand and capacity. Thus, the newly adopted displacement approach is based on comparing the ''elastic displacement'' demand to the ''inelastic displacement'' capacity of the primary structural components while ensuring a minimum level of inelastic capacity at all potential plastic hinge locations.

In addition to the designed structure itself, seismic design requirements may include a ''ground stabilization'' underneath the structure: sometimes, heavily shaken ground breaks up which leads to collapse of the structure sitting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 – YouTube |publisher=www.youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following topics should be of primary concerns: liquefaction; dynamic lateral earth pressures on retaining walls; seismic slope stability; earthquake-induced settlement.&lt;ref name=GeoEarthquakeEngineering&gt;{{cite book|title= Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering Handbook|author=Robert W. Day|year=2007|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-137782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear facility|Nuclear facilities]] should not jeopardise their safety in case of earthquakes or other hostile external events. Therefore, their seismic design is based on criteria far more stringent than those applying to non-nuclear facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf18.html |title=Nuclear Power Plants and Earthquakes |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] and [[2011 Japanese nuclear incidents|damage to other nuclear facilities]] that followed the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] have, however, drawn attention to ongoing concerns over [[Nuclear power in Japan#Seismicity|Japanese nuclear seismic design standards]] and caused other many governments to [[International reaction to Fukushima I nuclear accidents#Re-evaluation of existing nuclear energy programs|re-evaluate their nuclear programs]]. Doubt has also been expressed over the seismic evaluation and design of certain other plants, including the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]] in France.

=== Failure modes ===

'''Failure mode''' is the manner by which an earthquake induced failure is observed. It, generally, describes the way the failure occurs. Though costly and time consuming, learning from each real earthquake failure remains a routine recipe for advancement in ''seismic design'' methods. Below, some typical modes of earthquake-generated failures are presented.

[[File:LomaPrieta-SOMA.jpeg|thumb|left|Typical damage to [[unreinforced masonry building]]s at earthquakes]]
The lack of [[rebar|reinforcement]] coupled with poor [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and inadequate roof-to-wall ties can result in substantial damage to an '''unreinforced masonry building'''. Severely cracked or leaning walls are some of the most common earthquake damage. Also hazardous is the damage that may occur between the walls and roof or floor diaphragms. Separation between the framing and the walls can jeopardize the vertical support of roof and floor systems.

[[File:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg|thumb|[[Soft story building|Soft story]] collapse due to inadequate shear strength at ground level, [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]
'''[[Soft story building|Soft story effect]]'''. Absence of adequate stiffness on the ground level caused damage to this structure. A close examination of the image reveals that the rough board siding, once covered by a [[brick veneer]], has been completely dismantled from the studwall. Only the [[Structural rigidity|rigidity]] of the floor above combined with the support on the two hidden sides by continuous walls, not penetrated with large doors as on the street sides, is preventing full collapse of the structure.

[[File:Liquefaction at Niigata.JPG|thumb|left|Effects of [[soil liquefaction]] during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake]]]]
'''[[Soil liquefaction]]'''. In the cases where the soil consists of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic pore water pressure of sufficient magnitude and compact, [[liquefaction]] of those loose saturated deposits may result in non-uniform [[Consolidation (soil)|settlements]] and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the [[1964 Niigata earthquake|1964 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=neesit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d316Wdgf16Y&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=63 |title=Niigita Earthquake 1964 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smashed Car in Dujiangyan - 2008 Sichuan earthquake (1).jpg|thumb|Car smashed by [[landslide]] rock, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]]]
'''Landslide rock fall'''. A [[landslide]] is a geological phenomenon which includes a wide range of ground movement, including '''rock falls'''. Typically, the action of [[gravity]] is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur though in this case there was another contributing factor which affected the original [[slope stability]]: the landslide required an ''earthquake trigger'' before being released.

'''Pounding against adjacent building'''. This is a photograph of the collapsed five-story tower, St. Joseph's Seminary, [[Los Altos, California]] which resulted in one fatality. During [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], the tower pounded against the independently vibrating adjacent building behind. A possibility of pounding depends on both buildings' lateral displacements which should be accurately estimated and accounted for.

[[File:Kaiser Permanente Building After Northridge Earthquake.jpg|thumb|Effects of completely shattered joints of concrete frame, [[Northridge earthquake|Northridge]]]]
At [[Northridge earthquake]], the Kaiser Permanente concrete frame office building had joints completely shattered, revealing '''inadequate confinement steel''', which resulted in the second story collapse. In the transverse direction, composite end [[shear wall]]s, consisting of two [[wythe]]s of brick and a layer of [[shotcrete]] that carried the lateral load, peeled apart because of '''inadequate through-ties''' and failed.

* Improper [[construction site]] on a [[foothill]].
* Poor detailing of the [[rebar|reinforcement]] (lack of concrete confinement in the columns and at the beam-column joints, inadequate splice length).
* Seismically weak [[soft story building|soft story]] at the first floor.
* Long [[cantilever]]s with heavy [[dead load]].

== Earthquake-resistant construction ==

'''Earthquake construction''' means implementation of '''seismic design''' to enable building and non-building structures to live through the anticipated earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with the applicable [[building code]]s.[[File:2009 03 03 Pearl River Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of [[Pearl River Tower]] X-bracing to resist lateral forces of earthquakes and winds]]

Design and construction are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing of the members and their connections should be as simple as possible. As any construction in general, earthquake construction is a process that consists of the building, retrofitting or assembling of infrastructure given the construction materials available.&lt;ref name=BridgeDesign&gt;{{cite book|title=Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance
|author=Edited by Robert Lark|year=2007|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=0-7277-3593-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destabilizing action of an earthquake on constructions may be ''direct'' (seismic motion of the ground) or ''indirect'' (earthquake-induced landslides, [[soil liquefaction]] and waves of tsunami).

A structure might have all the appearances of stability, yet offer nothing but danger when an earthquake occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24993357/ |title=Bad construction cited in quake zone – World news – Asia-Pacific – China earthquake &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crucial fact is that, for safety, earthquake-resistant construction techniques are as important as [[quality control]] and using correct materials. ''Earthquake contractor'' should be [[registered company|registered]] in the state/province/country of the project location (depending on local regulations), [[bond (finance)|bonded]] and [[insured]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

To minimize possible [[earthquake loss|losses]], construction process should be organized with keeping in mind that earthquake may strike any time prior to the end of construction.

Each [[construction project]] requires a qualified team of professionals who understand the basic features of seismic performance of different structures as well as [[construction management]].

=== Adobe structures ===
[[File:Adobe structure.jpg|thumb|Partially collapsed adobe building in Westmorland, [[California]]]]

Around thirty percent of the world's population lives or works in earth-made construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eartharchitecture.org/|title=Earth Architecture – the Book, Synopsis|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe]] type of [[mud brick]]s is one of the oldest and most widely used building materials. The use of [[adobe]] is very common in some of the world's most hazard-prone regions, traditionally across Latin America, Africa, Indian subcontinent and other parts of Asia, Middle East and Southern Europe.

Adobe buildings are considered very vulnerable at strong quakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOiqGHEOmuA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=16 |title=simulacion terremoto peru-huaraz – casas de adobe – YouTube |publisher=Nz.youtube.com |date=2006-06-24 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple ways of seismic strengthening of new and existing adobe buildings are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828211041/http://www.world-housing.net/uploads/WHETutorial_Adobe_English.pdf |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key factors for the improved seismic performance of
adobe construction are:
* Quality of construction.
* Compact, box-type layout.
* Seismic reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUOPY0OjlQ&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=21 |title=Shake table testing of adobe house (4A-S7 East) – YouTube |publisher=Nz.youtube.com |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limestone and sandstone structures ===
[[File:SLCCityAndCountyBldg.jpg|thumb|left|Base-isolated City and County Building, [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]]]

[[Limestone]] is very common in architecture, especially in North America and Europe. Many landmarks across the world are made of limestone. Many medieval churches and castles in Europe are made of [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] masonry. They are the long-lasting materials but their rather heavy weight is not beneficial for adequate seismic performance.

Application of modern technology to seismic retrofitting can enhance the survivability of unreinforced masonry structures. As an example, from 1973 to 1989, the [[Salt Lake City and County Building]] in [[Utah]] was exhaustively renovated and repaired with an emphasis on preserving historical accuracy in appearance. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade that placed the weak sandstone structure on base isolation foundation to better protect it from earthquake damage.

=== Timber frame structures ===
[[File:Anne Hvides Gaard Svendborg.jpg|thumb|[[Anne Hvide's House]], Denmark (1560)]]

[[Timber framing]] dates back thousands of years, and has been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, Europe and medieval England in localities where timber was in good supply and building stone and the skills to work it were not.

The use of [[timber framing]] in buildings provides their complete skeletal framing which offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better ''seismic survivability''.&lt;ref name=Timber&gt;{{cite book|title= Timber Design &amp; Construction Sourcebook=Gotz, Karl-Heinz et al.|year=1989|publisher=McGraw-Hall |isbn=0-07-023851-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light-frame structures ===
[[File:Wood-framed house.jpg|thumb|left|A two-story wooden-frame for a residential building structure]]

[[Light-frame construction|Light-frame structures]] usually gain seismic resistance from rigid [[plywood]] shear walls and wood structural panel [[diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nees.buffalo.edu/projects/NEESWood/video.asp |title=SEESL |publisher=Nees.buffalo.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special provisions for seismic load-resisting systems for all [[engineered wood]] structures requires consideration of diaphragm ratios, horizontal and vertical diaphragm shears, and [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|connector]]/[[fastener]] values. In addition, collectors, or drag struts, to distribute shear along a diaphragm length are required.

=== Reinforced masonry structures ===
[[File:Bond-beam.JPG|thumb|Reinforced hollow masonry wall]]

A construction system where [[steel reinforcement]] is embedded in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[masonry]] or placed in holes and after filled with [[concrete]] or [[grout]] is called '''reinforced masonry'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rossen Rashkoff |url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm |title=Reinforced Brick Masonry |publisher=Staff.city.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819014216/http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/earthquakes/MasonryBrick/ReinforcedBrickMasonry.htm |archivedate=2013-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The devastating [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed that masonry construction should be improved immediately. Then, the California State Code made the reinforced masonry mandatory.

There are various practices and techniques to achieve reinforced masonry. The most common type is the reinforced hollow unit masonry. The effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal reinforcement strongly depends on the type and quality of the masonry, i.e. masonry units and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].

To achieve a [[ductile]] behavior of masonry, it is necessary that the [[shear strength]] of the wall is greater than the [[flexural strength]].&lt;ref name=SeismicMasonry&gt;{{cite book|title= Seismic Design of Masonry Using the 1997 UBC|author1=Ekwueme, Chukwuma G. |author2=Uzarski, Joe |year=2003|publisher=Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reinforced concrete structures ===
[[File:StressedRibbonBridgeUnderside7138.JPG|thumb|left|Stressed Ribbon pedestrian bridge over the Rogue River, Grants Pass, [[Oregon]]]]
[[File:ThreeTwrBrCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Prestressed concrete [[cable-stayed bridge]] over [[Yangtze river]]]]

[[Reinforced concrete]] is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars ([[rebars]]) or [[fiber]]s have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be [[brittle]]. It can be used to produce [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[column]]s, floors or bridges.

[[Prestressed concrete]] is a kind of [[reinforced concrete]] used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to [[beams]], floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing [[tendon]]s (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a [[compressive stress]] that offsets the [[tensile stress]] that the concrete [[compression member]] would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.

To prevent catastrophic collapse in response earth shaking (in the interest of life safety), a traditional reinforced concrete frame should have [[ductile]] joints. Depending upon the methods used and the imposed seismic forces, such buildings may be immediately usable, require extensive repair, or may have to be demolished.

=== Prestressed structures ===
[[Prestressed structure]] is the one whose overall [[integrity]], [[Structural stability|stability]] and [[security]] depend, primarily, on a ''prestressing''. ''Prestressing'' means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign&gt;{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|year=1987|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Colosseum With Moon.jpg|thumb|Naturally pre-compressed exterior wall of [[Colosseum]], Rome]]
There are the following basic types of prestressing:
* Pre-compression (mostly, with the own weight of a structure)
* [[Prestressed concrete|Pretensioning]] with high-strength embedded tendons
* [[Prestressed concrete|Post-tensioning]] with high-strength bonded or unbonded tendons
Today, the concept of [[prestressed structure]] is widely engaged in design of [[building]]s, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, [[nuclear reactor]] vessels, and numerous kinds of [[bridge]] systems.&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcrete&gt;{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|year=1989|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beneficial idea of ''prestressing'' was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; look, e.g., at the tall [[attic]] wall of [[Colosseum]] working as a stabilizing device for the wall [[pier]]s beneath.

=== Steel structures ===
[[File:LomaPrieta-BayBridge-collapsed-section.jpeg|thumb|Collapsed section of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] in response to [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]]]

'''Steel structures''' are considered mostly earthquake resistant but some failures have occurred. A great number of welded [[steel moment-resisting frame]] buildings, which looked earthquake-proof, surprisingly experienced brittle behavior and were hazardously damaged in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]].&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=394–395|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) initiated development of repair techniques and new design approaches to minimize damage to steel moment frame buildings in future earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacsteel.org/index.html |title=SAC Steel Project: Welcome |publisher=Sacsteel.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[structural steel]] seismic design based on [[Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) approach, it is very important to assess ability of a structure to develop and maintain its bearing resistance in the [[inelastic]] range. A measure of this ability is [[ductility]], which may be observed in a ''material itself'', in a ''structural element'', or to a ''whole structure''.

As a consequence of [[Northridge earthquake]] experience, the American Institute of Steel Construction has introduced AISC 358 "Pre-Qualified Connections for Special and intermediate Steel Moment Frames."  The AISC Seismic Design Provisions require that all [[Steel Moment Resisting Frame]]s employ either connections contained in AISC 358, or the use of connections that have been subjected to pre-qualifying cyclic testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seismic Design Manual|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction|location=Chicago|isbn=1-56424-056-8|pages=6.1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prediction of earthquake losses ==

'''Earthquake loss estimation''' is usually defined as a ''Damage Ratio'' ('''DR''') which is a ratio of the earthquake damage repair cost to the [[Total Economic Value|total value]] of a building.&lt;ref name=SeismicRisk&gt;{{cite book|title= Financial Management of Earthquake Risk|author=EERI Endowment Subcommittee|date=May 2000|publisher=EERI Publication|isbn=0-943198-21-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Probable Maximum Loss'' ('''PML''') is a common term used for earthquake loss estimation, but it lacks a precise definition.  In 1999, ASTM E2026 'Standard Guide for the Estimation of Building Damageability in Earthquakes' was produced in order to standardize the nomenclature for seismic loss estimation, as well as establish guidelines as to the review process and qualifications of the reviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|year=1999|title=Loss Estimation|author=Eugene Trahern|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410060435/http://www.cccengr.com/cccengerwebpage_lossestimation.html|archivedate=2009-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthquake loss estimations are also referred to as ''Seismic Risk Assessments''.  The risk assessment process generally involves determining the probability of various ground motions coupled with the vulnerability or damage of the building under those ground motions.  The results are defined as a percent of building replacement value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acceptable Risk Processes: Lifeline and Natural Hazards|year=2002|publisher=ASCE, TCLEE|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784406236|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5260|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113010823/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147486137&amp;productid=5260|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-13|editor1=Craig Taylor|editor2=Erik VanMarcke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔθνος}} ''ethnos'' "folk, people, nation" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''grapho'' "I write") is the systematic study of people and cultures. It is designed to explore [[cultural]] phenomena where the researcher observes society from the point of view of the subject of the study.  An ethnography is a means to represent graphically and in writing the culture of a [[ethnic group|group]].  The word can thus be said to have a double meaning, which partly depends on whether it is used as a [[count noun]] or uncountable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanethnography.com/ethnography.php "Technical definition of ethnography"], ''American Ethnography''&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting field study or a case report reflects the knowledge and the system of meanings in the lives of a cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1973). [[Thick description]]: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (pp. 3-30). New York: Basic Books, Inc., Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipsen, G. (1992). ''Speaking Culturally: Explorations in Social Communication.'' Albany, New York: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a method of data collection ethnography entails examining the behaviour of the participants in a certain specific social situation and also understanding their interpretation of such behaviour.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An ‘Exotic’ Ethnographer’s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewan (2018) further elaborates that this behaviour may be shaped by the constraints the participants feel because of the situations they are in or by the society in which they belong. Ethnography, as the presentation of [[empirical]] data on human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s, was pioneered in the biological, social, and cultural branches of [[anthropology]], but it has also become popular in the [[social sciences]] in general—[[sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethnology "Ethnology" at ''dictionary.com''].&lt;/ref&gt; communication studies, history—wherever people study ethnic groups, formations, compositions, resettlements, social welfare characteristics, materiality, spirituality, and a people's [[ethnogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Токарев |first=Сергей Александрович |coauthors= |script-title=ru:История зарубежной этнографии |publisher=Наука |year=1978 |url=http://historia-site.narod.ru/library/ethnology/tokarev_main.htm |isbn= |language=Russian |title=Archived copy |access-date=2003-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519225912/http://historia-site.narod.ru/library/ethnology/tokarev_main.htm |archive-date=2003-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical ethnography is a [[holistic]] study&lt;ref name="Ember 2006"&gt;Ember, Carol and Melvin Ember, ''Cultural Anthropology'' (Prentice Hall, 2006), chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heider, Karl 2001"&gt;Heider, Karl. ''Seeing Anthropology''. 2001. Prentice Hall, Chapters One and Two.&lt;/ref&gt; and so includes a brief history, and an analysis of the [[Physical geography|terrain]], the [[climate]], and the [[habitat]].  In all cases, it should be reflexive, make a substantial contribution toward the understanding of the social life of humans, have an aesthetic impact on the reader, and express a credible reality. An ethnography records all observed behavior and describes all symbol-meaning relations, using concepts that avoid causal explanations. Traditionally, ethnography was focussed on the western gaze towards the far 'exotic' east, but now researchers are undertaking ethnography in their own social environment. According to Dewan (2018), even if we are the other, the ‘another’ or the ‘native’, we are still ‘another’ because there are many facades of ourselves that connect us to people and other facades that highlight our differences. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History and meaning==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is known as the first modern ethnographer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462|title=Bernardino de Sahagun: First Anthropologist (review)|first=Louise M.|last=Burkhart|date=10 June 2003|publisher=|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|volume=89|issue=2|pages=351–352|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/cat.2003.0100}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
The word 'ethnography' is derived from the Greek ἔθνος (''ethnos''), meaning "a company, later a people, nation" and [[-graphy]], meaning "writing". Ethnographic studies focus on large cultural groups of people who interact over time. Ethnography is a set of qualitative methods that are used in social sciences that focus on the observation of social practices and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erialproject.org/for-librarians/what-is-ethnography|title=What is Ethnography? « ERIAL Project|website=www.erialproject.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to observe a situation without imposing any deductive structure or framework upon it and to view everything as strange or unique.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Preece, J., Sharp, H., &amp; Rogers, Y. (2015). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction (4th edition). Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of anthropology originated from Europe and England designed in late 19th century. It spread its roots to the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Some of the main contributors like [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.&amp;nbsp;B. Tylor]] (1832–1917) from Britain and [[Lewis H. Morgan]] (1818–1881), an American scientist were considered as founders of cultural and social dimensions. [[Franz Boas]] (1858–1942), [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] (1884—1942), [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948), and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901–1978), were a group of researchers from the United States who contributed the idea of [[cultural relativism]] to the literature. Boas's approach focused on the use of documents and informants, whereas Malinowski stated that a researcher should be engrossed with the work for long periods in the field and do a participant observation by living with the informant and experiencing their way of life. He gives the viewpoint of the native and this became the origin of field work and field methods.

Since Malinowski was very firm with his approach he applied it practically and traveled to [[Trobriand Islands]] which are located off the eastern coast of [[New Guinea]]. He was interested in learning the language of the islanders and stayed there for a long time doing his field work. The field of ethnography became very popular in the late 19th century, as many social scientists gained an interest in studying modern society.  Again, in the latter part of the 19th century, the field of anthropology became a good support for scientific formation.  Though the field was flourishing, it had a lot of threats to encounter. Postcolonialism, the research climate shifted towards post-modernism and feminism. Therefore, the field of anthropology moved into a discipline of social science.

==Origins==
[[Gerhard Friedrich Müller]] developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]] (1733–43) as a professor of history and geography. Whilst involved in the expedition, he differentiated ''Völker-Beschreibung'' as a distinct area of study. This became known as "ethnography," following the introduction of the Greek neologism ''ethnographia''  by Johann Friedrich Schöpperlin and the German variant by A. F. Thilo in 1767.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[August Ludwig von Schlözer]] and [[Christoph Wilhelm Jacob Gatterer]] of the [[University of Göttingen]] introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vermeulen, Han F., 2008, ''Early History of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment'', Leiden, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vermeulen"&gt;{{cite book|last = Vermeulen|first = Hans|title = Early History of Ethnograph and Ethnolog in the German Enlightenment: Anthropological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1710-1808|year = 2008|publisher = Privately published|location = Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]], known as the Father of History, had significant works on the cultures of various peoples beyond the Hellenic realm such as the [[Scythians]], which earned him the title "philobarbarian", and may be said to have produced the first works of ethnography.

==Forms of ethnography==

There are different forms of ethnography: confessional ethnography; life history; feminist ethnography etc. Two popular forms of ethnography are realist ethnography and critical ethnography. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)

Realist ethnography is a traditional approach used by cultural anthropologists. Characterized by Van Maanen (1988), it reflects a particular instance taken by the researcher toward the individual being studied. It's an objective study of the situation. It's composed from a third person's perspective by getting the data from the members on the site. The ethnographer stays as omniscient correspondent of actualities out of sight. The realist reports information in a measured style ostensibly uncontaminated by individual predisposition, political objectives, and judgment. The analyst will give a detailed report of the everyday life of the individuals under study. The ethnographer also uses standard categories for cultural description (e.g., family life, communication network). The ethnographer produces the participant's views through closely edited quotations and has the final work on how the culture is to be interpreted and presented. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)

Critical ethnography is a kind of ethnographic research in which the creators advocate for the liberation of groups which are marginalized in society. Critical researchers typically are politically minded people who look to take a stand of opposition to inequality and domination.  For example, a critical ethnographer might study schools that provide privileges to certain types of students, or counseling practices that serve to overlook the needs of underrepresented groups. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94). The important components of a critical ethnographer are to incorporate a value- laden introduction, empower people by giving them more authority, challenging the status quo, and addressing concerns about power and control. A critical ethnographer will study issues of power, empowerment, inequality inequity, dominance, repression, hegemony, and victimization. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)

==Features of ethnographic research==
According to Dewan (2018) the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings; rather, they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation. In this regard, the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions &lt;ref&gt;(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An ‘Exotic’ Ethnographer’s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Involves investigation of very few cases, maybe just one case, in detail.
* Often involves working with primarily unconstructed data. This data had not been coded at the point of data collection in terms of a closed set of analytic categories.
* Emphasizes on exploring social phenomena rather than testing hypotheses.
* Data analysis involves interpretation of the functions and meanings of human actions. The product of this is mainly verbal explanations, where statistical analysis and quantification play a subordinate role. 
* Methodological discussions focus more on questions about how to report findings in the field than on methods of data collection and interpretation.
* Ethnographies focus on describing the culture of a group in very detailed and complex manner. The ethnography can be of the entire group or a subpart of it. 
* It involves engaging in extensive field work where data collection is mainly by interviews, symbols, artifacts, observations, and many other sources of data. 
* The researcher in ethnography type of research looks for patterns of the group's mental activities, that is their ideas and beliefs expressed through language or other activities, and how they behave in their groups as expressed through their actions that the researcher observed.
* In ethnography, the researcher gathers what is available, what is normal, what it is that people do, what they say, and how they work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Procedures for conducting ethnography==

* Determine if ethnography is the most appropriate design to use to study the research problem. Ethnography is suitable if the needs are to describe how a cultural group works and to explore their beliefs, language, behaviours and also issues faced by the group, such as power, resistance, and dominance. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)
*  Then identify and locate a culture-sharing group to study.  This group is one whose members have been together for an extended period of time, so that their shared language, patterns of behaviour and attitudes have merged into discernible patterns. This group can also be a group that has been marginalized by society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)
* Select cultural themes, issues or theories to study about the group. These themes, issues, and theories provide an orienting framework for the study of the culture-sharing group. As discussed by [[Martyn Hammersley|Hammersley]] and Atkinson (2007), Wolcott (1987, 1994b, 2008-1), and Fetterman (2009). The ethnographer begins the study by examining people in interaction in ordinary settings and discerns pervasive patterns such as life cycles, events, and cultural themes. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94-95)
* For studying cultural concepts, determine which type of ethnography to use. Perhaps how the group works need to be described, or a critical ethnography can expose issues such as power, hegemony, and advocacy for certain groups (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)
* Should collect information in the context or setting where the group works or lives. This is called fieldwork. Types of information typically needed in ethnography are collected by going to the research site, respecting the daily lives of individuals at the site and collecting a wide variety of materials. Field issues of respect, reciprocity, deciding who owns the data and others are central to Ethnography (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)
*  From the many sources collected, the ethnographer analyzes the data for a description of the culture-sharing group, themes that emerge from the group and an overall interpretation (Wolcott, 1994b). The researcher begins to compile a detailed description of the culture-sharing group, by focusing on a single event, on several activities, or on the group over a prolonged period of time.
*   Forge a working set of rules or generalizations as to how the culture-sharing group works as the final product of this analysis. The final product is a holistic cultural portrait of the group that incorporates the views of the participants (emic) as well as the views of the researcher (etic). It might also advocate for the needs of the group or suggest changes in society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 96)

==Ethnography as method==
The ethnographic method is different from other ways of conducting social science approach due to the following reasons:
[[File:Rozmowa z twórczyniami tradycyjnych, wołoskich pisanek.jpg|thumb|An ethnographer conducting field interviews, [[Wallachian Open Air Museum|Valašské muzeum v přírodě]]]]
* It is field-based. It is conducted in the settings in which real people actually live, rather than in laboratories where the researcher controls the elements of the behaviors to be observed or measured.
* It is personalized. It is conducted by researchers who are in the day-to-day, face-to-face contact with the people they are studying and who are thus both participants in and observers of the lives under study.
* It is multifactorial. It is conducted through the use of two or more data collection techniques - which may be qualitative or quantitative in nature - in order to get a conclusion.
* It requires a long-term commitment i.e. it is conducted by a researcher who intends to interact with people they are studying for an extended period of time.  The exact time frame can vary from several weeks to a year or more.
* It is inductive. It is conducted in such a way to use an accumulation of descriptive detail to build toward general patterns or explanatory theories rather than structured to test hypotheses derived from existing theories or models.
* It is dialogic.  It is conducted by a researcher whose interpretations and findings may be expounded on by the study’s participants while conclusions are still in the process of formulation.
* It is holistic. It is conducted so as to yield the fullest possible portrait of the group under study.
* It can also be used in other methodological frameworks, for instance, an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Data collection methods==
[[File:Izmir Ethnography Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|[[Izmir Ethnography Museum]] (İzmir Etnografya Müzesi), [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]], from the courtyard]]
[[File:Ethnography Museum Budapest architecture.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=text|[[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Ethnography museum]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]]]
According to the leading social scientist, [[John David Brewer|John Brewer]], data collection methods are meant to capture the "social meanings and ordinary activities"&lt;ref name="brewer"&gt;[Brewer, John D. (2000). ''Ethnography.'' Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.10.]&lt;/ref&gt; of people (informants) in "naturally occurring settings"&lt;ref name="brewer" /&gt; that are commonly referred to as "the field."  The goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data.&lt;ref name="brewer" /&gt;  Multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community.  These can include participant observation, field notes, interviews, and surveys.

Interviews are often taped and later transcribed, allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking, but with all information available later for full analysis. Secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic.  In the past, kinship charts were commonly used to "discover logical patterns and social structure in non-Western societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/kinship.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed.

In order to make the data collection and interpretation transparent, researchers creating ethnographies often attempt to be "reflexive". Reflexivity refers to the researcher's aim "to explore the ways in which [the] researcher's involvement with a particular study influences, acts upon and informs such research".&lt;ref&gt;[Nightingale, David &amp; Cromby, John. ''Social Constructionist Psychology: A Critical Analysis of Theory and Practice''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.228.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these attempts of reflexivity, no researcher can be totally unbiased. This factor has provided a basis to criticize ethnography.

Traditionally, the ethnographer focuses attention on a community, selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well.&lt;ref name="G1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garson |first=G. David |url=http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/ethno.htm |title=Ethnographic Research: Statnotes, from North Carolina State University, Public Administration Program |publisher=Faculty.chass.ncsu.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community, often using snowball or chain sampling.&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt; This process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied.&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt; Ethnography relies greatly on up-close, personal experience. Participation, rather than just observation, is one of the keys to this process.&lt;ref&gt;Genzuk, Michael, PH.D., ''[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~genzuk/Ethnographic_Research.html A Synthesis of Ethnographic]'', Center for Multilingual, Multicultural Research, University of Southern California&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnography is very useful in social research.

Ybema et al. (2010) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography.  Ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective, in which behavior is observed, to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects. Research can range from an objectivist account of fixed, observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing "the interplay of individual agency and social structure."&lt;ref&gt;S. Ybema, D. Yanow, H. Wels, &amp; F. Kamsteeg (2010). "Ethnography." In A. Mills, G. Durepos, &amp; E. Wiebe (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Case Study Research.'' (pp. 348-352). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theory researchers address "issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power."

Another form of data collection is that of the "image." The image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea. An image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual's perspective, primarily based on that individual’s past experiences. One example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it. The physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of "I can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=Lynda|title=Lynda Barry: The answer is in the picture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmT4wLWksOw|website=YouTube|publisher=INKtalks|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner. Effectively, the idea of the image is a primary tool for ethnographers to collect data. The image presents the perspective, experiences, and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence, the individual will always contain this image in the group under study.

== Differences across disciplines ==
The ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines, primarily by anthropologists but also occasionally by sociologists. [[Cultural studies]], (European) [[ethnology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[social work]], [[education]], [[design]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[human factors and ergonomics]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[folkloristics]], [[religious studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[communication studies]], [[performance studies]], [[advertising]], nursing, [[urban planning]], [[usability]], [[political science]],&lt;ref&gt;Schatz, Edward, ed. ''Political Ethnography: What Immersion Contributes to the Study of Power''. University Of Chicago Press. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social movement]],&lt;ref&gt;Balsiger, P., Lambelet, A.,  Participant Observation. In D. Della Porta (Ed.), Methodological Practices in Social Movement Research (pp. 144-172). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[criminology]] are other fields which have made use of ethnography.

===Cultural and social anthropology===
[[Cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]] were developed around ethnographic research and their [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] texts, which are mostly ethnographies: e.g. ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) by [[Bronisław Malinowski]], ''Ethnologische Excursion in Johore'' (1875) by [[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay]],  ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' (1928) by [[Margaret Mead]], ''The Nuer'' (1940) by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], ''Naven'' (1936, 1958) by [[Gregory Bateson]], or "[[The Lele of the Kasai]]" (1963) by [[Mary Douglas]]. Cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research. The typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people, almost always based at least in part on [[emic]] views of where the culture begins and ends. Using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common.&lt;ref&gt;Naroll, Raoul. ''Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnographies are also sometimes called "case studies."&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Leo. ''Shadowed Lives: Undocumented Workers in American Society'' (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology). 1997, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnographers study and interpret culture, its universalities, and its variations through the ethnographic study based on [[fieldwork]]. An ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture, society, or community. The fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society, living with the local people and learning about their ways of life.  Neophyte Ethnographers are strongly encouraged to develop extensive familiarity with their subject prior to entering the field; otherwise, they may find themselves in difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=Janet M.C. | title=Caught in the Riptide: Female Researcher in a Patricentric Setting.  Pp. 171-182 in Fragile Truths: 25 Years of Sociology and Anthropology in Canada.  D. Harrison, W.K. Carroll, L. Christiansen-Ruffman and Raymond Currie (eds.) | publisher=Carleton University Press | year=1992 | location=Ottawa, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographers are participant observers. They take part in events they study because it helps with understanding local behavior and thought. Classic examples are [[Carol B. Stack]]'s ''All Our Kin'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stack |first=Carol B. | title=All Our Kin:Strategies for Survival in a black community | publisher=Harper and Row | year=1974 | location=New York, New York | isbn=0-06-013974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Briggs' ''Never in Anger'', [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard Lee]]'s ''Kalahari Hunter-Gatherers'', [[Victor Turner]]'s ''Forest of Symbols'', David Maybry-Lewis' ''Akew-Shavante Society'', [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s ''The Nuer,'' and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]''. Iterations of ethnographic representations in the classic, modernist camp include Joseph W. Bastien's "Drum and Stethoscope" (1992), Bartholomew Dean's recent (2009) contribution, ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 |title=University Press of Florida: Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |publisher=Upf.com |date=2009-11-15 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical ethnography attempts to be [[holistic]]&lt;ref name="Ember 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heider, Karl 2001"/&gt; and typically follows an outline to include a brief history of the culture in question, an analysis of the [[physical geography]] or terrain inhabited by the people under study, including [[climate]], and often including what biological anthropologists call [[habitat]]. Folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences. Material culture, technology, and means of subsistence are usually treated next, as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure.  Kinship and social structure (including age grading, peer groups, gender, voluntary associations, clans, moieties, and so forth, if they exist) are typically included. Languages spoken, dialects, and the history of language change are another group of standard topics.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Ember and Ember 2006, Heider 2001 op cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Practices of childrearing, acculturation, and emic views on personality and values usually follow after sections on social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Ember and Ember 2006, op cit., Chapters 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; Rites, rituals, and other evidence of religion have long been an interest and are sometimes central to ethnographies, especially when conducted in public where visiting anthropologists can see them.&lt;ref&gt;Truner, Victor. ''The Forest of Symbols''.  remainder of citation forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt;

As ethnography developed, anthropologists grew more interested in less tangible aspects of culture, such as values, worldview and what [[Clifford Geertz]] termed the "ethos" of the culture. In his fieldwork, Geertz used elements of a [[Empirical research|phenomenological]] approach, tracing not just the doings of people, but the cultural elements themselves. For example, if within a group of people, winking was a communicative gesture, he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean (it might mean several things). Then, he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used, and whether, as one moved about a region, winks remained meaningful in the same way. In this way, cultural boundaries of communication could be explored, as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence. Geertz, while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline, moved outside that outline to talk about "webs" instead of "outlines"&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. ''The Interpretation of Culture,'' Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt; of culture.

Within cultural anthropology, there are several subgenres of ethnography.  Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, anthropologists began writing "bio-confessional" ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research.  Famous examples include ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]'' (1955) by Lévi-Strauss, ''The High Valley'' by Kenneth Read, and ''The Savage and the Innocent'' by [[David Maybury-Lewis]], as well as the mildly fictionalized ''Return to Laughter'' by Elenore Smith Bowen ([[Laura Bohannan]]).

Later "[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]" ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer.  Famous examples include ''Deep Play:  Notes on a Balinese Cockfight'' by [[Clifford Geertz]],  ''Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco'' by [[Paul Rabinow]], ''The Headman and I'' by Jean-Paul Dumont, and ''Tuhami'' by Vincent Crapanzano.  In the 1980s, the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline, under the general influence of [[literary theory]] and [[postcolonial|post-colonial]]/[[post-structuralist]] thought.  "Experimental" ethnographies that reveal the ferment of the discipline include ''Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man'' by [[Michael Taussig]], ''Debating Muslims'' by Michael F. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, ''A Space on the Side of the Road'' by Kathleen Stewart, and ''Advocacy after Bhopal'' by Kim Fortun.

This critical turn in sociocultural anthropology during the mid-1980s can be traced to the influence of the now classic (and often contested) text, ''Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography'', (1986) edited by [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] and [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]]. ''Writing Culture'' helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being 'postmodern,' 'reflexive,' 'literary,' 'deconstructive,' or 'poststructural' in nature, in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Zenker &amp; Karsten Kumoll. ''Beyond Writing Culture: Current Intersections of Epistemologies and Representational Practices.'' (2010). New York: Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84545-675-7}}. Pgs. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Geertz's and [[Victor Turner|Turner's]] interpretive anthropology recognized subjects as creative actors who constructed their sociocultural worlds out of symbols, postmodernists attempted to draw attention to the privileged status of the ethnographers themselves. That is, the ethnographer cannot escape the personal viewpoint in creating an ethnographic account, thus making any claims of objective neutrality highly problematic, if not altogether impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Erickson &amp; Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory,'' Third Edition. (2008). Toronto: Broadview Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55111-871-0}}. Pg. 190&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to this last point, ''Writing Culture'' became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson &amp; Murphy (2008). A History of Anthropological Theory, Pgs. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of experimental forms such as 'dialogic anthropology,' 'narrative ethnography,'&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Ghodsee, "Writing Ethnographies that Ordinary People Can Read." {{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/05/24/writing-ethnographies-that-ordinary-people-can-read/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227060610/http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/05/24/writing-ethnographies-that-ordinary-people-can-read/ |archivedate=2013-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'literary ethnography',&lt;ref&gt;Literary Ethnography http://literary-ethnography.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Writing Culture'' helped to encourage the development of 'collaborative ethnography.'&lt;ref name="ZenkerKumoll"&gt;Olaf Zenker &amp; Karsten Kumoll.

Pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This exploration of the relationship between writer, audience, and subject has become a central tenet of contemporary anthropological and ethnographic practice. In certain instances, active collaboration between the researcher(s) and subject(s) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research.&lt;ref name="ZenkerKumoll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke E. Lassiter (2001). "From 'Reading over the Shoulders of Natives' to 'Reading alongside Natives', Literally: Toward a Collaborative and Reciprocal Ethnography", in ''Journal of Anthropologcal Research,'' 57(2):137-149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke E. Lassiter. "Collaborative Ethnography and Public Anthropology". (2005). ''Current Anthropology,'' 46(1):83-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
{{Sociology}}
[[Sociology]] is another field which prominently features ethnographies. [[Urban sociology]], Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University), and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School,]] in particular, are associated with ethnographic research, with some well-known early examples being ''[[The Philadelphia Negro]]'' (1899) by W. E. B. Du Bois, ''[[Street Corner Society]]'' by [[William Foote Whyte]] and ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' by [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.]]. Major influences on this development were anthropologist [[Lloyd Warner]], on the Chicago sociology faculty, and to [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]]'s experience as a journalist. [[Symbolic interactionism]] developed from the same tradition and yielded such sociological ethnographies as ''Shared Fantasy'' by [[Gary Alan Fine]], which documents the early history of fantasy [[role-playing games]].  Other important ethnographies in sociology include [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work on Algeria and France.

Jaber F. Gubrium's series of organizational ethnographies focused on the everyday practices of illness, care, and recovery are notable.  They include ''Living and Dying at Murray Manor,'' which describes the social worlds of a nursing home; ''Describing Care: Image and Practice in Rehabilitation,'' which documents the social organization of patient subjectivity in a physical rehabilitation hospital; ''Caretakers: Treating Emotionally Disturbed Children,'' which features the social construction of behavioral disorders in children; and ''Oldtimers and Alzheimer's: The Descriptive Organization of Senility,'' which describes how the Alzheimer's disease movement constructed a new subjectivity of senile dementia and how that is organized in a geriatric hospital. Another approach to ethnography in sociology comes in the form of [[institutional ethnography]], developed by [[Dorothy E. Smith]] for studying the social relations which structure people's everyday lives.

Other notable ethnographies include [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]]'s ''Learning to Labour,'' on working class youth; the work of [[Elijah Anderson]], [[Mitchell Duneier]], and [[Loïc Wacquant]] on black America, and Lai Olurode's ''Glimpses of Madrasa From Africa''.  But even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods, ethnography is not the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the discipline, as it is in cultural anthropology.

=== Communication Studies ===
Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, ethnographic research methods began to be widely used by communication scholars. As the purpose of ethnography is to describe and interpret the shared and learned patterns of values, behaviors, beliefs, and language of a culture-sharing group, Harris, (1968), also Agar (1980) note that ethnography is both a process and an outcome of the research. Studies such as [[Gerry Philipsen|Gerry Philipsen's]] analysis of cultural communication strategies in a [[blue-collar]], working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, ''Speaking 'Like a Man' in Teamsterville'', paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication.

Scholars of [[communication studies]] use ethnographic research methods to analyze communicative behaviors and phenomena. This is often characterized in the writing as attempts to understand taken-for-granted routines by which working definitions are socially produced. Ethnography as a method is a storied, careful, and systematic examination of the reality-generating mechanisms of everyday life (Coulon, 1995). Ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain "how" ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities. This often gives the perception of trying to answer the "why" and "how come" questions of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, R. B., Rubin, A. M., and Piele, L. J. (2005). ''Communication Research: Strategies and Sources.'' Belmont, California: Thomson Wadworth. pp. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often this type of research results in a [[case study]] or [[field study]] such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally, or the way firemen communicate during "down time" at a fire station.  Like anthropology scholars, communication scholars often immerse themselves, and participate in and/or directly observe the particular [[social group]] being studied.&lt;ref&gt;Bentz, V. M., and Shapiro, J. J. (1998). ''Mindful Inquiry in Social Research.'' Thousand Oaks, California: Sage. pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
The American anthropologist [[George Spindler]] was a pioneer in applying the ethnographic methodology to the classroom.

Anthropologists such as [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Mary Douglas]] have used ethnographic data to answer academic questions about consumers and consumption.  In this sense, Tony Salvador, [[Genevieve Bell]], and Ken Anderson describe design ethnography as being "a way of understanding the particulars of daily life in such a way as to increase the success probability of a new product or service or, more appropriately, to reduce the probability of failure specifically due to a lack of understanding of the basic behaviors and frameworks of consumers."&lt;ref&gt;Salvador, Tony; Genevieve Bell; and Ken Anderson (1999) "Design Ethnography," ''Design Management Journal'' (pp. 35-41). p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Sam Ladner argues in her book,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethnography-Guide-Private-Sector/dp/1611323908/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396459593&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sam+ladner] ''Practical Ethnography''&lt;/ref&gt; that understanding consumers and their desires requires a shift in "standpoint," one that only ethnography provides. The results are products and services that respond to consumers' unmet needs.

Businesses, too, have found ethnographers helpful for understanding how people use products and services. Companies make increasing use of ethnographic methods to understand consumers and consumption, or for new product development (such as [[video ethnography]]). The ''Ethnographic Praxis in Industry'' (EPIC) conference is evidence of this. Ethnographers' systematic and holistic approach to real-life experience is valued by product developers, who use the method to understand unstated desires or cultural practices that surround products. Where focus groups fail to inform marketers about what people really do, ethnography links what people say to what they do—avoiding the pitfalls that come from relying only on self-reported, focus-group data. Modern developments in computing power and AI have enabled higher efficiencies in ethnographic data collection via multimedia and computational analysis using machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon A, Liu Y, Setchi R.

International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Volume 7: 28th International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology ():V007T06A007. doi:10.1115/DETC2016-59832.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating ethnography ==
The Ethnographic methodology is not usually evaluated in terms of philosophical standpoint (such as [[positivism]] and [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]]). Ethnographic studies need to be evaluated in some manner.  No consensus has been developed on evaluation standards, but Richardson (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;254)&lt;ref&gt;Richardson,L. (2000). "Evaluating ethnography," in ''Qualitative Inquiry,'' 6(2), 253-255&lt;/ref&gt;  provides five criteria that ethnographers might find helpful. Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein's (1997) monograph, ''The New Language of Qualitative Method,'' discusses forms of ethnography in terms of their "methods talk."

# ''Substantive contribution'': "Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?"
# ''Aesthetic merit'': "Does this piece succeed aesthetically?"
# ''Reflexivity'': "How did the author come to write this text…Is there adequate self-awareness and self-exposure for the reader to make judgments about the point of view?"&lt;ref&gt;For post-colonial critiques of ethnography from various locations, see essays in Prem Poddar et al, ''Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Impact'': "Does this affect me? Emotionally? Intellectually?"  Does it move me?
# ''Expresses a reality'': "Does it seem 'true'—a credible account of a cultural, social, individual, or communal sense of the 'real'?"

==Challenges of ethnography==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
Ethnography, which is a method dedicated entirely to field work, is aimed at gaining a deeper insight of a certain people's knowledge and social culture.

Ethnography's advantages are:
* It can open up certain experiences during group research that other research methods fail to cover.
* Notions that are taken for granted can be highlighted and confronted.
* It can tap into intuitive and deep human understanding of and interpretations of (by the ethnographer) the accounts of informants (those who are being studied), which goes far beyond what quantitative research can do in terms of extracting meanings.
* Ethnography allows people outside of a culture (whether of a primitive tribe or of a corporation's employees) to learn about its members' practices, motives, understandings, and values.

However, there are certain challenges or limitations for the ethnographic method: 
* Deep expertise is required: Ethnographers must accumulate knowledge about the methods and domains of interest, which can take considerable training and time.
* Sensitivity: The ethnographer is an outsider and must exercise discretion and caution to avoid offending, alienating or harming those being observed.
* Access: Negotiating access to field sites and participants can be time-consuming and difficult. Secretive or guarded organizations may require different approaches in order for researchers to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Monahan |first=Torin, Fisher, Jill A. | year = 2014 | title = Strategies for Obtaining Access to Secretive or Guarded Organizations | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | doi=10.1177/0891241614549834|pmc=4679148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Duration and cost: Research can involve prolonged time in the field, particularly because building trust with participants is usually necessary for obtaining rich data.
* Bias: Ethnographers bring their own experience to bear in pursuing questions to ask and reviewing data, which can lead to biases in directions of inquiry and analysis.
* Descriptive approach:  Ethnography relies heavily on storytelling and the presentation of critical incidents, which is inevitably selective and viewed as a weakness by those used to the scientific approaches of hypothesis testing, quantification and replication.

Among the dangers of ethnography are that it can become indistinguishable from a kind of [[embedded journalism]] or [[blog]] with academic jargon giving it the veneer of academic legitimacy but without actually meeting the classic requirements for ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, B. (2013).  "Post-Cold War Anthropology as  Ideological Blog:  Purging Klukhohn and Mead for a Diary Read",  ''Journal of Developing Societies'', Spring, Volume 29, No. 1, 61-87.  &lt;/ref&gt;  A series of tests can be applied to determine whether work is actually ethnography or academic journalism depending on the focus of the study (an "ethnos"), the scientific hypotheses and questions, whether there is model building, whether there are cross-cultural comparisons, and the purpose, uses and forms of the work.

==Ethics==
[[Gary Alan Fine]] argues that the nature of ethnographic inquiry demands that researchers deviate from formal and idealistic rules or ethics that have come to be widely accepted in qualitative and quantitative approaches in research. Many of these ethical assumptions are rooted in positivist and post-positivist [[epistemology|epistemologies]] that have adapted over time but are apparent and must be accounted for in all research paradigms. These ethical dilemmas are evident throughout the entire process of conducting ethnographies, including the design, implementation, and reporting of an ethnographic study. Essentially, Fine maintains that researchers are typically not as ethical as they claim or assume to be — and that "each job includes ways of doing things that would be inappropriate for others to know".&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine is not necessarily casting blame at ethnographic researchers but tries to show that researchers often make idealized ethical claims and standards which in are inherently based on partial truths and self-deceptions. Fine also acknowledges that many of these partial truths and self-deceptions are unavoidable. He maintains that "illusions" are essential to maintain an occupational reputation and avoid potentially more caustic consequences. He claims, "Ethnographers cannot help but lie, but in lying, we reveal truths that escape those who are not so bold".&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these assertions, Fine establishes three conceptual clusters in which ethnographic ethical dilemmas can be situated: "Classic Virtues", "Technical Skills", and "Ethnographic Self".

Much debate surrounding the issue of ethics arose following revelations about how the ethnographer [[Napoleon Chagnon]] conducted his ethnographic fieldwork with the [[Yanomani]] people of South America.

While there is no international standard on Ethnographic Ethics, many western anthropologists look to the American Anthropological Association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work.&lt;ref&gt;''American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics'' http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/AAA-Ethics-Code-2009.pdf, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Association adopted a code of ethics, stating: Anthropologists have "moral obligations as members of other groups, such as the family, religion, and community, as well as the profession".&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The code of ethics notes that anthropologists are part of a wider scholarly and political network, as well as human and natural environment, which needs to be reported on respectfully.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"/&gt; The code of ethics recognizes that sometimes very close and personal relationship can sometimes develop from doing ethnographic work.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"/&gt; The Association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary, and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight-page code of ethics outlines ethical considerations for those conducting Research, Teaching, Application and Dissemination of Results, which are briefly outlined below.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Conducting Research" - When conducting research Anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.2-3"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;  If the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.2-3"/&gt;
* "Teaching" - When teaching the discipline of anthropology, instructors are required to inform students of the ethical dilemmas of conducting ethnographies and field work.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Application" - When conducting an ethnography, Anthropologists must be "open with funders, colleagues, persons studied or providing information, and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support for the work."&lt;ref name="Ethics p.5"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Dissemination of Results" - When disseminating results of an ethnography, "[a]nthropologists have an ethical obligation to consider the potential impact of both their research and the communication or dissemination of the results of their research on all directly or indirectly involved."&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.5"/&gt;

===Classic virtues===
* "The kindly ethnographer" – Most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are, which aids in the research process, but is also deceptive. The identity that we present to subjects is different from who we are in other circumstances.
* "The friendly ethnographer" – Ethnographers operate under the assumption that they should not dislike anyone. When ethnographers find they intensely dislike individuals encountered in the research, they may crop them out of the findings.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;Fine, p. 270-77&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The honest ethnographer" – If research participants know the research goals, their responses will likely be skewed. Therefore, ethnographers often conceal what they know in order to increase the likelihood of acceptance by participants.&lt;ref name="Fine" /&gt;

===Technical skills===
* "The Precise Ethnographer" – Ethnographers often create the illusion that field notes are data and reflect what "really" happened. They engage in the opposite of plagiarism, giving undeserved credit through loose interpretations and paraphrasing. Researchers take near-fictions and turn them into claims of fact. The closest ethnographers can ever really get to reality is an approximate truth.
* "The Observant Ethnographer" – Readers of ethnography are often led to assume the report of a scene is complete – that little of importance was missed. In reality, an ethnographer will always miss some aspect because of lacking omniscience. Everything is open to multiple interpretations and misunderstandings. As ethnographers' skills in observation and collection of data vary by individual, what is depicted in ethnography can never be the whole picture.
* "The Unobtrusive Ethnographer" – As a "participant" in the scene, the researcher will always have an effect on the communication that occurs within the research site. The degree to which one is an "active member" affects the extent to which sympathetic understanding is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 277-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnographic Self===
The following are commonly misconceived conceptions of ethnographers:

* "The Candid Ethnographer" – Where the researcher personally situates within the ethnography is ethically problematic. There is an illusion that everything reported was observed by the researcher.
* "The Chaste Ethnographer" – When ethnographers participate within the field, they invariably develop relationships with research subjects/participants. These relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography, although they may influence the research findings.
* "The Fair Ethnographer" – Fine claims that objectivity is an illusion and that everything in ethnography is known from a perspective. Therefore, it is unethical for a researcher to report fairness in findings.
* "The Literary Ethnographer" – Representation is a balancing act of determining what to "show" through poetic/prosaic language and style, versus what to "tell" via straightforward, 'factual' reporting. The individual skills of an ethnographer influence what appears to be the value of the research.&lt;ref name="Fine, p. 282-89"&gt;Fine, p. 282-89&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Norman K. Denzin, ethnographers should consider the following eight principles when observing, recording, and sampling data:

# The groups should combine symbolic meanings with patterns of interaction.
# Observe the world from the point of view of the subject, while maintaining the distinction between everyday and scientific perceptions of reality.
# Link the group's symbols and their meanings with the social relationships.
# Record all behavior.
# The methodology should highlight phases of process, change, and stability.
# The act should be a type of symbolic interactionism.
# Use concepts that would avoid casual explanations.

[[File:European Environment Agency Building in Copenhagen at winter.jpg|thumb|European Environment Agency Building in Copenhagen in winter]]
The '''European Environment Agency''' ('''EEA''') is the [[agency of the European Union]] (EU) which provides independent information on the environment.

==Definition==
The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the [[agency of the European Union]] (EU) which provides independent information on the environment. 
Its goal is to help those involved in developing, implementing and evaluating [[environmental policy]], and to inform the general public.

==Organization==
The EEA was established by the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) Regulation 1210/1990 (amended by EEC Regulation 933/1999 and EC Regulation 401/2009) and became operational in 1994,  headquartered in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

The agency is governed by a management board composed of representatives of the governments of its 33 member states, a [[European Commission]] representative and two scientists appointed by the [[European Parliament]], assisted by a committee of scientists.
The current Executive Director of the agency is Professor [[Hans Bruyninckx]], who has been appointed for a five-year term. He is the successor of Professor [[Jacqueline McGlade]].

==Member countries==
The [[Member states of the European Union|member states]] of the union are members; however other states may become members of it by means of agreements concluded between them and the EU.

It was the first EU body to open its membership to the 13 candidate countries (pre-[[enlargement of the EU|2004 enlargement]]).

The EEA has 33 member countries and six cooperating countries. The 33 member countries include the 28 EU Member States together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.

The six Balkans countries are cooperating countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo under the UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99. These cooperation activities are integrated into Eionet and are supported by the EU under the "Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance".

The EEA is an active member of the [[EPA Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://epanet.ew.eea.europa.eu/ European Network of the Heads of Environment Protection Agencies.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 33 member countries include the 28 [[European Union member state]]s together with [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Turkey]]. The six [[Western Balkans|Western Balkan]] countries are cooperating countries: [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]] as well as [[Kosovo]] under the [[UN Security Council]] Resolution 1244/99.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/countries-and-eionet Countries and Eionet], European Environment Agency, Retrieved on 24 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reports ==
The European Environment Agency (EEA) reported in 2017 that climate-related extreme events accounted ca €400 billion ($430 billion) of economic losses in EEA area from 1980 to 2013, and were responsible for 85,000 deaths during 1980-2013.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Chestney [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-climatechange-idUSKBN15912K South, southeast face Europe's most adverse climate change impact: agency]  Reuters, January 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==European environment information and observation network==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}} 
{{unreferenced section |date=July 2018}} 
The European environment information and observation network (Eionet) is a partnership network of the EEA and the countries. The EEA is responsible for developing the network and coordinating its activities. To do so, the EEA works closely together with national focal points (NFP´s), typically national environment agencies or environment ministries which are responsible for coordinating national networksof the National Reference Centres (NRCs) involving many institutions (about 350 in all).

Apart from the NFPs and NRCs, Eionet covers six European Topic Centres (ETCs) in the areas of air and climate change, biological diversity, climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation, water, land use and spatial information and analysis and [[sustainable consumption]] and production.

==Annual discharge process==
In February 2012, the [[European Parliament]]'s Committee on Budgetary Control published a draft report, identifying areas of concern in the use of funds and its influence for the 2010 budget such as a 26%  budget increase  from 2009 to 2010 to €50 600 000.&lt;ref name= budg&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120215ATT38159/20120215ATT38159EN.pdf Draft Report on discharge on the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2010] 14 pages, 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} and questioned that maximum competition and value-for-money principles were honored in hiring, also possible fictitious employees.&lt;ref name= budg/&gt;{{rp|10}}

The '''European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology''' ('''ESST''') is an association of [[universities]] who jointly teach and research in the field of social, scientific and technological developments. Universities from across Europe are members of the association, which was founded in 1991 and is registered as a non-profit organisation in Belgium.

== Activities and ethos ==
ESST runs a programme of teaching and research devoted to [[science and technology studies]], in both historical and contemporary perspectives. The ESST programme has affiliated faculty with strong interests in the intersections of science and technology with public policy, cultural change, and economic development.  The activities of ESST are financed both by the member universities and by external sources,which have included DG XII, DG XXII and the General Secretariat of the [[European Commission]]. From 2004 to 2009 ESST was responsible for the co-ordination of Masters-level teaching activities within the EU's [http://www.prime-noe.org/ PRIME] 'network of excellence' in policy studies of research and innovation.

The ESST programme is international in its outlook: it is a multicultural venture rooted in the teaching, research and scientific cultures of many European regions and countries, and in their wider social experience. The universities have developed a networked postgraduate programme focusing on the social, scientific and technological developments in Europe, which they teach in collaboration with each other. This involves substantial exchange of students and staff from the participating universities.

== ESST Masters degree ==
The ESST association offers a master's degree in "Society, Science and Technology in Europe", aims to develop informational resources, analytical skills and conceptual frameworks for researchers and students in technological change and innovation. The course is designed to provide post-graduate training for academics of all backgrounds: social science, natural sciences, engineering and humanities.

The Masters course is based on active participation by people from industry and engineering, policy-makers and academia from all over Europe. The approach is inter-disciplinary, based on recent results from research at the frontiers of modern studies of science/technology and economy/society. The course aims to relate such research to the social and economic analysis of innovation, to strategic decision-making and management of sciences and (new) technologies, to ethical issues in sciences and technology, and to political and cultural analysis of modern science- and technology-based societies.

The original ESST Master's degree was a one-year course, and this can still be taken by students who start at Oslo or Maastricht University. At other universities the ESST programme is a 'track' embedded in a two-year masters programme. At most ESST universities students receive both a local Masters award and the ESST MA Diploma.

All ESST universities that offer the first semester teach a common curriculum (with some local additions) in this semester, after which students choose a second-semester specialisation from the range on offer at the different universities within ESST. Students have the option either to move between universities (and countries) after the first semester or to stay at one university for both semesters; [[Erasmus Programme]] agreements are in place to assist students who move between countries. All second-semester specialisations are taught in English. The Masters thesis is supervised by an advisor at the second-semester university (supplemented by a 'home' advisor where appropriate) and the thesis is graded by staff from two ESST universities, one of whom is always from the first-semester university.

Starting in 2012-13, students who successfully complete course modules that cover the common first-semester ESST curriculum, but who do not go on to take (or complete) a second-semester ESST specialisation and write a thesis under ESST rules, will receive an ESST Certificate in addition to their local award.

== Undergraduate essay award ==
Since 2010, ESST has awarded an annual prize (currently worth €1000) for the best undergraduate essay submitted to ESST with content relevant to the broad field of society, science and technology. Previous winners include André Feldhof (Netherlands), Miklós Horváth (Hungary), Alina Marktanner (Netherlands), and Frederick Thielen (Netherlands). More information on the ESST Award can be found at the [http://esst.eu/ ESST website].

{{For|a comparison of fairy tale with other kinds of stories, such as myths, legends and fable|Traditional story}}

[[File:Däumling.jpg|thumb|alt= Illustration of the fairy tale character, Tom Thumb, on a hillside, next to a giant's foot.|1865 illustration of [[Hop-o'-My-Thumb]] and the [[ogre]]]]
A '''fairy tale''', '''wonder tale''', '''magic tale''', or '''''Märchen''''' is a [[folklore genre]] that takes the form of a [[short story]]. Such stories typically feature entities such as [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]], [[dragons]], [[Elf|elves]], [[Fairy|fairies]], [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], [[gnome]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[griffins]], [[mermaid]]s, [[talking animals]], [[troll]]s, [[unicorn]]s, or [[witchcraft|witches]], and usually [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[incantation|enchantments]]. Fairy tales may be distinguished{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} from other folk narratives such as [[legend]]s (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Stith. ''Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology &amp; Legend'', 1972 s.v. "Fairy Tale"&lt;/ref&gt; and explicit moral tales, including beast [[fable]]s. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to [[children's literature]].

In less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in "fairy-tale ending" (a [[happy ending]])&lt;ref&gt;http://w.com/dictionary/fairy%2{{Dead link|date= October 2018 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "fairy-tale [[romance (love)|romance]]". Colloquially, the term "fairy tale" or "fairy story" can also mean any far-fetched story or [[tall tale]]; it is used especially of any story that not only is not true, but could not possibly be true. Legends are perceived{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} as real; fairy tales may merge into [[legend]]s, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike [[legend]]s and [[Epic poems|epics]], fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial references to [[religion]] and to actual places, people, and events; they take place "[[once upon a time]]" rather than in actual times.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form; the name "fairy tale" was first ascribed to them by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] in the late 17th century. Many of today's fairy tales have evolved from centuries-old stories that have appeared, with variations, in multiple cultures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Richard. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6142964/Fairy-tales-have-ancient-origin.html "Fairy tales have ancient origin"]. ''The Telegraph'' 5 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because only the literary forms can survive. Still, according to researchers at universities in [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa|Lisbon]], such stories may date back thousands of years, some to the Bronze Age more than 6,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= BBC|title= Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35358487|website= BBC News|publisher =BBC|accessdate= 20 January 2016|date= 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today.

Folklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. The [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]] and the morphological analysis of [[Vladimir Propp]] are among the most notable. Other folklorists have interpreted the tales' significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales.

==Terminology==

Some [[folkloristics|folklorists]] prefer to use the [[German language|German]] term ''Märchen'' or "wonder tale"&lt;ref name=companion/&gt; to refer to the genre over ''fairy tale'', a practice given weight by the definition of Thompson in his 1977 [1946] edition of ''The Folktale'': "a tale of some length involving a succession of [[motif (literature)|motifs]] or episodes. It moves in an unreal world without definite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the marvellous. In this never-never land, humble [[hero]]es kill adversaries, succeed to kingdoms and marry princesses."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stith Thompson]], ''The Folktale'', 1977 (Thompson: 8).&lt;/ref&gt; The characters and motifs of fairy tales are simple and archetypal: princesses and goose-girls; [[youngest son]]s and gallant [[prince]]s; [[ogre]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[dragon]]s, and [[troll]]s; [[wicked stepmother]]s and [[false hero]]es; [[fairy godmother]]s and other [[donor (fairy tale)|magical helpers]], often [[talking animal|talking horses, or foxes, or birds]]; glass mountains; and prohibitions and breaking of prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fairy tale with a tragic rather than a [[happy ending|happy end]] is called an [[anti-fairy tale]].

==Definition==

[[File: Straparola's The Crucifix Comes To Life.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A painting from the fairy tale "The Facetious Nights of Straparola", showing people observing as a person jumps inside a building.|From ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' by [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]]]]

Although the fairy tale is a distinct genre within the larger category of folktale, the definition that marks a work as a fairy tale is a source of considerable dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/introduction/ftdefinition.html What Is a Fairy Tale?]"&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself comes from the translation of Madame D'Aulnoy's ''Conte de fées'', first used in her collection in 1697.)&lt;ref name=Windling1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forconte.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140328002739/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forconte.html | archivedate = 2014-03-28 | title = Les Contes de Fées: The Literary Fairy Tales of France | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common parlance conflates fairy tales with [[beast fable]]s and other folktales, and scholars differ on the degree to which the presence of fairies and/or similarly mythical beings (e.g., elves, goblins, trolls, giants, huge monsters) should be taken as a differentiator. [[Vladimir Propp]], in his ''Morphology of the Folktale'', criticized the common distinction between "fairy tales" and "animal tales" on the grounds that many tales contained both [[fantasy|fantastic]] elements and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, to select works for his analysis, Propp used all [[Russian folklore|Russian folktales]] classified as a folklore [[Antti Aarne|Aarne-Thompson]] 300-749&amp;nbsp;– in a cataloguing system that made such a distinction&amp;nbsp;– to gain a clear set of tales.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; His own analysis identified fairy tales by their [[plot (narrative)|plot]] elements, but that in itself has been criticized, as the analysis does not lend itself easily to tales that do not involve a [[quest]], and furthermore, the same plot elements are found in non-fairy tale works.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Were I asked, what is a fairytale? I should reply, Read [[Undine (novella)|Undine]]: that is a fairytale ... of all fairytales I know, I think Undine the most beautiful. |author=[[George MacDonald]], ''The Fantastic Imagination''}}

As [[Stith Thompson]] points out, talking animals and the presence of [[magic (fantasy)|magic]] seem to be more common to the fairy tale than fairies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p. 55, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mere presence of animals that talk does not make a tale a fairy tale, especially when the animal is clearly a mask on a human face, as in [[fable]]s.&lt;ref name=Tolkien15&gt;Tolkien, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", [[J.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Tolkien]] agreed with the exclusion of "fairies" from the definition, defining fairy tales as stories about the adventures of men in ''[[Álfheimr|Faërie]]'', the land of fairies, fairytale [[prince]]s and [[princess]]es, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], elves, and not only other magical species but many other marvels.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same essay excludes tales that are often considered fairy tales, citing as an example ''[[The Heart of a Monkey|The Monkey's Heart]]'', which [[Andrew Lang]] included in ''[[The Lilac Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref name=Tolkien15 /&gt;

Steven Swann Jones identified the presence of magic as the feature by which fairy tales can be distinguished from other sorts of folktales.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of the Imagination''. Routledge, 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson and Chaudri identify "transformation" as the key feature of the genre.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;''A companion to the fairy tale''. By Hilda Ellis Davidson, Anna Chaudhri. Boydell &amp; Brewer 2006. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; From a psychological point of view, [[Jean Chiriac]] argued for the necessity of the [[fantastic]] in these narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/fairy_tales.html |title=Psychoanalysis and Fairy-Tales |publisher=Freudfile.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of aesthetic values, [[Italo Calvino]] cited the fairy tale as a prime example of "quickness" in literature, because of the economy and concision of the tales.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Six Memos for the Next Millennium'', pp. 36–37. {{ISBN|0674810406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the genre===

[[File:Perrault1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A picture by Gustave Doré showing Mother Goose, an old woman, reading written (literary) fairy tales to children|A picture by [[Gustave Doré]] of [[Mother Goose]] reading written (literary) fairy tales]]

Originally, stories that would contemporarily be considered fairy tales were not marked out as a separate genre. The German term "Märchen" stems from the old German word "Mär", which means story or tale. The word "Märchen" is the [[diminutive]] of the word "Mär", therefore it means a "little story". Together with the common beginning "[[once upon a time]]" it means a fairy tale or a märchen was originally a little story from a long time ago when the world was still magic. (Indeed, one less regular German [[once upon a time|opening]] is "In the old times when wishing was still effective".)

The English term "fairy tale" stems from the fact that the French ''contes'' often included fairies.

Roots of the genre come from different oral stories passed down in European cultures. The genre was first marked out by writers of the [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]], such as [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]], and stabilized through the works of later collectors such as [[Charles Perrault]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; In this evolution, the name was coined when the ''[[précieuses]]'' took up writing literary stories; [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] invented the term ''Conte de fée'', or fairy tale, in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 858.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the definition of the genre of [[fantasy]], many works that would now be classified as fantasy were termed "fairy tales", including Tolkien's ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', p. 83, {{ISBN|0253356652}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Tolkien's "On Fairy-Stories" includes discussions of [[world-building]] and is considered a vital part of fantasy criticism. Although fantasy, particularly the subgenre of [[fairytale fantasy]], draws heavily on fairy tale motifs,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt; the genres are now regarded as distinct.

===Folk and literary===

The fairy tale, told orally, is a sub-class of the [[folklore|folktale]]. Many writers have written in the form of the fairy tale. These are the literary fairy tales, or ''Kunstmärchen''.&lt;ref name="Windling1"/&gt; The oldest forms, from ''[[Panchatantra]]'' to the ''[[Pentamerone]]'', show considerable reworking from the oral form.&lt;ref name=" Swann Jones, p. 35"&gt;Swann Jones, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brothers Grimm]] were among the first to try to preserve the features of oral tales. Yet the stories printed under the Grimm name have been considerably reworked to fit the written form.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in Matthew's American Literature'', p. 5, {{ISBN|0253356652}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary fairy tales and oral fairy tales freely exchanged plots, motifs, and elements with one another and with the tales of foreign lands.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The literary fairy tale came into fashion during the 17th century, developed by aristocratic women as a parlour game. This, in turn, helped to maintain the oral tradition. According to [[Jack Zipes]], "The subject matter of the conversations consisted of literature, mores, taste, and etiquette, whereby the speakers all endeavoured to portray ideal situations in the most effective oratorical style that would gradually have a major effect on literary forms."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fairy tale as myth/myth as fairy tale|last=Zipes|first=Jack|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many 18th-century folklorists attempted to recover the "pure" folktale, uncontaminated by literary versions. Yet while oral fairy tales likely existed for thousands of years before the literary forms, there is no pure folktale, and each literary fairy tale draws on folk traditions, if only in parody.&lt;ref name=" Zipes, p. 846"&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it impossible to trace forms of transmission of a fairy tale. Oral story-tellers have been known to read literary fairy tales to increase their own stock of stories and treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Redsun.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Illustration of the Russian fairy tale about Vasilisa the Beautiful, showing a rider on a horse in a forest|[[Ivan Bilibin]]'s illustration of the Russian fairy tale about [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]]]

The [[oral tradition]] of the fairy tale came long before the written page. Tales were told or enacted dramatically, rather than written down, and handed down from generation to generation. Because of this, the history of their development is necessarily obscure and blurred. Fairy tales appear, now and again, in written literature throughout literate cultures, as in ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', which includes ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]'' ([[Ancient Rome|Roman]], 100–200 AD),&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/introduction/timeline.html "Fairy Tale Timeline"]&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' ([[Folklore of India|India]] 3rd century BC),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; but it is unknown to what extent these reflect the actual folk tales even of their own time. The stylistic evidence indicates that these, and many later collections, reworked folk tales into literary forms.&lt;ref name=" Swann Jones, p. 35"/&gt; What they do show is that the fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' collection of magical tales (compiled ''circa'' 1500 AD),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; such as ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]'', and ''[[Bel and the Dragon]]''. Besides such collections and individual tales, in [[Chinese folklore|China]], [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophers such as [[Liezi]] and [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] recounted fairy tales in their philosophical works.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Moss Roberts, "Introduction", p. xviii, ''Chinese Fairy Tales &amp; Fantasies''. {{ISBN|0394739949}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader definition of the genre, the first famous Western fairy tales are those of [[Aesop]] (6th century BC) in [[ancient Greece]].

Jack Zipes writes in ''When Dreams Came True'', "There are fairy tale elements in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', and&amp;nbsp;... in many of [[William Shakespeare]] plays."&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[King Lear]]'' can be considered a literary variant of fairy tales such as ''[[Water and Salt]]'' and ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Soula Mitakidou and Anthony L. Manna, with Melpomene Kanatsouli, ''Folktales from Greece: A Treasury of Delights'', p. 100, Libraries Unlimited, Greenwood Village CO, 2002, {{ISBN|1563089084}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tale itself resurfaced in [[Western literature]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, with ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' by [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] (Italy, 1550 and 1553),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; which contains many fairy tales in its inset tales, and the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] tales of [[Giambattista Basile]] (Naples, 1634–36),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; which are all fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Gozzi]] made use of many fairy tale motifs among his [[Commedia dell'Arte]] scenarios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forital.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140210083152/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forital.html | archivedate = 2014-02-10 | title = White as Ricotta, Red as Wine: The Magic Lore of Italy | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including among them one based on ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love For Three Oranges]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, [[Pu Songling]], in China, included many fairy tales in his collection, ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' (published posthumously, 1766).&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt; The fairy tale itself became popular among the ''[[précieuses]]'' of upper-class [[Early Modern France|France]] (1690–1710),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; and among the tales told in that time were the ones of [[La Fontaine]] and the ''Contes'' of [[Charles Perrault]] (1697), who fixed the forms of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Straparola's, Basile's and Perrault's collections contain the oldest known forms of various fairy tales, on the stylistic evidence, all the writers rewrote the tales for literary effect.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Salon Era===

In the mid-17th century, a vogue for magical tales emerged among the intellectuals who frequented the [[salon (gathering)|salons]] of Paris. These salons were regular gatherings hosted by prominent aristocratic women, where women and men could gather together to discuss the issues of the day.

In the 1630s, aristocratic women began to gather in their own living rooms, salons, in order to discuss the topics of their choice: arts and letters, politics, and social matters of immediate concern to the women of their class: marriage, love, financial and physical independence, and access to education. This was a time when women were barred from receiving a formal education. Some of the most gifted women writers of the period came out of these early salons (such as [[Madeleine de Scudéry]] and [[Madame de Lafayette]]), which encouraged women's independence and pushed against the gender barriers that defined their lives. The [[salonnières]] argued particularly for love and intellectual compatibility between the sexes, opposing the system of arranged marriages.

Sometime in the middle of the 17th century, a passion for the conversational [[parlour game]] based on the plots of old [[Folklore|folk tales]] swept through the salons. Each [[salonnière]] was called upon to retell an old tale or rework an old theme, spinning clever new stories that not only showcased verbal agility and imagination but also slyly commented on the conditions of aristocratic life. Great emphasis was placed on a mode of delivery that seemed natural and spontaneous. The decorative language of the fairy tales served an important function: disguising the rebellious subtext of the stories and sliding them past the court censors. Critiques of court life (and even of the king) were embedded in extravagant tales and in dark, sharply dystopian ones. Not surprisingly, the tales by women often featured young (but clever) aristocratic girls whose lives were controlled by the arbitrary whims of fathers, kings, and elderly wicked fairies, as well as tales in which groups of wise fairies (i.e., intelligent, independent women) stepped in and put all to rights.

The [[salon (gathering)|salon]] tales as they were originally written and published have been preserved in a monumental work called ''[[Le Cabinet des Fées]]'', an enormous collection of stories from the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=Windling1 /&gt;

===Later works===
[[File:The violet fairy book (1906) (14751020284).jpg|thumb|The violet fairy book (1906)]]
The first collectors to attempt to preserve not only the plot and characters of the tale, but also the style in which they were told, was the [[Brothers Grimm]], collecting German fairy tales; ironically, this meant although their first edition (1812 &amp; 1815)&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; remains a treasure for folklorists, they rewrote the tales in later editions to make them more acceptable, which ensured their sales and the later popularity of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such literary forms did not merely draw from the folktale, but also influenced folktales in turn. The Brothers Grimm rejected several tales for their collection, though told orally to them by Germans, because the tales derived from Perrault, and they concluded they were thereby [[French folklore|French]] and not German tales; an oral version of ''[[Bluebeard]]'' was thus rejected, and the tale of ''Little Briar Rose'', clearly related to Perrault's ''[[Sleeping Beauty|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', was included only because Jacob Grimm convinced his brother that the figure of [[Brynhildr]], from much earlier [[Norse mythology]], proved that the sleeping princess was authentically [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ronald Murphy, ''The Owl, The Raven, and the Dove: The Religious Meaning of the Grimms' Magic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0195151690}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This consideration of whether to keep ''Sleeping Beauty'' reflected a belief common among folklorists of the 19th century: that the folk tradition preserved fairy tales in forms from pre-history except when "contaminated" by such literary forms, leading people to tell inauthentic tales.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The rural, illiterate, and uneducated peasants, if suitably isolated, were the ''folk'' and would tell pure ''folk'' tales.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they regarded fairy tales as a form of fossil, the remnants of a once-perfect tale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie]], ''The Classic Fairy Tales'' p. 17. {{ISBN|978-0192115591}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, further research has concluded that fairy tales never had a fixed form, and regardless of literary influence, the tellers constantly altered them for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], p. 22, ''Touch Magic''. {{ISBN|0874835917}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of [[romantic nationalism]], that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the [[Russia]]n [[Alexander Afanasyev]] (first published in 1866),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; the [[Norway|Norwegians]] [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] (first published in 1845),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; the Romanian [[Petre Ispirescu]] (first published in 1874), the [[England|English]] [[Joseph Jacobs]] (first published in 1890),&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; and [[Jeremiah Curtin]], an American who collected [[Ireland|Irish]] tales (first published in 1890).&lt;ref name=" Zipes, p. 846"/&gt; Ethnographers collected fairy tales throughout the world, finding similar tales in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], and [[Australia]]; [[Andrew Lang]] was able to draw on not only the written tales of Europe and Asia, but those collected by ethnographers, to fill his [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|"coloured" fairy books series]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Brown Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/brown.htm "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; They also encouraged other collectors of fairy tales, as when [[Yei Theodora Ozaki]] created a collection, ''Japanese Fairy Tales'' (1908), after encouragement from Lang.&lt;ref&gt;Yei Theodora Ozaki, ''Japanese Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/books/japan/freemanmitford/preface.html "Preface"]&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, writers such as [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[George MacDonald]] continued the tradition of literary fairy tales. Andersen's work sometimes drew on old folktales, but more often deployed fairytale motifs and plots in new tales.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Hans Christian Andersen", pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald incorporated fairytale motifs both in new literary fairy tales, such as ''[[The Light Princess]]'', and in works of the genre that would become [[fantasy]], as in ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' or ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "George MacDonald", p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural transmission==

Two theories of origins, have attempted to explain the common elements in fairy tales found spread over continents. One is that a single point of origin generated any given tale, which then spread over the centuries; the other is that such fairy tales stem from common human experience and therefore can appear separately in many different origins.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales with very similar plots, characters, and motifs are found spread across many different cultures. Many researchers hold this to be caused by the spread of such tales, as people repeat tales they have heard in foreign lands, although the oral nature makes it impossible to trace the route except by inference.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 845.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorists have attempted to determine the origin by internal evidence, which can not always be clear; [[Joseph Jacobs]], comparing the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] tale ''[[The Ridere of Riddles]]'' with the version collected by the Brothers Grimm, ''[[The Riddle (fairy tale)|The Riddle]]'', noted that in ''The Ridere of Riddles'' one hero ends up [[polygamy|polygamously]] married, which might point to an ancient custom, but in ''The Riddle'', the simpler riddle might argue greater antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''More Celtic Fairy Tales''. London: David Nutt, 1894, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreceltic/ridere.html Notes and References]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorists of the "Finnish" (or historical-geographical) school attempted to place fairy tales to their origin, with inconclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes influence, especially within a limited area and time, is clearer, as when considering the influence of Perrault's tales on those collected by the Brothers Grimm. ''Little Briar-Rose'' appears to stem from Perrault's ''The [[Sleeping Beauty]]'', as the Grimms' tale appears to be the only independent German variant.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 962.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the close agreement between the opening of the Grimms' version of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' and Perrault's tale points to an influence, although the Grimms' version adds a different ending (perhaps derived from ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Velten, pp. 966–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted because it contradicts what is in the Cinderella article (see "Chinese or Egyptian origin for Cinderella?" in talk page): "Occasionally, internal evidence points towards one source; not only is [[Duan Chengshi]]'s ''[[Ye Xian]]'' the oldest known variant of ''Cinderella'', but the value the tale places on small feet points to its being the origin of the others, reflecting the importance of tiny feet (causing the practice of [[footbinding]]) in Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Terri Windling, [http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forashs.html "Cinderella: Ashes, Blood, and the Slipper of Glass"]&lt;/ref&gt;"--&gt;

Fairy tales tend to take on the color of their location, through the choice of motifs, the style in which they are told, and the depiction of character and local color.&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers Grimm believed that European fairy tales derived from the cultural history shared by all [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples and were therefore ancient, far older than written records. This view is supported by research by the [[anthropologist]] Jamie Tehrani and the folklorist Sara Graca Da Silva using [[cladistics|phylogenetic analysis]], a technique developed by [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] to trace the relatedness of living and fossil [[species]]. Among the tales analysed were ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', traced to the time of splitting of Eastern and Western Indo-European, over 5000 years ago. Both ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'' appear to have been created some 4000 years ago. The story of ''The Smith and the Devil'' ([[Deal with the Devil]]) appears to date from the [[Bronze Age]], some 6000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35358487|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=20 January 2016|date=20 January 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with children==

[[File:Cutlery for children detail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Spoons for children;engraved on them are fairy tale scenes from "Snow White", "Little Red Riding Hood", and "Hansel and Gretel".|Cutlery for children. Detail showing fairy-tale scenes: [[Snow White]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], [[Hansel and Gretel]].]]

Originally, adults were the audience of a fairy tale just as often as children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary fairy tales appeared in works intended for adults, but in the 19th and 20th centuries the fairy tale became associated with [[children's literature]].

The ''[[précieuses]]'', including [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], intended their works for adults, but regarded their source as the tales that servants, or other women of lower class, would tell to children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Seifert]], "The Marvelous in Context: The Place of the ''Contes de Fées'' in Late Seventeenth Century France", Jack Zipes, ed., ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 913.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a novel of that time, depicting a countess's suitor offering to tell such a tale, has the countess exclaim that she loves fairy tales as if she were still a child.&lt;ref&gt;Seifert, p. 915.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the late ''précieuses'', [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] redacted a version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' for children, and it is her tale that is best known today.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brothers Grimm titled their collection ''[[Children's and Household Tales]]'' and rewrote their tales after complaints that they were not suitable for children.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, fairy tales were altered so that they could be read to children. The Brothers Grimm concentrated mostly on sexual references;&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapunzel]], in the first edition, revealed the prince's visits by asking why her clothing had grown tight, thus letting the witch deduce that she was pregnant, but in subsequent editions carelessly revealed that it was easier to pull up the prince than the witch.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in many respects, violence{{nsmdns}}particularly when punishing villains{{nsmdns}}was increased.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, pp. xlii–xliv.&lt;/ref&gt; Other, later, revisions cut out violence; J.{{nbsp}}R.{{nbsp}}R.{{nbsp}}Tolkien noted that ''[[The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)|The Juniper Tree]]'' often had its [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] stew cut out in a version intended for children.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The moralizing strain in the [[Victorian era]] altered the classical tales to teach lessons, as when [[George Cruikshank]] rewrote ''Cinderella'' in 1854 to contain [[temperance movement|temperance]] themes. His acquaintance [[Charles Dickens]] protested, "In an utilitarian age, of all other times, it is a matter of grave importance that fairy tales should be respected."&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pp. 181–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva239.html |title=A Transcription of Charles Dickens's "Frauds on the Fairies" (1 October 1853) |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalysts]] such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]], who regarded the cruelty of older fairy tales as indicative of psychological conflicts, strongly criticized this expurgation, because it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48, {{ISBN|0312293801}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairy tales do teach children how to deal with difficult times. To quote Rebecca Walters (2017, p.&amp;nbsp;56) “Fairytales and folktales are part of the cultural conserve that can be used to address children’s fears …. and give them some role training in an approach that honors the children’s window of tolerance”. These fairy tales teach children how to deal with certain social situations and helps them to find their place in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=Rebecca|date=2017-04-01|title=Fairytales, psychodrama and action methods: ways of helping traumatized children to heal|journal=Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=53–60|doi=10.1007/s11620-017-0381-1|issn=1619-5507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy tales teach children other important lessons too. For example, Tsitsani et al. carried out a study on children to determine the benefits of fairy tales. Parents of the children who took part in the study found that fairy tales, especially the color in them, triggered their child's imagination as the read them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsitsani|first=P.|last2=Psyllidou|first2=S.|last3=Batzios|first3=S.

"An Introduction to the Psychology of Fairytales". Zurich, New York 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; based on Jung‘s view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul, which can only express what soul is.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung: The Phenomoneology of the Sprit in Fairytales (1948). In: Collected Works, Vol. 9,I, Princeton/Bollingen 1980, par. 432&lt;/ref&gt; That means, she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul. They are the “purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes” and “they represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest and most concise form” because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends. “In this pure form, the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche”. “The fairy tale itself is its own best explanation; that is, its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story. [...] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these”. “I have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavour to describe one and the same psychic fact, but a fact so complex and far-reaching and so difficult for us to realize in all its different aspects that hundreds of tales and thousands of repetitions with a musician’s variation are needed until this unknown fact is delivered into consciousness; and even then the theme is not exhausted. This unknown fact is what Jung calls the Self, which is the psychic reality of the collective unconscious. [...] Every archetype is in its essence only one aspect of the collective unconscious as well as always representing also the whole collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, Marie-Louise (1970), An Introduction to the Psychology of Fairytales, Zurich, New York: Spring publications, {{ISBN|0882141015}}] 1–2 (chapter 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous people commented on the importance of fairy tales, especially for children. For example, Albert Einstein once showed how important he believed fairy tales were for children’s intelligence in the quote “If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales."&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1427525203&lt;/ref&gt;

The adaptation of fairy tales for children continues. [[Walt Disney]]'s influential ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' was largely (although certainly not solely) intended for the children's market.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Grant and Clute, "Cinema", p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anime]] ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo]]'' draws on the fairy tale ''[[Momotarō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Zipes has spent many years working to make the older [[traditional stories]] accessible to modern readers and their children.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric James The Art of Storytelling Show Interview [http://www.artofstorytellingshow.com/2008/06/29/jack-zipes-fairy-tales/ Jack Zipes&amp;nbsp;– Are Fairy tales still useful to Children?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary tales==

===Literary===

[[File:John Bauer 1915.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of three trolls surrounding a princess in a dark area, as adapted from a collection of Swedish fairy tales|[[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]'s illustration of trolls and a princess from a collection of Swedish fairy tales]]

In [[contemporary literature]], many authors have used the form of fairy tales for various reasons, such as examining the [[human condition]] from the simple framework a fairytale provides.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'' and so on!, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors seek to recreate a sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Fairytale", p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers use fairy tale forms for modern issues;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; this can include using the psychological dramas implicit in the story, as when [[Robin McKinley]] retold ''[[Donkeyskin]]'' as the novel ''[[Deerskin (novel)|Deerskin]]'', with emphasis on the abusive treatment the father of the tale dealt to his daughter.&lt;ref name=Pilinovsky&gt;{{cite journal | author = Helen Pilinovsky | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/fordnky.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325011315/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/fordnky.html | archivedate = 2014-03-25 | title = Donkeyskin, Deerskin, Allerleirauh: The Reality of the Fairy Tale | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, especially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist simply for comic effect, such as ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales|The Stinky Cheese Man]]'' by [[Jon Scieszka]] and ''The ASBO Fairy Tales'' by Chris Pilbeam. A common comic motif is a world where all the fairy tales take place, and the characters are aware of their role in the story,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the film series [[Shrek (film series)|Shrek]].

Other authors may have specific motives, such as [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[feminism|feminist]] reevaluations of predominantly [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] masculine-dominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', pp. 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of the [[damsel in distress]] has been particularly attacked by many feminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure include ''The Paperbag Princess'' by [[Robert Munsch]], a picture book aimed at children in which a princess rescues a prince, and [[Angela Carter]]'s ''The Bloody Chamber'', which retells a number of fairy tales from a female point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angela Carter – The Bloody Chamber And Other Stories|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/rote/CARTER.html|publisher=Angelfire.com|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many contemporary erotic retellings of fairy tales, which explicitly draw upon the original spirit of the tales, and are specifically for adults. Modern retellings focus on exploring the tale through use of the erotic, explicit sexuality, dark and/or comic themes, female empowerment, [[Fetishism|fetish]] and [[BDSM]], multicultural, and heterosexual characters. [[Cleis Press]] has released several fairy tale themed erotic anthologies, including ''Fairy Tale Lust'', ''Lustfully Ever After'', and ''A Princess Bound''.

It may be hard to lay down the rule between fairy tales and [[fairytale fantasy|fantasies]] that use fairy tale motifs, or even whole plots, but the distinction is commonly made, even within the works of a single author: George MacDonald's ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' are regarded as fantasies, while his "[[The Light Princess]]", "[[The Golden Key]]", and "The Wise Woman" are commonly called fairy tales. The most notable distinction is that fairytale fantasies, like other fantasies, make use of [[novelist]]ic writing conventions of prose, characterization, or setting.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', pp. 22–23, {{ISBN|068910846X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Fairy tales have been enacted dramatically; records exist of this in [[commedia dell'arte]],&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Commedia Dell'Arte", p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, "Commedia Dell'Arte", p. 745.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[film|cinema]] has meant that such stories could be presented in a more plausible manner, with the use of [[special effects]] and [[animation]]. [[The Walt Disney Company]] has had a significant impact on the evolution of the fairy tale film. Some of the earliest short silent films from the Disney studio were based on fairy tales, and some fairy tales were adapted into shorts in the musical comedy series "[[Silly Symphony]]", such as ''[[Three Little Pigs (1933 film)|Three Little Pigs]]''. [[Walt Disney]]'s first feature-length film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', released in 1937, was a ground-breaking film for fairy tales and, indeed, fantasy in general.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Disney and his creative successors have returned to traditional and literary fairy tales numerous times with films such as ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991). [[Disney]]'s influence helped establish the fairy tale genre as a genre for children, and has been accused by some of [[bowdlerizing]] the gritty naturalism&amp;nbsp;– and sometimes unhappy endings&amp;nbsp;– of many folk fairy tales.&lt;ref name=Pilinovsky /&gt; However, others note that the softening of fairy tales occurred long before Disney, some of which was even done by the Grimm brothers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Kay|year=1981|title=Märchen to Fairy Tale: An Unmagical Transformation|journal=Western Folklore|volume=40|issue=3|pages=232–44|doi=10.2307/1499694|jstor=1499694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatar, M.|year=1987|title=The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=24|isbn=978-0691067223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many filmed fairy tales have been made primarily for children, from Disney's later works to Aleksandr Rou's retelling of ''[[Vasilissa the Beautiful]]'', the first [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet film]] to use Russian folk tales in a big-budget feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = James Graham | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html | archivedate = 2013-01-09 | title = Baba Yaga in Film | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have used the conventions of fairy tales to create new stories with sentiments more relevant to contemporary life, as in ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scheib, [http://www.moria.co.nz/fantasy/labyrinth-1986.htm Review of ''Labyrinth'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', and the films of [[Michel Ocelot]].&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works have retold familiar fairy tales in a darker, more horrific or psychological variant aimed primarily at adults. Notable examples are [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forbewty.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131115234313/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forbewty.html | archivedate = 2013-11-15 | title = Beauty and the Beast | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', based on [[Angela Carter]]'s retelling of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrPathNeedles.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130920005533/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrPathNeedles.html | archivedate = 2013-09-20 | title = The Path of Needles or Pins: Little Red Riding Hood | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html|title=Guillermo del Toro and Ivana Baquero escape from a civil war into the fairytale land of ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-07-14|date=2006-12-25 |publisher=[[Science Fiction Weekly]]|last=Spelling|first=Ian| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707173614/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html| archivedate = July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Suspiria]]'', and ''[[Spike (2008 film)|Spike]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://variety.com/2008/film/news/festival-highlights-1117987482/ | title = Festival Highlights: 2008 Edinburgh International Film Festival | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2008-06-13 | accessdate = 2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; create new stories in this genre from fairy tale and folklore motifs.

In comics and animated TV series, ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'', ''[[Princess Tutu]]'', ''[[Fables (Vertigo)|Fables]]'' and ''[[MÄR]]'' all make use of standard fairy tale elements to various extents but are more accurately categorised as [[fairytale fantasy]] due to the definite locations and characters which a longer narrative requires.

A more modern cinematic fairy tale would be [[Luchino Visconti|Luchino Visconti's]] ''[[Le Notti Bianche]]'', starring [[Marcello Mastroianni]] before he became a superstar. It involves many of the romantic conventions of fairy tales, yet it takes place in post-[[World War II]] [[Italy]], and it ends realistically.

==Motifs==

[[File:Warwick Goble Beauty and Beast.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of the fairy tale "Beauty and the Beast". The princess is standing alongside the "beast", who is lying on the ground.|[[Beauty and the Beast]], illustration by [[Warwick Goble]]]]

Any comparison of fairy tales quickly discovers that many fairy tales have features in common with each other. Two of the most influential classifications are those of [[Antti Aarne]], as revised by [[Stith Thompson]] into the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]], and [[Vladimir Propp]]'s ''[[Morphology of the Folk Tale]]''.

===Aarne-Thompson===

This system groups fairy and folk tales according to their overall plot. Common, identifying features are picked out to decide which tales are grouped together. Much therefore depends on what features are regarded as decisive.

For instance, tales like ''[[Cinderella]]''&amp;nbsp;– in which a persecuted heroine, with the help of the [[fairy godmother]] or similar [[donor (fairy tale)|magical helper]], attends an event (or three) in which she wins the love of a prince and is identified as his true bride{{nsmdns}}are classified as type 510, the persecuted heroine. Some such tales are ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''; ''[[Aschenputtel]]''; ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]''; ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]''; ''[[Ye Xian]]''; ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]''; ''[[Catskin]]''; ''[[Fair, Brown and Trembling]]''; ''[[Finette Cendron]]''; ''[[Allerleirauh]]''.

Further analysis of the tales shows that in ''Cinderella'', ''The Wonderful Birch'', ''The Story of Tam and Cam'', ''Ye Xian'', and ''Aschenputtel'', the heroine is persecuted by her stepmother and refused permission to go to the ball or other event, and in ''Fair, Brown and Trembling'' and ''Finette Cendron'' by her sisters and other female figures, and these are grouped as 510A; while in ''Cap O' Rushes'', ''Catskin'', and ''Allerleirauh'', the heroine is driven from home by her father's persecutions, and must take work in a kitchen elsewhere, and these are grouped as 510B. But in ''Katie Woodencloak'', she is driven from home by her stepmother's persecutions and must take service in a kitchen elsewhere, and in ''Tattercoats'', she is refused permission to go to the ball by her grandfather. Given these features common with both types of 510, ''Katie Woodencloak'' is classified as 510A because the villain is the stepmother, and ''Tattercoats'' as 510B because the grandfather fills the father's role.

This system has its weaknesses in the difficulty of having no way to classify subportions of a tale as motifs. ''[[Rapunzel]]'' is type 310 (The Maiden in the Tower), but it opens with a child being demanded in return for stolen food, as does ''[[Puddocky]]''; but ''Puddocky'' is not a Maiden in the Tower tale, while ''[[The Canary Prince]]'', which opens with a jealous stepmother, is.

It also lends itself to emphasis on the common elements, to the extent that the folklorist describes ''[[The Black Bull of Norroway]]'' as the same story as ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''. This can be useful as a shorthand but can also erase the coloring and details of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===

[[File:1932. Билибин. Морозко.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Father Frost, a fairy tale character made of ice, acts as a donor in the Russian fairy tale "Father Frost". He tests the heroine, a veiled young girl sitting in the snow, before bestowing riches upon her.|Father Frost acts as a donor in the Russian fairy tale ''[[Father Frost (fairy tale)|Father Frost]]'', testing the heroine before bestowing riches upon her]]

[[Vladimir Propp]] specifically studied a collection of [[Russian fairy tale]]s, but his analysis has been found useful for the tales of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale''.&lt;/ref&gt; Having criticized Aarne-Thompson type analysis for ignoring what motifs ''did'' in stories, and because the motifs used were not clearly distinct,&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; he analyzed the tales for the ''function'' each character and action fulfilled and concluded that a tale was composed of thirty-one elements ('functions') and seven characters or 'spheres of action' ('the princess and her father' are a single sphere). While the elements were not all required for all tales, when they appeared they did so in an invariant order&amp;nbsp;– except that each individual element might be negated twice, so that it would appear [[rule of three (writing)|three times]], as when, in ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', the brother resists drinking from enchanted streams twice, so that it is the third that enchants him.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Propp's 31 functions also fall within six 'stages' (preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition), and a stage can also be repeated, which can affect the perceived order of elements.

One such element is the ''[[donor (fairy tale)|donor]]'' who gives the hero magical assistance, often after testing him.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Golden Bird]]'', the talking [[fox]] tests the hero by warning him against entering an inn and, after he succeeds, helps him find the object of his quest; in ''[[The Boy Who Drew Cats]]'', the priest advised the hero to stay in small places at night, which protects him from an evil spirit; in ''[[Cinderella]]'', the fairy godmother gives Cinderella the dresses she needs to attend the ball, as their mothers' spirits do in ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''; in ''[[The Fox Sister]]'', a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk gives the brothers magical bottles to protect against the [[Huli jing|fox spirit]]. The roles can be more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Red Ettin]]'', the role is split into the mother{{nsmdns}}who offers the hero the whole of a journey cake with her curse or half with her blessing{{nsmdns}}and when he takes the half, a fairy who gives him advice; in ''[[Mr Simigdáli]]'', the sun, the moon, and the stars all give the heroine a magical gift. Characters who are not always the donor can act like the donor.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kallo and the Goblins]]'', the villain goblins also give the heroine gifts, because they are tricked; in ''[[Schippeitaro]]'', the evil [[cat]]s betray their secret to the hero, giving him the means to defeat them. Other fairy tales, such as ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]'', do not feature the donor.

Analogies have been drawn between this and the analysis of myths into the [[Monomyth|Hero's journey]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Vogler, ''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers'', 2nd edition, p. 30, {{ISBN|0941188701}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

Many fairy tales have been interpreted for their (purported) significance. One mythological interpretation saw many fairy tales, including ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', and ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog King]]'', as [[solar deity|solar myths]]; this mode of interpretation subsequently became rather less popular.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychoanalysis|Freudian]], [[analytical psychology|Jungian]], and other [[psychology|psychological]] analyses have also explicated many tales, but no mode of interpretation has established itself definitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Bettleheim Bruno|title= The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales |publisher= Penguin|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0140137279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific analyses have often been criticized{{by whom|date=May 2016}} for lending great importance to motifs that are not, in fact, integral to the tale; this has often stemmed from treating one instance of a fairy tale as the definitive text, where the tale has been told and retold in many variations.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dundes, "Interpreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically", pp. 18–19, James M. McGlathery, ed., ''The Brothers Grimm and Folktale'', {{ISBN|0252015495}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In variants of ''[[Bluebeard]]'', the wife's curiosity is betrayed by [[Bluebeard|a blood-stained key]], by [[Fitcher's Bird|an egg's breaking]], or by [[How the Devil Married Three Sisters|the singing of a rose she wore]], without affecting the tale, but interpretations of specific variants have claimed that the precise object is integral to the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other folklorists have interpreted tales as historical documents. Many{{quantify|date=May 2016}} German folklorists, believing the tales to have preserved details from ancient times, have used the Grimms' tales to explain ancient customs.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach sees the topography of European Märchen as echoing the period immediately following the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]].&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = As the glaciers of the last ice age retreated (from c. 10,000 BC) forests, of various types, quickly colonised the land and came to cover most of Europe. [...] These forests formed the topography out of which the fairy stories (or as they are better called in German – the ''marchen''), which are one of our earliest and most vital cultural forms, evolved.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Other folklorists have explained the figure of the wicked stepmother in a historical/sociological context: many women did die in childbirth, their husbands remarried, and the new stepmothers competed with the children of the first marriage for resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p. 213. {{ISBN|0374159017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 lecture, [[Jack Zipes]] reads fairy tales as examples of what he calls "childism". He suggests that there are terrible aspects to the tales, which (among other things) have conditioned children to accept mistreatment and even abuse.&lt;ref&gt;
Jack Zipes, [https://archive.is/20121212173344/http://ias.umn.edu/2012/11/15/zipes-jack/ "Fairy Tales, Child Abuse, and 'Childism'"], (lecture, University of Minnesota Institute for Advanced Study, November 15, 2012).
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fairy tales in music ==
Fairy tales have inspired music, namely opera, such as the French [[Opéra féerie]] and the German [[Märchenoper]]. French examples include Gretry's ''[[Zémire et Azor]]'', and Auber's ''[[Le cheval de bronze]]'', German operas are Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', Siegfried Wagner's ''[[An allem ist Hütchen schuld!]]'', which is based on many fairy tales, and Carl Orff's ''[[Die Kluge]]''. Even contemporary fairy tales have been written for the purpose of inspiration in the music world. "Raven Girl" by [[Audrey Niffenegger]] was written to inspire a new dance for the Royal Ballet in London.

{{multiple image|width=180|footer=From left: Title page of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'' as published by [[Nathaniel Butter]] in 1608, and the falsely-dated title page of the quarto published by [[William Jaggard]] and [[Thomas Pavier]] in 1619.|image1=King Lear Q1.jpg|image2=King Lear 1619.jpg}}
'''False Folio''' is the term that [[Shakespeare]] scholars and [[bibliography|bibliographers]] have applied to [[William Jaggard]]'s printing of ten Shakespearean and [[Shakespeare Apocrypha|pseudo-Shakespearean]] plays together in 1619, the first attempt to collect Shakespeare's work in a single volume. There are only two complete extant copies. One is part of the collection of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowery|first1=J. Franklin|title=The Bindings of Edward Gwynn in the Folger Library|date=2011|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is part of [http://library.tcu.edu/spcoll/ Special Collections] at [http://www.tcu.edu Texas Christian University] in Fort Worth, Texas.

The term "false folio" intentionally evokes the folio collections of Shakespeare's works that appeared later: the [[First Folio]] of 1623 and its three seventeenth-century successors. The description "[[Folio (printing)|folio]]" is not strictly accurate, since the ten plays were printed in a larger-than-usual [[quarto]] format, not in folio; but the key qualifier is ''false'' folio. The texts in question were first examined with modern bibliographic procedures primarily by [[Alfred W. Pollard]], [[Walter Wilson Greg|W. W. Greg]], and William J. Neidig. Pollard provides a detailed account in his ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos''.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Pollard, ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos: A Study in the Bibliography of Shakespeare's Plays 1594–1685,'' Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1909; pp. 81–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the stationer and printer William Jaggard reprinted ten plays in 1619, either to be bound together in a single volume or issued separately depending on customer choice.  Jaggard, however, did not have clear title to all of the plays involved [see: [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]]; [[Stationers' Register]]], and therefore he printed some of the texts with false dates and the names of the original stationers involved on the title pages – in effect reproducing the appearance of the earlier quartos. The ten plays were:

*''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' – "printed for T. P. 1608" on the title page. False date. [[Thomas Pavier]] was the stationer who possessed the rights to ''Henry V'', and was an associate of Jaggard.
*''[[King Lear]]'' – "Printed for [[Nathaniel Butter]] 1608." False date and name. Butter had printed Q1 of ''Lear'' in 1608.
*''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' – "Printed by J. Roberts, 1600." False date and name. This was one play to which Jaggard did not have valid title; it belonged to stationer Laurence Hayes.
*''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' – "Printed for Arthur Johnson, 1619." False date and name. Johnson published Q1 of ''Merry Wives'' in 1602.
*''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' – "Printed by James Roberts, 1600." False date and name.
*''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' – "Printed for T. P. 1619", date "corrected" to 1609 in second state.
*''[[Sir John Oldcastle]]'' – "printed for T. P. 1600". False date.
*''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' – "Printed for T. P. 1619."
*''The Whole Contention Between the Two Famous Houses, Lancaster and York'' – "Printed at London, for T. P." This was the major innovation of the collection: Jaggard joined together two previously separate texts, ''The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster'' (the early version of ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]],'' published by [[Thomas Millington (publisher)|Thomas Millington]] in 1594 and 1600), and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'' (the early version of ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' published by Millington in 1595 and 1600). In 1602, Pavier had acquired the rights to both plays from Millington.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 161, 216–17, 249–50, 317–18, 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pericles'' was printed after ''The Whole Contention'', since their [[signature mark|signatures]] (the alphanumeric designations of the quires in sequence) run together; but the nine plays were apparently bound together in no particular order. (The few existing collections vary.)

As Jaggard lacked rights to Hayes' ''Merchant of Venice'', he may also have lacked rights to Butter's ''Lear'' and Johnson's ''Merry Wives''. There is much about the False Folio affair that remains unclear, such as subjective questions of Jaggard's motivation. Jaggard had a previous odd connection with the Shakespeare canon: he had printed the questionable miscellany ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' as Shakespeare's in 1599 and 1612. Some Shakespeare scholars have wondered why the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] used Jaggard as the printer and one of the publishers of the First Folio, just a couple of years after the False Folio affair. (Work on the First Folio began almost certainly in 1621.) It may have been a case of necessity, since Jaggard had a large-capacity print shop. (He had demonstrated his ability to print a volume of ten plays.) Pavier's role in the matter is also debated; his initials occur on five of the nine volumes (six of the ten plays), and some contemporary commentators see Pavier's role as more significant than Jaggard's – referring to the books as the "Pavier quartos" instead of the "False Folio."&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Blayney, "Compositor B and the Pavier Quartos," ''The Library,'' 5th series, Vol. 27 issue 3, pp. 179–206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William S. Kable, ''The Pavier Quartos and the First Folio of Shakespeare,'' Dubuque, IA, W. C. Brown Co., 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollard focused much of his attention on the concept of literary "piracy,"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Pollard, ''Shakespeare's Fight with the Pirates and the Problems of the Transmission of His Text,'' London, A. Moring, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; and his viewpoint coloured much of the scholarly attitude and approach to the False Folio during the twentieth century. By the start of the twenty-first century, some researchers began to take a less melodramatic and more nuanced view of the questions involved, a view that no longer casts Jaggard and Pavier as the villains in a moral contest.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Massai, ''Shakespeare and the Rise of the Editor,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Growing Up''''' is a [[sex education]] film for schools, 23 minutes in length, first shown in April 1971, which was made by [[Martin Cole (sexologist)|Dr Martin Cole]]. It is now available as part of ''The Joy of Sex Education'' DVD&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;BFI video (2 Feb 2009) ASIN: B001MGUAEW&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by one critic as "the most famous and controversial inclusion",&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;[http://www.moviemail-online.co.uk/scripts/reviews.pl?attribution=Alex%20Davidson Moviemail] Film Reviews By Alex Davidson&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' as the "undoubted masterpiece of this double-DVD set".&lt;ref name=Bradshaw&gt;Peter Bradshaw [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/feb/11/sex-education-films "Sex education films: they don't make them like they used to",] ''The Guardian'' (film blog), 11 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its release it was said to be "the most explicit and frank film ever made for use in schools",&lt;ref name=DMirror710113&gt;"A sex-act film for children", ''Daily Mirror'' 13 January 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted condemnation by [[Mary Whitehouse]], [[Lord Longford]],&lt;ref name=DMirror710417&gt;"Peer slams school sex film", ''Daily Mirror'', 17 April 1971&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Thatcher]]&lt;ref name=DMirror710422&gt;"That sex film gets 'X' certificate", ''Daily Mirror'', 22 April 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] who all, excepting Thatcher, attended the first public screening.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;Roger Lewin [https://books.google.com/books?id=s_mRNA9HJwgC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=%22Martin+Cole%22+biologist+sex&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N8vs_kRQ5e&amp;sig=d1Cbx3MtEI8UraazkiRdz0y2N48&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cF-4TLrBJoyOjAfou-WpDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Growing up too fast",] ''New Scientist and Science Journal'', 6 May 1971, p.301&lt;/ref&gt; Made two years before its earliest public showing, Cole though soon regretted a traditionalist description of gender roles in the film's opening commentary. The function of women was described as "giving birth to children", while it claimed men were "better at giving birth to ideas", a sequence which the Women's Liberation Movement objected to.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11691820/Martin-Cole-sexologist-obituary.html "Martin Cole, sexologist - obituary"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 22 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There was a version of the film shown to [[Aston University]] students earlier for feedback prior to the final version being released. It features scenes rather than drawings of naked people, which included intercourse and masturbation. Teachers and pupils gave it positive feedback, but the absence of a discussion of [[Sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] (VD) was noted by sympathetic reviewers.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

The film triggered a national controversy;&lt;ref name=Limond&gt;Limond, David (2008) ''History of Education'' '''37''' (3) 409&amp;ndash;429 "‘I never imagined that the time would come’: Martin Cole, the Growing Up Controversy and the Limits of School Sex Education in 1970s England"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7892257.stm "The Joy of Sex Education"], BBC Magazine, 16 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;"Educationally speaking, it is a rotten film", Whitehouse said after viewing the film, "which makes children no more than animals."&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"&gt;Dominic Sandbrook ''State of Emergency, The Way We Were: Britain 1970-74'', London: Allen Lane, 2010, p.421-22&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Thatcher, then secretary of state for education who had sent an advisor to view the film, told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 21 April that she was "very perturbed" at the thought of the film being shown in schools and suggested local education authorities consider it "with extreme caution".&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"/&gt;

After insisting on a screening, the education authority in [[Birmingham]], where Cole lived, banned the film from being shown in the city's schools.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arnot [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/how-lack-of-orgasms-turned-to-lack-of-interest-remember-the-sex-therapist-whose-patients-were-treated-by-surrogate-lovers-chris-arnot-tracked-him-down-happily-practising-in-suburban-birmingham-1487642.html "How lack of orgasms turned to lack of interest",] ''The Independent'', 28 July 1993&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of the film being shown to school children anywhere by the end of 1971, although it was shown to students at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="Sandbrook"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15695">The '''hedonic music consumption model''' was created by music researchers Kathleen Lacher and Richard Mizeski in 1994. Their goal was to use this model to examine the responses that listening to rock music creates, and to find if these responses influenced the listener's intention to later purchase the music.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The article begins with a discussion of why the issue of music consumption is important. Music is then explored as an aesthetic product, prior to a discussion of what hedonic consumption is, as well as its origins, and concludes with an in-depth look at the model itself.

==Music consumption==
[[Music]] is consumed in a variety of ways, through the [[radio]], [[television]], and [[internet]], as well as through [[concerts]] and [[performances]].&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"&gt;Ouellet, J. F. (2007). The purchase versus illegal download of music by consumers: The influence of consumer response towards the artist and music. Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences, 24, 107-119.&lt;/ref&gt;
North and Hargreaves&lt;ref&gt;North, A. C., &amp; Hargreaves, D. J. (Eds.). (1997). Music and consumer behaviour. The social psychology of music (pp. 268-289). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested "record buying is perhaps the ultimate behavioural measure of musical preference, involving the purchaser's [[time]], effort, and [[money]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;282). The study of music purchase and consumption was quite limited as of the early 1990s, as only a few academic studies had investigated this topic at that point in time.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt; 
 
The impact of illegal [[music downloads]] and [[file sharing]] has again brought the issue of music purchases to the forefront. Much popular press and current academic work is being devoted to this topic. The latest report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ([[IFPI]]) mentions four academic studies in particular (e.g., Zenter, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Zentner, A. (2003). Measuring the effect of online piracy on music sales. Journal of Law and Economics, 49, 63-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Liebowitz, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz, S. J. (2006). File sharing: Creative destruction or just plain destruction? Journal of Law and Economics, 49, 1-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael, 2006; Rob &amp; Waldfogel, 2006;)&lt;ref&gt;Rob, R., &amp; Waldfogel, J. (2007). Piracy on the silver screen. Journal of Industrial Economics, 55, 379-395.&lt;/ref&gt; that have examined file-sharing as having a negative impact on the record industry. Not all academics believe to be true however, as the Oberholzer &amp; Strumpf (2004) study brought a different viewpoint to this topic in an article published in the prestigious [[Journal of Political Economy]]. These [[Harvard Business School]] professors received considerable media attention with the study's conclusion "the empirical evidence on sales displacement is mixed…the papers using actual file-sharing data, suggest that piracy and music sales are largely unrelated" (pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25).&lt;ref&gt;Oberholzer-Gee, F., &amp; Strumpf, K. (2004). The effect of file sharing on record sales: An empirical analysis. Journal of Political Economy, 115, 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and hedonic consumption==
Hedonic consumption was first introduced as an alternative to the traditional consumer behavior model by in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"&gt;Hirschman, E. C., &amp; Holbrook, M. B. (1982). Hedonic consumption: Emerging concepts, methods and propositions. Journal of Marketing, 46, 92-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional [[consumer research]] has traditionally used the black box approach and has historically analyzed the consumption activities of product categories such as package goods and major consumer [[durables]].&lt;ref name="Pucely, M. J. 1988"&gt;Pucely, M. J., Mizerski, R., &amp; Perrewe, P. (1988). A comparison of measures for the purchase and consumption of pre-recorded music. Advances in Consumer Research, 15, 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Hedonic consumption focuses on products such as the [[arts]], music, and cultural events such as [[rock concerts]], [[fashion shows]] and [[films]]. These "experience" types of products tend to involve individual preferences that can generate certain [[emotions]], feelings and [[behaviors]].

Music is an [[aesthetic]] product as it often provides an emotional or spiritually moving experience specific to an [[individual]].&lt;ref name="Charters, S. 2006"&gt;Charters, S. (2006). Aesthetic products and aesthetic consumption: A review. Consumption, Markets and Culture, 9, 235-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrook&lt;ref name="Holbrook, M. B. 1982"&gt;Holbrook, M. B. (1982). Mapping the retail market for esthetic products: The case of jazz records. Journal of Retailing, 58, 114-129.&lt;/ref&gt; also states that music is appreciated primarily for its internal essence as opposed to being viewed strictly as an objective product. However, consumer research literature focusing on these types of products often uses the terms "aesthetic" and "hedonic" almost interchangeably. Charters (2006) points out "hedonic consumption is essentially about [[pleasure]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;240),&lt;ref name="Charters, S. 2006"/&gt; and that pleasure is but one aspect of the overall aesthetic experience. He also notes that "[[popular culture]] works may have ‘layers of meaning' for [[consumer]]s" as they may convey symbolic meaning for people in significance or emotion of some type. From a [[retailing]] standpoint, aesthetic products are characterized as having a wide range of [[Product (business)|product]] offerings in the [[marketplace]].&lt;ref name="Holbrook, M. B. 1982"/&gt;

As Hirschman and Holbrook point out, hedonic consumption expands upon the traditional definition of consumer behavior through its inclusion of "the multi-sensory, fantasy and emotive aspects of one's experience with products…including tastes, sounds, scents, tactile impressions and visual images" (p.&amp;nbsp;92).&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; These types of experience-oriented products often involve "[[fun]], amusement, fantasy, [[arousal]], sensory stimulation, and enjoyment" (p.&amp;nbsp;37).&lt;ref name="Pucely, M. J. 1988"/&gt; In addition, hedonic consumption often uses [[ethnic]] background, [[social class]] and [[gender]] to help determine the different consumer emotions and fantasies around a product.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt;

==The origins of hedonic consumption==
The study of the hedonic consumption as an academic field began in the late 1970s. It originated out of different [[behavioral science]] fields, including [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[psycholinguistics]], and [[psychology]]. Hirschman and Holbrook considered key contributions to come from two fields of prior academic research. The first was the motivation research of the 1950s, "which focused on the emotional aspects of products and fantasies that the products could arouse and/or fulfill" (p.&amp;nbsp;93).&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; [[Ernest Dichter]] was a key figure in this field of research which was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s. One of the major shortcomings of the early motivation research was the fact that many of its [[clinical studies]] lacked rigor and validity.

Hedonic consumption also owes a big debt to the academic field of product symbolism research.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; One of the important contributors to this academic field includes Sidney J. Levy, who is now the Coca-Cola Distinguished Professor of Marketing at Eller College of Management at the [[University of Arizona]]. He wrote the groundbreaking article "Symbols for Sale" which first appeared in the July–August 1959 edition of the ''Harvard Business Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. J. (1999). Symbols For Sale. In D. W. Rook (Ed.), Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 203-212). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. (Original work published 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Levy observed "consumers buy products and brands not only for so-called functional reasons but for the various ‘symbolic meanings' that their consumption provides" (p.&amp;nbsp;198).&lt;ref name="Rook, D. W. 1999 pp. 197-201"&gt;Rook, D. W. (Ed.). (1999). The symbolic nature of marketing. Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 197-201). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early Levy article "Symbolism and Life Style" was originally published in the December 1963 American Marketing Association's ''Toward Scientific Marketing'' Winter Conference Proceedings. In this article, Levy expanded upon his earlier writings by urging marketers to consider "the sum of an individual's consumption of symbolic goods and services as a 'lifestyle'" (p.&amp;nbsp;199).&lt;ref name="Rook, D. W. 1999 pp. 197-201"/&gt; Levy was interested in the development of a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] that would allow marketers to be able to think more systematically about how to meaningfully fulfill the needs of their individual consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. J. (1999). Symbolism and Life Style. In D. W. Rook (Ed.), Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 217-224). Thousand Oaks,CA: Sage. (Original work published 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
Hirschman and Holbrook's research in the hedonic consumption field first led Kathleen Lacher to begin to explore music as a hedonic consumption product in the late 1980s. Her goal was to try to understand the factors behind why people bought music.&lt;ref&gt;Lacher, K. T. (1989). Hedonic consumption: Music as a product. Advances in Consumer Research, 16, 367-373.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she joined forces with Richard Mizerski to conduct an experiment that explored music purchase intentions. These professors proposed a theoretical model they named the "model of music consumption and purchase intention". Their basic premise was that people buy music because of the "experience that the music creates by itself or because music can enhance other experiences, whether it is an individual or shared experiences with others" (p.&amp;nbsp;367).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

==Model building blocks==
Lacher and Mizerski based their experiments on previous music research that was conducted in the fields of [[music education]] and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Lacher, K. T. (1989). Hedonic consumption: Music as a product. Advances in Consumer Research, 16, 367-373&lt;/ref&gt; They tested music on four "responses" to see what, if any, had any effect on music purchase intentions.

#''Emotion'' - or the feelings people experience when hearing music, which usually range across a scale extending from rage to [[love]]. Emotion is also considered to be one of the primary factors in [[music appreciation]] as well as a potential factor in the [[purchasing process]].&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; 
#''Sensory'' – music often invokes a raw physical response to move physically or sway to the music. Yingling describes this primal process as "an awareness to the listener's need to either move physically towards or away" from the music source.&lt;ref&gt;Yingling, R. W. (1962). Classification of reaction patterns in listening to music. Journal of Research in Music Education, 10, 105-120.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#''Imaginal'' – This response often involves "images, ''memories'' or situations that music evokes" (p.&amp;nbsp;109).&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; The imaginal response also tends to invoke memories of past events, or to imagine events that could take place in the future.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt;
#''Analytical'' – This response often involves pre-conceived expectations about the music itself. Listeners tend to separate music by identifying of the technical aspects of the music (e.g., [[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], etc.); type, through music genre (e.g., rock, [[Folk music|folk]], etc.); and intrinsic, through other personalized listener factors (e.g., contemporary, religious, etc.).&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; 
	
Next, these first four inputs link together along a pathway towards music purchase using four additional factors:

&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Experiential response'' – or the experience that one has in becoming absorbed or involved in the music.&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ''overall affective behavior'' – This is more than just emotion, which "tends to be characterized by short duration intense reactionary episodes attributed to a specific cause.&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. (2003). Theory of affective dynamics: Emotions and moods. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 533-567). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacher and Mizerski considered the affective domain to capture the various interactions between basic emotions, emotional patterns, as well as [[Mood (psychology)|moods]] and motivations, as well as the previously identified analytical and imagery responses as well.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Reexperience the music'' – This revolves around the listener's need to want to listen to the music again. The researchers considered this to be a ''key factor'' of music purchase. In other words, the listener is motivated enough to purchase the product in order to control the type of music played, as well as where, when, and with whom the music is experienced in the [[future]].&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Purchase intention'' is the ultimate outcome of the hedonic music consumption model purchase. It should be noted that Lacher and Mizerski hypothesized that each of the first four inputs could also lead directly to any of the factors in the second cluster as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==The revised significant-paths-only hedonic music consumption model==
Lacher and Mizerski conducted [[experiment]]s with college students to determine if the directly linked relationships they had proposed between these eight factors stayed consistent in ultimately predicting rock music purchases. They picked this music genre as previous research suggested most recorded music was bought by people between the ages of 10 and 25, and that this was the preferred genre of the students in test groups.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

Lacher and Mizerski found during the course of the tests that their [[hypotheses]] were not as consistent as they had thought, and in some cases, the relationships were not direct. Still they were able to make some general conclusions about why people buy music. They revised their original model to create a significant-paths-only model hedonic music consumption model detailing the revised relationships between the factors. The emotional response was broken down to include six different music dimensions that ranged from calm to exuberant. In short, their end goal was to "foster a systematic system of why people purchase music so we can better understand this important marketplace behavior" (p.&amp;nbsp;375).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt; One of the ways that Lacher and Mizerski believed that this hedonic music consumption model might prove helpful in terms of future research was to explain the consumption of other "hedonic" products such as [[books]], movies, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[paintings]] and [[sports]] events" (p.&amp;nbsp;377).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

The '''International Association of Master Penmen, Engrossers and Teachers of Handwriting''' ('''IAMPETH''') (pronounced "I am Peth") is an international association for practicing and preserving the arts of [[calligraphy]], engrossing and [[penmanship]]. IAMPETH was founded in 1949.

IAMPETH maintains an archive of works of past masters (viewable, in person, only to members during the Annual Conference) in addition to online instruction guides on lettering styles such as [[Copperplate script|Copperplate]], [[Spencerian script]], [[Illuminated manuscript]] production (engrossing) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iampeth.com/lessons |title=Lessons |publisher=IAMPETH |accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the organization's collection has been digitally preserved and is available on their Internet Archive profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/@iampeth |title=IAMPETH |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual conference is held each year during the months of July or August in a US city. The convention consists of various classes, banquets, and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iampeth.com/conferences |title=Annual Conference |publisher=IAMPETH |accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 IAMPETH introduced a new Certificate Program, replacing the Master Penman Program which was discontinued in 2015. This program allows all members who have been with the organization for three or more years to submit work to be considered for Certificate of Proficiency, Certificate of Excellence, and finally a  Master Penman's Certificate. Current application requirements and associated costs are viewable by members only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iampeth.com/certificate |title=Certificate |publisher=IAMPETH |accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IAMPETH is composed of members from various countries. Dues range from $25 to $55 USD. Membership occasionally closes, temporarily, prior to the Annual Conference.

The '''Kyoto design declaration''' was signed in [[Kyoto]], on March 28, 2008 by 124 global members of Cumulus (the International Association of Universities and Colleges of Art, Design and Media). The declaration was developed to create [[sustainable design]]s and human-centered societies, through collaboration of institutions, business’ and individuals.

== Background ==
Yrjo Sotamaa (Finnish designer with an MA in Interior Architecture and [[furniture design]]) was the author of the design declaration and past president of Cumulus. Yrjo Sotamaa’s career was based on building a sustainable future and the importance of [[art]], [[design]] and the mythologies of design involved, which enable such creative societies and designs to be developed.
The Association Cumulus is described as an international network of universities, colleges, organizations and business partners all incorporated in the topic areas of art, design and [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cumulus|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=308&amp;Itemid=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Allowing for academic and corporate [[collaboration]]. Cumulus has expanded and improved in status over the past decade leading it to become a successful international organization representing a global community of 140 first-class institutions worldwide.

== History and the evolution of the design declaration ==
Cumulus was set up in 1990 by the combined efforts of ‘The [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] (UIAH) (currently [[Aalto University School of Art and Design]]) and the [[Royal College of Art]] in [[London]], collaborating with [[Danmarks Designskole]], [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]], [[Universität Gesamthochschule Essen]] and [[Hochschule für angewandte Kunst in Wien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cumulus|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/cumulus/about/cumulus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organizations focus is on enhancing academic forward designs and generating creative communities connecting the continents. This is described by the declarations author-Yrjo Sotamaa, as a ‘mission to make societies and industry aware of the importance of culture, art, and design in building sustainable societies, creative economies, innovative regions and a better everyday life for all people.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sotamaa|first=Yrjo|title=The Kyoto Design Declaration:Building a Sustainable Future|journal=Design Issues|date=25 September 2009|volume=25|series=Autumn|issue=4|pages=51–53|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/desi.2009.25.4.51|accessdate=2011-09-15|doi=10.1162/desi.2009.25.4.51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (journal article)This attitude is what brought about the declaration and members of Cumulus continue to work by the declarations approach.

== Objectives ==
The Kyoto design declarations main aim is highlighted by their statement of commitment from the members of Cumulus, to act on being globally responsible for building sustainable, human-centered, creative societies.
The Kyoto Design Declaration suggests that it is important, globally, to maintain and continue local or traditional practices. Focused on [[sustainability]] as a form of collaboration and as a design ethic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigo|url=http://www.indigodesignnetwork.org/?p=430|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forming relationships from addressed green issues and design proposals. [[Design thinking]] is the factor found at the core of the design manifesto. In co-operation with design thinking the importance of cultural traditional values are noted in order for their rejuvenation and focus. 
The design declaration states that In order to forward the ideals of [[sustainable development]] and design issues Members of Cumulus agreed to commit to share and promote their knowledge on sustainable development by upholding a relationship with educational and cultural institutions, companies, government agencies, design and other professional agencies and NGO’S.  
The Kyoto design declaration is a mark of the shift in movement from materialistic and visible values to a more intellectual and mental approach towards all aspects of design. The declaration describes this as an era of ‘cultural productivity’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cumulus|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=308&amp;Itemid=109|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and when embedded with cultural influences and sustainable principles there is a great potential for an improved world through design society. Sotamaa delivers the declaration to provide benefits to our global communities in the form of economic, ecological, social and cultural benefits which will endeavor to improve quality of life through design durability.

== Designers Involvement ==
Through notions of the declaration designers are made aware of ecological and social problems in the field of [[global development]] and sustainable design. This presents issues to address for design matters of [[education]] and [[research]]. ‘The declaration challenges design to redefine itself’- Yrjo Sotamma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cumulus|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=308&amp;Itemid=109|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The implementation of the declaration is clarified and kept up to date through annual sustainability reports available through the Cumulus website. Information includes actions taken by the association regarding the dealings and goals, which are set out in the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The living principles|url=http://www.livingprinciples.org/kyoto-design-declaration/|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are six subheadings, which outline and shape the declaration. The subheadings divide the declaration into categories for the designers and other professional businesses and institutional collaborations to follow and comprehend. 
-Proposing new values and new ways of thinking
-An era of human centered development
-The imperative for designers to assume new roles
-Seeking collaboration in forwarding the ideals of sustainable development
-From education to global responsibility
-The power to make fundamental improvements to our world

== Success and results ==
When signed in 2008 by the 124 global members of cumulus including the executive Board of Cumulus, President [[Christian Guellerin]], Past President Yrjö Sotamaa, Rector Kan Shimamoto, [[Kyoto Seika University]], and Industrial Designer Takuo Hirano from Japan. The Declaration also received support from ICISID, BEDA, AIGA and EIDD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cumulus: Kyoto Design Declaration|url=http://www.icsid.org/news/year/2008_news/articles516.htm|publisher=ICSID|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; four major international organizations, who still support and encourage the declaration and its design concepts. Cumulus now consists of 165 members from 43 countries. Continuously expanding globally and intellectually.

A direct result from the Kyoto design declaration is the cumulus green award. It is through this award that Cumulus is able to take action of the goals and aims stated in the design document. The projects intentions are to induce a response to design issues on sustainable societies through research and design projects. Design competitions are an example of how the declaration is put into place. This is through design competitions that question and discuss the current design issues to do with sustainability. Enforcing designers, students and corporate professionals to follow the guidelines of the Kyoto declaration enhancing their knowledge on the declarations main statement of building sustainable, human-centered, creative societies.

The Kyoto design declaration is seen as influential to many realms and institutions of design. Examples are seen across the globe. Helsinki is the origin of the Cumulus secretariat. The University of Art and Design Helsinki (TAIK) pioneered in the development of the Kyoto declaration, committing to educate sustainable issues. In order to create a successful global community the Mayor of [[Helsinki]], ([[Jussi Pajunen]]) stated in his [[World Design Capital]] 2012 application that his city will use all means presented by design- in the spirit of the Kyoto Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Helsinki|url=http://www.hel2.fi/wdc2012/Helsinki_World_Design_Capital_2012_Application.pdf|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Kyoto design declaration will be considered a part of design history in regards to national global mapping. Organizations such as ICSID who support the declaration are also involved in connecting memberships across the continents, leaving an impact on millions of designers throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woodham|first=Jonothan.M|title=Local, National and Global: Redrawing the Design Historical Map|journal=Journal of Design History|date=Autumn 2005|volume=18|issue=3|pages=257–267|url=http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/257.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2011-09-15|doi=10.1093/jdh/epi044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Metabolism'''|新陳代謝|shinchintaisha}} was a post-war Japanese architectural movement that fused ideas about architectural [[Megastructures (architecture)|megastructures]] with those of organic biological growth. It had its first international exposure during [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]]'s 1959 meeting and its ideas were tentatively tested by students from [[Kenzo Tange|Kenzo Tange's]] [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] studio.

During the preparation for the 1960 Tōkyō World Design Conference a group of young architects and designers, including [[Kiyonori Kikutake]], [[Kisho Kurokawa]] and [[Fumihiko Maki]] prepared the publication of the Metabolism manifesto. They were influenced by a wide variety of sources including [[Marxism|Marxist]] theories and biological processes. Their manifesto was a series of four essays entitled: Ocean City, Space City, Towards Group Form, and Material and Man, and it also included designs for vast cities that floated on the oceans and plug-in capsule towers that could incorporate organic growth. Although the World Design Conference gave the Metabolists exposure on the international stage their ideas remained largely theoretical.

Some smaller, individual buildings that employed the principles of Metabolism were built and these included Tange's Yamanashi Press and Broadcaster Centre and Kurokawa's [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]]. The greatest concentration of their work was to be found at the [[Expo '70|1970 World Exposition]] in Osaka where Tange was responsible for master planning the whole site whilst Kikutake and Kurokawa designed pavilions. After the [[1973 oil crisis]], the Metabolists turned their attention away from Japan and toward Africa and the Middle East.

==Origins of Metabolism==

The [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) was founded in Switzerland in 1928 as an association of architects who wanted to advance modernism into an international setting. During the early 1930s they promoted the idea (based upon new urban patterns in the United States) that urban development should be guided by CIAM's four functional categories of: dwelling, work, transportation, and recreation.&lt;ref name="Mumford 2010, p5"&gt;Mumford (2000), p5&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s [[Le Corbusier]] and other architects had moulded CIAM into a pseudo-political party with the goal of promoting modern architecture to all. This view gained some traction in the immediate post-war period when Le Corbusier and his colleagues began to design buildings in [[Chandigarh]]. By the early 1950s it was felt that CIAM was losing its avant-garde edge so in 1954 a group of younger members called "[[Team 10]]" was formed. This included the inner circle Dutch architects [[Jaap Bakema|Jacob Bakema]] and [[Aldo van Eyck]], Italian [[Giancarlo De Carlo]], Greek [[Georges Candilis]], the British architects [[Alison and Peter Smithson|Peter and Alison Smithson]] and the American [[Shadrach Woods]]. The Team 10 architects introduced concepts like "human association", "cluster" and "mobility", with Bakema encouraging the combination of architecture and planning in [[urban design]]. This was a rejection of CIAM's older four function mechanical approach and it would ultimately lead to the break-up and end of CIAM.&lt;ref name="Mumford 2010, p6-7"&gt;Mumford (2000), p6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenzo Tange]] was invited to the CIAM '59 meeting of the association in Otterlo, Netherlands. In what was to be the last meeting of CIAM he presented two theoretical projects by the architect [[Kiyonori Kikutake]]: the Tower-shaped City and Kikutake's own home, the Sky House. This presentation exposed the fledgling Metabolist movement to its first international audience. Like Team 10's "human association" concepts Metabolism too was exploring new concepts in urban design.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p26"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Tower-shaped City was a 300 metre tall tower that housed the infrastructure for an entire city. It included transportation, services and a manufacturing plant for prefabricated houses. The tower was vertical "artificial land" onto which steel, pre-fabricated dwelling capsules could be attached. Kikutake proposed that these capsules would undergo self-renewal every fifty years and the city would grow organically like branches of a tree.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p26"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed on a hillside, the Sky House is a platform supported on four concrete panels with a [[hyperboloid structure|hyperbolic paraboloid]] shell roof. It is a single space divided by storage units with the kitchen and bathroom on the outer edge.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p123"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; These latter two were designed so that they could be moved to suit the use of the house - and indeed they have been moved and/or adjusted about seven times over the course of fifty years. At one point a small children's room was attached to the bottom of main floor with a small child-sized access door between the two rooms.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p139"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

After the meeting, Tange left for [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to begin a four-month period as a visiting professor. It is possible that based upon the reception of Kikutake's projects in Otterlo he decided to set the fifth year project as a design for a residential community of 25,000 inhabitants to be constructed on the water of Boston Bay.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p177"&gt;Stewart (1987), p177&lt;/ref&gt; Tange felt a natural desire to produce urban designs based upon a new prototype of design, one that could give a more human connection to super-scale cities. He considered the idea of "major" and "minor" city structure and how this could grow in cycles like the trunk and leaves of a tree.&lt;ref name="Riani 1969, p24"&gt;Riani (1969), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the seven projects produced by the students was a perfect example of his vision. The project consisted of two primary residential structures each of which was triangular in section. Lateral movement was provided by motorways and monorail, whilst vertical movement from the parking areas was via elevators. There were open spaces within for community centres and every third level there were walkways along which were rows of family houses.&lt;ref name="Riani 1969, p24"&gt;Riani (1969), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The project appeared to be based upon Tange's unrealised competition entry for the World Health Organisation headquarters in Geneva&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p178"&gt;Stewart (1987), p178&lt;/ref&gt; and both projects paved the way for his later project, "Plan for Tōkyō – 1960". Tange went on to present both the Boston Bay Project and the Tōkyō Plan at the Tōkyō World Design Conference.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p181"&gt;Stewart (1987), p181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tōkyō World Design Conference, 1960==

The conference had its roots with Isamu Konmochi and Sori Yanagi who were representatives of the Japanese Committee on the 1956 International Design Conference in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. They suggested that rather than a four yearly conference in Aspen there should be a roving conference with Tōkyō as its first setting in 1960.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p180"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Three Japanese institutional members were responsible for organising the conference, although after the Japan Industrial Design Association pulled out only the [[Japan Institute of Architects]] and the Japan Association of Advertising Arts were left. In 1958 they formed a preparation committee led by [[Junzo Sakakura]], [[Kunio Maekawa]] and Kenzo Tange. As Tange had just accepted an invitation to be a visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology he recommended his junior colleague Takashi Asada to replace him in the organisation of the conference programmes.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p19"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Asada invited two friends to help him: the architectural critic and former editor of the magazine Shinkenchiku, [[Noboru Kawazoe]], and [[Kisho Kurokawa]] who was one of Tange's students. In turn these two men scouted for more talented designers to help, including: the architects Masato Otaka and Kiyonori Kikutake and the designers [[Kenji Ekuan]] and Kiyoshi Awazu.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p181-182"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 181-182&lt;/ref&gt; Kurokawa was selected because he had recently returned from an international student conference in the Soviet Union and was a student of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] architectural theorist [[Uzō Nishiyama]]. Ekuan was asked because of his recent participation in a seminar given by [[Konrad Wachsmann]]&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p283-284"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p283-284&lt;/ref&gt; (he arrived at the lecture on a [[Yamaha YA-1|YA-1]] motorbike that he had newly designed for [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]])&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p478"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p478&lt;/ref&gt; and Otaka was a junior associate of Kunio Maekawa and had just completed the Harumi Apartment Building in Tōkyō Bay. [[Fumihiko Maki]], a former undergraduate student of Tange also joined the group whilst in Tōkyō on a travelling fellowship from the [[Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts|Graham Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p22"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p300"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

By day Asada canvassed politicians, business leaders and journalists for ideas, by night he met with his young friends to cultivate ideas. Asada was staying at the Ryugetsu Ryokan in [[Asakusa]], Tōkyō and he used it as a meeting place for progressive scholars, architects and artists. He often invited people from other professions to give talks and one of these was the atomic physicist, [[Taketani Mitsuo|Mitsuo Taketani]]. Taketani was a scholar who was also interested in Marxist theory and he brought this along with his scientific theories to the group. Taketani's three stage methodology for scientific research influenced Kikutake's own three stage theory: ''ka'' (the general system), ''kata'' (the abstract image) and ''katachi'' (the solution as built), which he used to summarise his own design process from a broad vision to a concrete architectural form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p20"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also searched for architectural solutions to Japan's phenomenal urban expansion brought about by its economic growth and how this could be reconciled with its shortage of usable land. They were inspired by examples of circular growth and renewal found in traditional  Japanese architecture like the [[Ise Shrine]] and [[Katsura Detached Palace]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p185"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; They worked in coffee shops and Tōkyō's International House to produce a compilation of their works that they could publish as a manifesto for the conference.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p187"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference ran from 11–16 May 1960 and had 227 guests, 84 of whom were international, including the architects [[Louis Kahn]], [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Jean Prouvé]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]] and Peter and Alison Smithson. Japanese participants included Kunio Maekawa, [[Yoshinobu Ashihara]] and [[Kazuo Shinohara]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p190-193"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 190-193&lt;/ref&gt;

After his 13 May lecture, Louis Kahn was invited to Kikutake's Sky House and had a long conversation with a number of Japanese architects including the Metabolists. He answered questions until after midnight with Maki acting as translator. Kahn spoke of his universal approach to design and used his own [[Richards Medical Research Laboratories]] as an example of how new design solutions can be reached with new thinking about space and movement. A number of the Metabolists were inspired by this.{{Vague|date=March 2013}}&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p18"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Metabolism name===
[[File:Marine City sketch by Kikutake 1958.jpg|thumb|Marine City sketch by Kikutake, 1958]]
Whilst discussing the organic nature of Kikutake's theoretical Marine City project, Kawazoe used the Japanese word ''shinchintaisha'' as being symbolic of the essential exchange of materials and energy between organisms and the exterior world (literally ''[[metabolism]]'' in a biological sense.) The Japanese meaning of the word has a feeling of ''replacement of the old with the new'' and the group further interpreted this to be equivalent to the continuous renewal and organic growth of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p22"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the conference was to be a world conference, Kawazoe felt that they should use a more universal word and Kikutake looked up the definition of ''shinchintaisha'' in his Japanese-English dictionary. The translation he found was the word ''Metabolism''.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p235"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Metabolism manifesto==
[[File:Marinacity466.JPG|thumb|Kikutake used a photo of [[Marina City]] to illustrate the idea of capsules plugged onto a central tower]]
The group's manifesto ''Metabolism: The Proposals for New Urbanism'' was published at the World Design Conference.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p23"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Two thousand copies of the 90 page book were printed and were sold for ¥500 by Kurokawa and Awazu at the entrance to the venue.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p185"/&gt; The manifesto opened with the following statement:

{{Quote|''Metabolism is the name of the group, in which each member proposes further designs of our coming world through his concrete designs and illustrations. We regard human society as a vital process - a continuous development from atom to nebula. The reason why we use such a biological word, metabolism, is that we believe design and technology should be a denotation of human society. We are not going to accept metabolism as a natural process, but try to encourage active metabolic development of our society through our proposals.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p24"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

The publication included projects by each member but a third of the document was dedicated to work by Kikutake&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p285"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p285&lt;/ref&gt; who contributed essays and illustrations on the "Ocean City". Kurokawa contributed "Space City", Kawazoe contributed "Material and Man" and Otaka and Maki wrote "Towards the Group Form".&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p24"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Awazu designed the booklet and Kawazoe's wife, Yasuko edited the layout.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p206"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the projects included in the manifesto were subsequently displayed at the Museum of Modern Art's 1960 exhibition entitled ''Visionary Architecture'' and exposed the Japanese architects' work to a much wider international audience.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p279"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p279&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the more rigid membership structure of Team 10, the Metabolist's saw their movement as having organic form with the members being free to come and go, although the group had cohesion they saw themselves as individuals and their architecture reflected this.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p239 &amp; 301"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 239 &amp; 301&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially true for Tange who remained a mentor for the group rather than an "official" member.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p2"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean City===

Kikutake's Ocean City is the first essay in the pamphlet. It covered his two previously published projects "Tower-shaped City" and "Marine City" and included a new project "Ocean City" that was a combination of the first two. The first two of these projects introduced the Metabolist's idea of "artificial land" as well as "major" and "minor" structure.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p25"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Kawazoe referred to "artificial land" in an article in the magazine ''Kindai Kenchiku'' in April 1960. In responding to the scarcity of land in large and expanding cities he proposed creating "artificial land" that would be composed of concrete slabs, oceans or walls (onto which capsules could be plugged). He said that the creation of this "artificial land" would allow people to use other land in a more natural way.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p186"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marine City, Kikutake proposed a city that would float free in the ocean and would be free of ties to a particular nation and therefore free from the threat of war. The artificial ground of the city would house agriculture, industry and entertainment and the residential towers would descend into the ocean to a depth of 200 metres. The city itself was not tied to the land and was free to float across the ocean and grow organically like an organism. Once it became too aged for habitation it would sink itself.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p27"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean City was a combination of both Tower-shaped City and Marine City. It consisted of two rings that were tangent to one another, with housing on the inner ring and production on the outer one. Administrative buildings were found at the tangent point. The population would have been rigidly controlled at an upper limit of 500,000. Kikutake envisaged that the city would expand by multiplying itself as though it was undergoing cell division. This enforced the Metabolist idea that the expansion of cities could be a biological process.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p28"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space City===

In his essay "Space City", Kurokawa introduced four projects: Neo-Tōkyō Plan, Wall City, Agricultural City and Mushroom-shaped house. In contrast to Tange's linear Tōkyō City Bay Project, Kurokawa's Neo-Tōkyō Plan proposed that Tōkyō be decentralised and organised into cruciform patterns. He arranged Bamboo-shaped Cities along these cruciforms but unlike Kikutake he kept the city towers lower than 31 metres to conform with Tōkyō's building code&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p28.2"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; (these height limits were not revised until 1968).&lt;ref name="Sorensen 2002, p253"&gt;Sorensen (2002), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wall City considered the problem of the ever-expanding distance between the home and the workplace. He proposed a wall-shaped city that could extend indefinitely. Dwellings would be on one side of the wall and workplaces on the other. The wall itself would contain transportation and services.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p30"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving the [[Typhoon Vera|Ise Bay Typhoon]] in 1959 inspired Kurokawa to design the Agricultural City. It consisted of a grid-like city supported on 4 metre stilts above the ground.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p341"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The 500 metres square city sat on concrete slab that placed industry and infrastructure above agriculture and was an attempt to combine rural land and the city into one entity.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p30"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He envisaged that his Mushroom Houses would sprout through the slab of Agriculture City. These houses were shrouded in a mushroom-like cap that was neither wall nor roof that enclosed a tea room and a living space.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p341"/&gt;

===Towards the Group Form===

Maki and Otaka's essay on Group Form placed less emphasis on the megastructures of some of the other Metabolists and focused instead on a more flexible form of urban planning&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p352"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; that could better accommodate rapid and unpredictable requirements of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p34"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Otaka had first thought about the relationship between infrastructure and architecture in his 1949 graduation thesis and he continued to explore ideas about "artificial ground" during his work at Maekawa's office. Likewise, during his travels abroad, Maki was impressed with the grouping and forms of vernacular buildings.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p32"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The project they included to illustrate their ideas was a scheme for the redevelopment of [[Shinjuku station]] which included retail, offices and entertainment on an artificial ground over the station.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p352"/&gt; Although Otaka's forms were heavy and sculptural and Maki's were lightweight with large spans, both contained the homogeneous clusters that were associated with group form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p34"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Material and Man===

Kawazoe contributed a brief essay entitled ''I want to be a sea-shell, I want to be a mold, I want to be a spirit''. The essay reflected Japan's cultural anguish after the Second World War and proposed the unity of man and nature.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p286-287"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plan for Tōkyō, 1960–2025==
[[File:Tokyo Bay Plan by Tange 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Tokyo|Tokyo Bay Plan]], project of the Metabolist and [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralist]] movement, 1960 ([[Kenzo Tange]])]]
On 1 January 1961 Kenzo Tange presented his new plan for [[Tokyo Bay|Tōkyō Bay]] (1960) in a 45-minute television programme on [[NHK]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 284-292&lt;/ref&gt; The design was a radical plan for the reorganization and expansion of the capital in order to cater for a population beyond 10 million.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p112"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The design was for a linear city that used a series of nine-kilometre modules that stretched 80&amp;nbsp;km across Tōkyō Bay from [[Ikebukuro]] in the north west to [[Kisarazu, Chiba|Kisarazu]] in the south east. The perimeter of each of the modules was organised into three levels of looping highways, as Tange was adamant that an efficient communication system would be the key to modern living.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p112"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The modules themselves were organised into building zones and transport hubs and included office, government administration and retail districts as well as a new Tōkyō train station and highway links to other parts of Tōkyō. Residential areas were to be accommodated on parallel streets that ran perpendicular to the main linear axis and like the Boston Bay project, people would build their own houses within giant A-frame structures.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p123"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was designed by Tange and other members of his studio at Tōkyō University, including Kurokawa and [[Arata Isozaki]]. Originally it was intended to publish the plan at the World Design Conference (hence its "1960" title) but it was delayed because the same  members were working on the Conference organisation.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p144-145"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt; Tange received interest and support from a number of government agencies but the project was never built.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt; Tange went on to expand the idea of the linear city in 1964 with the [[Tōkaidō (region)|Tōkaidō]] Megalopolis Plan. This was an ambitious proposal to extend Tōkyō's linear city across the whole of the Tōkaidō region of Japan in order to re-distribute the population.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p680"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 680&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kikutake and Kurokawa capitalised on the interest in Tange's 1960 plan by producing their own schemes for Tōkyō. Kikutake's plan incorporated three elements both on the land and the sea and included a looped highway that connected all the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] around the bay. Unlike Tange however its simple presentation graphics put many people off. Kurokawa's plan consisted of helix-shaped megastructures floating inside cells that extended out across the bay. Although the scheme's more convincing graphics were presented as part of a film the project was not built.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;

With Japan's [[Japanese asset price bubble|property boom]] in the 1980s, both Tange and Kurokawa revisited their earlier ideas: Tange with his Tōkyō Plan 1986 and Kurokawa with his New Tōkyō Plan 2025. Both projects used land that had been reclaimed from the sea since the 1960s in combination with floating structures.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;

In 1961 Kenzo Tange received a commission from the Yamanashi News Group to design a new office in [[Kōfu, Yamanashi|Kōfu]]. As well as two news firms and a printing company the building needed to incorporate a cafeteria and shops at ground floor level to interface with the adjoining city. It also needed to be flexible in its design to allow future expansion.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p179-180"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

Tange organised the spaces of the three firms by function to allow them to share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there was room for vertical expansion.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p179-180"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the building was expanded in 1974 as Tange had originally envisioned,&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p363"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; it did not act as a catalyst for the expansion of the building into a megastructure across the rest of the city. The building was criticised for forsaking the human use of the building in preference to the structure and adaptability.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p186"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower===

In 1966 Tange designed the Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower in the [[Ginza]] district of Tōkyō. This time using only a single core Tange arranged the offices as cantilevered steel and glass boxes. The cantilever is emphasised by punctuating the three storey blocks with a single storey glazed balcony.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p188"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete forms of the building were cast using aluminium [[formwork]] and the aluminium has been left on as a cladding.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p135"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Although conceived as a "core-type" system that was included in Tange's other city proposals, the tower stands alone and is robbed of other connections.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p188"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nakagin Capsule Tower===

The icon of Metabolism, Kurokawa's [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]] was erected in the Ginza district of Tōkyō in 1972 and completed in just 30 days.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p388"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Prefabricated in [[Shiga Prefecture]] in a factory that normally built shipping containers, it is constructed of 140 capsules plugged into two cores that are 11 and 13 stories in height. The capsules contained the latest gadgets of the day and were built to house small offices and [[pied-à-terre|pieds-à-terre]] for Tōkyō [[Salaryman|salarymen]].&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p148-149"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

The capsules are constructed of light steel welded trusses covered with steel sheeting mounted onto the reinforced concrete cores. The capsules are 2.5 metres wide and four metres long with a 1.3 metre diameter window at one end. The units originally contained a bed, storage cabinets, a bathroom, a colour television set, clock, refrigerator and air conditioner, although optional extras such as a stereo were available. Although the capsules were designed with [[mass production]] in mind there was never a demand for them.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p148-149"/&gt; [[Nobuo Abe]], was a senior manager, managing one of the design divisions on the construction of the [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]]

Since 1996 the tower has been listed as an architectural heritage by [[Docomomo International|DoCoMoMo]]. However, in 2007 the residents voted to tear the tower down and build a new 14-storey tower. The tower still stands today and has approximately 15 people living inside. In 2010, the pods that are still safe to live in and not falling apart inside have become a hotel for a mere $30 American a night on average.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p233"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017 many capsules have been renovated and are being used as residential and office spaces, while short-stay renting such as Airbnb or other lodging provisions have been banned by the administration of the building.

===Hillside Terrace, Tōkyō===

After the World Design Conference Maki began to distance himself from Metabolist movement, although his studies in ''Group Form'' continued to be of interest to the Metabolists.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p23"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he published a booklet entitled ''Investigations in Collective Form'' in which he investigated three urban forms: Compositional-form, Megastructure and Group Form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p111"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The Hillside Terrace is a series of projects commissioned by the Asakura family and undertaken in seven phases from 1967 to 1992. It includes residential, office and cultural buildings as well as the Royal Danish Embassy and is situated on both sides of Kyū-Yamate avenue in the [[Daikanyamachō, Shibuya|Daikanyama]] district of Tōkyō.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p119"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution of the designs evolves through the phases with exterior forms becoming more independent of the interior functions and new materials being employed. For example, the first phase has a raised pedestrian deck that gives access to shops and a restaurant and this was designed to be extended in subsequent phases but the idea, along with the original master plan, was discarded in later phases.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p139"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; By the third phase Maki moved away from the Modernist maxim of ''form follows function'' and started to design the building exteriors to better match the immediate environment.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p157"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The project acted as a catalyst to the redevelopment of the whole area around [[Daikan-yama Station|Daikanyama Station]].&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p139"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism in context==

[[File:Tokyo 1945-3-10-1.jpg|thumb|Tōkyō after bombing, 1945]]

Metabolism developed during the post war period in a Japan that questioned its cultural identity. Initially the group had chosen the name ''Burnt Ash School'' to reflect the ruined state of firebombed Japanese cities and the opportunity they presented for radical re-building. Ideas of nuclear physics and biological growth were linked with [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] concepts of regeneration.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p287"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Although Metabolism rejected visual references from the past,&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p289"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; they embraced concepts of prefabrication and renewal from traditional Japanese architecture, especially the twenty-year cycle of the rebuilding of the [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise Shrine]] (to which Tange and Kawazoe were invited in 1953). The sacred rocks onto which the shrine is built were seen by the Metabolists as symbolising a Japanese spirit that predated [[Empire of Japan|Imperial]] aspirations and modernising influences from the West.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p290-291"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 290-292&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Investigations in Collective Form'' Maki coined the term ''Megastructure'' to refer structures that house the whole or part of a city in a single structure. He originated the idea from vernacular forms of village architecture that were projected into vast structures with the aid of modern technology. [[Reyner Banham]] borrowed ''Megastructure'' for the title of his 1976 book which contained numerous built and unbuilt projects. He defined ''Megastructures'' as modular units (with a short life span) that attached to structural framework (with a longer life span).&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p10"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Maki would later criticise the ''Megastructure'' approach to design advocating instead his idea of ''Group Form'' which he thought would better accommodate the disorder of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p11"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] readily interchanges the word Metabolism with [[Archigram]] in his 1968 book ''New Directions in Japanese Architecture''.&lt;ref name="Boyd 1968, p16"&gt;Boyd (1968), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the two groups both emerged in the 1960s and disbanded in the 1970s and used imagery with megastructures and cells, but their urban and architectural proposals were quite different. Although utopian in their ideals, the Metabolists were concerned with improving the social structure of society with their biologically inspired architecture, whereas Archigram were influenced by mechanics, information and electronic media and their architecture was more utopian and less social.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p11"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Osaka Expo, 1970==

[[File:Osaka Expo'70 Festival Plaza.jpg|thumb|The roof of the Festival Plaza, Osaka Expo 1970]]
[[File:EXPO TOWER.JPG|thumb|Kikutake's Expo Tower, Osaka Expo 1970]]
[[File:Toshiba-IHI Pavilion.jpg|thumb|Kurokawa's Toshiba-IHI Pavilion, Osaka Expo 1970]]

Japan was selected as the site for the  [[Expo '70|1970 World Exposition]] and 330 hectares in the Senri Hills in [[Osaka Prefecture]] were set aside as the location.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p282"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Japan had originally wanted to host a World Exposition in 1940 but it was cancelled with the escalation of the war. The one million people who had bought tickets for 1940 were allowed to use them in 1970.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 506-507&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenzo Tange joined the Theme Committee for the Expo and along with Uso Nishiyama he had responsibility for master planning the site. The theme for the Expo became "Progress and Harmony for Mankind". Tange invited twelve architects, including [[Arata Isozaki]], Otaka and Kikutake to design individual elements.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p282"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; He also asked Ekuan to oversee the design of the furniture and transportation and Kawazoe to curate the Mid-Air Exhibition which was sited in the huge space-frame roof.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"/&gt;

Tange envisioned that the Expo should be primarily conceived as a big festival where human beings could meet. Central to the site he placed the Festival Plaza onto which were connected a number of themed displays, all of which were united under one huge roof.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p284"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; In his Tōkyō Bay Project Tange spoke about the living body having two types of information transmission systems: fluid and electronic. That project used the idea of a tree trunk and branches that would carry out those types of transmission in relation to the city. Kawazoe likened the [[space frame]] roof of the Festival Plaza to the electronic transmission system and the aerial-themed displays that plugged into it to the hormonal system.&lt;ref name="Tange &amp; Kawazoe, p31"&gt;Tange &amp; Kawazoe (1970), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawazoe, Maki and Kurokawa had invited a selection of world architects to design displays for the Mid-Air Exhibition that was to be incorporated within the roof. The architects included [[Moshe Safdie]], [[Yona Friedman]], [[Hans Hollein]] and [[Giancarlo De Carlo]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p516"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tange was obsessed with the theory of flexibility that the space framed provide he did concede that in reality it was not so practical for the actual fixing of the displays.&lt;ref name="Tange &amp; Kawazoe, p31"/&gt; The roof itself was designed by Koji Kamaya and Mamoru Kawaguchi who conceived it as a huge space frame. Kawaguchi invented a welding-free [[ball joint]] to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the frame on the ground before raising it using [[Jack (device)|jacks]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p511"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikutake's Expo Tower was situated on the highest hill in the grounds and acted as a landmark for visitors. It was built of a vertical ball and joint space onto which was attached a series of cabins. The design was to have been a blueprint for flexible vertical living based upon a 360m3 standard construction cabin clad with a membrane of cast aluminium and glass that could be flexibly arranged anywhere on the tower. This was demonstrated with a variety of cabins that were observation platforms and VIP rooms and one cabin at ground level that became an information booth.&lt;ref name="Kikutake Assocs, p69"&gt;Kikutake Assocs (1970), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurokawa had won commissions for two corporate pavilions: the Takara Beautillion and the Toshiba IHI pavilion.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p507"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; The former of these was composed of capsules plugged onto six point frames and was assembled in just six days; the latter was a space frame composed of tetrahedron modules, based upon his Helix City that could grow in 14 different directions and resemble organic growth.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p528-530"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 528-530&lt;/ref&gt;

Expo '70 has been described has the apotheosis of the Metabolist movement.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"/&gt; But even before Japan's period of rapid economic growth ended with the [[1973 oil crisis|world energy crisis]], critics were calling the Expo a dystopia that was removed from reality.&lt;ref name="Sasaki, p143"&gt;Sasaki (1970), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The energy crisis demonstrated Japan's reliance both on imported oil and led to a re-evaluation of design and planning with architects moving away from utopian projects towards smaller urban interventions.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p228"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

[[File:Model of Aquapolis.JPG|thumb|Model of the Aquapolis, Okinawa Ocean Expo 1975]]
[[File:Kuwait Embassy and Chancellery in Japan.jpg|thumb|Kuwait Embassy and Chancellery of Japan (1970)]]

After the 1970 Expo, Tange and the Metabolists turned their attention away from Japan towards the Middle East and Africa. These countries were expanding on the back of income from oil and were fascinated by both Japanese culture and the expertise that the Metabolists brought to urban planning.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p591"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; Tange and Kurokawa capitalised on the majority of the commissions, but Kikutake and Maki were involved too.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p594-595"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 594-595&lt;/ref&gt;

Tange's projects included a 57,000 seat stadium and sports center in [[Riyadh]] for [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]], and a sports city for [[Kuwait]] for the planned 1974 Pan Arab Games. However, both were put on hold by the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War|Fourth Arab-Israeli War]] in 1973. Likewise, the plan for a new city center in [[Tehran]] was cancelled after the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]]. He did however complete the Kuwaiti Embassy in Tōkyō in 1970 and Kuwait's International Airport.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p606-610"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 606-610&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurokawa's work included a competition win for [[Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi's]] National Theatre (1977), capsule-tower designs for a hotel in [[Baghdad]] (1975) and a city in the desert in [[Libya]] (1979–1984).&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p620-630"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 620-630&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikutake's vision for floating towers was partly realised in 1975 when he designed and built the Aquapolis for the [[Expo '75|Okinawa Ocean Expo]]. The 100 x 100 meter floating city block contained accommodation that included a banquet hall, offices and residences for 40 staff and it was built in [[Hiroshima]] and then towed to [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p152-153"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt; Further unbuilt floating city projects were undertaken, including a floating city in [[Hawaii]] for ocean research and a plug-in floating A-frame unit containing housing and offices that could have been used to provide mobile homes in the event of a natural disaster.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p673-675"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 673-675&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Art Education Association''' (NAEA) is a [[professional association]] founded in 1947 in the United States. It is the world's largest professional [[art education]] association.

The NAEA's annual convention attracts thousands of art educators and offers art educators a chance to network, establish mentor relationships, and attend professional development events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=talkbackCommentsFull&amp;talk_back_header_id=6649576&amp;articleid=CA6726768 Melissa Techman, "Art Teachers Bring 21st-Century Vision to 2010 Conference", ''School Library Journal'', Apr. 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAEA also gives awards for Art Educator of the Year at this convention.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/life/stories/2010/04/19/1a-showtell19-art-gj686cra-1.html?sid=101 "OSU educator honored", ''The Columbus Dispatch'', Apr. 19, 2010], [http://kohd.com/page/170770 "Oregon's Best Art Teacher Selected from Bend", KOHD.com, Apr. 20, 2010], [http://www.dentonrc.com/sharedcontent/dws/drc/entertainment/stories/DRC_artbriefs_0418.25ac6816d.html "UNT art professor wins national award", ''Denton Record-Chronicle'', Apr. 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute]], in 1969, the NAEA began sponsoring March as [[Youth Art Month]].  Since 1984, Youth Art Month has been run by the [[Council for Art Education, Inc.]], which consists of representatives of the NAEA and other art associations.

As an advocacy organization, the NAEA speaks out in favor of increased funding for art education, and opposing cuts to art funding.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://peoplesworld.org/emergency-funding-urged-to-prevent-worst-school-cuts-in-50-years/ Susan Webb, "Emergency funding urged to prevent worst school cuts in 50 years", ''People's World'', Apr. 21, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAEA publishes two journals, ''Art Education'' and ''Studies in Art Education''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/publisher/naea Publisher Information from Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''note''' is a string of text placed at the bottom of a [[page (paper)|page]] in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text.  The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or [[citation]]s of a reference work in support of the text, or both.

'''Footnotes''' are notes at the foot of the page while '''endnotes''' are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work.  Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.

In some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.

== Numbering and symbols==

In English, a footnote is normally flagged by a [[superscript]]ed number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.

Typographical devices such as the [[asterisk]] (*) or [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is [[Asterisk|*]], [[Dagger (typography)|†]], [[Double dagger (typography)|‡]], [[Section sign|§]], [[Vertical Bar|‖]], [[Pilcrow|¶]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst (2005).  ''The Elements of Typographic Style'' (version 3.1).  Point Roberts, WA: Hartley and Marks. pp 68–69.  Bringhurst goes on to say “But beyond the ... double dagger, this order is not familiar to most readers, and never was.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symbols, including the [[Number Sign|#]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]], [[Lozenge|◊]], [[Arrow (symbol)|↓]], and [[Index (typography)|☞]], have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_001.pdf|author=William H. Sherman|title=Toward a History of the Manicule|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many of these symbols are used, for example, in [[John Bach McMaster]], ''History of the People of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; In documents like [[Public transport timetable|timetables]], many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.

== Academic usage==
Notes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the [[Modern Language Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]]) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.

In particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.

The MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Aside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:
* As signposts to direct the reader to information the author has provided or where further useful information is pertaining to the subject in the main text.
* To attribute a quote or viewpoint.
* As an alternative to parenthetical references; it is a simpler way to acknowledge information gained from another source.
* To escape the limitations imposed on the [[word count]] of various academic and legal texts which do not take into account notes. Aggressive use of this strategy can lead to a text affected by "foot and note disease" (a derogation coined by [[John Betjeman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Timothy|title=Rupert Brooke: Man and Monument|journal=English|year=1968|volume=17|issue=99|pages=79–84|url=http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/99/79.full.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2011|doi=10.1093/english/17.99.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

''The Independent'', Thursday 27 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government documents==
The [[US Government Printing Office]] Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 15: Footnotes, indexes, contents, and outlines | work=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-17.htm | accessdate=October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Guide to Footnotes and Endnotes for NASA History Authors | work=NASA History Style Guide | url=https://history.nasa.gov/footnoteguide.html | accessdate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal writing==
Associate Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=In Justice Breyer's Opinion, A Footnote Has No Place | date=1995-07-28 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC163EF93BA15754C0A963958260 | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A. Posner]] has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions.&lt;ref name=Posner2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|title=Against Footnotes|journal=Court Review|date=Summer 2001|url=http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-13|publisher=American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bryan A. Garner]], however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oddi |first=Marcia |url=http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2005/01/indiana_courts_99.html |title=Indiana Courts - Footnotes in Judicial Opinions |publisher=The Indiana Law Blog |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HTML==
[[HTML]], the predominant [[markup language]] for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the [[working group]] has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, [[MediaWiki]], for example, has had to introduce its own &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the ''[[Nelson (HTML preprocessor)|Nelson]]'' HTML preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nelson HTML Preprocessor | url=http://nelsonhtml.com | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be argued that the [[hyperlink]] partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jill Lepore]].

==History==
The sign is historically equal to the [[asterisks]] used by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] at the [[Musaeum|Mouseion at Alexandria]]. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it "marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage" and was used together with other signs such as the [[obelus]].&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson. Scribes and Scholars: A guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature. Oxford University Press, 1991, 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-19-872146-3}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The London printer [[Richard Jugge]] is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Zerby, ''The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes'', 2007, {{ISBN|1931229058}}, p. 28 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.

==Literary device==
At times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.

* [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' uses footnotes along with left and right marginal notes in Book II Chapter 2. The three types of notes represent comments from the three siblings doing their homework: Shem, Shaun, and Issy.
* [[J.G. Ballard]]'s  "Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown," is one sentence ("A discharged Broadmoor patient compiles 'Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown,' recalling his wife's murder, his trial and exoneration.") and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.
*[[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' uses what are arguably some of the most extensive and intricate footnotes in literature. Throughout the novel, footnotes are used to tell several different narratives outside of the main story. The physical orientation of the footnotes on the page also works to reflect the twisted feeling of the plot (often taking up several pages, appearing mirrored from page to page, vertical on either side of the page, or in boxes in the center of the page, in the middle of the central narrative).
* [[Flann O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Third Policeman]]'' utilizes extensive and lengthy footnotes for the discussion of a fictional philosopher, [[de Selby]]. These footnotes span several pages and often overtake the main plotline, and add to the absurdist tone of the book.
* [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' includes over 400 endnotes, some over a dozen pages long. Several literary critics suggested that the book be read with two bookmarks.  Wallace uses footnotes, endnotes, and in-text notes in much of his other writing as well.
*[[Manuel Puig]]'s ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (originally published in Spanish as ''El beso de la mujer araña'') also makes extensive use of footnotes.
*[[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]]'' includes lengthy footnotes and a parallel narrative.
*[[Mark Dunn]]'s ''[[Ibid: A Life]]'' is written entirely in endnotes.
*[[Luis d'Antin van Rooten]]'s ''[[Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames]]'' (the title is in [[French language|French]], but when pronounced, sounds similar to the [[English language|English]] ''"Mother Goose Rhymes"''), in which he is allegedly the editor of a manuscript by the fictional François Charles Fernand d’Antin, contains copious footnotes purporting to help explain the nonsensical French text. The point of the book is that each written French poem ''sounds'' like an English [[nursery rhyme]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] has made numerous uses within his novels. The footnotes will often set up running jokes for the rest of the novel.
*[[B.L.A.]] and [[G.B. Gabbler]]'s meta novel ''[[The Automation]]'' makes uses of footnotes to break the [[fourth wall]]. The narrator of the novel, known as "B.L.A.," tells the fantastical story as if true, while the editor, Gabbler, annotates the story through footnotes and thinks the manuscript is only a [[prose poem]] attempting to be a literary masterwork.
*[[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'' uses dozens of footnotes referencing a number of fictional books including magical scholarship and biographies.
*[[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[The Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' uses footnotes to insert comical remarks and explanations by one of the protagonists, Bartimaeus.
*[[Michael Gerber (parodist)|Michael Gerber]]'s ''[[Barry Trotter]]'' parody series used footnotes to expand [[one-line joke]]s in the text into paragraph-long comedic monologues that would otherwise break the flow of the narrative.
*[[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''[[An Abundance of Katherines]]'' uses footnotes in which he says: "[They] can allow you to create a kind of secret second narrative, which is important if, say, you're writing a book about what a story is and whether stories are significant."{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* Dr Carol Bolton uses extensive footnotes to provide the modern reader with a cipher for a novel about the travels of the fictional Spanish traveller [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275996974_Through_Spanish_Eyes_Robert_Southey's_Double_Vision_in_Letters_from_England_By_Don_Manuel_Alvarez_Espriella_%281807%29 Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella], an early 19th-century construct of Robert Southey's, designed to provide him with vehicle to critique the societal habits of the day.
*[[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series exploits the use of footnotes as a communication device (the ''footnoterphone'') which allows communication between the main character’s universe and the fictional bookworld.
*[[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Natural History of the Dead]]'' uses a footnote to further satirize the style of a history while making a sardonic statement about the extinction of "humanists" in modern society.
*[[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' follows each brief entry with a footnote (often five or six times the length of the main text) in which saints, historical figures, and other topics are used as examples for philosophical digression.  The separate footnotes are designed to contradict each other, and only when multiple footnotes are read together is Bayle's core argument for [[Fideism|Fideistic skepticism]] revealed.  This technique was used in part to evade the harsh censorship of 17th century France.
*[[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[Barney's Version (novel)|Barney's Version]]'' uses footnotes as a character device that highlights unreliable passages in the narration. As the editor of his father's autobiography, the narrator's son must correct any of his father's misstated facts. The frequency of these corrections increases as the father falls victim to both hubris and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. While most of these changes are minor, a few are essential to plot and character development.
*In [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the main plot is told through the annotative endnotes of a fictional editor.
*''[[Bartleby y Compañía]],'' a novel by [[Enrique Vila-Matas]], is stylized as footnotes to a nonexistent novel.
*The works of [[Jack Vance]] often have footnotes, detailing and informing the reader of the background of the world in the novel.
*[[Stephen Colbert]]'s ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'' uses both footnotes and margin notes to offer additional commentary and humor.
*[[Doug Dorst]]'s novel ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' uses footnotes to explore the story and relationship of characters V.M. Straka and F.X. Caldeira.

[[File:Parchment from goatskin.jpg|right|thumb|Central European (Northern) type of finished parchment made of [[goatskin (material)|goatskin]] stretched on a wooden frame]]
[[File:קלף, נוצה ודיו.jpg|thumb|Parchment with a quill and ink]]
'''Parchment''' is a writing material made from specially prepared untanned skins of animals—primarily sheep, calves, and goats. It has been used as a writing medium for over two millennia. [[Vellum]] is a finer quality parchment made from the skins of young animals such as lambs and young calves.

It may be called '''animal membrane''' by libraries and museums that wish to avoid distinguishing between "parchment" and the more restricted term vellum (see below).

== Parchment and vellum ==
Today the term "parchment" is often used in non-technical contexts to refer to any animal skin, particularly [[goat]], [[sheep]] or [[cow]], that has been scraped or dried under tension. The term originally referred only to the skin of sheep and, occasionally, goats. The equivalent material made from calfskin, which was of finer quality, was known as [[vellum]] (from the [[Old French]] ''velin'' or ''vellin'', and ultimately from the [[Latin]] ''vitulus'', meaning a calf);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Roy|title=Conservation of Leather and Related Materials |year=2007 |publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-7506-4881-3|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the finest of all was "uterine vellum", taken from a calf [[foetus]] or [[stillbirth|stillborn]] calf.

Some authorities have sought to observe these distinctions strictly: for example, [[lexicographer]] [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1755, and master [[calligrapher]] [[Edward Johnston]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Johnston |authorlink=Edward Johnston |year=1906 |title=Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering |place=London |publisher=John Hogg }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when old books and documents are encountered it may be difficult, without scientific analysis, to determine the precise animal origin of a skin either in terms of its species, or in terms of the animal's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Cains |chapter=The surface examination of skin: a binder's note on the identification of animal species used in the making of parchment |title=The Book of Kells: proceedings of a conference at Trinity College Dublin, 6–9 September 1992 |editor-first=Felicity |editor-last=O'Mahony |publisher=Scolar Press |place=Aldershot |year=1994 |isbn=0-85967-967-5 |pages=172–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, therefore, there has long been considerable blurring of the boundaries between the different terms. In 1519, [[William Horman]] wrote in his ''Vulgaria'': "That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan."&lt;ref&gt;William Horman, ''Vulgaria'' (1519), fol. 80v; cited in Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (written c. 1599–1602) the following exchange occurs:
{{quote|''Hamlet.'' Is not parchment made of sheepskins?&lt;br /&gt;
''Horatio.'' Ay, my lord, and of calves' skins too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Shakecite|Ham|M|5|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lee Ustick, writing in 1936, commented that:
{{quote|To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that ''vellum'' is a highly refined form of skin, ''parchment'' a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.&lt;ref&gt;Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is for these reasons that many modern [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[librarian]]s and [[archivist]]s prefer to use either the broader term "parchment", or the neutral term "animal membrane".&lt;ref&gt;Stokes and Almagno 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Permennter-1568.png|thumb|upright|German parchmenter, 1568]]

The word parchment evolved (via the Latin ''pergamenum'' and the French ''parchemin'') from the name of the city of [[Pergamon]] which was a thriving center of parchment production during the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443382/parchment |title=parchment (writing material) |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |year=2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705155624/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443382/parchment |archive-date=2012-07-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city so dominated the trade that a legend later arose which said that parchment had been invented in Pergamon to replace the use of [[papyrus]] which had become monopolized by the rival city of [[Alexandria]]. This account, originating in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', Book XII, 69–70), is dubious because parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Peter |title=Alexander to Actium: the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age |place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1990 |isbn=0520056116 |page=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentions writing on skins as common in his time, the 5th century BC; and in his ''Histories'' (v.58) he states that the Ionians of Asia Minor had been accustomed to give the name of ''skins'' (''diphtherai'') to books; this word was adapted by Hellenized Jews to describe scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/parchmen.html |title=Parchment |author=Meir Bar-Ilan |website=Bar-Ilan University – Faculty Members Homepages |access-date=2005-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050422080330/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~barilm/parchmen.html |archive-date=2005-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century BC, [[Library of Pergamum|a great library]] was set up in Pergamon that rivaled the famous [[Library of Alexandria]]. As prices rose for papyrus and the reed used for making it was over-harvested towards local extinction in the two [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] of the [[Nile delta]] that produced it, Pergamon adapted by increasing use of parchment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/blog/post/the-history-of-vellum-and-parchment|title=The History Of Vellum And Parchment {{!}} The New Antiquarian {{!}} The Blog of The Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America|last=|first=|date=|website=www.abaa.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830081534/https://www.abaa.org/Blog/post/the-history-of-vellum-and-parchment|archive-date=30 August 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Writing on prepared animal skins had a long history, however. [[David Diringer]] noted that "the first mention of Egyptian documents written on leather goes back to the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (c. 2550–2450 BC), but the earliest of such documents extant are: a fragmentary roll of leather of the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (c. 24th century BC), unrolled by Dr. H. Ibscher, and preserved in the [[Cairo Museum]]; a roll of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] (c. 1990–1777 BC) now in Berlin; the mathematical text now in the [[British Museum]] (MS. 10250); and a document of the reign of [[Ramses II]] (early thirteenth century BC)."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Diringer]], ''The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Assyria]]ns and the [[Babylonians]] impressed their [[cuneiform]] on clay tablets, they also wrote on parchment from the 6th century BC onward. [[Rabbinic literature]] traditionally maintains that the institution of employing parchment made of animal hides for the writing of ritual objects such as the [[Torah]], [[mezuzah]], and [[tefillin]] is [[Revelation at Sinai|Sinaitic]] in origin, with special designations for different types of parchment such as [[gevil]] and [[klaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillin 1:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic texts are also found on parchment.

In the later [[Middle Ages]], especially the 15th century, parchment was largely replaced by [[paper]] for most uses except luxury manuscripts, some of which were also on paper. New techniques in paper milling allowed it to be much cheaper than parchment; it was made of textile rags and of very high quality. With the advent of [[printing]] in the later fifteenth century, the demands of printers far exceeded the supply of animal skins for parchment.

[[File:NLW Penrice and Margam Deeds 204 front (8634702372).jpg|thumb|left|Latin [[Grant (money)|grant]] written on fine parchment or [[vellum]] with [[seal (device)|seal]] dated 1329]]

There was a short period during the introduction of printing where parchment and paper were used at the same time, with parchment (in fact vellum) the more expensive luxury option, preferred by rich and conservative customers. Although most copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] are on paper, some were printed on parchment; 12 of the 48 surviving copies, with most incomplete. In 1490, [[Johannes Trithemius]] preferred the older methods, because "handwriting placed on parchment will be able to endure a thousand years. But how long will printing last, which is dependent on paper? For if ... it lasts for two hundred years that is a long time."&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in David McKitterick, ''Print, Manuscript, and the Search for Order'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In fact high quality paper from this period has survived 500 years or more very well, if kept in reasonable library conditions.

The heyday of parchment use was during the medieval period, but there has been a growing revival of its use among artists since the late 20th century. Although parchment never stopped being used (primarily for governmental documents and diplomas) it had ceased to be a primary choice for artist's supports by the end of 15th century [[Renaissance]]. This was partly due to its expense and partly due to its unusual working properties. Parchment consists mostly of [[collagen]]. When the water in paint media touches parchment's surface, the collagen melts slightly, forming a raised bed for the paint, a quality highly prized by some artists.

Parchment is also extremely affected by its environment and changes in humidity, which can cause buckling. Books with parchment pages were bound with strong wooden boards and clamped tightly shut by metal (often brass) clasps or leather straps;&lt;ref name="pul" /&gt; this acted to keep the pages pressed flat despite humidity changes. Such metal fittings continued to be found on books as decorative features even after the use of paper made them unnecessary.&lt;ref name="pul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/closures/index.html |title=Clasps, Furniture, and Other Closures |author= |year=2004 |work=Hand Bookindings |publisher=Princeton University Library |accessdate=4 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208042037/http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/hb/cases/closures/index.html |archive-date=2011-12-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary artists prize the changeability of parchment, noting that the material seems alive and like an active participant in making artwork. To support the needs of the revival of use by artists, a revival in the art of preparing individual skins is also underway. Hand-prepared skins are usually preferred by artists because they are more uniform in surface and have fewer oily spots which can cause long-term cracking of paint than mass-produced parchment, which is usually made for lamp shades, furniture, or other interior design purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of current artists using parchment see:

The [[radiocarbon dating]] techniques that are used on papyrus can be applied to parchment as well. They do not date the age of the writing but the preparation of the parchment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=F.J.|last2=Gomez-Martinez|first2=I.|last3=Garcia-Leon|first3=M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of medieval manuscripts from the University of Seville|url=http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/75115/4/Radiocarbon%20dating.pdf|format=PDF|website=[[Digital.csic.es]]|access-date=2015-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102317/http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/75115/4/Radiocarbon%20dating.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is feasibly possible also to radio carbon date certain kinds of ink, it is extremely difficult to do due to the fact that they are generally present on the text only in trace amounts, and it is hard to get a carbon sample of them without the carbon in the parchment contaminating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stolte|first=D.|year=2011|title=UA experts determine age of book 'nobody can read'|url=http://uanews.org/story/ua-experts-determine-age-book-nobody-can-read|website=www.uanews.org|access-date=2015-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404164910/http://uanews.org/story/ua-experts-determine-age-book-nobody-can-read|archive-date=2015-04-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
Parchment is prepared from pelt&amp;nbsp;– i.e. wet, unhaired, and limed skin&amp;nbsp;– by drying at ordinary temperatures under tension, most commonly on a wooden frame known as a stretching frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reed |first=Ronald |title=Ancient Skins Parchments and Leathers |year=1972 |publisher=Seminar Press |place=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flaying, soaking, and dehairing ===
After being flayed, the skin is soaked in water for about a day. This removes blood and grime from the skin and prepares it for a dehairing liquor.&lt;ref name='reed75'&gt;Reed, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The dehairing liquor was originally made of rotted, or fermented, vegetable matter, like beer or other liquors, but by the [[Middle Ages]] an unhairing bath included [[lime (mineral)|lime]]. Today, the lime solution is occasionally sharpened by the use of sodium sulfide. The liquor bath would have been in wooden or stone vats and the hides stirred with a long wooden pole to avoid human contact with the [[alkaline]] solution. Sometimes the skins would stay in the unhairing bath for eight or more days depending how concentrated and how warm the solution was kept—unhairing could take up to twice as long in winter. The vat was stirred two or three times a day to ensure the solution's deep and uniform penetration. Replacing the lime water bath also sped the process up. However, if the skins were soaked in the liquor too long, they would be weakened and not able to stand the stretching required for parchment.&lt;ref name='reed75' /&gt;

=== Stretching ===
After soaking in water to make the skins workable, the skins were placed on a stretching frame. A simple frame with nails would work well in stretching the pelts. The skins could be attached by wrapping small, smooth rocks in the skins with rope or leather strips. Both sides would be left open to the air so they could be scraped with a sharp, [[blade#Patterns of knife blades|semi-lunar knife]] to remove the last of the hair and get the skin to the right thickness. The skins, which were made almost entirely of [[collagen]], would form a natural glue while drying and once taken off the frame they would keep their form. The stretching aligned the fibres to be more nearly parallel to the surface.

== Treatments ==
{{See also|Purple parchment}}
To make the parchment more aesthetically pleasing or more suitable for the [[scribe]]s, special treatments were used. According to Reed there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing [[pumice]] powder into the flesh side of parchment while it was still wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run. To make the parchment smooth and white, thin pastes (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.&lt;ref&gt;See for example recipes in the [[Secretum Philosophorum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meliora di Curci in her paper "The History and Technology of Parchment Making" notes that parchment was not always white. "[[Cennino Cennini|Cennini]], a 15th century craftsman provides recipes to tint parchment a variety of colours including purple, indigo, green, red and peach." The Early medieval [[Codex Argenteus]] and [[Codex Vercellensis]], the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] and the [[Codex Brixianus]] give a range of luxuriously produced manuscripts all on [[purple vellum]], in imitation of Byzantine examples, like the [[Rossano Gospels]], [[Sinope Gospels]] and the [[Vienna Genesis]], which at least at one time are believed to have been reserved for Imperial commissions.

Many techniques for [[parchment repair]] exist, to restore creased, torn, or incomplete parchments.

=== Reuse ===
{{Main|Palimpsest}}
During the seventh through the ninth centuries, many earlier parchment manuscripts were scrubbed and scoured to be ready for rewriting, and often the earlier writing can still be read. These recycled parchments are called [[palimpsest]]s. Later, more thorough techniques of scouring the surface irretrievably lost the earlier text.

== Jewish parchment ==

{{See also|Gevil|Klaf|Duchsustus}}
The way in which parchment was processed (from hide to parchment) has undergone a tremendous evolution based on time and location. Parchment and vellum are not the sole methods of preparing animal skins for writing. In the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Bava Batra]] 14B) Moses writes the first Torah Scroll on the unsplit cow-hide called ''[[gevil]]''.

Parchment is still the only medium used by traditional [[religious]] [[Jews]] for [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] or [[tefilin]] and [[mezuzah]]s, and is produced by large companies in [[Israel]]. For those uses, only hides of [[kosher]] animals are permitted. Since there are many requirements for it being fit for the religious use, the liming is usually processed under supervision of a qualified [[Rabbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccdesigninc.com/MishmeresStam/Leaflet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Information Leaflet by Vaad Mishmereth Staam |website=CC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410134250/http://www.ccdesigninc.com/MishmeresStam/Leaflet.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional uses of the term ==
In some universities, the word parchment is still used to refer to the certificate (scroll) presented at graduation ceremonies, even though the modern document is printed on paper or thin card; although doctoral graduates may be given the option of having their scroll written by a calligrapher on vellum. The [[University of Notre Dame]] still uses animal parchment for its [[diploma]]s. Similarly, [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]] use goat skin parchment for their degrees.

=== Plant-based parchment ===
{{See also|Parchment paper (baking)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
'''Vegetable (paper) parchment''' is made by passing a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into [[sulfuric acid]]. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.

Other processes can be used to obtain grease-resistant paper, such as waxing the paper or using [[fluorine]]-based chemicals. Highly beating the fibers gives an even more translucent paper with the same grease resistance. Silicone and other coatings may also be applied to the parchment. A [[silicone]]-coating treatment produces a cross-linked material with high density, stability and heat resistance and low surface tension which imparts good anti-stick or release properties. [[Chromium]] salts can also be used to impart moderate anti-stick properties.

== Parchment craft ==
{{Main|Parchment craft}}
Historians believe that parchment craft originated as an art form in Europe during the fifteenth or sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Parchment craft at that time occurred principally in Catholic communities, where crafts persons created lace-like items such as devotional pictures and communion cards. The craft developed over time, with new techniques and refinements being added. Until the sixteenth century, parchment craft was a European art form. However, missionaries and other settlers relocated to South America, taking parchment craft with them. As before, the craft appeared largely among the Catholic communities. Often, young girls receiving their first communion received gifts of handmade parchment crafts.

Although the invention of the printing press led to a reduced interest in hand made cards and items, by the eighteenth century, people were regaining interest in detailed handwork. Parchment cards became larger in size and crafters began adding wavy borders and perforations. In the nineteenth century, influenced by French romanticism, parchment crafters began adding floral themes and cherubs and hand embossing.

Parchment craft today involves various techniques, including tracing a pattern with white or colored ink, embossing to create a raised effect, stippling, perforating, coloring and cutting. Parchment craft appears in hand made cards, as scrapbook embellishments, as bookmarks, lampshades, decorative small boxes, wall hangings and more.

== DNA testing ==
An article published in 2009 by Timothy L. Stinson considered the possibilities of tracing the origin of medieval parchment manuscripts and codices through [[DNA]] analysis. The methodology would employ [[polymerase chain reaction]] to replicate a small DNA sample to a size sufficiently large for testing. A 2006 study had revealed the genetic signature of several Greek manuscripts to have "goat-related sequences". It might be possible to use these techniques to determine whether related library materials were made from genetically related animals (perhaps from the same herd).&lt;ref&gt;Stinson 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Method acting]] is employed by actors to evoke realistic emotions into their performance by drawing on personal experiences. Raymond Hamden, doctor of Clinical and Forensic Psychology, defines the purpose of method acting as “compartmentalizing their own feelings while playing another character [so] they could bring the emotions of that personal feeling to cry if they needed to with that character.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when these emotions are not compartmentalized, they can encroach on other facets of life, often seeming to disrupt the actor’s psyche. This occurs as the actor delves into previous emotional experiences, be they joyful or traumatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological effects, like emotional fatigue, comes when suppressed or unresolved raw emotions are unburied to add to the character,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; not just from the employing personal emotions in performance. The question becomes whether the actor calls up resolved or unresolved emotions in their acting.

== Psychological effects ==
The psychological effects of method acting vary in intensity from individual to individual. Some common effects include; 
*Fatigue
*Fear
*Anxiety
*Shame
*Sleep deprivation
*Personality changes
*Psychotic disorders.

Fatigue, or emotional fatigue, comes mainly when actors “create dissonance between their actions and their actual feelings.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGrandey|Grandey, Alicia A. “When ‘The Show Must Go On’: Surface Acting As Determinants of Emotional Exhaustion and Peer-Rated Service Delivery.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A mode of acting referred to as “surface acting” involves only changing one’s actions without altering the deeper thought processes. Method acting, when employed correctly, is mainly deep acting, or changing thoughts as well as actions, proven to generally avoid excessive fatigue. Surface acting is statistically “positively associated with a negative mood and this explains some of the association of surface acting with increased emotional exhaustion.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idJudge|Judge, Timothy A. “Is Emotional Labor More Difficult for Some than for Others? A Multi-level, Experience-sampling Study.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; This negative mood that is created leads to fear, anxiety, feelings of shame and sleep deprivation.

Raw emotion or unresolved emotions conjured up for acting, may result in a sleep deprivation and the cyclical nature of the ensuing side effects. [[Sleep deprivation]] alone can lead to impaired function, causing some individuals to “acute episodes of psychosis.” Sleep deprivation initiates chemical changes in the brain that can lead to behavior similar to psychotic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes can lead to more lasting psychological damage. In cases where raw emotion that has not been resolved, or traumas have been evoked before closure has been reached by the individual, the emotion can result in greater emotional instability and increased sense of anxiety, fear or shame.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem seen in method acting comes from the inability of actors to compartmentalize the emotions of the character from their own in daily life. Generally the actors who suffer personality changes and psychotic disorders already have some psychotic tendencies or are emotionally unstable. Those who have [[dissociative identity disorder]] “can’t recognize that the role isn’t theirs” and, even though these individuals appear normal, they have psychotic disorders that sometimes take months to identify.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Dissociative identity disorder is a chemically based disorder that results from “high stress and trauma.” What these individuals experience psychologically can further detriment their chemical and physiological makeup.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor that is rarely discussed when observing the emotional effects of method acting is that the individuals that practice method acting may already be emotionally unstable. Dr. Hamden notes that “many actors have had a traumatic life, [and] acting gives [them] the opportunity to be someone else.” &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals are already emotionally unstable and so the effects of method acting are more severe for them. It is only a minority of people, about 32%, that will have extreme traumatic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
In the professional acting field, most companies have a psychoanalyst that consults on films to give analysis and characteristics for characters. Their responsibility lies in aiding actors in understanding how the character would act. These professionals help when actors cannot relate. Their responsibility is to draw connections and pull raw emotions from the actor to connect with the character.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Under professional supervision, method acting proves safe and effective. Many actors find the practice of method acting cathartic, similar to psychiatrist Jacob L. Moreno’s [[psychodrama]]. In this technique, a professional aids in keeping the individual in alignment while they achieve closure for traumatic emotional damage. The harmful situations in method acting arise when there is no professional supervising the process, such as in “cult-like” weekend courses&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   provided by unqualified individuals that cannot monitor the individuals and keep them in alignment psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHamden2010|Hamden, Raymond. “Clinical and Forensic Psychology.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

This would be evident in weekend courses where the instructor promises to instruct method acting to a large public class, sometimes as many as one hundred people. The instructor would then be incapable of meeting the psychological needs of each individual in the class. Harmful psychological effects arise “when control of necessary skill falls short, [and] the balance [shifts] to the negative.” This occurs “because the [psychological] risks are in fact greater than anticipated, or because unanticipated obstacles or hurdles arise.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The acting situation then becomes threatening and results in the unpleasant feelings of fear, anxiety or shame.

=== Correlation between acting and physiology ===
It is commonly believed that there is a strong correlation between acting and the physiological reaction to acting. According to the task-emotion theory, “the positive emotions of the actor should be coupled with a specific physiological activation. In particular, excited physical reactions were expected to co-exist with task-emotions such as tension, excitement, and challenge.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The emotion-task theory proposes that “the ‘action tendencies’ in characters occupy a special place and differ somewhat from [the] impulses in general behavior.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, studies have been done that show that the correlation between emotions and physical reactions are moderately weak. .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger comes when control precedence “manifests itself by sudden interruptions of behavior, changes in behavior or by persistence of [character’s] behavior.”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   “Control precedence” by emotions is the “feelings, thoughts, impulses, actions or activation going along with aroused emotion that takes precedence over other planned or half executed thoughts, feelings, impulses, etc.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKonin|Konin, Elly A. “Acting Emotions: Shaping Emotions on Stage.”]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Control precedence is the main concern for method acting. It proves a challenge for actors to come out of character after employing method acting techniques, sometimes altering their behavior, urging them to follow impulses that would be foreign to their own personal nature. This difficulty of returning to one’s own behavior is the common concern linked with method acting.

'''Pull my finger''' is a [[joke]] or [[prank]] regarding [[flatulence]] in which a [[Mark (victim)|mark]] is asked to pull the finger of the joker, who simultaneously farts so as to suggest a [[causality|causal relationship]] between the two events. 

A comparable activity is attributed to a character in a short story by [[Mordecai Richler]] (collected in ''[[The Street (story collection)|The Street]]'', 1969):
{{cquote|He settled in sullenly at the kitchen table, his smile morose, and suddenly he would call out, "Pull my finger!" If you did he let out a tremendous burp.}}

A variation on this joke appears in [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s film ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' ([[1959 in film|1959]]). Schoolboys ask each other to push their foreheads, responding with an expulsion of gas.

In the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', a gas bomb hidden in a corpse has its timer started by pulling on the corpse's finger.

In 2008, an [[iPhone]] app from Air-O-Matic called Pull My Finger was one of the most popular apps in Apple's App Store, purchased over 50,000 times in less than one week.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It allowed users to pull a virtual finger, activating the sound.  The phrase is now the focus of a legal battle between Pull My Finger and InfoMedia's iFart Mobile app over the use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chartier |first=David |url=https://arstechnica.com/software/news/2009/02/prior-fart-legal-stink-up-over-iphone-flatulence-apps.ars |title=Prior fart: legal stink-up over iPhone flatulence apps |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an MRI study of how knuckles trigger popping sounds was jokingly called the "pull my finger study."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/health/pop-science-study-reveals-secret-behind-knuckle-cracking-sound-t15401 |title='Pull my finger': Study reveals secret behind knuckle-cracking pop|publisher=today.com |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9121">'''Professional [[social worker]]s''' are generally considered those who hold a professional degree in social work. In a number of countries and jurisdictions, [[Licensure|registration]] or [[licensure]] of people working as social workers is required and there are mandated qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW, 2005). NASW Fact Sheet. Retrieved November 15, 2006 from http://www.socialworkers.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, the professional association sets academic and experiential requirements for admission to membership.

==United States==
{{main|Council on Social Work Education|Master of Social Work}}

A social worker, practicing in the [[United States]], usually requires a [[doctoral degree]] (Ph.D or DSW), [[master's degree]] ([[Master of Social Work|MSW]]) or a [[bachelor's degree]] (BSW or BASW) in social work from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited program to receive a license in most states. In some areas, however, a social worker may be able to receive a license with a bachelor's or even associate degree{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} in any discipline. The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW) is the largest organization of professional social workers in the United States.

Depending on the university, the four-year degree may be structured in different ways and draws upon many fields, including social work theory, psychology, human development, sociology, social policy, research methods, social planning and social administration.

A person with a BSW is considered a "generalist" and the MSW is considered "a specialist or advanced generalist"; a Ph.D. or D.S.W. (Doctor of Social Work) generally conducts research, teaches, or analyzes policy, often in higher education settings.

Various states in the United States "protect" the use of the title social worker by statute.  Use of the title requires licensure or certification in most states. The licensure or certification also requires a prelicensure examination through the ASWB (Association of Social Work Boards), with the exception of the State of California, who creates and administers their own licensing exam. Over half of all states offer licensure at various levels of social work practice, and [[clinical social work]] is regulated by licensure in all states. The pass rate for the Master's level licensing exam is around 74%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aswb.org/SWLE/passrates.asp ASWB : : Social Work Licensing Exams] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416031049/http://www.aswb.org/SWLE/passrates.asp |date=April 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
A four-year Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) is required for entry into the field in most parts of Canada. In Alberta, the entry-level requirement is the diploma in social work practice. A Master's degree in Social Work (MSW) is usually required to provide psychotherapy treatment. Authorized Social Workers with advanced clinical certification in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan are allowed to independently use the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) in order to make a mental health diagnosis. These provinces hold a clinical registry for this purpose. In the province of Nova Scotia, MSW social workers can make provisional mental health diagnosis'.

In order to legally use the title "social worker", candidates must register with their provincial regulatory body. Some provinces also require an exam prerequisite for certification through the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB).

==United Kingdom==
The main qualification for social work is the [[undergraduate]] Bachelor's degree (BA, BSc or BSW) in social work, offered at [[British universities]] from September 2003 onwards. There is also available a master's degree (MA, MSc or MSW). These have replaced the previous qualifying award, the undergraduate Diploma in Social Work (DipSW), although the postgraduate counterpart, the postgraduate Diploma in Social Work (PGDipSW) is still awarded and allows the holder to register and practice as a social worker.  The DipSW was first awarded in 1991 and phased out across the UK by 2009. Prior to this, the recognised qualification was the Certificate of Qualification in Social Work (CQSW), awarded between 1975 and 1991.

Purporting to be either a social worker or a student social worker without registering with the relevant Social Work Register and holding or undergoing training for the recognised qualifications is now a [[criminal offence]]. Social workers must renew their registration every two years. These regulations offer protection to vulnerable people by guaranteeing the professional regulation of people working as social workers. They also promote workforce development, as all social workers must participate in at least fifteen days of professional training over a two-year period in order to be eligible for renewal of their registration.

Non-registered or non-qualified social care practitioners in the United Kingdom, often referred to as Social Services Assistants, Child and Family Workers or Community Care Assistant or Community Care Workers (not to be confused with domiciliary or care home care workers), are unregistered social care practitioners that often do not hold any formal social work qualification and they must practice under the direct supervision of a registered social worker. This is not the case in Scotland where the scope of [https://web.archive.org/web/20091023204444/http://www.sssc.uk.com/All+about+Registration/What+are+the+timescales+for+registration/What+are+the+timescales+for+registration.htm registration for social service workers] is more advanced.

Within the mental health sector in the United Kingdom, social workers can train as an [[Approved Mental Health Professional]] and [https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Applying%20for%20Approved%20Clinician%20Approval.pdf Approved Clinicians].  With the implementation of the [[Mental Health Act 2007]], this had replaced the previous [[Approved Social Worker]] role and is open to other professionals such as community psychiatric nurses, psychologists and occupational therapists, whilst maintaining a social work ethos. AMHPs are responsible for organising and contributing to assessments under the [[Mental Health Act 1983]], as amended by the Mental Health Act 2007.

After qualifying, social workers can undertake further training under the social work 'Post-Qualifying Framework'. Before 2007, there were four awards available under this framework:
*Post-Qualifying Award - for advanced social work practice and management
*Mental Health - Training to become an [[Approved Mental Health Professional]] or AMHP, which may lead to being appointed as an [https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Applying%20for%20Approved%20Clinician%20Approval.pdf Approved Clinician] with further postgraduate and doctorate training.  
*Child Care Award - qualification to work with children and young people
*Practice Teaching Award - qualification to work as a tutor, supervisor and assessor for social work students on their work placement

In 2007, the [[General Social Care Council]] and UK partners implemented a new framework which unified these awards in a simpler structure allowing broader study to count towards three levels of social work award: specialist, higher specialist, and advanced.

==Australia==
A four-year Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) is required for entry into the occupation of Social Worker in Australia, although some universities also offer a two-year, accelerated, graduate-entry MSW. Graduates of courses recognised by the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW) are eligible for membership. A person with overseas qualifications can apply for consideration of recognition of their qualifications via a formal application for assessment by the AASW. Australia is alone among developed [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]] [[OECD]] countries in having no [[licensure|registration]] requirements for social workers. Most employers stipulate that applicants must be ''eligible'' for membership of the [http://www.aasw.asn.au/membership-information/aasw-membership-eligibility-international-qualified-social-workers  AASW], and only graduates of courses recognised by the AASW are eligible for membership. However AASW membership is not compulsory and only a third of social workers are members.  Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is an ongoing requirement of accredited membership of the AASW and must incorporate accountability, gaining new knowledge and information &amp; skill development (CPD Policy 2011/12, AASW). No such requirement exists for non-members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasw.asn.au/whatwedo/registration-campaign AASW registration campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandinavia==
{{main|Socionom}}
''Socionom'' is the Swedish and Danish term for a person with a degree in social work and related subjects.  In Sweden the "socionom"/Bachelor of Social Work education is 3.5 years.

[[Image:Theodor Kittelsen, Soria Moria.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Soria Moria Castle|Soria Moria]]" by [[Theodor Kittelsen]]:  a hero glimpses the end of his quest.]]
{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">'''Refresher training''' is a form of updating military knowledge of the [[reservist]] troops. After one has completed the [[conscription]] service, he or she can be called for refresher training for some number of days.

==Refresher training in the Finnish Defence Forces==

In the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] (FDF) [[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] can be ordered to refresher training for 100 days in addition to their original military service and the [[Military rank|rank]] and file (privates and other lower ranks) for 75 or 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/reservilainen/index_en.dsp The Finnish Defence Forces: Reservist pages]&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of refresher training that a reservist is called to depends on the importance of the reservists assignment, [[Military deployment|deployment]], the amount of [[Special forces|special training]] (i.e. training that requires constant upkeep of skills) and willingness. The aim is to train the most important wartime units at intervals of about 5 years. The average duration of the exercises is approximately 5 days and nights. Many never get called to refresher training, some get called frequently and some even apply for voluntary additional training. The obligation for refresher training ends at the age of 60 for [[Officer (armed forces)|Officers]] and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and at 50 for the lower ranks.

==Refresher training in the Swedish Defence Forces==
As part of the changes in the post-[[Cold War]] reorganization if the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] from an invasion defence force to a targeted mission force, refresher training session were not held starting in the late 1990s. Refresher training was reintroduced by the [[Löfven Cabinet|Swedish government]] on December 11, 2014.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{cite web|title=Government reintroduces refresher training|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikle6043308|website=Sveriges Radio|publisher=Sveriges Radio|accessdate=December 11, 2014|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Materials, at the University of Manchester''' is a school of [[Materials science|Materials Science]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. The school is one of the largest departments in Europe that has a material science focus.{{fact|date=August 2016}} This is reflected by an annual research income of around £7m,{{fact|date=August 2016}} 60 academic staff, and a population of 150 research students and 60 [[postdoctoral research]] staff. 

==Teaching==
The School offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in all aspects of materials including materials engineering, biomaterials, corrosion protection, technical textiles, fashion and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419043134/http://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk/|archivedate=2016-04-19|url=http://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk|website=materials.manchester.ac.uk|publisher=University of Manchester|location=Manchester|title=School of Materials, University of Manchester|author=Anon|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In the 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] both the Material Science and Corrosion and Protection centre gained the highest rating, 5*. The School of Materials has also been ranked first for research power in the UK.

The school is unusual in that the Materials Science departments at [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST)]] and the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] were already joint before the merger of those two institutions in 2004.  The School also incorporates the Textiles, Paper Science and Corrosion &amp; Protection departments which were formerly part of UMIST.

==Senior staff==
{{As of|2016}} the head of school is Professor William Sampson.&lt;ref name=sampson&gt;{{cite web|first=Williams|last=Sampson|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012000055/http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/william.sampson/|title=Professor William Sampson (BSc (Hons), PhD, FIMMM)|publisher=University of Manchester|location=Manchester|website=manchester.ac.uk|archivedate=2015-10-12|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/william.sampson/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 to 2015 the head of School was Professor [[Paul O'Brien (chemist)|Paul O'Brien]] FRS.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;{{Who's Who | surname = O’BRIEN |othernames = Prof. Paul | id = U59835 | volume = 2013 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other senior academic staff include [[Philip J. Withers]] FRS, the [[Regius Professor]] of Materials.

==Buildings==
The Manchester Materials Science centre was one of the main buildings of the school until its demolition in 2016. {{As of|2016}} the centre will be replaced with the Manchester Engineering Campus Development (MECD).

Some Greek alphabet typefaces, especially historically, have been a closer simulation of handwriting.

==Styles==
{{see also|Samples of script typefaces}}
Script typefaces are organized into highly regular formal types similar to [[cursive]] writing and looser, more casual scripts.
=== Formal scripts ===
A majority of formal scripts are based upon the letterforms of seventeenth and eighteenth century writing-masters like [[George Bickham the Elder|George Bickham]], George Shelley and George Snell. The letters in their original form are generated by a quill or metal nib of a pen. Both are able to create fine and thick strokes. Typefaces based upon their style of writing appear late in the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. Contemporary revivals of formal script faces can be seen in [[Kuenstler Script]] and [[Matthew Carter]]'s typeface Snell Roundhand. These typefaces are frequently used for invitations and diplomas to effect an elevated and elegant feeling. They may use [[typographic ligature]]s to have letters connect. 
=== Casual scripts ===
Casual scripts show a less formal, more active hand. The strokes may vary in width but often appear to have been created by wet brush rather than a pen nib. They appear in the early twentieth century and with the advent of photocomposition in the early-1950s their number rapidly increased. They were popularly used in advertising in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] into the 1970s. Examples of casual script types include [[Brush Script]], [[Kaufmann (script)|Kaufmann]] and [[Mistral (typeface)|Mistral]]. Some may be non-connecting. 
==Technology==
[[File:Gospel Estienne 1550.jpg|thumb|Claude Garamond's famous [[grecs du roi]] typeface, intended to mimic the handwriting of Cretan scribe [[Angelo Vergecio]]. To mimic his writing, many alternate characters are needed. While this style was once very popular in printing the [[Greek alphabet]], it is no longer used due to its complexity.]]
Script typefaces place particular demands on printing technology if the letters are intended to join up and vary like handwriting. A typeface intended to mimic handwriting, such as [[Claude Garamond]]'s [[grecs du roi]] typeface, will require many [[Stylistic alternate|alternate characters]]. In digital type these (once drawn) can be substituted seamlessly through contextual [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] insertion in applications like InDesign, but this was complicated in metal. Another complexity in metal type was that [[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]] had to have delicate overhanging parts to interlock. This required careful design and casting for the sorts to fit together without gaps or the sorts breaking, or leaving gaps to be filled in by the natural spread of ink on paper.&lt;ref name="Venus Motorroller"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardwig|first1=Florian|title=Venus Motorroller|url=http://fontsinuse.com/uses/7735/venus-motorroller|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Korbmacher-Verein Kranichfeld invoice, 1939"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardwig|first1=Florian|title=Korbmacher-Verein Kranichfeld invoice, 1939|url=http://fontsinuse.com/uses/8596/korbmacher-verein-kranichfeld-invoice-1939|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Script typefaces have evolved rapidly in the second half of the 20th century due to developments in technology and the end of widespread use of metal type. Historically, most signwriting on logos, displays and shop frontages did not use fonts but was rather [[Lettering|custom-designed lettering]] created by signpainters and engravers.&lt;ref name="Not a font"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simonson|first1=Mark|author-link=Mark Simonson|title=Not a font|url=http://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/not-a-font|website=Mark Simonson Studio (blog)|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lettering is not type"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coles|first1=Stephen|title=Lettering is not type|url=https://fontbureau.typenetwork.com/news/article/clear-definitions|website=Type Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Vernacular"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=James|authorlink1=James Mosley|title=English Vernacular|url=http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2006/02/english-vernacular.html|website=Typefoundry (blog)|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Golden Age of Hand Lettering in American Advertising"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shinn|first1=Nick|title=The Golden Age of Hand Lettering in American Advertising|url=http://typeculture.com/academic-resource/articles-essays/the-golden-age-of-hand-lettering-in-american-advertising/|website=Type Culture|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[phototypesetting]] and then computers have made printing text at a range of sizes far easier than in the metal type period, it has become increasingly common for businesses to use type for logos and signs rather than hand-drawn lettering. In addition, phototypesetting made [[Kerning|overlap of characters]] relatively simple, something very complicated to achieve in metal type. [[Matthew Carter]] has cited his 1966 Snell Roundhand typeface as deliberately designed to replicate a [[Round hand|style of calligraphy]] hard to simulate in metal.&lt;ref name="ADC Hall of Fame: Matthew Carter"&gt;{{cite web|title=ADC Hall of Fame: Matthew Carter|url=http://adcglobal.org/hall-of-fame/matthew-carter/|publisher=ADC|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snell roundhand Lawson1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander S. Lawson|title=Anatomy of a Typeface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FiJ87ixLs0sC&amp;pg=PA360|date=January 1990|publisher=David R. Godine Publisher|isbn=978-0-87923-333-4|pages=360–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional development enabling more sophisticated script fonts has been the release of the [[OpenType]] format, which most fonts are now released in. This allows fonts to have a large character set, increasing the sophistication of design possible, and contextual insertion, in which characters that match one another are inserted into a document automatically, so fonts can convincingly mimic handwriting without the user having to choose the correct substitute characters manually.&lt;ref name="Lettercentric: Type as Writing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Lettercentric: Type as Writing|url=http://www.printmag.com/article/lettercentric-type-as-writing/|website=Print|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern script typefaces emulate the styles of hand-drawn lettering from different historical periods.

==Unicode==
{{see|Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols}}
In [[Unicode]] there is a script Latin alphabet for [[List of mathematical symbols#Symbols based on Latin letters|mathematical use]], with both capital and small letters. Few fonts provide support for all 52 characters, and their presentations vary in style from [[roundhand]] to [[chancery hand]] and others. 

These characters are listed here: {{not a typo|𝒜ℬ𝒞𝒟ℰℱ𝒢ℋℐ𝒥𝒦ℒℳ𝒩𝒪𝒫𝒬ℛ𝒮𝒯𝒰𝒱𝒲𝒳𝒴𝒵 𝒶𝒷𝒸𝒹ℯ𝒻ℊ𝒽𝒾𝒿𝓀𝓁𝓂𝓃ℴ𝓅𝓆𝓇𝓈𝓉𝓊𝓋𝓌𝓍𝓎𝓏}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9920">The '''semiotics of dress''' is a term used to refer to the [[fashion design|design]] and customs associated with [[dress]] ([[clothing]]), as patterned to a kind of [[symbol]]ism that has rules and norms.

The term "[[semiotics]]" can be defined as a system of linguistic signs or symbols.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owyong|first=Yuet See Monica|date=2009-06-01|title=Clothing semiotics and the social construction of power relations|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10350330902816434|journal=Social Semiotics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=192|doi=10.1080/10350330902816434|issn=1035-0330}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system of signs or symbols is not limited to language only. Therefore, the term '''semiotics of dress''' can be further referred to as a non-linguistic semiotic resource which interrelates with [[facial expression]]s, [[gesture]]s and body semiotics in an effort to develop and communicate meaning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, clothing and fashion are not the same thing, and it is important to understand this. While [[clothing]] is defined as "any covering of the human body",&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[fashion]] is defined as the style of dress accepted by members of a society as being appropriate for specific times and occasions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[human body]] is the key element of this non-linguistic semiotic resource. The way one dresses is informed by the biological and social needs of the human being. Central to the semiotics of dress is the psychology of self-perception and self-presentation, both as [[individual]]s who see themselves, as well how individuals are seen within a greater group, [[society]], [[culture]] or [[subculture]].

==Social views==
When the term semiotics is applied to dress, it refers to the words and symbols used to describe the images supporting "the structure of social interaction".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dress Codes: meanings and messages in American culture|last=Rubinstein|first=Ruth|publisher=Westview Press|year=2001|isbn=0813322839|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Examples of these social interactions include: the system of statuses and roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}} Therefore, the way one dresses can be analyzed as a symbol mechanism to communicate ideas and values with other members in a society, as sociologists [[Erving Goffman]] and Gregory P. Stone have suggested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== ''Symbolism/ideals/values of dress'' ===
According to Ruth Rubinstin, there are three categories for '''clothing signs''': The first, is task oriented or instrumental in nature; the second, is having one primary meaning; and the third, is being recognized as a sign for those who wear it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Clothing that shows or portrays some kind of authority in society would fall in the first category. An example would be military uniforms, wigs used in English courts, or law enforcement uniforms. People who wear this kinds of uniforms and emblems are expected by society to behave in certain ways. Not only that, but it is assumed that they possess certain economic, educational and social statuses.

Clothing that separates the sexes, and creates differences between a male and a female, would fall into the second category of clothing signs according to Rubinstin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Sex differences in clothing are due to "Social judgments, personal evaluation and appropriate expectations of dress".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Because of these, society has coercive power upon colors, shapes and fabrics in the clothes that men and women should wear. Examples of this include men wearing pants, while women are wearing skirts.

Within the third category one may find "seductive attire" as it was labeled by Flugel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} However, wearing sex-specific clothing doesn't necessarily mean one will feel sensual or inclined to have sexual intercourse. Perhaps a better understanding of this could be derived from the church fathers. Who said that seductive attire is a mixture of exposure and coverage of the body. A clothing piece one may use for reference is the ''décollegate'', which was "first in use during the end of the [[Middle Ages]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

'''Symbolism''' in clothing or dress is very much subjective, unlike clothing signs. Symbols in clothing don't represent one's level in a social institution. Therefore, they are not governed by any kind of rules or regulations. Clothing symbols are a reflection of what a specific society believes is valuable at a given time. Using clothing symbols do not imply nothing about a person's rights, duties or obligations, and they should not be used to judge or predict one's behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Therefore, to understand and comprehend one through its clothing symbols takes time and intimate comprehension of one's history.

'''Cultural values''' in dress can easily increase an individual's self significance by portraying those good, desirable values in accordance with one's society. This can be further explained by looking at or taking members of the [[Aristocracy (class)|European aristocracy]] as an example. They would wear clothes made with expensive fabrics and ornaments, which would differentiate them from the rest. All in efforts to show others that they possess a privileged place in a social class, where they could not be seen working in a field. Therefore, giving the impression of freedom and relaxation from harsh labor, unlike their servants.

=== ''Men v. women'' ===
Throughout history there has been a separation between the roles and relationships that [[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]] play. These socially structured differences between men and women have contradicted each other at times. [[Fashion]] has picked up on the tensions left by these contradictions as well. The symbolic separation of men and women is fundamental to the history of dress.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Clothing|last=Kaiser|first=Susan|publisher=Fairchild Publications|year=1997|isbn=1563671077|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}} As time has gone by, the forms of clothing (colors, fabrics and shapes) have changed, but the idea of gender difference has survived.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;{{rp|68}} From an early point in life, children learn to differentiate between a male and a female based on clothing and hairstyles.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;{{rp|68}} An example this may be attributed to television cartoons where superheroines are pictured with strong and muscular bodies. However; due to their clothing, they portray an image or an idea to the viewer of being sexy or attractive, therefore putting her physical strength as a secondary attribute.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|120}}

== Psychology in dress ==
Psychologist J. C. Flugel concluded that styles of dress affect one's appearance, yet triggering feelings that enable role performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}} This means that when an individual's body and clothes fuse together to form one, then the individual's sense of importance increases. Increments in one's sense of importance yields to feelings and behaviors of being able to control the environment in which one is in. At the same time, this may work backwards. In other words, if one's body and clothes don't come together as a whole, then one may feel embarrassed, and therefore belittle its sense of importance. Flugel called this idea ''Image Contrast''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Clothing can be perceived as one's medium or channel for self-expression.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}} Every day people communicate ideas and express feelings about them to others through the use of clothing, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}} This way of thinking leads to the idea of the ''social self'', which is that the idea of ''self-reflection'' is a social construction.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|146}}

=== ''Self-perception'' ===
The term ''self-schema'' could be used to defined thought processes that modify, organize and integrate qualities assigned to the self.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|148}} This idea may include visual images or verbal descriptions that people may use to describe which "look" suits them best and which "look" doesn't.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|148}}

Teen boys see their selves as more physically effective than teen girls. While at the same time, teen girls perceive themselves as being more effective by means of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|121}} Recently these perceptions among men and women have changed. Women are increasingly concerned with their physical effectiveness, while men have become more interested in their physical attractiveness. Today, unlike men, women are more critical when assessing their bodies in terms of physical fitness, appearance, health and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|122}} But both men and women tend to be equally satisfied when it comes to their bodies and their self-perceptions.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;{{rp|122}}

[[File:Mikro020.jpg|thumb|''Mikrokosmos'' emblem book, 1579: "Venus is left shivering in front of a makeshift fire while Bacchus and Ceres wander away".&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus''', [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Without [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Bacchus]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] freezes'',&lt;ref&gt;Or "grows cold" "chills" etc&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Liber]] was an alternative Roman name for Bacchus, as the older local wine god for Rome&lt;/ref&gt;  is a quotation from the Roman comedian [[Terence]] (c. 195/185 – c. 159 BC) that became a proverb in the [[Early Modern period]].  Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive.  It was sometimes shown in art, especially in the period 1550–1630, in [[Northern Mannerism]] in [[Prague]] and the [[Low Countries]], as well as by [[Rubens]].&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the concentration of images by the [[Haarlem Mannerists]] reflects the patronage of the powerful brewers of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially p. 21 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proverb==
The phrase derives from Terence's comedy ''[[Eunuchus]]'', in which Chremes says to Pythias in the fifth scene of the fourth act (732), ''verbum hercle hoc verum erit "sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus"'' (That saying, "Without Ceres and [[Liber]], Venus freezes" is absolutely true!"). Thus the phrase was probably a well-known proverb at the time as well. Chremes makes use of it to declare how Pythias seems even more beautiful than usual to him during the rowdy partying after a large meal.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, 178&lt;/ref&gt; Liber, the son of Ceres and god of human prosperity (and also of wine), was later replaced with Bacchus. The phrase is found in a similar form in [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' 4.32.43&lt;/ref&gt; who quotes it as an example of the stylistic device of [[metonymy]].&lt;ref&gt;''De nat. deor.'' 2.23.60, cited after Gerd Hagenow: [http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/121/Hagenow.pdf ''Der nicht ausgekehrte Speisesaal''] (PDF; 3,5&amp;nbsp;MB), note 7&lt;/ref&gt; In later times it was universally attributed to Terence.

In the Middle Ages, [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] used it in his work, ''Dialogus miraculorum'' to warn against luxury and frivolty and to advocate an ascetic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogus miraculorum'' 112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] quoted it in this sense as well, in a 1518 sermon against the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].&lt;ref&gt;WA 1,519&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of [[Renaissance humanism]], the proverb was included with a broader sense in various compilations, such as the ''[[Adagia]]'' of [[Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Adagia 1297 = II.3.97&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest German use is in a compilation from Klagenfurt dating to 1468: ''An wein und brot Leidet Venus not'' (Without wine and bread, Venus is not in good stead).&lt;ref&gt;Singer, pp. 453f.&lt;/ref&gt; Further German variants include:
* ''Ohne Wein und Brot ist Venus tot.'' (Without wine and bread, Venus is dead)
* ''Ohn Speis und Trank ist Venus krank.'' (Without cheer and ale, Venus is frail)
* ''Ohne Kost und ohne Wein kann die Liebe nicht gedeihn.'' (Without food and without wine, love cannot shine)&lt;ref&gt;Publius Terentius Afer: ''Lustspiele'', translated by Christian Victor Kindervater. Leipzig: Frommann, 1799, p. 175 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=znw9AAAAcAAJ Digitised])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakespeare]]'s line in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', "Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale", may be an inverted reference.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Twelfth Night]]'' 2.1.123, [[Sir Toby Belch]] to [[Malvolio]]; see Erasmus, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject in art ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Venus frigida (KMSKA).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Venus Frigida]]'', Rubens 1615, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp. Venus and Cupid are freezing, as a [[satyr]] arrives with a fruit bowl]]
Depictions in art divide into those showing Venus, typically with an accompanying [[Cupid]], either "freezing", without food and drink (or much in the way of clothing), or more comfortable when supplied with them, usually by the other gods in person.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter type is more common, but [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] are among the artists who used both types.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''[[Feast of the Gods (art)|Feast of the Gods]]'', another subject popular among the Northern Mannerists, the subject offers the combination of a relatively obscure classical reference and the opportunity for plentiful nudity.  The subject appears in paintings, drawings and prints, and compositions are often copied between these media, and between artists.

Initially the depiction of this motif were closely tied to text and was found mostly in [[emblem book]]s, with the first appearance in the ''Picta poesis'' of 1552, by [[Barthélémy Aneau]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, fig. 3, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Mikrokosmos'', an emblem book of 1579 by the Dutch poet [[Laurentius Haechtanus]] may be the first depiction of the shivering Venus, as Ceres and Bacchus walk away.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin text makes clear that the motif is to be understood as a warning against excessive feasting and drinking because they stimulate sexual desire.

''Explain, [[Cythera (island)|Cytheran]] Venus, and Cupid too:''
''Why do you warm your own feet, warm your own hands?''
''Perhaps because eloquent [[Iacchos]] is not helping you?''
''Isn't dusty Ceres around either?''
''Where sobriety reigns, harmful lust freezes''
''and no war is waged against the curier.''&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the moderate man&lt;/ref&gt;
''Wherever powerful drunkeness and excess reign,''
''the mother of adultery begins her ruthless war.''

[[File:Abraham Bloemaert Sine Baccho et Cenere friget Venus.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Bloemaert]], early 17th century]] 
The motif was especially favoured in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in the Netherlands and in the circle of [[mannerist]] artists at the court of [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, pp. 380–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Early examples of the motif as the subject of an independent painting are Spranger's pair of paintings of about 1590,&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hans von Aachen]]'s ''Bacchus, Ceres und Amor'' (1598), all painted for Rudolf II.  The Spranger was turned into a print in Amsterdam in about 1597 by [[Jan Harmensz Muller]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1508822&amp;partId=1 British Museum], ''Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus'' (Without Bacchus and Ceres, Venus grows cold), object listing&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hendrik Goltzius]] produced at least 10 versions of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; including a monumental work in the unusual technique of pen and limited colour on canvas, here highly effective (illustrated here).  This was also (probably) in Rudolf's collection, then in the royal collections of Sweden and England, and is now in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/85733.html Phildalephia  Museum of Art]; [http://articles.philly.com/1991-11-24/news/25768376_1_art-museum-engraving-european-art "The Picture That Spurred A Splendid Exhibition"], by Edward J. Sozanski, Inquirer Art Critic, November 24, 1991, philly.com (''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; A different work on the subject in the same technique is in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], which includes a self-portrait by Goltzius in the background.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/05/arts/art-view-in-those-days-it-paid-to-be-clever.html Review in ''New York Times''] of exhibition in Philadelphia in 1992; Santos, 34–35, fig. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wtewael Sine Cerere.jpg|thumb|left| [[Cabinet painting]], about 1605, by [[Joachim Wtewael]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.N08404.html/f/3/N08404-3.pdf lot notes], [[Sotheby's]], New York. Sale "Important Old Master Paintings Including European Works of Art", 24 Jan 2008, Lot 3&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Especially in Goltzius' version, the undertones of danger and the moral point of the [[allegory]] are still clear, although the motif later moved far from a narrow moral message about personal moderation.&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, pp. 380–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the print versions carry the proverb text, which it was presumably felt needed stating for a wider public.  Reference to the motif is uncertain in some works, or groups of works,&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 20&lt;/ref&gt; but it is at least arguable that any combination of the three gods, with or without Amor, carries a reference to it, as there is no other context that brings this particular group together.  Two different sets of prints by Goltzius showed each of the three gods in turn; in one set, engraved by [[Jan Saenredam]], each is surrounded by worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 16–18, figs 8–10 and 15–17; Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Two late paintings by [[Joachim Wtewael]] show half-length portraits of Bacchus and Ceres, and it is presumed that a Venus is missing to complete the set; another small painting by Wtewael shows the three gods, and Amor, together.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, J.; Helmus, L.  &amp; Wheelock Jr. A.  (2015) ''Pleasure and Piety: The Art of Joachim Wtewael'', last two entries, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|9780691166063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens employed the motif repeatedly in different ways, including the visibly freezing ''[[Venus frigida]]'', a version with [[Cupid|Amor]] who desperately attempts to start a fire, and one with Venus at the ''Moment maßvollen Erwärmens und ruhigen Erwachens'' (Moment of modestly warming and quietly waking) in which she hesitantly accepts a wine cup from Bacchus.&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; Italian artists rarely depicted it, whether because it came from the mainly northern tradition of emblem books or because the subject had less resonance in a warmer climate.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are a painting by [[Pietro Liberi]] and a print by [[Agostino Carracci]] after one by Goltzius.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1459994&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Sine+Cerere+et+Baccho+friget+Venus&amp;page=1 British Museum, object page]; Santos, fig. 5, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[baroque]] period the motif no longer appears often.

===Haarlem brewers' propaganda===
[[File:RubensVenusCupidBacchusandCeres.jpg|thumb|Rubens 1612/13, Staatliche Museen, [[Kassel]]]]
The [[Calvinist]] [[Dutch Republic]] had complex and conflicted attitudes to both sex and alcohol.  Several prominent painters had problems with drink, and the issues were discussed by the biographer and artist [[Karel van Mander]], as part of much wider discussions in Dutch culture.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially 21–28&lt;/ref&gt;  A paper of 2012 by R. de Mambro Santos discusses the motif in this context, and proposes that the depiction of the subject was greatly affected by the big brewers of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially p. 21 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Santos, van Mander can be seen to connect excessive drinking with wine, while beer is presented in his writings and art as a safer and more wholesome product.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Bacchus, as by extension the god of all alcoholic drinks, and Ceres, as the goddess covering the raw materials, were symbolic of [[beer]], and a metaphor used by van Mander placed Venus and Cupid as representing the transformative process of actual brewing, by boiling the ingredients; the fire appearing in many images was a further necessity for brewing.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 30–36&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Santos, at the period when the subject is found in the art of the [[Haarlem Mannerists]], "the economic life of Haarlem was mainly based on the production of beer", and brewers dominated the government of the city, having "assumed the role previously played by the nobility as a leading group in the administration of the town".&lt;ref&gt;Santos, pp. 27–28, each quoted in turn&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Brouwershofje]],  an [[almshouse]] complex in the city, has more information on the Haarlem brewers' guild.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular Jan Mathijsz Ban was a leading brewer, a friend of artists and a significant collector, spending many weeks touring Italy with Goltzius.  With another brewer, he was the dedicatee of the central part of van Manders' ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''.  Van Mander praises the taste and knowledge of the Haarlem brewers at various points,&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; and "Both Van Mander’s text and Goltzius’ images present Bacchus as a sober, elegant divinity, a gentle and polite god not associated at all with excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages", contrary to much previous imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lord Byron==

[[Lord Byron]] expanded on the proverb in ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' Canto II, sections 169–170:
:''... some good lessons''
:''Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus''
:''Without whom Venus will not long attack us.''
:''While Venus fills the heart (without heart really''
:''Love, though good always, is not quite so good),''
:''Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli, &amp;ndash;''
:''For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood, &amp;ndash;''
:''While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly.''

[[File:Note stems.png|thumb|Musical stems may go either way upon the middle line; generally, lower than this they go up and the higher than this they go down.]]

In [[musical notation]], '''stems''' are the, "thin, vertical [[line (geometry)|lines]] that are directly connected to the [[notehead|[note] head]]&lt;!--the source spells "note head" as two words--&gt;."&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', p.14. Seventh Edition. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stems may point up or down. Different-pointing stems indicate the [[voice (music)|voice]] for [[polyphonic]] music written on the same [[staff (music)|staff]]. Within one voice, the stems usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher, and up for those below. If the stem points up from a notehead, the stem originates from the right-hand side of the note, but if it points down, it originates from the left. There is an exception to this rule: if a [[chord (music)|chord]] contains a [[Interval number|second]], the stem runs between the two notes with the higher being placed on the right of the stem and the lower on the left. If the chord contains an odd numbered cluster of notes a second apart (such as C, D, E), the outer two will be on the correct side of the stem, while the middle note will be on the wrong side.

The length of a stem should be that of an octave on the staff,&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt; going to either an octave higher or lower than the notehead, depending on which way the stem is pointing. If a note head is on a [[ledger lines|ledger line]] more than an octave away from the middle line of a staff, the stem will be elongated to touch the middle line. In any polyphonic music in which two parts are written on the same staff, stems are typically shortened to keep the music visually centered upon the staff.

[[File:Music-tremolo.png|90px|right]]
Stems may be altered in various ways to alter the rhythm or other method of performance. For example, a note with diagonal slashes through its stem is played [[tremolo]].

Brock]] - second edition 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A specialist in Syriac studies is known as a '''Syriacist'''. Specifically, British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by this designation, at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christian]] and [[Maronite Christian]] communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between ''Aramaistik'' (Aramaic studies) and ''Neuaramaistik'' (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies).

At universities Syriac studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as [[Eastern Christianity]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], [[Aramaic studies]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Leiden]], [[Eastern Christianity]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Crossroads: Essays on Medieval Christian Legacy - Page 391 Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala - 2007 "Not because this list would be very long, but since Syriac Studies are mostly incorporated into a more general field of studies, e.g. [[Aramaic studies]] (as is the case, e.g. at the Universities of Oxford or Leiden), or Eastern Christianity, as in Duke, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Semitic studies]] at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. Most students learn the [[Syriac language]] within a [[biblical studies]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Orientalia christiana periodica - Volume 74 - Page 564 Pontificium Institutum Orientalium Studiorum - 2008 "(a question those of us in Syriac studies are too often asked). Then, posing the question, why study Syriac, he situates the field within the broader academy. While most students learn Syriac within a biblical studies program, Syriac also impacts ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences for Syriac studies include the Symposium Syriacum,&lt;ref&gt;VI Symposium Syriacum 1992: University of Cambridge 1994 Page 14 "René Lavenant, Pontificium Institutum Orientalium Studiorum - 1994 "must have felt in 1892: Syriac studies were very much alive then — however restricted the number of scholars working in the field at the time; Syriac studies are even more alive today — as the large registration at this conference ..."&lt;/ref&gt; the Section "Bible and Syriac Studies in Context" at the International Meetings of the [[Society of Biblical Literature]],&lt;ref name=sbl1&gt;http://www.sbl-site.org/meetings/Congresses_CallForPaperDetails.aspx?MeetingId=22&amp;VolunteerUnitId=594&lt;/ref&gt; and the Section "Syriac Literature and Interpretations of Sacred Texts" at the Annual Meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature.&lt;ref name=sbl1/&gt;  

Syriac academic journals include the annual ''Oriens Christianus'' ([[Wiesbaden]]) and ''Syriac Studies Today''.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern churches review - Volume 1 - Page 370 1966 "... assisted by periodicals devoted to Christian oriental studies; the most important for Syriac studies are the annual Oriens Christianus (Wiesbaden) and 370 Syriac Studies Today by Robert Murray, SJ."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Ages of the Interior Life''''' : ''Prelude of Eternal Life'' (Les Trois Ages de la Vie Interieure) is a book written by French theologian [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], published in 1938 and 1939 in two volumes, while teaching at the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)]], Rome from 1909 to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Translator's Preface |title= The Three Ages of the Interior Life, Catholic Spiritual Teaching |url = http://www.christianperfection.info/tta1.php#bk2 |accessdate= 2014-07-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The book explains the entire Catholic tradition on the [[Interior life (Catholic theology)|interior life]] as well as [[spirituality|spiritual life]] covering virtually all aspects of the faith. Composed of 95 chapters, it is a synthesis of Garrigou Lagrange's earlier works, ''Christian Perfection and Contemplation'' (''Perfection chrétienne et contemplation'' (1923))  and ''Love of God and the Cross of Jesus'' (''L'amour de Dieu et la Croix de Jésus'' (1929)).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = The Three Ages of the Interior Life: Preface |publisher= Catholic Spiritual Teaching| url = http://www.christianperfection.info/tta1.php | accessdate = 2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as a classic of modern theological literature.

In the book he propounded the thesis that infused [[contemplation]] and the resulting [[mysticism|mystical]] life are in the normal way of holiness of [[Christian perfection]]. This influenced the section entitled "Chapter V: The Universal Call to Holiness in the Church" in the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, ''[[Lumen gentium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hprweb.com/2009/04/rehabilitation-of-garrigou-lagrange/|title=Rehabilitation of Garrigou-Lagrange|author=[http://fatherbtm.com/ Mullady, Brian, O.P.]|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thomas Tang International Moot Court Competition''', also known as the '''Tang''', is a [[Moot court|moot court competition]] sponsored by the National [[Asian-Pacific American|Asian Pacific American]] [[Bar association|Bar Association]], attracting participants from [[law school]]s in the U.S. and Asia.

==History==
The [[Thomas Tang]] National Moot Court Competition was founded in 1993 by the Asian Pacific-American Law Student Association ("APALSA") of the South Texas College of Law, [[Houston, Texas]].   The competition came about as a result of an intense debate among three South Texas College of Law ("STCL") students - Kevin Pham, Pam Rea, and John Tang - over the need for a moot court competition that would celebrate the growing Asian American presence and influence in the American legal system and would simultaneously encourage law students to analyze issues that impact Americans from all backgrounds.  These three students, along with every other member of the South Texas College of Law APALSA organization during 1993, mobilized their efforts, to bring about the competition as a lasting contribution to the legal education community.  Rea authored the moot court case and the local rules for the competition, while Pham and Tang relentlessly sought and obtained support from the law school's administration and the local Asian American Bar Association ("AABA") of Houston, and provided leadership to the many student volunteers needed for a successful outcome.  Both the Houston Chapter of the AABA and South Texas College of Law embraced the APALSA students' vision and supported their efforts, but the organization and efforts that resulted in the highly successful first year of the Tang were the result of the collaboration among law students who pursued a vision to contribute to the opportunities available to Asian American law students.  The success of the Tang was realized in the first year, as law students traveled from all over the United States to participate in the competition.

The students who founded the competition named it after the highest ranking Asian American justice at that time, The Honorable Thomas Tang, the senior judge on the Federal Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Justice Tang greatly honored the students of STCL and the participating competitors, when he personally attended the 1993 competition and presided over Final Round.  In his remarks to the participating students in 1993, Justice Tang noted the efforts of the law students in creating opportunity and change, and challenged future law students to seek out ways of their own to enhance the legal profession and advance the involvement of persons from all backgrounds in our justice system.

The Tang is now administered by the NAPABA Law Foundation and the NAPABA Judicial Council, whose leadership continues to offer law students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the complexities and strength of the American justice system as it applies to all Americans. The Competition continues to honor the late Judge Thomas Tang, a champion of [[individual rights]], an advocate for the advancement of minority attorneys, an ardent supporter of NAPABA and the moot court competition. Judge Tang served on the United States [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] [[Court of Appeals]] from 1977 until his death in 1995. Judge Tang's wife, Dr. Pearl Tang, continues the legacy and participates every year.

==Outreach==
The Competition is open to all students but is especially designed to reach out to APA law students and provide them with an opportunity to showcase their writing and oral advocacy skills and compete for scholarships totaling $10,000.

In the countable sense, a '''verse''' is formally a single [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] [[Line (poetry)|line]] in a [[poetry|poetic composition]]. However, verse has come to represent any division or grouping of words in a poetic composition, with groupings traditionally having been referred to as [[stanza]]s.

In the uncountable ([[mass noun]]) sense '''verse''' refers to  "[[poetry]]" as contrasted to [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wiktionary'', "Verse" (accessed 8 August 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the common unit of verse is based on [[meter (poetry)|meter]] or [[rhyme]], the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.types-of-poetry.org.uk/45-verse.htm "Verse"], "Types-Of-Poetry", Screen 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense '''verse''' is also used pejoratively in contrast to [[poetry]] to suggest work that is too pedestrian or too incompetent to be classed as poetry.

==Types of verse==
===Blank verse===
[[Blank verse]] is poetry written in regular, metrical, but unrhymed, lines, almost always composed of iambic pentameters.
&lt;poem&gt;
    Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit
    Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
    Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of Eden, 'till one greater Man
    ....
                                              —[[John Milton]] (from [[Paradise Lost]])
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Free verse===
[[Free verse]] is usually defined as having no fixed meter and no end rhyme. Although free verse may include end rhyme, it commonly does not.
&lt;poem&gt;
    Whirl up, sea—
    Whirl your pointed pines,
    Splash your great pines
    On our rocks,
    Hurl your green over us,
    Cover us with your pools of fir.

                                              —[[H.D.]]
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Laboratories and organizations==

With the initiative of the Society for Wildlife Forensic Science (SWFS), the Scientific Working Group for Wildlife Forensic Sciences (SWGWILD) was formed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SWGWILD |work=Society for Wildlife Forensic Science |date=14 January 2013 |url=http://www.wildlifeforensicscience.org/swgwild/|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope==

While animals and plants are the victims in the crimes of illegal [[wildlife trade]] and [[animal abuse]], society also pays a heavy price when those crimes are used to fund illegal drugs, weapons and terrorism. Links between [[human trafficking]], [[public corruption]] and [[illegal fishing]] have also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 2009. [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT48323/html/CPRT-111SPRT48323.htm Trafficking and extortion of Burmese migrants in Malaysia and Southern Thailand: a report to the Committee on Foreign Relations], United States Senate. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; The continued development and integration of wildlife forensic science as a field will be critical for successful management of the many significant social and conservation issues related to the illegal wildlife trade and wildlife [[law enforcement]].
