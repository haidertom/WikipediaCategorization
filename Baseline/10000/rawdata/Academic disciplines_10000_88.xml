The endeavor to use 100% [[renewable energy]] for electricity, heating/cooling and transport is motivated by [[global warming]], pollution and other environmental issues, as well as economic and [[energy security]] concerns. Shifting the total global [[primary energy]] supply to renewable sources requires a [[energy transition|transition of the energy system]]. In 2013 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. [[Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy use]] has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11 /&gt;

In 2014, renewable sources such as [[Wind power|wind]], [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[bioenergy|biomass]], and burnt waste provided 19% of the total energy consumed worldwide, with roughly half of that coming from traditional use of biomass.&lt;ref name=Armaroli&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armaroli | first1 = Nicola | authorlink = Nicola Armaroli | authorlink2 = Vincenzo Balzani | last2 = Balzani | first2 = Vincenzo | year = 2016 | title = Solar Electricity and Solar Fuels: Status and Perspectives in the Context of the Energy Transition | url = | journal = [[Chemistry – A European Journal]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 32–57 | doi = 10.1002/chem.201503580 | pmid = 26584653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important sector is electricity with a renewable share of 22.8%, most of it coming from hydropower with a share of 16.6%, followed by wind with 3.1%.&lt;ref name=Armaroli/&gt; According to the [[REN21]] 2017 global status report, these figures had increased to 19.3% for energy in 2015 and 24.5% for electricity in 2016. There are many places around the world with grids that are run almost exclusively on renewable energy. At the national level, at least 30 nations already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of the energy supply.

Professors S. Pacala and [[Robert H. Socolow]] of Princeton University have developed a series of “[[climate stabilization wedge]]s” that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic [[climate change]], and "renewable energy sources," in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their "wedges."&lt;ref name="Pacala"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1100103 |pmid=15310891 |pages=968–72 |title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5686 |year=2004 |last1=Pacala |first1=S |last2=Socolow |first2=R |bibcode=2004Sci...305..968P |citeseerx=10.1.1.642.8472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at [[Stanford University]] and director of its Atmosphere and Energy program, says that producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]],  and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible, and that existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that [[Cost of electricity by source|energy costs]] today with a wind, solar, and water system should be similar to today's energy costs from other optimally cost-effective strategies.&lt;ref name="enpol2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.045 |pages=1170–90 |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |journal=Energy Policy |volume=39 |issue=3 |year=2011 |last1=Delucchi |first1=Mark A |last2=Jacobson |first2=Mark Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armaroli | first1 = Nicola | authorlink = Nicola Armaroli | authorlink2 = Vincenzo Balzani | last2 = Balzani | first2 = Vincenzo | year = 2011 | title = Towards an electricity-powered world | url = | journal = [[Energy and Environmental Science]] | volume = 4 | issue = 9| pages = 3193–3222 [3216] | doi = 10.1039/c1ee01249e }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson's conclusions have been disputed by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608126/in-sharp-rebuttal-scientists-squash-hopes-for-100-percent-renewables/ | title = Scientists Sharply Rebut Influential Renewable-Energy Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the United States, the independent [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] has noted that “sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, [[energy security]], and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments  |author=National Research Council| date=2010|page=4|publisher=National Academies of Science|isbn=9780309137089  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low-carbon energy strategies are political rather than technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, [[Sustainable energy|unsustainable energy consumption]], outdated [[energy infrastructure]], and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpd.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Revised.pdf|title=Post Carbon Pathways|author=John Wiseman|date=April 2013|work=University of Melbourne|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a [[Science (journal)|Science]] paper&lt;ref name="sorensen-1975"&gt;

published in 1975 by Danish physicist [[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sørensen]], which was followed by several other proposals.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer" /&gt; In 1976 [[energy policy]] analyst [[Amory Lovins]] coined the term "[[soft energy path]]" to describe an alternative future where [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and appropriate [[renewable energy]] sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels.&lt;ref name=joshua2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/the-elusive-green-economy/7554/ |title=The Elusive Green Economy |author=Green, Joshua |date=July–August 2009 |work=The Atlantic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europe and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor [[Henrik Lund (academic)|Henrik Lund]] published a first paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lund | first1 = Henrik | authorlink = Henrik Lund (academic) | year = 2006| title = Large-scale integration of optimal combinations of PV, wind and wave power into the electricity supply | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 503–515 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the [[Energy transition|transition]] to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europe, America, Australia and other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer" /&gt;

Even in the early 21st century it was extraordinary for scientists and decision-makers to consider the concept of 100 per cent renewable electricity. However, renewable energy progress has been so rapid that things have totally changed since then:&lt;ref name=diesrev /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Solar photovoltaic]] modules have dropped about 75 per cent in price. Current scientific and technological advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation. On-shore [[wind power]] is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions. [[Concentrated solar thermal]] power (CST) with [[thermal storage]] has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still has the potential for further cost reductions of about 50 per cent.&lt;ref name=diesrev&gt;{{cite web |url= http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/another-myth-busted-on-the-road-to-100-renewable-electricity-52178 |title=Another Myth Busted on the Road to 100% Renewable Electricity |author=Mark Diesendorf  |date=4 April 2013 |work=Reneweconomy.com.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11 /&gt; [[Wind turbine]]s generate 39&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Elproduktion|url = https://www.energinet.dk/DA/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/Termisk-produktion/Sider/Termisk-produktion.aspx|website = www.energinet.dk|access-date = 2016-02-21|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302062337/https://www.energinet.dk/DA/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/Termisk-produktion/Sider/Termisk-produktion.aspx|archive-date = 2016-03-02|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; percent of Danish electricity, and Denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well. Together, wind and biomass provide 44% of the electricity consumed by the country's six million inhabitants. In 2010, Portugal's 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources. Spain's 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewables.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy has a history of strong public support. In America, for example, a 2013 [[Gallup survey]] showed that two in three Americans want the U.S. to increase domestic energy production using solar power (76%), wind power (71%), and natural gas (65%). Far fewer want more petroleum production (46%) and more nuclear power (37%). Least favored is coal, with about one in three Americans favouring it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/americans-want-more-emphasis-on-solar-wind-natural-gas |title=Americans Want More Emphasis on Solar, Wind, Natural Gas |author=Dennis Jacobe |date=April 9, 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[REN21]] says renewable energy already plays a significant role and there are many policy targets which aim to increase this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a binding 20% by 2020 target for the European Union. Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables. Outside Europe, a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.ren21.net/Portals/0/REN21_GFR_2013_print.pdf |title=Renewables global futures report 2013 |author=REN21 |date=2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Nuclear power]] involves substantial accident risks (e.g., [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], [[Chernobyl disaster]]) and the unsolved problem of safe long-term [[high-level radioactive waste management]], and [[carbon capture and storage]] has rather limited safe storage potentials.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/wene.128 |pages=74–97 |title=Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: A paradigm shift in energy policies |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment |volume=4 |year=2015 |last1=Hohmeyer |first1=Olav H |last2=Bohm |first2=Sönke }}&lt;/ref&gt; These constraints have also led to an interest in 100% renewable energy. A well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade, evaluating scenarios for 100% renewable energy for various geographical areas. In recent years, more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.03.038 |pages=270–82 |title=Least cost 100% renewable electricity scenarios in the Australian National Electricity Market |journal=Energy Policy |volume=59 |year=2013 |last1=Elliston |first1=Ben |last2=MacGill |first2=Iain |last3=Diesendorf |first3=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive to use 100% renewable energy is created by [[global warming]] and ecological as well as economic concerns, post [[peak oil]].

The first country to propose 100% renewable energy was [[Iceland]], in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rio02.com/proceedings/pdf/031_Gissuarson.pdf |title=Implementation of Green Bookkeeping at Reykjavik Energy |publisher=Rio02.com |accessdate=2012-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617131226/http://www.rio02.com/proceedings/pdf/031_Gissuarson.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals have been made for Japan in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyrichjapan.info/en/welcome.html |title=Energy Rich Japan |publisher=Energyrichjapan.info |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for Australia in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.beyondzeroemissions.org/ZCA2020_Stationary_Energy_Report_v1.pdf |title=Zero Carbon Australia Stationary Energy Plan |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523064256/http://media.beyondzeroemissions.org/ZCA2020_Stationary_Energy_Report_v1.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay]] obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources (Albania and Paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity, Iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal).&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=2&amp;pid=2&amp;aid=12 International energy statistics] data for 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources (97 percent from hydropower).&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=NO Norway], updated 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet.

This is often confused with renewable energy. If electricity produced on the grid is 65 GWh from fossil fuel and 35 GWh from renewable energy and rooftop off grid solar produces 80 GWh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 GWh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 GWh.

Cities like [[Paris]] and [[Strasbourg]] in France, planned to use 100% renewable energy by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Un plan climat met Paris sur la voie de la neutralité carbone |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/climat/article/2018/03/22/un-plan-climat-met-paris-sur-la-voie-de-la-neutralite-carbone_5274533_1652612.html|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|date=2018-03-21|last1=Roger|first1=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'Eurométropole de Strasbourg dévoile son plan climat 2030 |url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/climat-environnement/l-eurometropole-de-strasbourg-devoile-son-plan-climat-2030-1509993398|date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources, a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100% renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2010/11/101109-peak-oil-iea-world-energy-outlook/ |title=Has the World Already Passed "Peak Oil"? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research that has been published in [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support.

Other changes involve use of [[electric car]]s and the development of enhanced transmission grids and storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | last2 = Delucchi | first2 = Mark A. | year = 2011| title = Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part I: Technologies, energy resources, quantities and areas of infrastructure, and materials | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 1154–1169 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delucchi | first1 = Mark A. | last2 = Jacobson | first2 = Mark Z. | year = 2011| title = Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 1170–1190 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Paris Agreement]], countries periodically update their climate change targets for the future, by 2018 no [[g20|G20 country]] had committed to a 100% renewable target.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.climate-transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Brown-to-Green-Report-2018_rev.pdf p21&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
''[[The Fourth Revolution: Energy]]'' is a German [[documentary film]] released in 2010. It shows the vision of a global society, which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100% with renewable energies, showing a complete reconstruction of the economy, to reach this goal. In 2011, [[Hermann Scheer]] wrote the book ''The Energy Imperative: 100 Percent Renewable Now'', published by Routledge.

''[[Reinventing Fire]]'' is a book by Amory Lovins released in October 2011. By combining reduced energy use with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] gains, Lovins says that there will be a $5 trillion saving and a faster-growing economy. This can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies, through market forces, led by business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/03/16/amory-lovins-reinventing-fire-convergence-and-innovation?page=full |title=Amory Lovins on 'Reinventing Fire' with convergence and innovation |author=Adam Aston |date=March 16, 2012  |work=Greenbiz }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Clinton]] says the book is a "wise, detailed and comprehensive blueprint".&lt;ref name=nytrf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/fossil-fuels-as-the-whale-oil-of-the-future/ |title=Fossil Fuels as the Whale Oil of the Future |author=Matthew Wald |date=October 27, 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first paragraph of the preface says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine fuel without fear. No climate change. No oil spills, dead coal miners, dirty air, devastated lands, lost wildlife. No energy poverty. No oil-fed wars, tyrannies, or terrorists. Nothing to run out. Nothing to cut off. Nothing to worry about. Just energy abundance, benign and affordable, for all, for ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/reinventing-transforming-capitalism-barriers?newsfeed=true |title=Nine barriers to reinventing capitalism |author=John Elkington |date=21 March 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |date=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] has said that [[solar energy]] technologies, in its many forms, can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces:&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf|title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.&lt;ref name=ie11 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the refereed journal ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' published two articles by [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a professor of engineering at [[Stanford University]], and research scientist Mark A. Delucchi, about changing our energy supply mix and "Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power". The articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power, transportation, and heating/cooling from wind, water, and sunlight (WWS), which are safe clean options. In Part I, Jacobson and Delucchi discuss WWS energy system characteristics, aspects of energy demand, WWS resource availability, WWS devices needed, and material requirements.&lt;ref name=enpol2010&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part I: Technologies, energy resources, quantities and areas of infrastructure, and materials |author=Mark Z.

In terms of [[solar power]], an additional 49,000 300 MW [[concentrating solar]] plants, 40,000 300 MW [[solar photovoltaic]] power plants, and 1.7 billion 3&amp;nbsp;kW rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed. Such an extensive WWS infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30%.&lt;ref name=enpol2010 /&gt;  In Part II, Jacobson and Delucchi address variability of supply, system economics, and energy policy initiatives associated with a WWS system. The authors advocate producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Energy costs with a WWS system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name="enpol2011" /&gt;

In general, Jacobson has said wind, water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the world's energy, eliminating all [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Kate Galbraith. [http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/100-percent-renewables-by-2030/ 100 Percent Renewables by 2030?] ''Green Inc.'', December 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He advocates a "smart mix" of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mark Z. |last1=Jacobson |first2=M.A. |last2=Delucchi |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/sad1109Jaco5p.indd.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030 |journal=[[Scientific American]]   |volume=301 |issue=5  |pages=58–65 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1109-58 |pmid=19873905  |date=November 2009|bibcode=2009SciAm.301e..58J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2012 study by the [[University of Delaware]] for a 72 GW system considered 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most cost-effective, for the [[PJM Interconnection]], would use 17 GW of solar, 68 GW of [[offshore wind]], and 115 GW of onshore wind, although at times as much as three times the demand would be provided. 0.1% of the time would require generation from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2013/dec/renewable-energy-121012.html|title=Wind, solar power paired with storage could be cost-effective way to power grid|work=UDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Denmark's parliament agreed on a comprehensive new set promotional programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will lead to the country getting 100 percent of electricity, heat and fuels from renewables by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/03/a-true-all-of-the-above-energy-policy-denmark-affirms-commitment-to-100-renewable-energy-by-2050 |title=A True 'All of the Above' Energy Policy: Denmark Affirms Commitment to 100% Renewable Energy by 2050 |author=Stephen Lacey |date=29 March 2012 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100% renewable energy produced by wind, water and sunlight, for New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | year = 2013 | title = Examining the feasibility of converting New York State's all-purpose energy infrastructure to one using wind, water, and sunlight | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 585–601 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.02.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | title = A roadmap for repowering California for all purposes with wind, water, and sunlight | year = 2014 | journal = [[Energy (journal)|Energy]] | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 875–889 | doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | year = 2016 | title = A 100% wind, water, sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy plan for Washington State | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 75–88 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2015.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states, by 2050.  {{as of|2014}}, a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up, which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states. The 50-state plan is part of [[The Solutions Project]], an independent outreach effort led by Jacobson, actor [[Mark Ruffalo]], and film director [[Josh Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/february/fifty-states-renewables-022414.html |title=Stanford scientist unveils 50-state plan to transform U.S. to renewable energy |author=Mark Schwarz |date= February 26, 2014  |work=Stanford Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014}}, many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing, can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, hydro, ocean and geothermal energy. Debate over detailed plans remain, but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable, economically feasible, socially viable, and so realisable. This prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by Germany, one of the world's most successful industrial economies, to undertake a major [[energy transition]], [[Energiewende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transforming power |first1=Andy |last1=Stirling |author-link=Andy Stirling |date=2014 |journal=Energy Research and Social Science |doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.02.001 |volume=1 |pages=83–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a study was published in ''[[Energy and Environmental Science]]'' that describes a pathway to 100% renewable energy in the United States by 2050 without using biomass. Implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable, as by 2050 it would save about $600 Billion Dollars [[health costs]] a year due to reduced [[air pollution]] and $3.3 Trillion global warming costs. This would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around $8300 compared to a business as usual pathway. According to that study, barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political, as most people didn't know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5EE01283J |pages=2093–117 |title=100% clean and renewable wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy roadmaps for the 50 United States |journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=8 |issue=7 |year=2015 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Bazouin |first3=Guillaume |last4=Bauer |first4=Zack A.

In June 2017, twenty-one researchers published an article in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] rejecting Jacobson's earlier PNAS article, accusing him of modeling errors and of using invalid modeling tools.&lt;ref name=NYT21june17&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Eduardo|title=Fisticuffs Over the Route to a Clean-Energy Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/business/energy-environment/renewable-energy-national-academy-matt-jacobson.html|accessdate=4 August 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 June 2017|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1610381114 |pmid=28630353 |pmc=5495221 |title=Evaluation of a proposal for reliable low-cost grid power with 100% wind, water, and solar |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=114 |issue=26 |pages=6722–6727 |year=2017 |last1=Clack |first1=Christopher T.

=== Grid integration simulation ===
In 2015, Jacobson and Delucchi, together with Mary Cameron and Bethany Frew, examined with computer simulation (LOADMATCH), in more detail how a wind-water-solar (WWS) system can track the energy demand from minute to minute. This turned out to be possible in the United States for 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15060 Jacobson, M.Z., M.A. Delucchi, M.A. Cameron, and B.A. Frew, ''A low-cost solution to the grid reliability problem with 100% penetration of intermittent wind, water, and solar for all purposes'', Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 112 (49) 15060-15065 December 8, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, the plan was further developed for 139 countries by a team of 27 researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.joule.2017.07.005 |title=100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water, and Sunlight All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World |journal=Joule |volume=1 |pages=108–21 |year=2017 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Bauer |first3=Zack A.F |last4=Goodman |first4=Savannah C |last5=Chapman |first5=William E |last6=Cameron |first6=Mary A |last7=Bozonnat |first7=Cedric |last8=Chobadi |first8=Liat |last9=Clonts |first9=Hailey A |last10=Enevoldsen |first10=Peter |last11=Erwin |first11=Jenny R |last12=Fobi |first12=Simone N |last13=Goldstrom |first13=Owen K |last14=Hennessy |first14=Eleanor M |last15=Liu |first15=Jingyi |last16=Lo |first16=Jonathan |last17=Meyer |first17=Clayton B |last18=Morris |first18=Sean B |last19=Moy |first19=Kevin R |last20=O'Neill |first20=Patrick L |last21=Petkov |first21=Ivalin |last22=Redfern |first22=Stephanie |last23=Schucker |first23=Robin |last24=Sontag |first24=Michael A |last25=Wang |first25=Jingfan |last26=Weiner |first26=Eric |last27=Yachanin |first27=Alexander S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018, Jacobson and Delucchi with Mary Cameron and Brian Mathiesen published the LOADMATCH results for 20 regions in which the 139 countries in the world are divided. According to this research, a WWS system can follow the demand in all regions.&lt;ref name="WWS2"&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CombiningRenew/WorldGridIntegration.pdf WWS per region]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2018.02.009 |title=Matching demand with supply at low cost in 139 countries among 20 world regions with 100% intermittent wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=123 |pages=236–48 |year=2018 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Cameron |first3=Mary A |last4=Mathiesen |first4=Brian V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program LOADMATCH receives as input estimated series, per half minute during 2050-2055, of
* the energy demand
* the intermittent wind and solar energy supply predicted with a 3D global climate / weather model GATOR-GCMOM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/GATOR/GATOR-GCMOMHist.pdf |title=Data |website=web.stanford.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the hydropower, geothermal, tidal and wave energy
and specifications of
* the capacities and maximum loading / unloading speeds of the different types of storage
* losses due to storage, transport, distribution and maintenance
* a demand-supply management system ([[smart grid]]).

The program has been carried out for each region 10-20 times with adapted input for the storage capacities, until a solution was found in which the energy demand was followed, per half minute for 5 years, with low costs.

The WWS system is assumed to connect in the electric network
* geographically dispersed variable energy sources, [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) and hydro power
* storage facilities: [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]], as heat in CSP plants, in batteries, as hydrogen by electrolysis of water, or as compressed air underground.

Although electricity is currently a big fraction of primary energy; it is to be expected that with renewable energy deployment primary energy use will go down sharply as electricity use increases, as it is likely to be combined with some degree of further electrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | authorlink = Mark Z.

== Obstacles ==
The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies, at the pace required to prevent [[runaway climate change]], are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are:&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* [[Climate change denial]]
* [[Fossil fuels lobby|Efforts to impede renewable energy by the fossil fuel industry]]
* Political paralysis
* Unsustainable consumption of energy and resources
* Path dependencies and outdated infrastructure
* Financial and governance constraints
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[NASA]] Climate scientist [[James Hansen]] discusses the problem with rapid [[fossil fuel phase-out|phase out of fossil fuels]] and said that while it is conceivable in places such as New Zealand and Norway, "suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the [[Easter Bunny]] and [[Tooth Fairy]]."&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/nuclear_energy_and_climate_change_environmentalists_debate_how_to_stop_global.html|title=Nuclear energy and climate change: Environmentalists debate how to stop global warming.|work=Slate Magazine|date=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=James|title=Baby Lauren and the Kool-Aid|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2011/20110729_BabyLauren.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2013|authorlink=James Hansen|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solar-generated electricity including the proposals of Jacobson and colleagues, and writing in an issue of ''Spectrum'' prepared by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], he identified numerous points of concern, such as cost, intermittent power supply, growing [[NIMBY]]ism, and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that "History and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed."&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/a-skeptic-looks-at-alternative-energy/0|title=A Skeptic Looks at Alternative Energy|author=Vaclav Smil|work=ieee.org|date=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smil and Hansen are concerned about the [[variable renewable energy|variable output]] of solar and wind power, but American physicist Amory Lovins has said that the [[electricity grid]] can cope, just as it routinely backs up nonworking coal-fired and nuclear plants with working ones.&lt;ref name=lovi12&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |issue=March/April 2012 |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |journal=Foreign Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 American academic Dr. Gregory Unruh published a dissertation identifying the systemic barriers to the adoption and diffusion of renewable energy technologies. This theoretical framework was called [[Carbon lock-in|Carbon Lock-in]] and pointed to the creation of self-reinforcing feedbacks that arise through the co-evolution of large technological systems, like electricity and transportation networks, with the social and political institutions that support and benefit from system growth. Once established, these techno-institutional complexes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/portal/pls/portallive/docs/1/7294726.PDF |title=Microsoft Word - Lock-in_Foxon_final.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; become "locked-in" and resist efforts to transform them towards more environmentally sustainable systems based on renewable sources.

[[Lester R. Brown]] founder and president of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, D.C., says a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy is both possible and necessary. Brown compares with the U.S. entry into World War II and the subsequent rapid mobilization and transformation of the US industry and economy. A quick transition to 100% renewable energy and saving of our civilization is proposed by Brown to follow an approach with similar urgency.&lt;ref name="Plan B 4.0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth-policy.org/images/uploads/book_files/pb4book.pdf |title=Plan B 4.0, Mobilizing to Save Civilization  |author=Lester R. Brown |date=2009 |work=Earth Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]] says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production.&lt;ref name=IEA /&gt; The issue of [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent supply]] applies to popular renewable technologies, mainly [[wind power]] and [[solar photovoltaics]], and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as the demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when [[dispatchable generation]] such as hydroelectricity or solar thermal storage is also available. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification.&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/so_contribution.pdf|title=Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:&lt;ref name=Lovins11&gt;[[Amory Lovins]] (2011). ''[[Reinventing Fire]]'', Chelsea Green Publishing, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the world's leading climate researchers selected by the United Nations, said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17" /&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 22"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |date=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years.&lt;ref name=ipccccc /&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out with their [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|fifth report]], saying that in the absence of any one technology (such as bioenergy, [[carbon dioxide capture and storage]], nuclear, wind and solar), climate change mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on which technology is absent. For example, it may cost 40% more to reduce carbon emissions without carbon dioxide capture. (Table 3.2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/|title=IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|work=ipcc.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google spent $30 million on their RE&lt;C project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change. The project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change|title=What It Would Really Take to Reverse Climate Change|publisher=|date=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4446">The '''ASPRO chronology''' is a nine-period dating system of the ancient [[Near East]] used by the [[Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée]] for [[archaeological]] sites aged between 14,000 and 5,700 BP.&lt;ref name="Hours1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Hours|title=Atlas des sites du proche orient (14000 - 5700 BP)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlZtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 July 2011|year=1994|publisher=Maison de l'Orient méditerranéen|isbn=978-2-903264-53-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASPRO : Atlas des Sites du Proche-Orient|url=http://www.mom.fr/ressources-numeriques/bases-de-donnees/ASPRO|website=MAISON DE L'ORIENT ET DE LA MÉDITERRANÉE JEAN POUILLOUX|accessdate=25 September 2016|ref=MOM.FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASPRO stands for the "Atlas des sites du Proche-Orient" (Atlas of Near East archaeological sites), a French publication pioneered by [[Francis Hours]] and developed by other scholars such as [[Olivier Aurenche]].

The periods, [[archaeological culture|cultures]], features and date ranges of the original ASPRO chronology are shown below:

In 2001, the institute revised the chronology of the first six periods based on newer carbon data and calibration curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Auranche | first=O | title=Proto-neolithic and Neolithic Cultures in the Middle East — the Birth of Agriculture, Livestock Raining, and Ceramics: a Calibrated 14C Chronology 12,500–5500 cal BC | journal=Radiocarbon | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=1191–1202 | year=2001 | url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/PDF/RadioCarbon.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Period 3 an early and late phase could be distinguished, but Periods 4 and 5 were merged. Overall they found more overlap in time between different cultural phases between different sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2843">In [[anthropology]], an '''acephalous society''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀκέφαλος "headless") is a society which lacks political leaders or hierarchies. Such groups are also known [[Social stratification#Non-stratified societies|non-stratified]] societies. Typically these societies are small-scale,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51115271|title=Dictionary of the social sciences|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Calhoun, Craig J., 1952-, Oxford University Press.|isbn=9780199891184|location=New York|oclc=51115271}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized into bands or tribes that make decisions through [[consensus decision making]] rather than appointing permanent chiefs or kings. Most foraging or [[hunter-gatherer]] societies are acephalous {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Some exceptions to this trend are the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley Civilization]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]] and the [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worshipping Power: An Anarchist History of State Formation|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When these societies do not possess distinctions of rank, they are described as [[egalitarian]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In scientific literature covering native African societies and the effect of [[European colonialism]] on them the term is often used to describe groups of people living in a settlement with "no government in the sense of a group able to exercise effective control over both the people and their territory".&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Daannaa: "The Acephalous Society And The Indirect Rule System in Africa, Journal of Legal Pluralism And Unofficial Law, Nr. 34, p. 62, http://www.jlp.bham.ac.uk/volumes/34/daannaa-art.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect the term is also often used as synonymous to "stateless society".&lt;ref name="Ayittey"&gt;Daannaa, p61; G.N. Ayittey: "STATELESS SOCIETIES: The Igbo, the Fulani, the Somali", A New Nigeria, http://seunfakze.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/stateless-societies-the-igbo-the-fulani-the-somali-by-prof-g-n-ayittey/&lt;/ref&gt; Such societies are described as consensus-democratic in opposition to the majority-democratic systems of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Ayittey, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Igbo people|Igbo Nation]] in West Africa is alleged to be an acephalous or egalitarian society.&lt;ref name="Ayittey"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Archaeological science''', also known as '''archaeometry''', consists of the application of [[scientific technique]]s to the analysis of archaeological materials, to assist in dating the materials. It is related to [[Scientific methodology|methodologies]] of archaeology.  Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcos Martinón-Torres and David Killick|title=Archaeological Theories and Archaeological Sciences in "The Oxford Handbook of Archaeological Theory"|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level  theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Social science and archaeological enquiry|journal=Antiquity|date=4 April 2017|volume=91|issue=356|pages=520–528|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Natural Environment Research Council|Natural and Environmental Research Council]] provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in almost all cases of archeometric research, scientists from the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] assist in the scientific analysis of archeological artifacts. Universities that offer courses in archeometry offer these courses frequently as free choice for [[Archaeology|archeology]] students and these courses contain mainly a nonscientific overview over the possibilities that different scientific analyses offer to them.

== Types of archaeological science ==
Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M.S. (1991) Archaeological Science - past achievements and future prospects. ''Archaeometry'' '''31''' 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;
* physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating|relative]] [[chronology|chronologies]]
* [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] studies
* environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and [[pathology]] of people
* mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods)
* [[remote sensing|remote-sensing]] and [[geophysical survey|geophysical-survey]] techniques for buried features
* [[conservation sciences]], involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation

Techniques such as [[lithic analysis]], [[archaeometallurgy]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[zooarchaeology]] also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.

=== Dating techniques ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological [[stratum|strata]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Some of the most important [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] techniques include:
* [[radiocarbon dating]] — especially for dating organic materials
* [[dendrochronology]] — for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates
* [[thermoluminescence dating]] — for dating inorganic material (including ceramics)
* [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) — for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of [[quartz]] within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure [[potassium feldspar]]s, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications)
* [[electron spin resonance]], as used (for example) in dating teeth
* [[potassium-argon dating]] — for dating (for example) fossilized [[Hominidae|hominid]] remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated)

=== Artifact studies ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:
* [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF)
* [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS)
* [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA)
* [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM)
* [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS)

[[Lead]], [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope analysis]] can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study's subjects.

[[Provenance analysis]] has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of [[trade|exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of archaeometry ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the "second [[radiocarbon revolution]]" significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the "first radiocarbon revolution" from 1949.

== Locating Archaeological Sites ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites.  The use of [[remote sensing]] has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of [[aerial photography]] (including [[satellite imagery]] and [[Lidar]]) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]s often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.&lt;ref&gt;

The two best established biomonitoring programs in representative samples of the general population are those of the United States and Germany, although population-based programs exist in a few other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Porta M, etal | year = 2008 | title = Monitoring concentrations of persistent organic pollutants in the general population: the international experience | url = | journal = Environment International | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 546–561 | doi=10.1016/j.envint.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) began to publish its biennial ''National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals'', which reports a statistically representative sample of the U.S. population.&lt;ref name=CDC_about&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Program | work = cdc.gov | publisher = Centers for Disease Control | date = 3 April 2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/about.html | accessdate = 25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Working Group]] has also conducted biomonitoring studies.&lt;ref name=EWG/&gt;

==Definition==
Biomonitoring involves the use of organisms to assess [[environmental contamination]], such as of surrounding air or water. It can be done [[Qualitative research|qualitatively]] by observing and noting changes in organisms, or [[quantitatively]] by measuring accumulation of chemicals in organism tissues. By observing or measuring the effects the environment has on its resident organisms, pollution may be suspected or [[inferred]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Biomonitoring | work = www.water.ncsu.edu | publisher = NCSU Water Quality Group | url = http://www.water.ncsu.edu/watershedss/info/biomon.html | accessdate = 29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Historically, [[public health]] regulations{{where|date=April 2016}} have been based on theoretical risk calculations according to known levels of chemical substances in air, water, soil, food, other consumer products and other sources of potential exposure.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Human biomonitoring offers the opportunity to analyze the actual internal levels of bodily substances from all potential routes of exposure at one time, which may contribute to improving risk assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Juberg |first1=Daland R. |last2=Bus |first2=James |last3=Katz |first3=Diane S. |title=The Opportunities and Limitations of Biomonitoring |journal=Policy Brief |date=February 2008 |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |url=http://www.mackinac.org/archives/2008/s2008-01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2016}}

Scientific advancements have made it possible to detect a greater number of chemical substances in smaller concentrations in the body, with some chemicals detectable at levels as low as parts per trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_acc/bin.asp?CID=257&amp;DID=1584&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF |title=What is Biomonitoring? |format=PDF |work=American Chemistry Council |accessdate=11 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123051537/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_acc/bin.asp?CID=257&amp;DID=1584&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF |archive-date=2008-11-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2016}} A single biomonitoring measurement is only one snapshot in time and may not accurately reflect the level of exposure over longer periods.&lt;ref name=Foster_Agzarian&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00216-006-0822-6 |title=Reporting results of biomonitoring studies |year=2006 |last1=Foster |first1=Warren G. |last2=Agzarian |first2=John |journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry |volume=387 |pages=137–40 |pmid=17093961 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[United States National Research Council|U.S. National Research Council]] published a report, ''Human Biomonitoring for Environmental Chemicals''. The report recognized the value of biomonitoring for better understanding exposure to environmental chemicals, and included several findings and recommendations to improve the utility of biomonitoring data for [[health risk assessment]].&lt;ref name=NRCReport&gt;{{cite news|last=Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology|title=Human Biomonitoring for Environmental Chemicals|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11700&amp;page=1|accessdate=2012-01-20|newspaper=U.S. National Research Council|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, the report called for more rigorous health-based criteria for selecting chemicals to include in biomonitoring studies; the development of tools and techniques to improve risk-based interpretation and communication of biomonitoring data; integration of biomonitoring into exposure assessment and epidemiological research; and exploration of bioethical issues around biomonitoring, including informed consent, confidentiality of results, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on Biomonitoring |publisher=American Chemical Society |url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/policy/publicpolicies/promote/biomonitoring.html |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224115706/http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_SUPERARTICLE&amp;node_id=1901&amp;use_sec=false&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=d3db2ed2-5853-4b7f-932b-fe46125e26b6 |archivedate=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of exposure to environmental chemicals has received attention as a result of televised reports by [[Bill Moyers]] for [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and [[Anderson Cooper]] for [[CNN]]'s "[[Planet in Peril]]" series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Planet in Peril | work = CNN.com | publisher = CNN | date = October 2007 | url = http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2007/planet.in.peril/ | accessdate = 13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''[[Our Stolen Future]]'', with a foreword by former Vice President [[Al Gore]], also raised awareness by focusing on [[endocrine disruption]].

==Surveys in the U.S.==
*In the United States, the CDC first tested samples from the general population for lead and a few pesticides in 1976.&lt;ref name=Stokstad&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.304.5679.1892 |title=BIOMONITORING: Pollution Gets Personal |year=2004 |last1=Stokstad |first1=E. |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5679 |pages=1892–4 |pmid=15218119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES) program had a major expansion.&lt;ref name=Stokstad/&gt;
*''National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals''
The CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences within the National Center for Environmental Health has developed a National Biomonitoring Program, and has published the biennial ''National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals'' since 2001. As the selection of chemicals is controversial, the CDC has identified influential criteria:Evidence of exposure in a U.S. population, presence and significance of health effects after a given level of exposure, desire to track public health initiatives to reduce exposure to a given agent, existing method for accurately measuring biologically relevant concentrations of the chemical, sufficient tissue specimens, in particular, blood and/or urine samples and cost-effectiveness.&lt;ref name=chemrisk&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.8755 |title=Biomonitoring and Biomarkers: Exposure Assessment Will Never Be the Same |year=2006 |last1=Paustenbach |first1=Dennis |last2=Galbraith |first2=David |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=114 |issue=8 |pages=1143–9 |pmid=16882516 |pmc=1552022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDC established three criteria for removing chemicals from future surveys: a new replacement chemical (i.e., a metabolite or other chemical) is more representative of exposure than the chemical currently measured, or if after three survey periods, detection rates for all chemicals within a method-related group are less than 5 percent for all population subgroups (i.e., two sexes, three race/ethnicity groups, and the age groups used in the National Report), or if after three survey periods, levels of chemicals within a method-related group are unchanged or declining in all demographic subgroups documented in the National Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Public Comments and Revised Criteria for Removing Chemicals Future Editions of CDC's National Report on Human Exposure Environmental Chemicals | url = https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/| work = Federal Register | volume = 73 | issue = 61 | pages = 16688 | date = 28 March 2008 | accessdate = 10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[National Children's Study]] plans to follow 100,000 children across the United States from birth until age 21. The study was authorized as part of the [[Children's Health Act]] of 2000 as the largest effort undertaken to address the effects of social, economic and environmental factors on a child's health. the CDC's Environmental Health Laboratory announced in 2009 it would play a key role in the biomonitoring of the ongoing National Children's Study,In collaboration with the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD), [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] and U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Children's Study | work = cdc.gov | date = 2009-07-07 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/childrens_study.html | accessdate = 23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

The presence of an environmental chemical in the body does not necessarily indicate harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interpreting the Data |url=https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/ |work=Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2007 |accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analytical chemistry of detecting chemicals has advanced more rapidly than the ability to interpret the potential health consequences.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Human Biomonitoring for Environmental Chemicals | year = 2008 | publisher = National Research Council | url = http://www.nao.edu/catalog/11700.html | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health risks are usually established from toxicity studies in laboratory animals and epidemiological evidence in humans. [[Lead]] is a well studied chemical with a CDC action level of concern, currently at 10&amp;nbsp;µg/dL, or 100 [[parts per billion]], in blood; however, neurobehavioral impairment has been noted below this level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/lead/pb_standards2.html Lead (Pb) Toxicity: What Are the U.S. Standards for Lead Levels?] [[ATSDR]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because this approach requires establishment of cause and effect in epidemiological studies and a thorough understanding of human dose response, data to support these types of action levels exist for only a few environmental chemicals.  The concept of Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) has been developed as an alternative approach to aid in interpreting and communicating biomonitoring results in the context of potential risks to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpretation of Report Data: Important Factors|url=https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/data_tables/interpretation.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys of human exposure to chemicals do not usually integrate the number of chemical compounds detected per person and the concentration of each compound. This leaves untested relevant exposure situations; e.g., whether individuals with low concentrations of some compounds have high concentrations of the other compounds. Analyses of the concentrations of a given compound usually show that most citizens have much lower concentrations than a certain minority. A study based on a representative sample of the population of Catalonia (Spain),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Porta M ''et al.'' | year = 2012 | title = Number of persistent organic pollutants detected at high concentrations in a general population | url = | journal = Environment International | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 106–111 | doi=10.1016/j.envint.2012.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which integrated the number of compounds detected per person and the concentration of each compound, found that more than half of the population had concentrations in the top quartile of 1 or more of the 19 persistent toxic substances (PTS) (pesticides, PCBs) analyzed. Significant subgroups of the population accumulated PTS mixtures at high concentrations. For instance, 48% of women 60–74 years had concentrations of  6 or more PTS in the top quartile; half of the entire population had levels of 1 to 5 PTS above 500&amp;nbsp;ng/g, and less than 4% of citizens had all PTS in the lowest quartile. Thus, PTS concentrations appear low in most of the population only when each individual compound is looked at separately. It is not accurate to state that most of the population has low concentrations of PTS. The assessment of mixture effects must address the fact that most individuals are contaminated by PTS mixtures made of compounds at both low and high concentrations.

==Biomonitoring equivalents==

Scientists performing biomonitoring testing are able to detect and measure concentrations of natural and manmade chemicals in human blood and urine samples at parts-per-billion to parts-per-quadrillion levels. A 2006 [[U.S. National Research Council]] report found that while scientists were capable of detecting the chemicals at these levels, methods for interpreting and communicating what their presence meant regarding potential health risks to an individual or population were still lacking.&lt;ref name="NRCReport" /&gt; The report recommended that scientific research be done to improve the interpretation and communication of biomonitoring results through the use of existing risk assessments of specific chemicals.&lt;ref name="NRCReport" /&gt;

To address this situation, several groups  recognized that exposure guidance values, such as [[reference dose]] and [[tolerable daily intake]], could, with sufficient data, be translated into corresponding estimates of [[biomarker]] concentrations for use in the interpretation of biomonitoring data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.jes.7500540 |title=Reverse dosimetry: Interpreting trihalomethanes biomonitoring data using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling |year=2006 |last1=Tan |first1=Yu-Mei |last2=Liao |first2=Kai H |last3=Clewell |first3=Harvey J |journal=Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=591–603 |pmid=17108893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ScreeningApproach&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2006.08.004 |title=Biomonitoring equivalents: A screening approach for interpreting biomonitoring results from a public health risk perspective |year=2007 |last1=Hays |first1=S.M. |last2=Becker |first2=R.A. |last3=Leung |first3=H.W. |last4=Aylward |first4=L.L. |last5=Pyatt |first5=D.W. |journal=[[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]] |volume=47 |pages=96–109 |pmid=17030369 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the initial methodology for the systematic translation of exposure guidance values into corresponding screening values for biomonitoring data, dubbed Biomonitoring Equivalents, was published by scientists from Summit Toxicology.&lt;ref name="ScreeningApproach"/&gt; Subsequently, an expert panel from government, industry and academia, convened to develop detailed guidelines for deriving and communicating these Biomonitoring Equivalents.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2008.05.004|title=Guidelines for the derivation of Biomonitoring Equivalents: Report from the Biomonitoring Equivalents Expert Workshop|year=2008|last1=Hays|first1=Sean M.|last2=Aylward|first2=Lesa L.|last3=Lakind|first3=Judy S.| last4=Bartels|first4=Michael J.|last5=Barton|first5=Hugh A.|last6=Boogaard|first6=Peter J.| last7=Brunk| first7=Conrad| last8=Dizio|first8=Stephe|last9=Dourson|first9=Michael| displayauthors = 8|journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology| volume=51| issue=3| pages=S4–15|pmid=18583008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomonitoring Equivalents can be used for evaluation of biomonitoring data in a risk assessment context. Comparing biomonitoring data for a chemical with its Biomonitoring Equivalent provides a means for assessing whether population exposures to chemicals are within or above the levels considered safe by regulatory agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cen-v086n014.p052 |title=Advertisement |year=2008 |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=86 |issue=14 |pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomonitoring Equivalents can thus assist scientists and risk managers in the prioritization of chemicals for follow-up or risk management activities.&lt;ref name="ScreeningApproach" /&gt;

Since 2007, scientists have derived and published Biomonitoring Equivalents for more than 110 chemicals, including [[cadmium]], [[benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[arsenic]], [[toluene]], [[methylene chloride]], [[triclosan]], [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[volatile organic compounds]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijheh.2011.06.002 |title=Human biomonitoring assessment values: Approaches and data requirements |year=2011 |last1=Angerer |first1=Jürgen |last2=Aylward |first2=Lesa L. |last3=Hays |first3=Sean M. |last4=Heinzow |first4=Birger |last5=Wilhelm |first5=Michael |journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health |volume=214 |issue=5 |pages=348–60 |pmid=21764371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chemicalsubstanceschimiques"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitoring and Surveillance Activities under Canada's Chemicals Management Plan|url=http://www.chemicalsubstanceschimiques.gc.ca/plan/surveil/index-eng.php|publisher=Government of Canada, Chemical Substances Division|accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several have been developed through collaborations of scientists from the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and [[Health Canada]].&lt;ref name="Pmid" /&gt; Researchers from the German Human Biomonitoring Commission&lt;ref name="Schulz2007" /&gt; have also proposed a concept for deriving screening values similar to Biomonitoring Equivalents.&lt;ref name="chemicalsubstanceschimiques" /&gt;

==Communication==
The National Research Council's 2006 report emphasized that accurate communication of results is essential for the proper use of biomonitoring surveys, but at the same time noted "there is no accepted standard for good biomonitoring communications."&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; In 2007, the [[Boston University School of Public Health]] organized a panel on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Consensus Statement on Human Biomonitoring | work = Measuring Chemicals in People -- What Would You Say? | publisher = Boston University School of Public Health | url = http://www.biomonitoring06.org/uploads/Main/Consensus_statement_final.pdf | accessdate = 23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expert panel on Biomonitoring Equivalents has published guidelines for communicating information to the general public and health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2008.05.007|title=Guidelines for the communication of Biomonitoring Equivalents: Report from the Biomonitoring Equivalents Expert Workshop|year=2008|last1=Lakind|first1=Judy S.| last2=Aylward|first2=Lesa L.| last3=Brunk| first3=Conrad| last4=Dizio| first4=Stephen| last5=Dourson| first5=Michael| last6=Goldstein|first6=Daniel A.|last7=Kilpatrick|first7=Michael E.|last8=Krewski|first8=Daniel|last9=Bartels|first9=Michael J.| displayauthors = 8| journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=S16–26|pmid=18579271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bosscha Observatory''' is the oldest modern [[observatory]] in [[Indonesia]], and one of the oldest in Asia. The observatory is located in [[Lembang]], [[West Java]], approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Bandung]]. It is situated on a hilly six hectares of land and is {{convert|1310|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]] plateau. The IAU observatory code for Bosscha is 299.

==History==
During the first meeting of the ''Nederlandsch-Indische Sterrekundige Vereeniging'' (Dutch-Indies Astronomical Society) in the 1920s, it was agreed that an [[observatory]] was needed to study [[astronomy]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Of all locations in the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesia archipelago]], a [[tea|tea plantation]] in Malabar, a few kilometers north of [[Bandung]] in [[West Java]] was selected. It is on the hilly north side of the city with a non-obstructed view of the sky and with close access to the city that was planned to become the new capital of the Dutch colony, replacing Batavia (present-day [[Jakarta]]). The observatory is named after the tea plantation owner [[Karel Albert Rudolf Bosscha]], son of the physicist [[Johannes Bosscha]] and a major force in the development of science and technology in the Dutch East Indies, who granted six hectares of his property for the new observatory.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hastings, ''The Road to Lembang: A Retrospect, 1938-1966'', p. 34. Griffith University, Division of Asian and International Studies, Centre for the Study of Australia-Asia Relations, 1990. {{ISBN|9780868573564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the observatory began in 1923 and was completed in 1928. Since then a continuous observation of the sky was made. The first international publication from Bosscha was published in 1922. Observations from Bosscha were halted during [[World War II]] and after the war a major reconstruction was necessary. On 17 October 1951, the Dutch-Indies Astronomical Society handed over operation of the observatory to the [[government of Indonesia]]. In 1959 the observatory's operation was given to the [[Institut Teknologi Bandung]] and has been an integral part of the research and formal education of astronomy in Indonesia.

==Facilities==

Five large [[telescope]]s were installed in Bosscha:

# The Zeiss double refractor
#:This telescope is mainly used to observe visual [[binary star]]s, conduct [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric studies]] on [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]], image [[lunar crater]]s, observe planets ([[Mars]], [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]]) and to observe [[comet]] details and other heavy bodies. The telescope has two [[objective lens]]es with a diameter of {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} each and a [[focal length]] of {{convert|10.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.
# The Schmidt telescope (nicknamed: ''Bima Sakti'' telescope)
#: This telescope is used to study [[galaxy|galactic structure]], [[stellar spectra]], [[asteroid]] studies, [[supernova]]e, and to photograph heavy bodies. The main lens diameter is {{convert|71.12|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the correcting bi-concave and convex lens is {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} with a focal length of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is also equipped with a [[spectrum|spectral]] [[prism (optics)|prism]] with a prime angle of 6.10 degrees for stellar spectra, a wedge sensitometer and a [[film recorder]].
# The Bamberg refractor
#: This telescope is used to determine [[stellar magnitude]], [[stellar distance]], and photometric studies of eclipsing stars, [[sun|solar imaging]], and others. It is equipped with a photoelectric [[photometer]] a {{convert|37|cm|in|abbr=on}} lens diameter and a {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} meter focal length.
# The Cassegrain GOTO
#: This was a gift from the [[government of Japan|Japanese government]]. This computer controlled telescope can automatically view objects from a database and this was the first digital telescope at Bosscha. The telescope is also equipped with a [[photometer]] and [[Spectrometer|spectrometer-spectrograph]].
# The Unitron refractor
#: This telescope is used for observing [[hilal (crescent moon)|hilal]], [[lunar eclipse]], [[solar eclipse]] and [[sunspot]] photography, and also other objects. Lens diameter is {{convert|10.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a focal length of {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1512">The '''concert saloon''' was an American adaptation of the [[English people|English]] [[music hall]], and a precursor of variety and [[vaudeville]] theater. As in the music hall, [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] was served. The entertainment at the [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] was to hold the imbiber's attention, so they would imbibe more.

{{quote|The fact that the concert saloons featured a kind of particularly tawdry, low-end theatre as well as liquor and the new fad of "waiter girls"—and, in the minds of many, [[prostitution]]—was too much for many so-called respectable people to bear. As late as 1881, ''[[Nym Crinkle]]'' would point out, "they serve as the gathering places for idle and vicious people to drink beer, listen to execrable music, make assignations, and parade in the dirtiest market those common charms which they have to sell."

{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
The '''crime against nature''' or '''unnatural act''' has historically been a legal term in [[English language|English]]-speaking [[State (polity)|states]] identifying forms of [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] not considered [[natural]] or decent and are legally punishable [[offence (law)|offenses]].&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], Book 4, Chapter 15, Section 4&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual practices that have historically been considered to be "crimes against nature" include [[anal sex]]&lt;ref name="See Rose v 1975"&gt;See Rose v. Locke, 1975, 96 S.Ct. 243, 423 U.S. 48, 46 L.Ed.2d 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Andrews v. Vanduzer 1814"&gt;Andrews v. Vanduzer, [[Supreme Court of New York|N.Y.Sup.]] 1814 (January Term, 1814)(Vanduzer accused Andrews of having had connection with a cow and then a mare and the court understood this to mean that Vanduzer was going around telling others that Andrews had been guilty of the crime against nature with a beast.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and terminology==

For much of modern history, a "crime against nature" was understood by courts to be synonymous to "[[buggery]]", and to include [[anal sex]] (copulation ''per anum'') and [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="See Rose v 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews v. Vanduzer 1814"/&gt; Early court decisions agreed that [[fellatio]] (copulation ''per os'') was not included, though mainly because that practice was virtually unknown when the common-law definition was established (it remained so rare that first attempted fellatio prosecutions under the "crime against nature" statute date to 1817 in England and 1893 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rex v. Samuel Jacobs (1817); Prindle v. State of Texas, 21 S.W. 360 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;) Likewise, sexual activities between two women were not covered. Over time, particularly starting in the early 20th century, some jurisdictions started enacting statutes or developing precedents the extended the scope of the crime to include fellatio and, sometimes, other sexual activities.

The term ''crime against nature'' is closely related to, and was often used interchangeably with, the term ''[[sodomy]]''. (This varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes the two terms were understood to be synonymous; sometimes sodomy was limited to sexual activities between two humans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/oldwiki/images/8/81/Ausman_v._Veal,_10_IN_355.pdf|title=Ausman v. Veal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes sodomy was taken to include anal sex or bestiality, whereas ''crime against nature'' also included fellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4736&amp;context=jclc|title=The role of common law concepts in modern jurisprudence}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Until the early 19th century, courts were divided on whether the act needed to be completed (to result in ejaculation) in order to be a punishable offense. This question was deemed sufficiently important that, in 1828, English law was explicitly amended to specify that proof of ejaculation was not necessary for convictions for buggery and rape.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law|author= Charles F. Williams|year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime was not limited to same-sex activities, and, in case of an act between two adults, both participants were guilty, regardless of consent. Attempted or completed act of sodomy, committed by a husband against his wife, was grounds for divorce in common law.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

Historically, the offense was usually referred to by its longer name, the ''detestable and abominable'' (or ''abominable and detestable'', or, sometimes, ''infamous'') ''crime against nature, committed with mankind or beast''. This phrase originates in [[Buggery Act 1533]], with words "crime against nature" substituted for "vice of buggery" in the original, and it was present in one of these forms in criminal codes of most U.S. states.  Specific acts included under this heading were typically deemed too detestable to list them explicitly, resulting in a number of vagueness-based legal challenges to corresponding statutes. One of the most recent, and one of the rare successful challenges, is the 1971 Florida case of ''[[Franklin v. State]]''. On the other hand, just 7 years prior, a similar challenge (''Perkins v. State''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/234/333/1671292/|title=Perkins v. State of North Carolina, 234 F. Supp. 333 (W.D.N.C. 1964)}}&lt;/ref&gt;) failed in North Carolina. (In ''Perkins'', the Court wrote that, if this were a new statute, it would have been "obviously unconstitutional for vagueness", but, since this was a statute whose history was traceable back to the reign of [[Henry VIII]], it accumulated a number of judicial interpretations, and, backed with these interpretations, it was not unconstitutionally vague.)

Penalties for this offense varied greatly over time and between jurisdictions. Crime against nature remained punishable by death or life imprisonment both in the UK and in many U.S. states well into the 19th century. Liberalization of sexual morals led to reduction of penalties or decriminalization of the offense during the second half of the 20th century, so that, by 2003, it was no longer a punishable offense in 36 out of 50 U.S. states, and was only punishable by a fine in some of the remaining 14. (See [[Sodomy laws in the United States]] for details.)

==Current use==
Currently, the term crime against nature is still used in the [[statutes]] of the following [[United States|American]] states. However, these laws are unconstitutional to enforce for sexual conduct between consenting adults in light of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003). The crime against nature statutes are however still used to criminalize sexual conduct involving minors, [[incest]], public sex, [[prostitution]] and [[bestiality]].

==Repeal and unconstitutionality==
Except for the above nine states, all other states in the United States have repealed their "crimes against nature" laws. Furthermore, in 2003, in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the US Supreme Court held that nonremunerative sex between consenting adults in private was protected by the Constitution and could not be criminalized under "crimes against nature" laws. Thus, fellatio, cunnilingus and homosexual sex can no longer fall within the scope of such laws.

'''Demography''' (from prefix ''demo-'' from [[Ancient Greek]] δῆμος ''dēmos'' meaning "the people", and ''-graphy'' from γράφω ''graphō'', implies "writing, description or measurement"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demography for etymology (origins) of ''demography''].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[statistics|statistical study]] of [[population|populations]], especially [[human|human beings]]. As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space (see [[population dynamics]]).  Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to [[birth]], [[Migration (human)|migration]], [[aging]], and [[death]]. Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth's population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers. Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population.

[[Demographic analysis]] can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as [[education]], [[nationality]], [[religion]], and [[ethnicity]]. Educational institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science of Population |url=http://demographicpartitions.org/science-population-determines-population-change/ |website=demographicpartitions.org |accessdate=4 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814023915/http://demographicpartitions.org/science-population-determines-population-change/ |archivedate=14 August 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually treat demography as a field of [[sociology]], though there are a number of independent demography departments.&lt;ref name="ub"&gt;{{Cite web | title=UC Berkeley Demography department website | url=http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formal demography''' limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of '''social demography''' or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hinde ''Demographic Methods'' Ch. 1 {{ISBN|0-340-71892-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Demographic thoughts traced back to antiquity, and were present in many civilisations and cultures, like [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNcflpmW3BUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=studies+in+demography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y1QFr3LGxP&amp;sig=xJkW1mxVL6XS-Gij0tOpOsFZA9E&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=qdjRS8DjMsGC8gbj4Ii_Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false S.C.Srivastava,''Studies in Demography'', p.39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greece, this can be found in the writings of [[Herodotus]], [[Thucidides]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Epicurus]], [[Protagoras]], [[Polus]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006" /&gt; In Rome, writers and philosophers like [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the elder]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Epictetus]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], and [[Columella]] also expressed important ideas on this ground.&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006"/&gt;

In the [[Middle ages]], Christian thinkers devoted much time in refuting the Classical ideas on demography.  Important contributors to the field were [[William of Conches]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000"&gt;Peter Biller,''The measure of multitude: Population in medieval thought''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LnqlgqeYhwYC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=Nicole+Oresme+on+demographics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1RB9HPQrvY&amp;sig=RtvI_JuQ4SGR0QYfa7ptB5eDW1w&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=kdLRS8SJBcO78gbWg8jNDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartholomew of Lucca]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; [[William of Pagula]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; and [[Ibn Khaldun]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, &amp; Daria Khaltourina (2006). ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''. Moscow: URSS,  {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest demographic studies in the modern period was ''Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality'' (1662) by [[John Graunt]], which contains a primitive form of [[actuarial table|life table]]. Among the study's findings were that one third of the children in London died before their sixteenth birthday. Mathematicians, such as [[Edmond Halley]], developed the life table as the basis for life insurance mathematics. [[Richard Price]] was credited with the first textbook on life contingencies published in 1771,&lt;ref&gt;“Our Yesterdays: the History of the Actuarial Profession in North America, 1809-1979,” by E.J. (Jack) Moorhead, FSA, ( 1/23/10 – 2/21/04), published by the Society of Actuaries as part of the profession’s centennial celebration in 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; followed later by [[Augustus de Morgan]], ‘On the Application of Probabilities to Life Contingencies’ (1838).&lt;ref&gt;The History of Insurance, Vol 3, Edited by David Jenkins and Takau Yoneyama (1 85196 527 0): 8 Volume Set: ( 2000) Availability: Japan: Kinokuniya).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, [[Benjamin Franklin]] published his essay ''[[Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.]]'', projecting [[exponential growth]] in British colonies.&lt;ref name=valtier&gt;{{cite journal|title= "An Extravagant Assumption": The Demographic Numbers behind Benjamin Franklin's Twenty-Five-Year Doubling Period|last=von Valtier|first=William F.|journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]|volume=155|number=2|date=June 2011|pages=158–188|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/5VonValtier1550205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced [[Thomas Robert Malthus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=April 25, 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123 |jstor=984852 |issn=0003-049X}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, writing at the end of the 18th century, feared that, if unchecked, population growth would tend to outstrip growth in food production, leading to ever-increasing famine and poverty (see [[Malthusian catastrophe]]). Malthus is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the limits to growth. Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by [[Benjamin Gompertz]] and [[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst]].

The period 1860-1910 can be characterised as a period of transition wherein demography emerged from statistics as a separate field of interest. This period included a panoply of international ‘great demographers’ like [[Adolphe Quételet]] (1796–1874), [[William Farr]] (1807–1883), [[Louis-Adolphe Bertillon]] (1821–1883) and his son [[Jacques Bertillon|Jacques]] (1851–1922), [[Joseph Körösi]] (1844–1906), [[Anders Nicolas Kaier]] (1838–1919), [[Richard Böckh]] (1824–1907), [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858-1917), [[Wilhelm Lexis]] (1837–1914), and [[Luigi Bodio]] (1840–1920) contributed to the development of demography and to the toolkit of methods and techniques of demographic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;de Gans, Henk and Frans van Poppel (2000) Contributions from the margins.

==Methods==
There are two types of data collection—direct and indirect—with several different methods of each type.

=== Direct methods ===
Direct data comes from vital statistics registries that track all births and deaths as well as certain changes in legal status such as marriage, divorce, and migration (registration of place of residence). In developed countries with good registration systems (such as the United States and much of Europe), registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths.

A [[census]] is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data. A census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country. In contrast to vital statistics data, which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so, and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths. Analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place. These compare the [[sex ratio]]s from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data.

Censuses do more than just count people. They  typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age, sex, marital  status, literacy/education, employment status, and occupation, and geographical location. They may also collect data on migration (or place of birth or of previous residence), language, religion, nationality (or ethnicity or race), and citizenship.  In countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete, the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality; for example the censuses of the [[People's Republic of China]] gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census.

[[File:World population growth - time between each billion-person growth.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rate of human population growth showing projections for later this century]]

=== Indirect methods ===
Indirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available, such as is the case in much of the developing world, and most of [[historical demography]]. One of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age. With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population. Other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings, parents, and children. Other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography.

There are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes. They include [[models of mortality]] (including the [[life table]], [[Gompertz curve|Gompertz models]], [[Proportional hazards models|hazards models]], [[Proportional hazards models|Cox proportional hazards models]], [[Decrement table|multiple decrement life tables]], [[Brass relational logits]]), [[fertility]] ([[Hernes model]], [[Ansley J. Coale|Coale]]-Trussell models, [[parity progression ratios]]), marriage (Singulate Mean at Marriage, [[Page model]]), disability ([[Sullivan's method]], [[multistate life tables]]), [[population projections]] ([[Lee–Carter model|Lee-Carter model]], the [[Leslie matrix|Leslie Matrix]]), and [[population momentum]] ([[Nathan Keyfitz|Keyfitz]]).

The United Kingdom has a series of four national birth cohort studies, the first three spaced apart by 12 years: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development, the 1958 [[National Child Development Study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Power C and Elliott J |title=Cohort profile: 1958 British Cohort Study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=34–41 |year=2006 |pmid=16155052 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi183}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1970 British Cohort Study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elliott J and Shepherd P|title=Cohort profile: 1970 British Birth Cohort (BCS70)|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=836–43|year=2006 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl174 |pmid=16931528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Millennium Cohort Study]], begun much more recently in 2000. These have followed the lives of samples of people (typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study) for many years, and are still continuing. As the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way, inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of British people in terms of their health, education, attitudes, childbearing and employment patterns.&lt;ref&gt;The last three are run by the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common rates and ratios==

* The '''crude [[birth rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 people.
* The '''general [[fertility rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44).
* The '''age-specific fertility''' rates, the annual number of live births per 1,000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15-19, 20-24 etc.)
* The '''crude [[death rate]]''', the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people.
* The '''[[infant mortality rate]]''', the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1,000 live births.
* The '''expectation of life''' (or [[life expectancy]]), the number of years that an individual at a given age could expect to live at present mortality levels.
* The '''[[total fertility rate]]''', the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life, if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates.
* The '''replacement level fertility''', the average number of children women must have in order to replace the population for the next generation. For example, the replacement level fertility in the US is 2.11.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"&gt;Introduction to environmental engineering and science by Masters and Ela, 2008, Pearson Education, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[gross reproduction rate]]''', the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates.
* The '''net reproduction ratio''' is the expected number of daughters, per newborn prospective mother, who may or may not survive to and through the ages of childbearing.
* A '''stable population''', one that has had constant crude birth and death rates for such a long period of time that the percentage of people in every age class remains constant, or equivalently, the population pyramid has an unchanging structure.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;
* A '''stationary population''', one that is both stable and unchanging in size (the difference between crude birth rate and crude death rate is zero).&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;

A stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size. It can be expanding or shrinking.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;

Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have proportionally more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[life table]], which summarizes mortality separately at each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.

==Basic equation==
Suppose that a country (or other entity) contains ''Population&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' persons at time ''t''.
What is the size of the population at time ''t'' + 1 ?

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Population}_{t+1} = \text{Population}_t + \text{Natural Increase}_t + \text{Net Migration}_t&lt;/math&gt;

Natural increase from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Natural Increase}_t = \text{Births}_t - \text{Deaths}_t&lt;/math&gt;

Net migration from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Net Migration}_t = \text{Immigration}_t - \text{Emigration}_t&lt;/math&gt;

This basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations.  For example, the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change.  When dealing with ethnic groups, however, "net migration" might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification ([[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]).  Individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Estimating Russification of Ethnic Identity Among Non-Russians in the USSR," ''Demography'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Nov., 1983): 461-489.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition, in practice the recording and counting of events (births, deaths, immigration, emigration) and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error. So allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made.

The figure in this section shows the latest (2004) UN projections of world population out to the year 2150 (red = high, orange = medium, green = low). The UN "medium" projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075. Working independently, demographers at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] in Austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |title=Doubling of world population unlikely |first=Wolfgang |last=Lutz |author2=Sanderson, Warren |author3=Scherbov, Sergei |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=803–805 |date=1997-06-19 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |format=PDF |doi=10.1038/42935 |pmid=9194559 |issue=6635 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230409/http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 21st century, the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise.

===Science of population===
Populations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality, and migration.  Fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity (a woman's childbearing potential).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bongaarts]]. The Fertility-Inhibiting Effects of the Intermediate Fertility Variables. Studies in Family Planning, Vol. 13, No. 6/7. (Jun. - Jul., 1982), pp. 179-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality is the study of the causes, consequences, and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population.  Demographers most commonly study mortality using the [[Life Table]], a statistical device that provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/lftbls/lftbls.htm N C H S - Life Tables&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some predefined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent.  Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Rowland ''Demographic Methods and Concepts'' Ch. 11 {{ISBN|0-19-875263-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demography is today widely taught in many universities across the world, attracting students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies. Being at the crossroads of several disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[epidemiology]], [[geography]], [[anthropology]] and [[history]], demography offers tools to approach a large range of population issues by combining a more technical quantitative approach that represents the core of the discipline with many other methods borrowed from social or other sciences. Demographic research is conducted in universities, in research institutes as well as in statistical departments and in several international agencies. Population institutions are part of the [[Cicred]] (International Committee for Coordination of Demographic Research) network while most individual scientists engaged in demographic research are members of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iussp.org International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]&lt;/ref&gt; or a national association such as the [[Population Association of America]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.populationassociation.org Population Association of America]&lt;/ref&gt; or affiliates of the Federation of Canadian Demographers in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canpopsoc.org Canadian Population Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626005822/http://www.canpopsoc.org/ |date=26 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthroposophy}}
'''Eurythmy''' is an expressive [[performing art|movement art]] originated by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in conjunction with [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers|Marie von Sivers]] in the early 20th century. Primarily a performance art, it is also used in [[pedagogy|education]], especially in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]], and&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; as part of [[anthroposophic medicine]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for claimed therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref name=qw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt;

The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''.

==Movement repertoire==
The [[gesture]]s in the eurythmist's movement repertoire relate to the sounds and rhythms of speech, to the tones and rhythms of music and to "soul experiences", such as joy and sorrow. Once these fundamental repertoire elements are learned, they can be composed into free artistic expressions. The eurythmist also cultivates a feeling for the qualities of straight lines and curves, the directions of movement in space (forward, backward, up, down, left, right), contraction and expansion, and color. The element of color is also emphasized both through the costuming, usually given characteristic colors for a piece or part and formed of long, loose fabrics that accentuate the movements rather than the bodily form, and through the lighting, which saturates the space and changes with the moods of the piece.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

Eurythmy's aim is to bring the artists' expressive movement and both the performers' and audience's feeling experience into harmony with a piece's content;&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädogogik'', Böhlau Verlag, {{ISBN|3-412-01898-8}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; eurythmy is thus sometimes called "visible music" or "visible speech", expressions that originate with its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], who described eurythmy as an "art of the soul".

Most eurythmy today is performed to [[European classical music|classical (concert) music]] or texts such as [[poetry]] or stories. Silent pieces are also sometimes performed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

===Eurythmy with music===
When performing eurythmy with music (also called ''tone eurythmy''), the three major elements of music, [[melody]], [[harmony]] and [[rhythm]], are all expressed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;  The melody is primarily conveyed through expressing its rise and fall; the specific [[pitch (music)|pitches]]; and the [[interval (music)|intervallic qualities]] present.  Harmony is expressed through movement between tension and release, as expressions of dissonance and consonance, and between the more inwardly directed minor mood and the outwardly directed major mood.  Rhythm is chiefly conveyed through livelier and more contoured movements for quick notes, slower, dreamier movements for longer notes; in addition, longer tones move into the more passive (listening) back space, quicker tones into the more active front space.

Breaths or pauses are expressed through a larger or smaller movement in space, giving new impulse to what follows.  Beat is conveyed through greater emphasis of downbeats, or those beats upon which stress is normally placed.  Beat is generally treated as a subsidiary element. Eurythmy has only occasionally been done to popular music, in which beat plays a large role.

The timbre of individual instruments is brought into the quality both of the tonal gestures and of the whole movement of the eurythmist.  Usually there will be a different eurythmist or group of eurythmists expressing each instrument, for example in chamber or symphonic music.

A piece's [[choreography]] usually expresses elements such as the major or minor key, the shape of the melody line, the interplay between voices or instruments and the relative dominance of one or another voice or instrument.  Thus, musicians can often follow even the finest details of their part in the movements of the eurythmists on stage.  Particular musical forms (e.g. the [[sonata]]) can have special characteristic choreographic expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurythmy with spoken texts===
Eurythmy is often performed with spoken texts such as poetry, stories or plays. ''Speech eurythmy'' includes such elements as the [[phoneme|sounds of speech]], [[rhythm]]s, poetic [[meter (poetry)|meter]]s, [[grammar]] and mood. In speech eurythmy, all the sounds of language have characteristic gestural qualities: the sound of an 'A' is open due to the position of the articulators during the vowel. A 'k' sounds sharper due to the manner of articulation of the consonant, that it is a plosive. Note that it is the audible sounds themselves, not the letters of the written language, that are expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{npsn|date=April 2014}}[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Steiner on eurythmy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eurythmy was conceived in 1911 when a widow brought her young daughter, Lory Smits, who was interested in movement and dance, to the [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]] [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Due to the recent loss of her father, it was necessary for the girl to find a career. Steiner's advice was sought; he suggested that the girl begin working on a new art of movement. As preparation for this, she began to study human anatomy, to explore the human step,  to contemplate the movement implicit in Greek sculpture and dance, and to find movements that would express spoken sentences using the sounds of speech. Soon a number of other young people became interested in this form of expressive movement.

During these years, Steiner was writing a new drama each year for performance at the [[Anthroposophical Society]]'s summer gatherings; beginning in 1912, he began to incorporate the new art of movement into these dramas. When the Society decided to build an artistic center in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]] (this later became known as the [[Goetheanum]]) a small stage group began work and offered weekly performances of the developing art. [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], Steiner's wife, who was a trained actress and speech artist, was given responsibility for training and directing this ensemble. This first eurythmy ensemble went on tour in 1919, performing across [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Alan Stott, ''Eurythmy: its Birth and Development'', {{ISBN|0-9541048-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner saw eurythmy as a unique expression of the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] impulse:
{{quote|It is the task of Anthroposophy to bring a greater depth, a wider vision and a more living spirit into the other forms of art. But the art of Eurythmy could only grow up out of the soul of Anthroposophy; could only receive its inspiration through a purely Anthroposophical conception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Rudolf Steiner's "Lecture on Eurythmy" August 26, 1923]&lt;/ref&gt;|Rudolf Steiner}}

According to Steiner: ''In eurythmy we present in the form and movement of the human organism a direct external proof of a man's share in the life of the supersensible world. When people do eurythmy they are linked directly with the supersensible world. Whenever art is formed from a truly artistic conviction it bears witness to the connection of the human being with the supersensible world.'' (Dornach, 12 September 1920) &lt;ref&gt;Biesantz/Klingborg, The Goetheanum: Rudolf Steiner's Architectural Impulse (London, 1979), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Steiner gave two intensive workshops on different aspects of eurythmy; transcripts of his talks during these workshops are published as ''Eurythmy as Visible Speech'' and ''Eurythmy as Visible Singing''.

Eurythmy ensembles in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] and at the Goetheanum soon became established parts of the cultural life of Europe. The Goetheanum ensemble was recognized with a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris Expo]] of 1937/8. The Stuttgart training and ensemble, led by [[Else Klink]], had to close in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] period but reopened shortly after the close of [[World War II]]. There are now training centers and artistic ensembles in many countries.&lt;ref name="Stott"/&gt;

===Etymology===
The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''. The term was used by Ancient Greek and Roman architects to refer to the harmonious proportions of a design or building;&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka, ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', Sheen and Ward, NY 1946, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''eurythmy'' was used from the 17th to 19th century to refer not only to harmonious architectural proportions, but also to "rhythmical order or movement" and "a graceful proportion and carriage of the body".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/65086 "Eurhythmy"], Oxford English Dictionary, accessed 1/14/14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurythmy as a performing art==
There are notable eurythmy ensembles in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]]; [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]; [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]; [[London]], [[England]]; [[Järna]], [[Sweden]], and [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] (near [[New York City]]). All of these groups both perform locally and tour internationally. Many smaller performing groups also exist [http://www.eurythmie-info.de/Buehnen.htm (see list)]. High schools that have their own performing ensembles include the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120313232919/http://www.sfwaldorf.org/high-school/arts/eurythmy-troupe San Francisco Waldorf High School ensemble].

==Pedagogical eurythmy==
When the first [[Waldorf School]] was founded in 1919, eurythmy was included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Stockmeyer, ''Rudolf Steiner's Curriculum for Waldorf Schools'', Steiner Schools Fellowship, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly recognized as a successful complement to [[gymnastics]] in the school's movement program and is now taught in most Waldorf schools, as well as in many non-Waldorf pre-school centers, kindergartens and schools. It is taught to all ages from pre-schools through high school and into college. Its purpose is to awaken and strengthen the expressive capacities of children through movement, stimulating the child to bring [[imagination]], [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] and [[concept]]ualization to the point where they can manifest these as "vital, moving forms" in physical space.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; It is also thought to improve balance, coordination, concentration, rhythm, and form an awareness of patterns.

Eurythmy pedagogical exercises begin with the straight line and curve and proceed through successively more complicated geometric figures and choreographed forms, developing a child's coordination and concentration. An extensive set of special exercises has also been developed for pedagogical purposes.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; These include metamorphosing geometric patterns and dynamic movement sequences.

Rods or balls are sometimes used in exercises to develop precision in movement, to expand the experience of space, develop precise balance, and to objectify the movement experience. The rods are usually approximately the length of an arm; the balls are of a size to fit comfortably in one hand. Both are generally made of copper, a material receptive to warmth.

Though there are some independent post-graduate trainings for pedagogical eurythmy, this aspect is frequently included in courses focusing on artistic work.

According to the precepts of anthroposophic medicine, a human has four aspects which need to be treated: spirit, soul, life and matter.&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt; Eurythmy is one of the practices said to act on the "life" aspect, and is claimed to effect an "improvement of health related life functions".&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt; A person receiving eurthymy therapy moves under the guidance of a eurythmy therapist, who will have been trained two years beyond the four-year fundamental course in eurythmy.

A 2008 review in ''BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' said that eurythmy was a "potentially relevant add-on" to a therapeutic program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Büssing A, Ostermann T, Majorek M, Matthiessen PF |title=Eurythmy Therapy in clinical studies: a systematic literature review |journal=BMC Complement Altern Med |volume=8 |issue= |pages=8 |year=2008 |pmid=18377647 |pmc=2322948 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but though the studies reviewed reported improvement in symptoms, limitations in the underlying data and in the review methods means these conclusions "warrant cautious interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |entry=Eurythmy Therapy in clinical studies: a systematic literature review |publisher=[[Centre for Reviews and Dissemination]] |date=7 April 2009 |url=http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/ShowRecord.asp?AccessionNumber=12008103765#.U0Yu14XePN0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

First published in London in 1990, ''Eye'' was founded by [[Rick Poynor]], a prolific writer on graphic design and visual communication. Poynor edited the first twenty-four issues (1990-1997). Max Bruinsma was the second editor, editing issues 25–32 (1997–1999), before its current editor [[John L. Walters]] took over in 1999. Stephen Coates was art director for issues 1-26, Nick Bell was art director from issues 27-57, and Simon Esterson has been art director since issue 58.

Frequent contributors include Phil Baines, [[Steven Heller (graphic design)|Steven Heller]], Steve Hare, Richard Hollis, [[Robin Kinross]], Jan Middendorp, [[J. Abbott Miller]], John O’Reilly, [[Rick Poynor]], [[Alice Twemlow]], [[Kerry William Purcell]], Steve Rigley, Adrian Shaughnessy, David Thompson, Christopher Wilson and many others.

Other contributors have included Nick Bell (creative director from issues 27-57), [[Gavin Bryars]], [[Anne Burdick]], Brendan Dawes, Simon Esterson (art director since issue 58), [[Malcolm Garrett]], Anna Gerber, Jonathan Jones, [[Emily King]], [[Ellen Lupton]], [[Russell Mills (artist)|Russell Mills]], Quentin Newark, Tom Phillips, [[Robin Rimbaud]], [[Stefan Sagmeister]], Sue Steward, [[Erik Spiekermann]], Teal Triggs, [[Val Williams]] and Judith Williamson.

The magazine has had five publishers: Wordsearch, [[Emap]], Quantum Publishing, [[Haymarket Brand Media]] and Eye Magazine Ltd., formed in April 2008 after a [[management buyout]].&lt;ref&gt;Press release from Haymarket, April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''fractal''' is a detailed, recursive, and infinitely self-similar mathematical set whose [[Hausdorff dimension]] strictly exceeds its [[topological dimension]]. Fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature due to their tendency to appear nearly the same at different levels, as is illustrated here in the successively small magnifications of the [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek"/&gt; Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales,&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''expanding symmetry''' or '''unfolding symmetry'''; If this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the [[Menger sponge]],&lt;ref name="Gouyet" /&gt; it is called a [[self-similar]] pattern.

One way that fractals are different from finite [[geometric figures]] is the way in which they [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]]. Doubling the edge lengths of a [[polygon]] multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its [[volume]] scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). However, if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is not necessarily an [[integer]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît B. |title=The fractal geometry of nature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC |year=1983 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This power is called the [[fractal dimension]] of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's [[topological dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos"&gt;{{cite book | last=Mandelbrot | first=Benoît B. | title=Fractals and Chaos| publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | year=2004 |isbn=978-0-387-20158-0 | quote=A fractal set is one for which the fractal (Hausdorff-Besicovitch) dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension | page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mathematical equations, fractals are usually nowhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; An infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line - although it is still [[topological dimension|1-dimensional]] its fractal dimension indicates that it also resembles a surface.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos" /&gt;
[[File:Sierpinski carpet 6.svg|thumb|[[Sierpinski carpet]] (to level 6), a fractal with a [[topological dimension]] of 2 and a [[Hausdorff dimension]] of 1.893]]

The mathematical [[#history|roots]] of fractals have been traced throughout the years as a formal path of published works, starting in the 17th century with notions of [[recursion]], then moving through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment of the concept to the study of [[Continuous function|continuous]] but not [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] functions in the 19th century by the seminal work of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=S. L.|title=Riemann's example of a continuous 'nondifferentiable' function continued|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|date=June 1978|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81–82|doi=10.1007/BF03023065}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on to the coining of the word ''[[wikt:fractal|fractal]]'' in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin ''[[wikt:fractus#Latin|frāctus]]'' meaning "broken" or "fractured", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional [[fractal dimension|dimensions]] to geometric [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical people : profiles and interviews|last1=Albers|first1=Donald J.|last2=Alexanderson|first2=Gerald L.|publisher=AK Peters|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56881-340-0|location=Wellesley, MA|page=214|chapter=Benoît Mandelbrot: In his own words|author2-link=Gerald L. Alexanderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement amongst authorities about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as "beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mandelbrot|first=Benoit|title=24/7 Lecture on Fractals|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7HB5Oze4g#t=70|work=2006 Ig Nobel Awards|publisher=Improbable Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot stated that "A fractal is by definition a set for which the [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension]] strictly exceeds the [[topological dimension]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, B.B.: The Fractal Geometry of Nature. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1982); p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and expanded the definition to: "A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jens Feder|title=Fractals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgvyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4899-2124-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still later, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language: "...to use ''fractal'' without a pedantic definition, to use ''[[fractal dimension]]'' as a generic term applicable to ''all'' the variants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Edgar|title=Measure, Topology, and Fractal Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk2vruTv0_gC&amp;pg=PR7|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-74749-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consensus is that theoretical fractals are infinitely self-similar, [[iteration|iterated]], and detailed mathematical constructs having fractal dimensions, of which many [[List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension|examples]] have been formulated and studied in great depth.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos |last=Briggs |first=John |year= 1992 |publisher= Thames and Hudson |location= London |isbn=978-0-500-27693-8 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals are not limited to geometric patterns, but can also describe processes in time.&lt;ref name="Gouyet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time series" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krapivsky | first1 = P.

== Introduction ==
[[File:Simple Fractals.png|thumb|right| A simple fractal tree created through javascript]]
The word "fractal" often has different connotations for laymen as opposed to mathematicians, where the layman is more likely to be familiar with [[fractal art]] than the mathematical concept. The mathematical concept is difficult to define formally, even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with little mathematical background.

The feature of "self-similarity", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the [[infinite regress]] in parallel mirrors or the [[homunculus]], the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head ...). The difference for fractals is that the pattern reproduced must be detailed.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|166; 18}}&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote" /&gt;

This idea of being detailed relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or [[fractal dimension]] greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric [[shapes]] are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 the length of the original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the Koch snowflake. It is also 1-dimensional for the same [[reason]] as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a fractal dimension greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The fractal curve divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its [[fractal dimension]].

This also leads to understanding a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are "nowhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot be measured in traditional ways.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; To elaborate, in trying to find the length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of [[rectifiable curve|measuring]] with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pickover, the mathematics behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when the mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] pondered [[recursion|recursive]] [[self-similarity]] (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the [[straight line]] was self-similar in this sense).&lt;ref name="Pickover"&gt;{{cite book |page=310 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=fractal+koch+curve+book#v=onepage&amp;q=fractal%20koch%20curve%20book&amp;f=false |first=Clifford A. |last=Pickover

One of the next milestones came in 1904, when [[Helge von Koch]], extending ideas of Poincaré and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the [[Koch snowflake]].&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when [[Wacław Sierpiński]] constructed his famous [[Sierpinski triangle|triangle]] then, one year later, his [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]]. By 1918, two French mathematicians, [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Gaston Julia]], though working independently, arrived essentially simultaneously at results describing what are now seen as fractal behaviour associated with mapping [[complex numbers]] and iterative functions and leading to further ideas about [[strange attractors|attractors and repellors]] (i.e., points that attract or repel other points), which have become very important in the study of fractals.&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Very shortly after that work was submitted, by March 1918, [[Felix Hausdorff]] expanded the definition of "dimension", significantly for the evolution of the definition of fractals, to allow for sets to have noninteger dimensions.&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], who, in his 1938 paper ''Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole'' described a new fractal curve, the [[Lévy C curve]].&lt;ref group="notes" name="levy note" /&gt;

Different researchers have postulated that without the aid of modern computer graphics, early investigators were limited to what they could depict in manual drawings, so lacked the means to visualize the beauty and appreciate some of the implications of many of the patterns they had discovered (the Julia set, for instance, could only be visualized through a few iterations as very simple drawings).&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gordon

== Characteristics ==
One often cited description that Mandelbrot published to describe geometric fractals is "a rough or fragmented [[Shape|geometric shape]] that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole";&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt; this is generally helpful but limited. Authors disagree on the exact definition of ''fractal'', but most usually elaborate on the basic ideas of self-similarity and an unusual relationship with the space a fractal is embedded in.&lt;ref name="Gouyet"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gouyet | first=Jean-François | title=Physics and fractal structures | publisher=Masson Springer | location=Paris/New York | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-387-94153-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Falconer | first=Kenneth | title=Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2003 | pages=xxv | isbn= 978-0-470-84862-3 | nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Edgar | first=Gerald | title=Measure, topology, and fractal geometry | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-387-74748-4 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One point agreed on is that fractal patterns are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s, but whereas these numbers quantify [[complexity]] (i.e., changing detail with changing scale), they neither uniquely describe nor specify details of how to construct particular fractal patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karperien |first=Audrey |title=Defining microglial morphology: Form, Function, and Fractal Dimension |publisher=Charles Sturt University |year= 2004 |doi=10.13140/2.1.2815.9048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 when Mandelbrot coined the word "fractal", he did so to denote an object whose [[Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension]] is greater than its [[Lebesgue covering dimension|topological dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote" /&gt; It has been noted that this dimensional requirement is not met by fractal [[space-filling curve]]s such as the [[Hilbert curve]].&lt;ref group=notes name="space filling note" /&gt;

According to Falconer, rather than being strictly defined, fractals should, in addition to being nowhere differentiable and able to have a [[fractal dimension]], be generally characterized by a [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] of the following features;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;

* Self-similarity, which may be manifested as:
:* Exact self-similarity: identical at all scales; e.g. [[#koch|Koch snowflake]]
:* Quasi self-similarity: approximates the same pattern at different scales; may contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms; e.g., the [[Mandelbrot set]]'s satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies.
:* Statistical self-similarity: repeats a pattern [[stochastic]]ally so numerical or statistical measures are preserved across scales; e.g., [[#random|randomly generated fractals]]; the well-known example of the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]], for which one would not expect to find a segment scaled and repeated as neatly as the repeated unit that defines, for example, the Koch snowflake&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;
:* Qualitative self-similarity: as in a time series&lt;ref name="time series"&gt;{{cite book | last=Peters | first=Edgar | title=Chaos and order in the capital markets : a new view of cycles, prices, and market volatility | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-471-13938-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Multifractal]] scaling: characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule
* Fine or detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. A consequence of this structure is fractals may have [[emergent properties]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=John |last1=Spencer |first2=Michael S. C. |last2=Thomas |first3=James L. |last3=McClelland |title=Toward a unified theory of development : connectionism and dynamic systems theory re-considered |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford/New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-530059-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (related to the next criterion in this list).
* Irregularity locally and globally that is not easily described in traditional [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean geometric]] language. For images of fractal patterns, this has been expressed by phrases such as "smoothly piling up surfaces" and "swirls upon swirls".&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos" /&gt;
* Simple and "perhaps [[recursion|recursive]]" definitions ''see [[#algorithms|Common techniques for generating fractals]]''

As a group, these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain cases, such as those that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features. A straight line, for instance, is self-similar but not fractal because it lacks detail, is easily described in Euclidean language, has the same [[Hausdorff dimension]] as [[topological dimension]], and is fully defined without a need for recursion.&lt;ref name ="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;

== Simulated fractals ==
[[File:Apophysis-100303-104.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[fractal flame]]]]
Fractal patterns have been modeled extensively, albeit within a range of scales rather than infinitely, owing to the practical limits of physical time and space. Models may simulate theoretical fractals or [[#fractals in nature|natural phenomena with fractal features]]. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for [[fractal analysis]]. Some specific applications of fractals to technology are listed [[#fractals in technology|elsewhere]]. Images and other outputs of modelling are normally referred to as being "fractals" even if they do not have strictly fractal characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal image that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display [[Artifact (error)|artifacts]] which are not characteristics of true fractals.

Modeled fractals may be sounds,&lt;ref name="music" /&gt; digital images, electrochemical patterns, [[circadian rhythm]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Fathallah-Shaykh | first1=Hassan M. | title=Fractal Dimension of the Drosophila Circadian Clock | doi=10.1142/S0218348X11005476 | journal=Fractals | volume=19 | issue=4 | pages=423–430 | year=2011 | pmid= | pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

Similarly, random fractals have been used to describe/create many highly irregular real-world objects. A limitation of modeling fractals is that resemblance of a fractal model to a natural phenomenon does not prove that the phenomenon being modeled is formed by a process similar to the modeling algorithms.

[[Decalcomania]], a technique used by artists such as [[Max Ernst]], can produce fractal-like patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Frame, Michael; and Mandelbrot, Benoît B.; [http://classes.yale.edu/Fractals/Panorama/ ''A Panorama of Fractals and Their Uses'']&lt;/ref&gt; It involves pressing paint between two surfaces and pulling them apart.

Cyberneticist [[Ron Eglash]] has suggested that fractal geometry and mathematics are prevalent in [[African art]], games, [[divination]], trade, and architecture. Circular houses appear in circles of circles, rectangular houses in rectangles of rectangles, and so on. Such scaling patterns can also be found in African textiles, sculpture, and even cornrow hairstyles.&lt;ref name="African art"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/eglash.dir/afractal/afractal.htm |first=Ron |last=Eglash |title=African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design |location=New Brunswick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1999 |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Bryn; [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/02/23/MN36684.DTL ''Sophisticated Mathematics Behind African Village Designs Fractal patterns use repetition on large, small scale''], San Francisco Chronicle, Wednesday, February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hokky Situngkir]] also suggested the similar properties in Indonesian traditional art, [[batik]], and [[ornament (art)|ornaments]] found in traditional houses.&lt;ref&gt;Situngkir, Hokky; Dahlan, Rolan (2009).

In a 1996 interview with [[Michael Silverblatt]], [[David Foster Wallace]] admitted that the structure of the first draft of ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' he gave to his editor Michael Pietsch was inspired by fractals, specifically the [[Sierpinski triangle]] (a.k.a. Sierpinski gasket), but that the edited novel is "more like a lopsided Sierpinsky Gasket".&lt;ref name="novel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw/bw960411david_foster_wallace |first=David Foster |last=Wallace |title=Bookworm on KCRW |publisher=Kcrw.com |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a circle boundary is drawn around the two-dimensional view of a fractal, the fractal will never cross the boundary, this is due to the scaling of each successive iteration of the fractal being smaller. When fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the fractal increases, while the area will never exceed a certain value. A fractal in three-dimensional space is similar, however, a difference between fractals in two dimensions and three dimensions, is that a three dimensional fractal will increase in surface area, but never exceed a certain volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fractal.org/Bewustzijns-Besturings-Model/Fractals-Useful-Beauty.htm|title=Introduction to Fractal Geometry|website=www.fractal.org|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be utilized to maximize the efficiency of [[ion propulsion]], when choosing electron emitter construction and material. If done correctly, the efficiency of the emission process can be maximized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs21grc.html|title=NASA – Ion Propulsion|last=DeFelice|first=David|date=August 18, 2015|work=NASA|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fractography''' is the study of the fracture surfaces of materials. Fractographic methods are routinely used to determine the cause of failure in engineering structures, especially in product failure and the practice of [[forensic engineering]] or [[failure analysis]]. In [[material science]] research, fractography is used to develop and evaluate theoretical models of crack growth behavior.

One of the aims of fractographic examination is to determine the cause of failure by studying the characteristics of a fractured surface.  Different types of crack growth (e.g. [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[stress corrosion cracking]], [[hydrogen embrittlement]]) produce characteristic features on the surface, which can be used to help identify the failure mode. The overall pattern of cracking can be more important than a single crack, however, especially in the case of brittle materials like [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]]es.

==Methods==
[[Image:Crankshaft fatigue.jpg|thumbnail|right|Crankshaft fatigue fracture]]
An important aim of fractography is to establish and examine the origin of cracking, as examination at the origin may reveal the cause of crack initiation.  Initial fractographic examination is commonly carried out on a macro scale utilising low power [[optical microscopy]] and oblique lighting techniques to identify the extent of cracking, possible modes and likely origins. Optical microscopy or [[macrophotography]] are often enough to pinpoint the nature of the failure and the causes of crack initiation and growth if the loading pattern is known. 

Common features that may cause crack initiation are [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]]s, [[Cavitation|void]]s or empty holes in the material, [[contamination]], and [[stress concentration]]s.  "Hachures", are the lines on fracture surfaces which show crack direction. The broken crankshaft shown at right failed from a surface defect near the bulb at lower centre, the single brittle crack growing up into the bulk material by small steps, a problem known as [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]].  The crankshaft also shows hachures which point back to the origin of the fracture. Some modes of crack growth can leave characteristic marks on the surface that identify the mode of crack growth and origin on a macro scale e.g. beachmarks or [[:wikt:striation|striation]]s on fatigue cracks. The areas of the product can also be very revealing, especially if there are traces of sub-critical cracks, or cracks which have not grown to completion. They can indicate that the material was faulty when loaded, or alternatively, that the sample was overloaded at the time of failure.
[[Image:Fractured breast implant.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fractured breast implant catheter in SEM]]
A [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]] is formed where brittle cracks meet, as shown on the picture of a failed catheter (Cp). The cusp was formed by brittle failure of the [[catheter]] on a [[breast implant]] in [[silicone rubber]]. The origin of the cracks is at the shoulder at the left-hand side. Identifying such features will allow a fracture surface map to be made of the surface being studied. The implant failed because of overload, all the imposed loads being concentrated at the connection between the catheter and the bag holding salt solution. As a result, the patient reported loss of fluid from the implant, and it was extracted surgically and replaced.
===USB Microscopy===
[[USB microscope]]s are especially useful for examining fracture surface features since they are small enough to be hand-held. A variety of camera sizes and resolution are available commercially at low cost. The camera cable plugs into the computer via a [[USB]] plug and most such devices come with illumination at the camera supplied by [[LED light]]s.
==Fracture surface map==
[[Image:Fract map1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fracture map of failed breast implant]]
A schematic fracture surface map is a valuable result of visual or microscopic examination. It seeks to isolate and identify the features on the surface which show how the product failed. Such a map can be a valuable way of presenting information which shows clearly how a crack was initiated which grew with time. In the case of the failed breast implant catheter, the crack path was very simple, but the cause more subtle. Further [[scanning electron microscopy]] showed numerous microcracks between the bag and the catheter, indicating that the adhesive bond between the two components had failed prematurely, perhaps through faulty manufacture. The material of construction of both bag and catheter, silicone rubber is a physically weak elastomer, and product design must allow for the low tear or [[shear strength]] of the material.

==Scanning electron microscopy==
{{Main|Scanning Electron Microscopy}}
In many cases, fractography requires examination at a finer scale, which is usually carried out in a scanning electron microscope or SEM. The resolution is much higher than the optical microscope, although samples are examined in a partial vacuum and colour is absent. Improved SEM's now allow examination at near atmospheric pressures, so allowing examination of sensitive materials such as  those of biological origin. 
The SEM is especially useful when combined with [[Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or EDX, which can be performed in the microscope, so very small areas of the sample can be analysed for their elemental composition.

==Applications==

Fractography is a widely used technique in [[forensic engineering]], [[forensic materials engineering]] and [[fracture mechanics]] to understand the causes of failures and also to verify theoretical failure predictions with real life failures. It is of use in [[forensic science]] for analysing broken products which have been used as weapons, such as broken bottles for example. Thus a defendant might claim that a bottle was faulty and broke accidentally when it impacted a victim of an assault. Fractography could show the allegation to be false, and that considerable force was needed to smash the bottle before using the broken end as a weapon to deliberately attack the victim. [[Bullet]] holes in glass [[windscreen]]s or windows can also indicate the direction of impact and the energy of the projectile. In these cases, the overall pattern of cracking is vital to reconstructing the sequence of events, rather than the specific characteristics of a single crack. Fractography can determine whether a cause of train derailment was a faulty rail, or if a wing of a plane had fatigue cracks before a crash.

Fractography is used also in materials research, since fracture properties can correlate with other properties and with structure of materials.

'''Healthism''', sometimes called '''public-healthism''', is a [[neologism]] to describe a variety of [[ideology|ideological]] constructs concerning health and medicine. The term "healthism" was most likely first used by the political economist [[Robert Crawford (political economist)|Robert Crawford]], whose article "Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Robert Crawford, ''Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life''. (Health:, Vol. 10, No. 4, 401-420 (2006))&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1980. In this article Crawford describes how the new political ideology, which emerged in the US during the 1970s, "[situated] the problem of health and disease at the level of the individual." The term is also known for its use in the 1994 book ''The Death of Humane Medicine and the Rise of Coercive Healthism'' by [[Petr Skrabanek]]. Skrabanek's use of "healthism", and most subsequent uses, are [[pejorative]] in intent. However, there is also a growing movement in the 21st century which see healthism as a positive empowering phenomenon which is not inherently coercive. This is exemplified through its popular uptake in the form of preventive medicine, yoga, meditation, fitness regimes, diets and the emphasis on lifestyle changes in Western society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{About|the sketch revue |the book|Settling Accounts: In at the Death}}

'''''In At The Death''''' was a sketch revue performed at The Bush Theatre, London in 1978, most notable for being the first time that future colleagues [[Victoria Wood]] and [[Julie Walters]] would work together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The show is described in Neil Brandwood's biography of Wood as an "alternative theatre company's sketch show about mortality."

After being impressed by Wood's songwriting skills, director Dusty Hughes invited her to be part of a six strong writing team. The topicality of the review was also deemed suitable for her, as she'd just finished writing weekly topical songs on the [[BBC1]] consumer show ''[[That's Life!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers included were [[Ken Campbell]], [[Snoo Wilson]], Ken Hutchinson and Nigel Baldwin. They were asked to write short items based on the weeks newspapers around the theme of death. Campbell took stories from the ''Malaysian New Strait Times'', Baldwin the ''Holyhead and Anglesey Chronicle'', but to be more accessible, Wood drew her inspiration strictly from the tabloids.

Wood wrote six items in the first half of the show, including a requiem for [[Guy the Gorilla]], a song about 'battered wives' (inspired by an article in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' about domestic violence). A song called 'Road Blocks' about a motorcycle accident, and a melancholy number titled '[http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/LoveSong.htm Love Song]'. The second half featured a sketch by Wood called 'Dear Mum', about a middle classed woman who refuses to visit her mother in hospital, and also a harrowing song titled 'Abortion.'&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cast was Julie Walters. Having only met Wood briefly eight years before, the two hit it off immediately. Wood also performed in the show, but said later "There was a sketch set in Belfast and I couldn’t do the accent, so they made me a deaf mute." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/LoveSong.htm Love Song/Victoria_Wood.asp|title=Love Song introduction by Victoria Wood|publisher=Robert England|date=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood received much critical acclaim for her work on the show though. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said her songs "successfully blend a gallows humour with an unexpected touch of humanity", and [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] wrote "Victoria Wood's musical epigrams brilliantly embroider the action".

The revue was initially too short, and making up the shortfall, Wood discovered a new talent, writing comedy sketches. The sketch 'Sex' was set in a [[Manchester]] library and starred Walters as a teenage girl who thinks she's pregnant asking Alison Fiske (as the librarian) advice. As almost the only comedy in the show, it came as a welcome relief to the audience and went down extremely well. During the writing process, Wood said she discovered her true voice. "It was the first thing I'd written with proper jokes and I thought "aha!" I'd suddenly found something I could do. It was a blinding flash, like learning a new language." ''[[The Times]]'' said of the sketch that she was a "great discovery" who "got more poetry out of Manchester speech than I had heard for years".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast also included Godfrey Jackman, [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] and [[Clive Merrison]]. The production ran from 13 July to 6 August 1978.

Due to Wood's acclaim, then theatre director [[David Leland]] commissioned her first play ''[[Talent (1978 play)|Talent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7329">The '''International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science''' is an international scientific [[learned society]] covering all applications of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] to [[chemistry]] and [[chemical physics]]. It was created in [[Menton]] in 1967. The founding members were [[Raymond Daudel]], [[Per-Olov Löwdin]], [[Robert G. Parr]], [[John Pople]] and [[Bernard Pullman]]. Its foundation was supported by [[Louis de Broglie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Advances in the Theory of Atomic and Molecular Systems: Conceptual and Computational Advances in Quantum Chemistry |edition=illustrated |first1=Piotr |last1=Piecuch |first2=Jean |last2=Maruani |first3=Gerardo |last3=Delgado-Barrio, |first4=Stephen |last4=Wilson |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2009 |isbn=978-90-481-2596-8 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qbgc17K1dAC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1qbgc17K1dAC&amp;pg=PA4 Extract of page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the Academy had 25 regular members under 65 years of age. This was later raised to 30, and  then to 35. There is no limit on the number of members over 65 years of age. The  members are "chosen among the scientists of all countries who have distinguished themselves by the value of their scientific work, their role of pioneer or leader of a school in the broad field of [[quantum chemistry]], i.e. the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to the study of [[molecule]]s and [[macromolecule]]s".&lt;ref name=IQAMS/&gt; The Academy presently consists of 90 members (as of 2006). The Academy organizes the [[International Congress of Quantum Chemistry]] every three years.

The academy awards a medal to a young member of the scientific community who has distinguished himself or herself by a pioneering and important contribution. The award has been made every year since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaqms.org/awards.php IAQMS awards] Assessed March 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic scriptures==

In Islamic literature, blasphemy is of many types, and there are many different words for it: ''sabb'' (insult) and ''shatm'' (abuse, vilification), ''takdhib'' or ''tajdif'' (denial), ''iftira'' (concoction), ''la`n'' or ''la'ana'' (curse) and ''ta`n'' (accuse, defame).&lt;ref&gt;See:

*Stanfield-Johnson, R. (2004). "The tabarra'iyan and the early Safavids". ''Iranian Studies'' '''37'''(1). pp. 47–71.&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic literature, the term "blasphemy" sometimes also overlaps with ''[[Kafir|kufr]]'' ("unbelief"), ''fisq'' (depravity), ''isa'ah'' (insult), and ''ridda'' (apostasy).&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, in Hent de Vries (ed.). ''Religion: Beyond a Concept''. Fordham University Press (2008). {{ISBN|978-0823227242}}. pp. 589–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lw/&gt;

===Quran===
Not only does the Quran not prescribe any earthly punishment for blasphemy, it actually advocates a non-violent response.&lt;ref&gt;Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty, Mustafa Akyol, 2013 p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, 2004 pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; The commanded response is only to "not sit with" those who mock the religion. For example:

{{quote|When you hear God’s revelations disbelieved in and mocked at, do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse; surely then you would be like them.|[[Qur'an]]|{{quran-usc|4|140}}||}} 

But a variety of punishments, including death, have been instituted in Islamic Jurisprudence, that draw their sources from hadith literature &lt;ref&gt;Siraj Khan. Blasphemy against the Prophet, in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture (editors: Coeli Fitzpatrick and Adam Hani Walker). {{ISBN|978-1610691772}}, pp. 59–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, 2004 pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadiths===
Sources in hadith literature allege that [[Muhammad]] ordered the execution of [[Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Uri. ''The Assassination of Kaʿb b. al-Ashraf.'' Oriens, Vol. 32. (1990), pp. 65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Badr]], Ka'b had incited the Quraysh against Muhammad, and also urged them to seek vengeance against Muslims. Another person executed was Abu Rafi', who had actively propagandized against Muslims immediately before the [[Battle of Ahzab]]. Both of these men were guilty of insulting Muhammad, and both were guilty of inciting violence. While some{{Who?|date=April 2017}} have explained that these two men were executed for blaspheming against Muhammad, an alternative explanation{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} is that they were executed for treason and causing disorder (''[[fasad]]'') in society.&lt;ref&gt;Siraj Khan (2014), "Blasphemy against the Prophet," ''Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God'', (vol. 1 pp. 62). [[ABC-CLIO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One hadith{{Which?|date=April 2017}} tells of a man who killed his slave because she persisted in insulting Muhammad. Upon hearing this, Muhammad is reported to have exclaimed: "Do you not bear witness that her blood is futile!" (''anna damah hadarun'')&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|38|4348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; This expression can be read as meaning that the killing was unnecessary, implying that Muhammad condemned it.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; However, most hadith specialists interpreted it as voiding the obligation of paying the blood money which would normally be due to the woman's next of kin.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; Another hadith reports Muhammad using an expression which clearly indicates the latter meaning: &lt;ref name=khan/&gt;

{{quotation|Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib: A Jewess used to abuse the Prophet and disparage him. A man strangled her till she died. The Apostle of Allah declared that no recompense was payable for her blood.|{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|38|4349}}  }}

==Punishment==

===Traditional jurisprudence===
{{Fiqh |criminal}}
The [[Quran]] does not explicitly mention any worldly punishment for blasphemy (''sabb allah'' or ''sabb al-rasul''). Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) of Sunni and Shia [[madhab]]s have declared different punishments for the religious crime of blasphemy, and they vary between schools. These are as follows:&lt;ref name = "Saeed"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Saeed  | first = Abdullah  |author2=Hassan Saeed  | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam  | publisher = Ashgate Publishing Company  | year = 2004  | location = Burlington VT  | pages = 37–39  | isbn = 978-0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhold, Lutz.

:[[Hanafi]] – views blasphemy as synonymous with apostasy, and therefore, accepts the repentance of apostates.

He must repent, or else is killed. And this is the same for the woman, except Abu Hanifa said: Do not kill the woman, but coerce her back to Islam.”&lt;/ref&gt; If a non-Muslim commits blasphemy, his punishment must be a [[tazir]] (discretionary, can be death, arrest, caning, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi (933), Mukhtasar Ikhtilaf al-Ulama, vol. 3, p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

The Islamic law considers blasphemy against Muhammad a more severe offense than blasphemy against God. Repentance can lead to forgiveness by God when God is blasphemed, however since Muhammad is no longer alive, forgiveness is not possible when Muhammad is blasphemed, and the Muslim community must punish his blasphemy by avenging blasphemer's death.&lt;ref name = "Saeed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David A.

A convicted blasphemer may, among other penalties, lose all legal rights. The loss of rights may cause a blasphemer's marriage to be dissolved, religious acts to be rendered worthless, and claims to property—including any inheritance—to be rendered void. Repentance, in some Fiqhs, may restore lost rights except for marital rights; lost marital rights are regained only by remarriage. Women have blasphemed and repented to end a marriage. Muslim women may be permitted to repent, and may receive a lesser punishment than would befall a Muslim man who committed the same offense.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion"/&gt; Most Muslim-majority countries have some form of blasphemy law and some of them have been compared to blasphemy laws in European countries (Britain, Germany, Finland etc.).&lt;ref name="Böwering"/&gt; However, in five countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, blasphemy is punishable by execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OcriBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83 |page= 83 |title= Political Secularism, Religion, and the State: A Time Series Analysis of Worldwide Data |author= Jonathan Fox |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, more than a thousand people have been convicted of blasphemy since the 1980s; though none have been executed.&lt;ref name="Böwering"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q1I0pcrFFSUC&amp;pg=PA72 |page=72 |title= The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought |editors= Gerhard Böwering, Patricia Crone, Mahan Mirza |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blasphemy as apostasy==
{{Main|Apostasy in Islam}}
Blasphemy has historically been seen as an evidence of rejection of Islam, that is, the religious crime of [[apostasy]]. Some jurists believe that blasphemy automatically implies a Muslim has left the fold of Islam.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p. 38–39}} A Muslim may find himself accused of being a blasphemer, and thus an apostate on the basis of one action or utterance.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p.48}}&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Blasphemy: Islamic Concept |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion |volume = 2 |pages = 974–76 |publisher = Thomson Gale |location = Farmington Hills, MI |year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain hadiths, after Mecca's fall [[Muhammad]] ordered a number of enemies executed. Based on this early jurists postulated that ''sabb al-Nabi'' (abuse of the Prophet) was a crime "so heinous that repentance was disallowed and summary execution was required".&lt;ref name=kadri-252&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sadakat Kadri]] writes that the actual prosecutions for blasphemy in the Muslim historical record "are vanishingly infrequent". One of the "few known cases" was that of a Christian accused of insulting the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. It ended in an acquittal in 1293, though it was followed by a protest against a decision led by the famed and strict jurist [[Ibn Taymiyya]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel, ''Muslim Theologian's Response'', pp. 69–71)&lt;/ref&gt;

New York: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, several Islamic nations have argued in the United Nations that blasphemy against Muhammad is unacceptable, and that laws should be passed worldwide to proscribe it. In September 2012, the [[Organisation of Islamic Conference]] (OIC), who has sought for a universal blasphemy law over a decade, revived these attempts. Separately, the Human Rights Commission of the OIC called for "an international code of conduct for media and social media to disallow the dissemination of incitement material". Non-Muslim nations that do not have blasphemy laws, have pointed to abuses of blasphemy laws in Islamic nations, and have disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/radical-islam’s-global-reaction-push-blasphemy-laws Michael Totten, Radical Islam's global reaction: the push for blasphemy laws (January/February 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/19/us-protests-religions-blasphemy-idUSBRE88I1EG20120919|title=Islamic states to reopen quest for global blasphemy law|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/Blasphemy_Cases.pdf|format=PDF|title=Blasphemy Laws Exposed – The Consequences of Criminalizing Defamation of Religions |year=2012|website=humanrightsfirst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding, controversies raised in the non-Muslim world, especially over depictions of [[Muhammad]], questionning issues relating to the [[religious offense]] to minorities in secular countries. A key case was the 1989 fatwa against English author [[Salman Rushdie]] for his 1988 book entitled ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', the title of which refers to an account that Muhammad, in the course of revealing the Quran, [[Satanic Verses|received a revelation from Satan and incorporated it therein]] until made by Allah to retract it.

As a response, [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] wrote ''[[A Brief History of Blasphemy]]'' in which he discussed freedom to publish books that may cause distress to minorities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In September 2007, Bangladeshi cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] depicted in the daily ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man. The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name. He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". Bangladesh does not have a blasphemy law but groups said the cartoon ridiculed Muhammad, torched copies of the paper and demanded that Rahman be executed for blasphemy. As a result, Bangladeshi police detained Rahman and confiscated copies of ''Prothom Alo'' in which the cartoon appeared.

In June 2009, Noreen was involved in an argument with a group of Muslim women with whom she had been harvesting berries after the other women grew angry with her for drinking the same water as them. She was subsequently accused of insulting the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a charge she denies, and was arrested and imprisoned. In November 2010, a [[Sheikhupura]] judge sentenced her to death.

The verdict, which was reached in a district court and would need to be upheld by a superior court, has received worldwide attention. Various petitions, including one that received 400,000 signatures, were organized to protest Noreen's imprisonment, and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] publicly called for the charges against her to be dismissed. She received less sympathy from her neighbors and Islamic religious leaders in the country, some of whom adamantly called for her to be executed.

In January 2011, talking about the Asia Bibi blasphemy case, Pakistani politician Salmaan Taseer expressed views opposing the country's blasphemy law and supporting Asia Bibi.

====Protests against depicting Muhammad====
[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|260px|A 17th century copy of a 14th-century Persian manuscript image of [[Muhammad]] prohibiting [[Nasi']], one of the [[depictions of Muhammad]] which raised objections]]

In December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Few weeks later, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing [[depictions of Muhammad]]. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A picture of Muhammad had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, without evoking similar protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiegel Special'' 1, 1998, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, several Muslims protested against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in the [[English Wikipedia]]'s ''Muhammad'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328966,00.html |title=Muslims Protest Wikipedia Images of Muhammad |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/books/05wiki.html |title=Wikipedia Islam Entry Is Criticized |author=Noam Cohen |publisher=New York Times |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition opposed a reproduction of a 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century [[Ilkhanate]] manuscript image depicting Muhammad as he prohibited [[Nasīʾ]].&lt;ref&gt;MS Arabe 1489.

====The Muhammad cartoons crisis====

In September 2005, in the tense aftermath of the assassination of Dutch film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], killed for his views on Islam, Danish news service [[Ritzau]] published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]] to find an illustrator to work on his children's book ''The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' (Danish:''Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv'').&lt;ref name="hansen&amp;hundevadt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=John|title=Provoen og Profeten: Muhammed Krisen bag kulisserne|year=2006|publisher=Jyllands-Postens Forlag|location=Copenhagen|isbn=87-7692-092-5|first2=Kim |last2=Hundevadt|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bluitgen|first=Kåre|title=Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv|year=2006|publisher=Høst &amp; Søn/Tøkk|isbn=978-87-638-0049-5|page=268|url=http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T|others=Anonymous illustrator|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118123641/http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that three artists declined his proposal, which was interpreted as evidence of self-censorship out of fear of reprisals, which led to much debate in Denmark.&lt;ref name="dybangst"&gt;{{cite news|date=17 September 2005|title=Dyb angst for kritik af islam ("Profound anxiety about criticism of Islam")|newspaper=Politiken|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/|accessdate=19 March 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whyipub"&gt;{{cite news|date=19 February 2006|title=Why I Published Those Cartoons |newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html|first=Flemming|last=Rose|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the experiment, Danish scholar [[Peter Hervik]] wrote that it disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark, because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons.&lt;ref name=IMER&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hervik|first=Peter|title=The Danish Muhammad Cartoon Conflict|journal=Current Themes in IMER Research|year=2012|volume=13|url=http://www.mah.se/upload/Forskningscentrum/MIM/CT/CT%2013.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=Malmö Institute for Studies of Migration, Diversity and Welfare (MIM)|issn=1652-4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Danish newspaper ''Politiken'' stated that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists who reportedly declined his proposal, so his claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved, but that Bluitgen refused, making his initial claim impossible to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;Politiken 12. Februar 2006 "''Muhammedsag: Ikke ligefrem en genistreg''"&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Flemming Rose]], an editor at the [[List of newspapers in Denmark|Danish newspaper]] ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', invited professional illustrators to depict Muhammad as an experiment to see how much they felt threatened. The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about [[criticism of Islam]] and self-censorship. On 30 September 2005, the ''Jyllands-Posten'' published 12 editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the prophet Muhammad. One cartoon by [[Kurt Westergaard]] depicted Muhammad with a bomb in his turban, which resulted in the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] (or Muhammad cartoons crisis) ([[Denmark|Danish]]: ''Muhammedkrisen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henkel|first=Heiko|title=Fundamentally Danish?

"Those who have won are dictatorships in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, where they cut criminals' hands and give women no rights," Juste told The Associated Press. "The dark dictatorships have won."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cartoon-inflames-muslim-world/|title=Cartoon Inflames Muslim World|author=LLOYD VRIES|date=2 Feb 2006|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting the cartoon that initiated the diplomatic crisis, American scholar [[John E.

In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but foreign minister [[Laila Freivalds]] pressured the provider to shut the page down (in 2006, her involvement was revealed to the public and she had to resign).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm |title=Swedish foreign minister resigns over cartoons |work=Reuters AlertNet |accessdate=2006-03-21 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060322184626/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' republished the ''Jyllands-Posten'' cartoons of Muhammad.

In July 2007, art galleries in Sweden declined to show drawings of artist [[Lars Vilks]] depicting Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. While Swedish newspapers had published them already, the drawings gained international attention after the newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of them on August 18 to illustrate an editorial on the "right to ridicule a religion".&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular publication led to official condemnations from Iran,&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan,&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release|title=Pakistan Condemns the Publication of Offensive Sketch in Sweden |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=4 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan,&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the inter-governmental Organisation of the Islamic Conference.&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the American comedy program ''[[South Park]]'', which had previously depicted Muhammad as a superhero ("[[Super Best Friends]])"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Super Best Friends | episodelink = Super Best Friends | series = South Park | serieslink = South Park | airdate = 2001-07-04 | season = 5 | number = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since then,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season/ |title=Ryan j Budke.

They intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to ''[[Family Guy]]'' character [[Peter Griffin]] ("[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"). However, [[Comedy Central]] who airs the series rejected the scene and its creators reacted by satirizing [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability. In April 2010, animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] planned to make episodes satirizing controversies over previous episodes, including Comedy Central's refusal to show images of Muhammad following the 2005 Danish controversy. After they faced Internet death threats, Comedy Central modified their version of the episode, obscuring all images and bleeping all references to Muhammad. In reaction, cartoonist Molly Norris created the [[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day]], claiming that if many people draw pictures of Muhammad, threats to murder them all would become unrealistic. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Examples of blasphemy==
[[File:Salman-Rushdie-1.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Salman Rushdie]] was accused of blasphemy and became the subject of a ''[[fatwā]]'' issued by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], in February 1989.]]
A variety of actions, speeches or behavior can constitute blasphemy in Islam. Some examples include insulting or cursing Allah, or Muhammad; mockery or disagreeable behavior towards beliefs and customs common in Islam; criticism of Islam's holy personages. [[Apostasy in Islam|Apostasy]], that is, the act of abandoning Islam, or finding faults or expressing doubts about Allah (''ta'til'') and Qur'an, rejection of Muhammed or any of his teachings, or leaving the Muslim community to become an atheist is a form of blasphemy. Questioning religious opinions (fatwa) and normative Islamic views can also be construed as blasphemous. Improper dress, drawing offensive cartoons, tearing or burning holy literature of Islam, creating or using music or painting or video or novels to mock or criticize Muhammad are some examples of blasphemous acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicp.ca/islamic-lessons/english/youth/the-islamic-education-series-book-5/chapter-of-belief/lesson-13-the-types-of-blasphemy-and-blasphemers/ Association of Islamic Charitable Projects, ''The Types of Blasphemy'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, D.

Individuals have been accused of blasphemy or of insulting Islam for a variety of actions and words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17816">'''Landscape urbanism''' is a theory of urban planning arguing that the best way to organize cities is through the design of the city's landscape, rather than the design of its buildings. The phrase 'landscape urbanism' first appeared in the mid 1990s. Since this time, the phrase 'landscape urbanism' has taken on many different uses, but is most often cited as a [[postmodernist]] or [[post-postmodernist]] response to the "failings" of [[New Urbanism]] and the shift away from the comprehensive visions, and demands, for [[modern architecture]] and [[urban planning]].

The phrase 'landscape urbanism' first appeared in the work of Peter Connolly, a Masters of Urban Design student from RMIT Melbourne. In 1994, Connolly used the phrase in the title for his Masters of Urban Design proposal at RMIT Melbourne. Here, he suggested that 'a language of "landscape urbanism" barely exists and needs articulating', and that 'existing urbanisms ... are limited in the exploration of the landscape'. He also used the term 'landscape as urbanism' in his 1994 essay, '101 Ideas About Big Parks'.&lt;ref&gt;Kerb: Journal of Landscape Architecture, no 1, Melbourne: RMIT University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Tom Turner wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;The city of the future will be an infinite series of landscapes: psychological and physical, urban and rural, flowing apart and together. They will be mapped and planned for special purposes, with the results recorded in geographical information systems (GIS), which have the power to construct and retrieve innumerable plans, images and other records. [[Christopher Alexander]] was right: a city is not a tree. It is a landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Tom, ''City as landscape'', London E&amp;FN Spon, 1996 p.v&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;From the late 1990s, the phrase 'landscape urbanism' was used by landscape architects in the United States to refer to the re-organisation of declining post-industrial cities, such as Detroit. From the 2000s, it was used in Europe by architects to mean a highly flexible way of integrating large-scale infrastructure, housing and open space. By the late 2000s, the phrase became associated with highly commercialized, multi-phase urban parks, such as [[Olympic Park|Olympic park]] design.

== History ==

The first major event to do with 'landscape urbanism' was the Landscape Urbanism conference sponsored by the Graham Foundation in Chicago in April 1997. Speakers included Charles Waldheim, [[Mohsen Mostafavi]], [[James Corner]] of James Corner/Field Operations, Alex Wall, and Adriaan Geuze of the firm [[West 8]], among others. The formative period of Landscape Urbanism can be traced back to RMIT University and [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the late 1980s, at a time when Peter Connolly, [[Richard Weller]], James Corner, Mohsen Mostafavi, and others were exploring the artificial boundaries of Landscape Architecture, Urban Design and Architecture, searching for better ways to deal with complex urban projects. However, their texts cite and synthesize the ideas of influential modernist methods, programmes and manifestoes that appeared in the early twentieth century. Charles Waldheim, Anu Mathur, Alan Berger, Chris Reed, amongst others, were students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] during this formative period for Landscape Urbanism. After the Chicago conference, European design schools and North American design institutions formed academic programs and began to formalize a field of Landscape Urbanism studies, including the [[University of Toronto]], [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], Oslo School of Architecture [https://web.archive.org/web/20110607080654/http://www.aho.no/en/AHO/Institutes/Urbanism-and-landscape/], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [http://web.mit.edu/landscapeurbanism/], Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium [http://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02Q2AE.htm], the [[University of Illinois]] at Chicago and London's [[Architectural Association]].

The development of an actual operative response to the broad and often vague concepts surrounding landscape urbanism was largely developed at the Architectural Association in London.  Prior to this period of design exploration, landscape urbanism had never been clearly developed as an actual design practice.  Today, much of the design culture that has come to be associated with landscape urbanism was initiated and developed in the AA Landscape Urbanism program during its early formative period and its influence persists in many educational institutions.  A number of practices that have chosen to adopt the design and conceptual approach towards urbanism have also adopted many of these design strategies. 

== Themes ==

James Corner is the author of an essay entitled "Terra Fluxus." He has identified four general ideas that are important for use in Landscape Urbanism. They are as follows:

1 Process over time - Understanding the fluid or changing nature of any environment and the processes that affect change over time. A respect for natural processes (Ecology) - the idea that our lives intertwine with the environment around us, and we should therefore respect this when creating an urban environment.  Landscape Urbanism is concerned with a working surface over time – a type of urbanism that anticipates change, open endedness and negotiation.

2 Horizontality - The use of horizontal alignment in landscaping, rather than relying on vertical structuring.

3 Working Methods /Techniques - Those who practice the idea of landscape urbanism should be able to adapt their techniques to the environment that they are in.

4 The imaginary - That in many ways the failing of twentieth century planning can be attributed to the absolute impoverishment of the imagination to extend new relationships and sets of possibilities
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corner|first1=James|title=Terra Fluxus|journal=Landscape Urbanism Reader|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ten characteristics ==
[[Tom Turner]] summarized the ten characteristics of landscape urbanism in the book ''Landscape design history and theory: landscape architecture and garden design origins''&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscape design history &amp; theory: landscape architecture and garden design origins|last=Turner|first=Tom|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

1-Broad scale context: Landscape urbanism does not belong to a specific scale. It can be considered in small or large-scale projects.

2-Landscape is a context which contains architecture and civil engineering.

3-Landscape is seen as a third machinery arm that makes a connection between its components. [[Mohsen Mostafavi]], the author of ''Landscape Urbanism : A Manual for the Machinic Landscape''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscape Urbanism: A Manual for the Machinic Landscape|last=Mostafavi|first=Mohsen|last2=Najle|publisher=Ciro|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the same phrase.

4-LU projects can provide the opportunity of increasing the social interactions. Also, Emily Talen, one of the writers of ''Landscape Urbanism and its Discontentes''&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents|last=Andres|first=Duany|last2=Talen|first2=Emily|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; talks about social aspects of a LU project ''"by forming three theoretical alliances: one with [[post-structuralism]], one with [[Theoretical ecology|ecology]], and one --peculiarly-- with Marxism."''

5-Function is the most significant concern in LU machine, which gives the appearance of a project less importance.

6-LU discovers the potentials and opportunities in landscapes.

7-The infrastructure are highlighted in LU projects.

8-LU projects will develop the interrelationship between natural and engineered systems.

9-LU will break the boundary between the landscape and the city and will organize them as one.

10-The answer to the projects which are complex or have ecological concentrations, is landscape urbanism

*Also see projects by ''Stoss''/Chris Reed [http://www.stoss.net/]

== Criticism ==
Landscape urbanism has been criticized as an idea that is only loosely defined from a set of flashy projects. These are expensive schemes with a commercial and esthetic purpose that satisfy a local or regional ambition to invest in ecology or sustainability without posing a more globally applicable approach. A true merger of landscape architecture with the field of Urban Ecology lacks. From this criticism Frederick Steiner introduced landscape ecological urbanism as an approach that can include the field of urban ecology and Wybe Kuitert has shown how such integrative planning and management of the city should rely on analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = F. R. | year = 2011 | title = Landscape Ecological Urbanism: Origins and Trajectories, ''Landscape and Urban Planning'' 100: 333-337 and Wybe Kuitert (2013)  Urban landscape systems understood by geo-history map overlay | url = | journal = Journal of Landscape Architecture | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 54–63 | doi = 10.1080/18626033.2013.798929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discerning the potential quality of wild nature in the city is a first step to see how new urban ecology might be developed. Potential vegetation maps for a city are the tool to this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuitert | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = The Nature of Urban Seoul: Potential Vegetation Derived from the Soil Map | url = | journal = International Journal of Urban Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 95–108 | doi = 10.1080/12265934.2013.766505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One opponent to Landscape Urbanism is [[New Urbanism]], led by [[Andres Duany]],&lt;ref name="New Urbanism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bettercities.net/article/street-fight-landscape-urbanism-versus-new-urbanism-14855 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508062902/http://bettercities.net/article/street-fight-landscape-urbanism-versus-new-urbanism-14855 |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which promotes walkable communities and smart growth with its Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Traditional Neighborhood Design (TND). In response to landscape urbanism’s focus on expansive green space in urban development, Duany stated that “density and urbanism are not the same.” Further, “unless there is tremendous density, human beings will not walk.” &lt;ref name="New Urbanism"/&gt; The result is patches of green sprawl that lose connectivity to the greater network.

Emo Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soleri|first=Paolo|title=Lean Linear City|year=2012|publisher=Cosanti Press|isbn=978-1-883340-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another philosophy critical of Landscape Urbanism. The movement contends that Landscape Urbanism views ecology as an aesthetic element of style and not urban ecology. The artificial ecology replaces the entropic state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehighline.org/galleries/images/high-line-1999-2006 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503233057/http://www.thehighline.org/galleries/images/high-line-1999-2006 |archivedate=2013-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to re-create a landscape that fits a particular brand or aesthetic. The loss is a dynamic, adaptive, and certainly essential urban system. Emo urbanism differs by making evolving "nature" a key component of the design process. The realization of this process is called “Urbanature" and "Big Nature." As an evolving urban ecology, [[Charles Morris Anderson]] has described this connection as the “thinness.” It is the simultaneous perception and implicit understanding of the past, present, and future. Emo Urbanist projects include the built work of Charles Anderson at the Olympic Sculpture Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.werk.us/portfolio/olympic-sculpture-park/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asla.org/awards/2007/07winners/267_wmct.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id%3D801 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217034444/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Seattle, WA; The Anchorage Museum Common&lt;ref&gt;http://www.werk.us/portfolio/anchorage-museum/&lt;/ref&gt; in Anchorage, AK; the yet to be constructed Project Phoenix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://project-phoenix.org/ourmission |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517035417/http://project-phoenix.org/ourmission |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Haiti and Hellinikon's Metropolitan Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.werk.us/portfolio/hellinikon-metropolitan-park/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102409/http://www.werk.us/portfolio/hellinikon-metropolitan-park/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Athens, Greece.

Ian Thompson has published a critical review of landscape urbanism in which he identifies its ten tenets and asks six critical questions. His conclusions are: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;... there are ideas with the Landscape Urbanism discourse which have great merit, among which I would include the breaking down of professional distinctions, the integration of ecological thinking, the foregrounding of infrastructure, the interest in the positive use of waste materials and the emphasis upon functionality rather than mere appearance. There is also a quantity of dubious philosophy, unhelpful imagery and obscurantist language that Landscape Urbanism ought to dump. ... Larding the case for Landscape Urbanim with Deleuzian and Derridean references was a mistake, since it was done principally to impress an academic elite, and it has even left large sections of its intended audience bemused'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Thompson (2012) Ten Tenets and Six Questions for Landscape
Urbanism, Landscape Research, 37:1, 7-26,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''ledger line''' or '''leger line''' is used in Western [[musical notation]] to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] above or below the lines and spaces of the regular [[musical staff]]. A line slightly longer than the note head is drawn parallel to the staff, above or below, spaced at the same distance as the lines within the staff. 

The origin of the word is uncertain, but may have been borrowed attributively from the term for a horizontal timber in a [[scaffolding]], lying parallel to the face of the building and supporting the [[putlog]]s. There is no basis to support the often-found claim that the word originates from the French ''léger'', meaning "light" or "slight" {{harv|OED|2005}}. The Oxford online dictionary describes the origin of the "leger" spelling as a "variant of ledger" that first appeared in the 19th century {{harv|Oxford Living Dictionary|n.d.}}.

Although ledger lines are found occasionally in manuscripts of [[plainchant]] and early [[polyphony]], it was only in the early 16th century in keyboard music that their use became at all extensive {{harv|Anon.|2001}}. Even then, printers had an aversion to ledger lines which caused difficulties in setting type, wasting space on the page and causing a messy appearance. Vocal music employed a variety of different clefs to keep the range of the part on the staff as much as possible; in keyboard notation a common way of avoiding ledger lines was the use of [[open score]] on four staves with different [[Clef|clefs]] {{harv|Godwin|1974|loc=16–17}}.

Except for woodwind players, who prefer ledger lines to ''[[Octave#Notation|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;]]'' notation because they associate fingerings with staff positions {{harv|Shatzkin|1993|loc=48}}, notes that use at least four ledger lines make music more difficult to read.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} For easier readability, the composer would usually switch [[clefs]] or use the ''[[octave|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;]]'' notation. Some [[transposing instrument]]s, such as the [[piccolo]], [[double bass]], [[guitar]], and the [[tenor voice]], transpose at the octave to avoid ledger lines.

Notation of [[tuba]], [[trombone]], and [[euphonium]] parts always use ledger lines below the bass staff, and never the ''[[8vb|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; bassa]]'' notation {{harv|Read|1969|loc=354}}.

When music for bass clef instruments, such as the cello or trombone, goes several ledger lines above the bass clef, the [[tenor clef]] is used; if it were to go even higher than practical in tenor clef, the notes may be notated in treble clef, or in the case of trombone, alto clef.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;!--I have never seen a part for tenor trombone scored in alto clef nor heard of such a convention. Typically trombone in the high register stays in tenor clef and while it is very rare, if it is necessary to go higher the treble clef is used. Alto clef wouldn't really do much in this situation seeing as you can only go up another third before you get in trouble again.--&gt;

A ledger line is also used to support a [[half note|half rest]] {{music|halfrest}} or [[whole note|whole rest]] {{music|wholerest}} where there are multiple voices on one staff and such a rest is forced above or below the staff. (The rare [[double whole note|double whole rest]] is suspended between two ledger lines in this situation.)

This is a descriptive '''list of art from the [[Stone Age]]''', the period of [[prehistory]] characterised by the widespread use of [[stone tool]]s. This page contains, by sheer volume of the artwork discovered, a very incomplete list of the works of the painters, sculptors, and other artists who created what we now call prehistoric art. For fuller lists see [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]], [[Art of the Middle Paleolithic]], and [[:Category:Prehistoric art]] and its many sub-categories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">This is a list of organizations and institutions of professional sexologists, sex researchers, and sexual behavior scientists.  These do not include organizations of non-professionals, political advocacy or activist groups (although some organizations may engage in some advocacy as one of their activities), self-help or social groups, groups of enthusiasts for a topic in sexology, or websites unassociated with any actual organization or institution.  These organizations and institutions are recognized by their local governments (such as by incorporation) or are administrative units within a larger organization that is.

'''Logology''' (or '''ludolinguistics''') is the field of '''recreational linguistics''', an activity that encompasses a wide variety of  [[word game]]s and wordplay. The term is analogous to the term "[[recreational mathematics]]".

==Overview==
Some of the topics studied in logology are [[lipogram]]s, [[acrostic]]s, [[palindrome]]s, [[Reduplication|tautonym]]s, [[isogram]]s, [[pangram]]s, [[bigram]]s, trigrams, tetragrams, [[transdeletion pyramid]]s, and [[pangrammatic window]]s.

The term ''logology'' was adopted by [[Dmitri Borgmann]] to refer to recreational linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farrell|first=Jeremiah|title=Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics|url=http://wordways.com/|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maldevelopment''' is the state of an organism or an organisation that did not develop in the "normal" way (used in medicine, e.g. "brain maldevelopment of a fetus"). It was introduced as a human and social development term in [[France]] in the 1990s by [[Samir Amin]] to challenge the concept of "[[underdevelopment]]." The word ''maldéveloppement'' did not exist before then (the medical terms are ''malformation'' or ''développement anormal''), so the word is a [[neologism]] meant to be analogous to the difference between [[undernutrition]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Evolutionary-Change-Toward-a-Systemic-Theory-of-Development-and-Maldevelopment/Katsenelinboigen/p/book/9789056995294|title=Evolutionary Change: Toward a Systemic Theory of Development and Maldevelopment|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maldevelopment is a global concept that includes human and social development. Under the philosophy of [[sustainable development]], economic development is only a "tool" that allows for greater human and social development, not the final goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amerika.org/texts/is-development-good-for-the-third-world-vandana-shiva/|title=Is ‘Development’ Good For The Third World? (Vandana Shiva) «  Amerika|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Under''-development is a quantitative notion, implying that a nation has a lack and must gain something to reach a particular reference state—the state of the nation that judges another nation as underdeveloped.  So this notion also implies a unique development model—the one of the judging nation.

''Mal''-development, or ''ill''-development, is a qualitative notion that expresses a mismatch, a discrepancy between the conditions (economic, political, meteorological, cultural, etc.) and the needs and means of the people.

The '''Master of Architecture''' (M.Arch.) is a [[professional degree]] in [[architecture]], qualifying the graduate to move through the various stages of professional accreditation ([[Intern architect|internship]], exams) that result in receiving a license.

==Overview==
The degree is earned through several possible paths of study, depending on both a particular program's construction, and the candidate's previous academic experience and degrees.  M.Arch. degrees vary in kind, so they are frequently given names such as "M.Arch. I" and "M.Arch. II" to distinguish them.  All M.Arch. degrees are professional degrees in architecture.  There are, however, other master's degrees offered by architecture schools that are not accredited in any way.

Many schools offer several possible tracks of architectural education.  Including study at the bachelor's and master's level, these tracks range up to 7.5 years in duration.

* One possible route is what is commonly referred to as the "4+2" course.  This path entails completing a four-year, accredited, pre-professional bachelor of arts in architecture or a bachelor of science in architecture. This degree is not 3-year, depending on the nature and quality of your undergraduate study performance, and the evaluation of your master's degree program school of your undergraduate study) Master of Architecture program.  This route offers several advantages: your first four years are a bit more loose, allowing the inclusion of some liberal arts study; you can attend two different institutions for your undergraduate and graduate study, which is helpful in that it allows you to have a more varied architectural education, and you can pick the best place for you to complete your thesis (because chances are, you might not pick the program that has the exact focus that you will want when it becomes time for your thesis study); and you will finish the 4+2 course of study with a master's degree that will provide you the career option of teaching architecture at the collegiate level.
* The second route to obtaining an accredited master's degree begins in graduate school, with a 3 or 3.5-year master's degree (commonly called an "M.Arch. I").  The advantage to this route is that the student can study something else he or she is interested in his/her undergraduate study (anything else).  Because students come from different undergraduate backgrounds, the breadth of knowledge and experience in the student body of an M.Arch. I program is often considered an advantage.  One possible disadvantage is that the total time in school is longer (7 or 7.5 years with an undergraduate degree).  Another disadvantage is that the student has a very short time to cover the extremely broad scope of subject areas of which architects are expected to have a working knowledge.  Nevertheless, major schools of architecture including [[MIT]] and [[Harvard]] often offer a 3.5-year program to students already with strong architectural background, fostering a competitive and productive academic environment.
* A third possible route is what schools are calling a "post-professional" master's degree. It is research-based and often a stepping-stone to a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Architecture. Schools include [[Cornell]], [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[MIT]], and [[RISD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=For instance see: Cornell|title=Post-Professional Master of Architecture Program|url=http://aap.cornell.edu/arch/programs/marchpost.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard|title=Programs|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/academic-programs/architecture/march-ii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that there is another route to becoming an architect: the continuous 5-year professional degree program.  In such a program, after five years of study, students are awarded with a professional degree in architecture. Depending on the school and course of study, this could be either a [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) or an M.Arch.  In the U.S., it is typically a 5-year B.Arch.  Either degree qualifies those who complete it to sit for the ARE (the [[Architectural Registration Exam]], the architecture equivalent of the bar exam), which leads to an architect's license in the U.S..  One disadvantage of the B.Arch. degree is that it is rarely considered as sufficient qualification for teaching architecture at the university/college level in the U.S. (though there are many exceptions).  Many architects who wish to teach and have only received a B.Arch. choose to pursue a 3-semester master's degree (not an M.Arch.) to obtain further academic qualification.

Graduate-level architecture programs consist of course work in design, [[building science]], [[structural engineering]], [[architectural history]], theory, professional practice, and elective courses. For those without any prior knowledge of the field, coursework in calculus, physics, computers, statics and strengths of materials, architectural history, studio, and building science is usually required. Some architecture programs allow students to specialize in a specific aspect of architecture, such as architectural technologies or [[digital media]]. A thesis or final project is usually required to graduate.

Important to consider in choosing the school(s) for an architectural education is their overall "focus". Architectural schools usually, by virtue of the history of the school and the interests of the faculty, will approach the instruction of architecture from a technical, historical, or artistic bent—or a combination thereof. This is not something that will be spelled out in the school's literature, but will be more or less apparent in the lists of classes offered and the study areas of the faculty. While it may not seem important at first, in retrospect it will probably be a major factor.

An architectural thesis is the culmination of a student’s research.  Submission of the thesis represents the completion of the final requirement for the degree and may be presented as graphic representations, a written work, or physical forms.  According to ''Architectural Research Methods''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=21Uz_E0HNR4C&amp; Architectural Research Methods]. Linda N. Groat, David Wang. John Wiley and Sons, 2002. {{ISBN|0-471-33365-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Linda N. Groat and David Wang, the scope of the research inquiry must not be too broad or too narrow.  A good topic will clearly and simply identify a body of literature to which the topical question can be referred.  Additionally, a thesis question must have significance to not only the student, but his or her peers, and to the field of architecture.

In the [[United States]], The [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture. Since most state registration boards in the United States require any applicant for licensure to have graduated from a NAAB-accredited program, obtaining such a degree is an essential aspect of preparing for the professional practice of architecture.

Again, first time students matriculating with a 5-year B.Arch. degree can also qualify for registration, without obtaining a master's degree.  Some programs offer a concurrent learning model, allowing students the opportunity to work in the profession while they are earning their degree, so that they can test for licensure immediately upon graduation.

In Canada, Master of Architecture degrees may be accredited by the [[Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), allowing the recipient to qualify for both the ARE and the [[Examination for Architects in Canada]] (ExAC).

As of March 2006, there were eighty-four accredited Master of Architecture programs in the United States, including Puerto Rico. In Canada, there were ten accredited programs.

{{italic title}}
'''''Mathematical Magick''''' (complete title: ''Mathematical Magick, or, The wonders that may by performed by mechanichal geometry: in two books, concerning mechanical powers [and] motions. Being one of the most easie, pleasant, useful (and yet most neglected) part of Mathematicks. Not before treated of in this language''.) is a [[treatise]] by the [[Anglican ministry|English clergyman]], [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], [[polymath]] and author [[John Wilkins]] (1614 – 1672). It was first published in 1648 in London,&lt;ref&gt;''by I.W.M.A., London, printed by M.F. for Sa: Gellibrand at the brasen Serpent in Pauls Church-yard. 1648.'' Quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lc38yWFv3p8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=John+Wilkins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kpw7T46XO8P0sgb1s63dBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Wilkins&amp;f=false Asbach-Schnitker, Brigitte: John Wilkins, Mercury ... Bibliography, 7.3 The Works of John Wilkins, n° 24]&lt;/ref&gt; another edition was printed in 1680&lt;ref&gt;''By J. Wilkins, late Ld BP of Chester. London: Printed for Edw.Gellibrand at the Golden Ball in St. Pauls Church-yard. 1680'', 295 pages. A reproduction of the original in the British Library is made available by [[EEBO]] – Early English Books Online (with limited access); further editions were published in 1691 and 1707. There are reprints titled ''Mathematical Magic Or the Wonders That May Be Performed by Mechanical Geometry (1691)''; Kessinger Publishing, 2003 and 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and further editions were published in 1691 and 1707.

==Abstract==
Wilkins dedicated his work to ''His Highness the Prince Elector Palatine'' ([[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Charles I Louis]]). It is divided into two books, one headed ''Archimedes'', ''because he was the chiefest in discovering of Mechanical powers'', the other was called ''Daedalus'' because he ''was one of the first and most famous amongst the Ancients for his skill in making Automata.''&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins in his foreword&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins sets out and explains the principles of mechanics in the first book and gives an outlook in the second book on future technical developments like flying which he anticipates as certain if only sufficient exercise, research and development would be directed to these topics. The treatise is an example of his general intention to disseminate scientific knowledge and method and of his attempts to persuade his readers to pursue further scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shapiro, Barbara (1969).''John Wilkins 1614–1672'', p.30. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First book ==
In the 20 chapters of the first book, traditional mechanical devices are discussed such as the [[Weighing scale|balance]], the [[lever]], the [[wheel]] or [[pulley]] and the [[block and tackle]], the [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]], and the [[screw (simple machine)|screw]]. The powers acting on them are compared to those acting in the human body. The book deals with the phrase attributed to [[Archimedes]] saying ''that if he did but know where to stand and fasten his instrument, he could move the world'' and shows the effect of a series of gear transmissions one linked to the other. It shows the importance of various speeds and the theoretical possibility to increase speed beyond the speed of the earth at the [[equator]]. Finally, [[siege engines]] like [[catapult]]s are compared with the cost and effect of then modern guns.

== Second book ==

=== Various devices ===
In the 15 chapters of the second book, various devices are examined which move independently of human interference like clocks and watches, water mills and wind mills. Wilkins explains devices being driven by the motion of air in a chimney or by pressurized air. A [[land yacht]] is proposed driven by two sails on  two masts, and a wagon powered by a [[vertical axis wind turbine]]. A number of independently moving small artificial figures representing men and animals are described.  The possibilities are considered to improve the type of [[submarine]] designed and built by [[Cornelis Drebbel]]. The tales about various flying devices are related and doubts as to their truth are dissipated. Wilkins explains that it should be possible for a man, too, to fly by himself&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematical Magick'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; if a frame were built where the person could sit and if this frame was sufficiently pushed in the air.

=== The art of flying ===
In chapter VII, Wilkins discusses various methods how a man could fly, namely by the help of spirits and good or evil angels (as related on various occasions in the Bible), by the help of fowls, by wings fastend immediately to the body or by a flying chariot. The whole of this chapter (and of the following one) concern the possibilities of flying. In a single preliminary phrase, Wilkins refers to previous reports about attempts to fly: 
{{quote|Tis related of a certain English Monk called Elmerus [probably [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]]], about the Confessors time, that he did by such wings fly from a Tower above a furlong; and so another from Saint Marks steeple in Venice; another at Norinberge; and Busbequius speaks of a Turk in Constantinople, who attempted something this way. Mt. Burton mentioning this quotation, doth believe that some new-fangled wit ('tis his Cynical phrase) will some time or other find out this art. Though the truth is, most of these Artists did unfortunately miscarry by falling down and breaking their arms or legs, yet that may be imputed to their want of experience ...|p. 204|}}
Wilkins continues by saying that sufficient practise should enable a man to fly. The most probable way, however, would be by a ''flying chariot, which may be so contrived as to carry a man within it...''&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematical Magick'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; and be equipped with some sort of engine, or else be big enough to carry several persons each of them successively labouring to cause the chariot to fly. Wilkins uses the next chapter to dissipate any doubts there may be as to the possibility of such a flying chariot, but of course a number of particular items would have to be developed and tested.

=== Perpetual motion and perpetual lamps ===
In Chapters IX to XV, extensive discussions and deliberations are set out why a perpetual motion should be feasible, why the stories about lamps burning for hundreds of years were true and how such lamps could be made and perpetual motions created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">'''Mitochondrial toxicity''' is a condition in which the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] of a body's cells become damaged or decline significantly in number; it occurs as a side effect of certain [[antiretroviral drug]]s used to treat human immunodeficiency virus, or [[HIV]].

==Causes==
While the exact causes of mitochondrial toxicity are unknown, research has shown that a certain group of anti-viral drugs used to treat HIV, specifically nucleoside analog [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs), interfere with an enzyme needed in the production of mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebody.com/pinf/mitochondrial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
The disruption of cell function that accompanies the condition can cause both mild and severe problems in people suffering from mitochondrial toxicity.  The most commonly observed symptom is muscle weakness, or [[myopathy]].  Others include [[peripheral neuropathy]] (numbness in the fingers and toes) and [[pancreatitis]] (inflammation of the pancreas), with the most severe being [[lactic acidosis]], in which a build-up of lactic acid in the tissues of the body leads to loss of energy, organ failure, and eventually death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projinf.org/fs/mito_b.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002195329/http://www.projinf.org/fs/mito_b.html |archivedate=2006-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Movement Research''' is a non-profit organization that offers dance classes, workshops, residencies and performance opportunities for artists in [[New York City]]. Its focus is on improvisation, post-modern dance, and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouvement.net/teteatete/portraits/questions-en-mouvement Portrait of Movement Research in the French magazine Mouvement]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1978 under the name “The School for Movement Research &amp; Construction” and incorporated in 1980 after its first public performance in 1979. Movement Research organizes performances at the [[Judson Memorial Church]] among other locations around New York City. It has a long tie with Judson Church and [[Judson Dance Theater]] which shares some of the same base of artists.&lt;ref name=newm&gt;{{cite web|title=Movement Research in Residence|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/movement-research|work=Rethinking the Imprint of Judson Dance Theater Fifty Years Later September–December 2012|publisher=[[New Museum]]|accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Spring 2018, Movement Research announced they will be occupying 3 spaces in the newly renovated 122 Community Center, making 122CC Movement Research's first permanent home in their 40 year history.

'''Museum education''' is a specialized field devoted to developing and strengthening  the education role of non-formal education spaces and institutions such as museums. Its main objective is to engage visitors in learning experiences to enhance their curiosity and interest on their objects and collections. [[File:Dallas Museum of Art 06.jpg|thumb|Educational exhibition on "Materials &amp; Meanings" at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].]]

In a seminal report called ''Excellence and Equity''&lt;ref name="aam1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=Excellence and Equity|year=1992|publisher=American Association of Museums|isbn=978-0-931201-14-1|url=http://iweb.aam-us.org/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=I277}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992 by the American Association of Museums (now the [http://aam-us.org/about-us American Alliance of Museums]), the educational role of museums was identified as the core to museums' service to the public. According to the report, "...the public dimensions of museums leads them to perform the public service of education—a term that in its broadest sense includes exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation and dialogue". As museum education has developed as a field of study and interest in its own right, efforts have been made to record its history and to establish a research agenda to strengthen its position as a discipline in the wider work of museums.

== History ==

=== Non-formal education ===

In his first report as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture during [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration, in 1968, [[Philip H. Coombs]] emphasized the increment of the educative needs of the world’s population after World War II. In it, he mentions the diversity of non-formal education activities that constitute, or should constitute an important complement to formal education to the total educational efforts of any country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2001). «La necesidad de planificación y evaluación educativas en la educación no formal. Algunas propuestas». ''Educació i Cultura'': 14, 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; To Coombs, non-formal education had the potential to satisfy the learning demands of both, individuals and collectivities, because unlike formal and traditional education, which is rigid with its contents and programs, it is flexible and, when planning and designing educational activities, it takes into consideration local variations of culture, economy and society, which counteracts the tendency of developing countries to just imitate education models of developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2011 [2004]). «1». ''Pedagogía museística. Nuevas perspectivas y tendencias actuales''. Ariel. p. 15. {{ISBN|978-84-344-6974-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a work written by Coombs in conjunction with M. Ahmed, non-formal education is defined as "...any organized educational activity outside the established formal system—whether operating separately or as an important feature of some broader activity—that is intended to serve identifiable learning clienteles and learning objective".&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Phillips H. and H. Ahmed. ''New Paths To Learning: For Rural Children and Youth'' (en inglés). New York, N.Y.: International Council for Educational Development Publications. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, Coombs and Ahmed add the idea that non-formal education is any systematic educative activity, organized outside from the official framework to facilitate educative experiences for all people, regardless of age, genre, nationality, social, economic or health situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout his career, Coombs encouraged and impulsed the professional development of people responsible of non-formal education, which will be determining to the development and professionalization of the educative areas in institutions devoted to non-formal education.

=== Beginnings in art museums of the United States ===

At the turn of the twentieth century, art museums were very new institutions to the average visitor, who was seen wandering with no clear direction through the galleries, and with no clear idea on how to appreciate and study the exhibitions. In 1906, architect J. Randolph Coolidge Jr. was appointed the temporary director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He experimented with a guiding system in the galleries, to help visitors orient themselves throughout their walk across the exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Rika and, Elliot Kai-Kee (2011). «2». ''Teaching in the Art Museum. Interpretation as Experience''(en inglés). J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-058-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in the June bulletin of the museum that same year, features one of the first uses of the term docent and the description of its functions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It has been proposed to the Trustees to consider the permanent appointment of one or more persons of intelligence and education who could act as intermediaries between Curators and the many who would be glad to avail themselves of trained instruction in our galleries. Through these docents, as it has been proposed to call them, the heads of departments could instruct many more persons than it would be possible for them to accompany through the galleries; and illustrated lectures upon the collections prepared in the departments might be regularly given by these specially qualified aids both in the Museum and in the class rooms of neighboring schools and colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-4423283/4423283_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The Educational Work of the Museum. Retrospect and Prospect"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Statement==

In late 2009 North College of Thessaloniki ceased its 34-year-operation due to the Greek economic crisis.This affected the degree completion of many enrolled students. However, North College reputation still remains high through its graduates who have succeeded in achieving substantial careers professionally and academically in Greece and overseas.

==Historical Review==

North College of Thessaloniki, Greece, was established in 1975 as "Makedonikos Ekpedeftikos Organismos - MEO" (Macedonian Educational Organisation). In late 70s the MEO was renamed North College.

North College was one of the first independent institutions of Higher Education in Greece,&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive guide to Private Universities or Colleges in Greece. Last changed: 03.12.2007. (Online since 30.06.2005.)&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to teaching undergraduate and postgraduate academic courses.

Since its establishment, the North College of Thessaloniki operated as an Independent, non-profit-making, Liberal Studies College until 2009, under the legislative decree of the Hellenic Republic, 9/9.10.35.&lt;ref&gt;Government Official Journal (Gazette) 450A and the law 1966/26.9.91, Government Official Journal 147A (Gazette), legislative decree of the Hellenic Republic, 9/9.10.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, in co-operation with USA Academic institutions and in light of the growing demands of the local employment market, North College of Thessaloniki developed a relevant inspired academic system.

North College began its operation according to the trimester mode and on the basis of a clear modular system.

Until 1993 all courses lead to the Degree after three-year-studies, namely after the completion of a nine-trimester-course.

==Academic System==

In 1990, North College initiated a policy of approaching the British Educational System in order to comply with the European standards of education. This policy included close contacts and co-operation with British educational institutions.

In 1990s, the College moved rapidly towards a European educational philosophy, in view of the European Unification. In this context, North College Thessaloniki adopted the British educational system.

In 1995, North College changed its nine-trimester-mode of studies into eight-semester-mode.

==Academic &amp; International Partners==

Specifically, the following collaborations have had a catalytic effect on the North College's operating system:

[[File:North College Thessaloniki BTEC Approved Center Certificate 1996.jpg|thumb|North College of Thessaloniki, BTEC Approved Center Certificate 1996]]

*The BTEC/EDEXCEL FOUNDATION provision which had been operating in North College with remarkable success (1990). North College was the first institution in Greece to achieve BTEC Approved Assessment Centre status (1996). Thus, North College had been providing an autonomous two-year-long complete framework of higher education (1995). At that time, BTEC validation enabled North College to provide HND courses.
*The links with the University of Abertay Dundee, U.K. (1997). North College had been validated by the U.A.D. for the delivery of BA(Hons) in Business Studies and BSc(Hons) in Computer Studies at undergraduate level.
*In 1994, North College had been franchised by the U.A.D. for the delivery of MBA and MBA/Marketing and PgD/MSc in Software Engineering.

==Academic Innovations==

North College was the first and only Institution of Higher Education in Greece, both in the Independent and/or Public sector, which introduced and operated  Journalism Studies Courses in 1977.

That innovation enabled first graduates students to be fully and unconditionally accepted by American and British Universities for post-graduate studies.

Until 1990 the Greek state Universities ignored the Media Studies courses. Since then, the dominant notion was that the media professions were, merely, skill-oriented and thus, it was not necessary for journalists etc. to study for a degree.

All the media professionals were self-taught or graduates of irrelevant degrees such as lawyers, mathematicians, psychologists or, even just, high school graduates.

==Location==

North College resided in [[Thessaloniki]], Greece's second largest city after Athens. Thessaloniki has a population about 1.2 million and an extensive activity on trade and services.

==Organisation / Curriculum==

The College developed educational programmes in Business Studies, Division of Computing, Art &amp; Design, Psychology &amp; Counselling, Applied Linguistics &amp; Foreign Languages,  Mass Media &amp; Communications.

The College was oriented towards the development of Higher Education programmes, research and related services in Greece as well as overseas.

North College internationalised its education in Europe and in the United States by joint projects:

*Offered courses validated by British universities&lt;ref&gt;Overseas Quality Audit Report. University of Abertay Dandee &amp; North College Thessaloniki, Greece. Institutional Review Directorate. April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
*Participated in European Union educational and research initiatives
*Undertook joint quality monitoring, research and development
*Contributed to development programs with Central and Eastern Europe
*Developed and applied the UK and European Credit Transfer System between Universities
*Promoted staff and student exchanges

The North College of Thessaloniki used to offer 37 bachelor and 17 master's degrees in School of Business &amp; Computing, School of Art &amp; Design, and School of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences.

United Kingdom remained and still remains the most popular choice of North College graduates to seek for post-graduate studies.

==Governance==

*The Board of Governors
*The Course Management Team
*The Course Board
*The Examination &amp; Award Board
*The Quality Standards Committee

==Social Activities==
Clubs, Groups and Societies of North College created by students who shared the same enthusiasm and the same preference for Social, Sports, Cultural, Arts, Performing and Media activities. They were strongly encouraged to develop new plans and initiatives as well as to participate and involve in such activities, cultivating their social skills.

Various Clubs, Societies and Groups used to operate in North College such as Soccer, Basketball, Volleyball, Aerobic and some more unusual such as Art Therapy Group, which was founded by students of the Department of Psychology and was open and flexible to include members from other study areas.

==Alumni==

The Alumni Association of North College, operates as an independent legal entity recognized by statute by the competent authorities of the Greek State, in order to ensure communication between the alumni of the college. Besides, one of the main activities of the Alumni Association of North College is the continuous mutual information for the development of its members, but also the interconnections both within the organized structure, and between the different actors and networks of common interest.

==The Campuses==

During the academic year of 1992-93 (until 2005), the College moved to its new facilities outside the city of Thessaloniki, with purpose-built classrooms, better equipped, bigger and more in quantity. At that time North College owned three Inner City Campuses (City Annex, and Metropolitan Campus) and one out-city campus (Ioannina City).

The last Metropolitan Campus Building of the college was presented during the Pan-Hellenic Architecture Exhibition organized by HELEXPO in November 2005.

&lt;!--Basic introduction--&gt;
'''The Order of Nine Angles''' ('''ONA'''; '''O9A''') is a [[Satanism|Satanic]] and [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|Left-Hand Path]] [[occultism|occult]] group based in the United Kingdom, but with affiliated groups in various other parts of the world. Claiming to have been established in the 1960s, it rose to public recognition in the early 1980s, attracting attention for its [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] ideologies and activism. Describing its approach as "[[Theistic Satanism|Traditional Satanism]]", it has been identified by academic researchers as also exhibiting [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and [[Modern paganism|Neo-Pagan]] elements in its beliefs. It has been described as one of the most extreme and dangerous Satanist groups in the world.

&lt;!--History of the ONA--&gt;
According to the Order's own account, it was established in the [[Welsh Marches]] of Western England during the late 1960s by a woman who had previously been involved in a secretive pre-Christian tradition surviving in the region. This account also states that in 1973 a man named "Anton Long" was initiated into the group, subsequently becoming its Grand Master. Several academic commentators to have studied the ONA express the view that the name "Anton Long" is probably the pseudonym of the British neo-Nazi activist [[David Myatt]], although Myatt has denied that this is the case. From the late 1970s onward, Long authored a number of books and articles propagating the Order's ideas, and in 1988 it began production of its own journal, ''Fenrir''. Through these ventures it established links with other neo-Nazi Satanist groups around the world, furthering its cause through embracing the [[Internet]] in the 2000s.

&lt;!--Beliefs--&gt;
The ONA promotes the idea that human history can be divided into a series of Aeons, each of which contain a corresponding human civilization. It expresses the view that the current Aeonic civilization is that of the [[Western culture|Western]], but claims that the evolution of this society is threatened by the "Magian/Nazarene" influence of [[Judeo-Christian]] religion, which the Order seeks to combat in order to establish a militaristic new social order, termed the "Imperium". According to Order teachings, this is necessary in order for a Galactic civilization to form, in which "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" society will colonise the [[Milky Way]]. It advocates a spiritual path in which the practitioner is required to break societal taboos by isolating themselves from society, committing crimes, embracing political extremism and violence, and carrying out an act of [[human sacrifice]]. ONA members practice [[magic (paranormal)|magick]], believing that they are able to do so through channeling [[Energy (esotericism)|energies]] into our own "causal" realm from an "acausal" realm where the laws of physics do not apply, with such magical actions designed to aid in the ultimate establishment of the Imperium.

&lt;!--Structure and organisation--&gt;
The ONA lacks any central authority or structure, instead operating as a broad network of associates &amp;ndash; termed the "kollective" &amp;ndash; who are inspired by the texts originally authored by Long and other members of the "Inner ONA". The group comprises largely of clandestine cells, termed "nexions", as well as gangs known as Dreccs, artists known as Balobians, and folk mystics known as Rounwytha. With the first nexion based in [[Shropshire]], Western England, the majority of groups have been established in the British Isles and Germany, although others have been formed elsewhere in Europe, Russia, South Africa, Australia, and North America. Academic estimates suggest that the number of individuals broadly associated with the Order falls in the low thousands.

==History==

===Origins===

[[File:Shropshire UK locator map 2010.svg|thumb|right|The ONA's first cell, "Nexion Zero", was established in the county of Shropshire (pictured).{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}}]]

Academics have found it difficult to ascertain "exact and verifiable information" about the ONA's origins given the secrecy with which the group shields itself.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} As with many other occult organisations, the Order shrouds its history in "mystery and legend", creating a "mythical narrative" for its origins and development.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} The ONA claims to be the descendant of pre-Christian [[paganism|pagan]] traditions which survived the [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation of Britain]] and which were passed down from the Middle Ages onward in small groups or "temples" based in the [[Welsh Marches]] &amp;ndash; a border area between England and Wales &amp;ndash; which were each led by a Grand Master or Grand Mistress.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=218}} According to the Order, in the late 1960s a Grand Mistress of one such group united three of these temples &amp;ndash; Camlad, the Temple of the Sun, and The Noctulians &amp;ndash; to form the ONA,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} before welcoming outsiders into the tradition.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=391}}

According to the Order's account, one of those whom the Grand Mistress initiated into the group was "Anton Long", an individual who described himself as a British citizen who had spent much of his youth visiting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=86}} Long claimed that prior to his involvement in the ONA he had been interested in occultism for several years, having contacted a [[coven]] based in [[The Fens|Fenland]] in 1968, before moving to London and joining groups that practiced [[ceremonial magic]] in the style of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}} He also claimed a brief involvement in a Satanic group based in [[Manchester]], the [[Orthodox Temple of the Prince]] run by Ray Bogart, during which time he encountered the ONA Grand Mistress.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=86|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=357}} According to the Order's account, Long joined the ONA in 1973 &amp;ndash; the first to have done so in five years &amp;ndash; and became the Grand Mistress' heir.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=217|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} He later recalled that at that time the group held rituals at [[henges]] and [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|stone circles]] around the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=255}}

This account further states that when the Order's Grand Mistress migrated to Australia, Long took over as the group's new Grand Master.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} The group claimed that Long "implemented the next stage of Sinister Strategy &amp;ndash; to make the teachings known on a large scale".{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}} From the late 1970s onward, Long encouraged the establishment of new ONA groups, which were known as "temples",{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|pp=221&amp;ndash;222}} and from 1976 onward he authored an array of texts for the tradition, codifying and extending its teachings, mythos, and structure.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=87}} These texts are typically written in English, although they include passages of [[Classical Greek]] as well as terms from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]],{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=87}} reflecting Long's fluency in such languages.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=86}} After examining these texts, the historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] stated that in them, Long "evokes a world of witches, outlaw peasant sorcerers, orgies and blood sacrifices at lonely cottages in the woods and valleys of this area [Shropshire and Herefordshire] where he has lived since the early 1980s".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}}

[[File:Ibnmyatt.png|thumb|left|David Myatt (pictured 2007) is often cited as the central ideologue in the ONA.]]

The real identity of "Anton Long" remains a mystery to both members of the Order and to academics who have studied it.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=85}} However, in a 1998 issue of the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] magazine ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'', it was claimed that "Anton Long" was a pseudonym of [[David Myatt]], a prominent figure in the British neo-Nazi movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=256|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=357}} Born in the early 1950s, Myatt had been involved in various neo-Nazi groups, initially serving as a bodyguard for [[Colin Jordan]] of the [[British Movement]] before joining the [[Combat 18]] militia and becoming a founding member and leader of the [[National Socialist Movement (United Kingdom)|National Socialist Movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1pp=217, 222|2a1=Ryan|2y=2003|2p=53|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3pp=263&amp;ndash;264}} His text on ''A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution'', in which he advocated violent militancy in aid of the neo-Nazi cause, was cited as an influence on the nail bomber [[David Copeland]].{{sfnm|1a1=Weitzmann|1y=2010|1p=16|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2pp=263&amp;ndash;264}} In 1998 Myatt converted to [[Islam]] and remained a practicing Muslim for eight years, in which time he encouraged violent [[jihad]] against [[Zionism]] and Israel's Western allies.{{sfnm|1a1=Weitzmann|1y=2010|1pp=16&amp;ndash;17|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2pp=265&amp;ndash;267|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=358}} In 2010, he announced that he had renounced Islam and was practicing an esoteric tradition that he termed the "Numinous Way".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=358}}

Goodrick-Clarke supported the idea that Myatt was Long,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=216|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=357}} with the [[religious studies]] scholar Jacob C. Senholt adding that "the role of David Myatt [is] paramount to the whole creation and existence of the ONA".{{sfn|Senholt|2009|p=16}} Senholt presented additional evidence that he believed confirmed Myatt's identity as Long,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=268}} writing that Myatt's embrace of neo-Nazism and radical [[Islamism]] represented "insight roles" which Myatt had adopted as part of the ONA's "sinister strategy" to undermine Western society,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=267}} a view endorsed by scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013a|p=207}} In 2015, an ONA member known as R. Parker argued in favour of the idea that Myatt was Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/myatt-mage-v9d.pdf |accessdate=16 October 2015 |title=A Modern Mage |website=O9A |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cKRCfXiA?url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/myatt-mage-v9d.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Page's publication, the sociologist of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] stated that the ONA has "more or less acknowledged" that Myatt and Long are the same person, {{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=358}} which claim about Myatt the ONA has disputed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/the-o9a-and-academia-v3.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2017 |title=Academia, David Myatt, and the Order of Nine Angles |website=O9A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myatt himself has repeatedly denied allegations that he has any involvement with the ONA,{{sfnm|1a1=Ryan|1y=2003|1p=53|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=267}} and that he has used the pseudonym "Anton Long",{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=111}} furthermore challenging the arguments used to connect him with Long by claiming that they are based on insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name=Myatt-honor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/myatt-a-matter-of-honour.html |accessdate=2012-10-10 |date=November 2012 |title=A Matter of Honour |website=David Myatt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6biSydvsn?url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/myatt-a-matter-of-honour.html |archivedate=2015-09-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious studies scholar George Sieg expressed concern with this association, stating that he found it to be "implausible and untenable based on the extent of variance in writing style, personality, and tone" between Myatt and Long.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|p=257}} [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]], an academic specialist in the far right, has also suggested that Myatt and Long are separate people,{{sfn|Kaplan|1998|p=115}} while the religious studies scholar Connell R. Monette posited the possibility that "Anton Long" was not a singular individual but rather a pseudonym used by several different people.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=92}}

===Public emergence===

The ONA arose to public attention in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} During the 1980s and 1990s it spread its message through articles in various magazines,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}} such as Stephen Sennitt's ''Nox'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Infernal Texts: Nox &amp; Liber Koth''. Falcon Publications, 1997. (Third edition, The Original Falcon Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-935150-73-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; as well as through the publication of such volumes as ''The Black Book of Satan'',&lt;ref name=blackbook&gt;''The Black Book of Satan''. 1984, Thormynd Press, {{ISBN|0-946646-04-X}}. British Library General Reference Collection Cup.815/51, BNB GB8508400&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Naos''.&lt;ref&gt;''Naos: A Practical Guide to Modern Magick''. Coxland Press, 1990, {{ISBN|1-872543-00-6}}. British Library General Reference Collection YK.1993.a.13307, BNB GB9328754&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 it began publication of its own in-house journal, titled ''Fenrir''.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=218|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=256}} Among written material that it has publicly issued have been philosophical tracts, ritual instruction, letters, poetry, and gothic fiction.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=293}} Its core ritual text is titled the ''Black Book of Satan''.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=260|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=361}} It has also issued its own music, painted [[tarot]] set known as the Sinister Tarot, and a three-dimensional board game known as the Star Game.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=236}}  The ONA established links with other neo-Nazi Satanist groups: its international distributor was New Zealander [[Kerry Bolton]], the founder of the [[Black Order (Satanist group)|Black Order]],{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=229}} who is described as an ONA adept in the group's published letter-correspondence,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=254}} and it has access to a private library of occult and far right material owned by the [[Neo-völkisch movements#Order of the Jarls of Baelder|Order of the Jarls of Bælder]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=225}} According to Monette, the group now have associates, and groups, in the United States, Europe, Brazil, Egypt, Australia, and Russia.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}} One of these associate groups is the U.S.-based [[Tempel ov Blood]], which has published a number of texts through Ixaxaar Press,{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1pp=89&amp;ndash;90|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=359}} while another is the California-based White Star Acception, which has been designated as the ONA's "Flagship Nexion" in the United States despite diverting from mainstream ONA teachings on a number of issues.{{sfnm|1a1=Sieg|1y=2013|1p=253|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=359}}

During the early 1990s, the Order stated that it was entering the second stage of its development, in which it would leave behind its prior focus on recruitment and public outreach within the occult community and that it would instead focus on refining its teachings; its resulting quietness led some occultists to erroneously speculate that the ONA had become defunct.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=107}}
In 2000, the ONA established a presence on the Internet, using it as a medium to communicate with others and to distribute its writings.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=256}}  
In 2008, the ONA announced that it was entering the third phase in its history, in which it would once again focus heavily on promotion, utilising such [[social media]] as online blogs, forums, [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]] to spread its message.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=107}} In 2011, the "Old Guard", a group of longstanding members of the Order, stated that they would withdraw from active, public work with the group.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=93}} In March 2012, Long announced that he would be withdrawing from public activity, although appears to have remained active in the Order.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=87}}

==Beliefs and structure==

The ONA describes its beliefs as belonging to "a sinisterly-numinous mystic tradition", adding that "it is not now and never was either strictly satanist or strictly Left Hand Path, but uses "satanism" and the LHP as "causal forms"; that is, as techniques/experiences/ordeals/challenges" to aid the practitioner's spiritual advancement.&lt;ref name="basic"&gt;{{cite web |title=O9A 101 |website=O9A: Quintessence of the Order of Nine Angles |url=https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/o9a-101/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6biTnFnPD?url=https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/o9a-101/ |archivedate=2015-09-21 |access-date=2015-08-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monette described the ONA as "a fascinating blend of both Hermeticism and Traditional Satanism, with some pagan elements".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=85}}
Faxneld described the ONA as "a dangerous and extreme form of Satanism" {{sfn|Faxneld|2013a|p=207}} and as "one of the most extreme Satanist groups in the world." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10205724/Pony-mutilated-in-suspected-satanic-act-in-Dartmoor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Kaplan and Leonard Weinberg characterised it as a "National Socialist-oriented Satanist group",{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} while Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke similarly deemed it to be a "Satanic Nazi cult" which "combine[d] paganism with praise for Hitler".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=215}} He added that the ONA "celebrated the dark, destructive side of life through anti-Christian, elitist and Social Darwinist doctrines."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=216}} Considering the manner in which the ONA had syncretized both Satanism and [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], the historian of religion [[Mattias Gardell]] described its spiritual perspective as "a heathen satanic path".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=292}} The scholar George Sieg however argued that the ONA should be categorised as "post-Satanic" because it has "surpassed (without fully abandoning) identification with its original satanic paradigm".{{sfn|Sieg|2013|p=255}}

===Traditional Satanism and Paganism===

The ONA describe their occultism both as "Traditional Satanism",{{sfnm|1a1=Faxneld|1y=2013a|1p=207|2a1=Faxneld|2y=2013b|2p=88|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=250|4a1=Sieg|4y=2013|4p=252}}{{efn| The ONA used the term Traditional Satanism in their ''Black Book of Satan'', published in 1984.&lt;ref name=blackbook /&gt; Since the establishment of the ONA, the term "Traditional Satanism" has also been adopted by [[Theistic Satanism|Theistic Satanist]] groups like the [[Brotherhood of Satan]].{{sfn|Faxneld|2013b|p=88}} Faxneld suggested that the Order's adoption of the word "traditional" possibly reflected a "conscious strategy to built legitimacy" by harking back to "arcane ancient wisdom" in a manner deliberately distinct from the way in which [[Anton LaVey]] sought to gain legitimacy for his Church of Satan by appealing to rationality, science, and his own personal charisma.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013b|p=88}} Elsewhere Faxneld suggested that the ONA's use of "Traditional Satanism" to differentiate themselves from the dominant forms of Satanism had comparisons with how those who describe themselves as practitioners of "[[Traditional Witchcraft]]" do so to distinguish their magico-religious practices from the dominant form of modern witchcraft, [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Faxneld|2013a|pp=207&amp;ndash;208}} According to Anton Long, writing in the text ''Selling Water By The River'' "Traditional Satanism is a term used to describe the sinister path which for centuries was taught on an individual basis&amp;nbsp;... To this path belongs the Septenary System, Esoteric Chant [and] the comprehensive training of novices (including the development of the physical side) and most importantly the Internal system of magick (the Grade Rituals etcetera)."{{sfn|Long|1992c|pp=13&amp;ndash;17}}}} and as a "mystical sinisterly-numinous tradition".&lt;ref name="basic" /&gt;
According to Jesper Aagaard Petersen, an academic specialist of Satanism, the Order present "a recognizable new interpretation of Satanism and the [[Left Hand Path]]",{{sfn|Petersen|2014|p=416}} and for those involved in the group, Satanism is not simply a religion but a way of life.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}}
The Order postulates Satanism as an arduous individual achievement of self-mastery and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] self-overcoming, with an emphasis on individual growth through practical acts of risk, prowess and endurance.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=218}} Therefore, "[t]he goal of the Satanism of the ONA is to create a new individual through direct experience, practice and self-development [with] the grades of the ONA system being highly individual, based on the initiates' own practical and real-life acts, instead of merely performing certain ceremonial rituals".{{sfn|Senholt|2009|pp=29&amp;ndash;30}} Thus Satanism, the ONA assert, requires venturing into the realm of the forbidden and illegal in order to shake the practitioner loose of cultural and political conditioning.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=86}} Intentionally transgressive, the Order has been characterised as providing "an aggressive and elitist spirituality".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=85}} Religious studies scholar Graham Harvey claimed that the ONA fit the stereotype of the Satanist "better than other groups", something which he thought was deliberately achieved by embracing "deeply shocking" and illegal acts.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=292}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="[Long] rejects the quasi-religious organization and ceremonial antics of the Church of Satan, the Temple of Set and other satanic groups. He believes that traditional satanism goes far beyond the gratification of the pleasure-principle and involves the arduous achievement of self-mastery, self-overcoming in a Nietzschean sense, and ultimately cosmic wisdom. His conception of satanism is practical, with an emphasis on individual growth into realms of darkness and danger through practical acts of prowess, endurance and the risk of life."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=218}} }}

The ONA are strongly critical of larger Satanic groups like the [[Church of Satan]] and the [[Temple of Set]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=293|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} whom they deem to be "sham-Satanic" because they embrace the "glamour associated with Satanism" but are "afraid to experience its realness within and external to them".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} In turn, the Church of Satan has criticised what they alleged was the Order's "paranoic insistence that they are the only upholders of Satanic tradition",{{sfn|Kaplan|1998|p=115}} with Kaplan stating that these comments reflect "the intramural tensions" that are common within "the world of Satanism",{{sfn|Kaplan|1998|p=115}} and about which criticism Anton Long wrote that the ONA does not "claim to be a peer organization with a claim to some kind of authority&amp;nbsp;... When in the past we and others like us have said things that others interpret as being against the [Temple of Set] or La Vey, we were simply assuming the role of Adversary – challenging what seemed to be becoming accepted dogma."{{sfn|Long|1992a||p=7}}

Although conceiving of itself as having pre-Christian origins and describing Satanism as "militant paganism", the ONA does not advocate the re-establishment of pre-Christian belief systems, with one ONA tract stating that "all past gods of the various Western Traditions are rendered obsolete by the forces which Satanism alone is unleashing".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} However, Goodrick-Clarke noted that the group's "ideas and rituals" draw upon "a native tradition", with references to the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon concept of ''[[wyrd]]'', an emphasis on ceremonies performed at equinoxes, and the construction of incense using indigenous trees, thus suggesting the idea of "rootedness in English nature".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} Practitioners undergo "black pilgrimages" to prehistoric ceremonial sites in the area around Shropshire and Herefordshire in the [[English Midlands]].{{Sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}}
Furthermore, Monette writes that "a critical examination of the ONA's key texts suggests that the satanic overtones could be cosmetic, and that its core mythos and cosmology are genuinely hermetic, with pagan influences."{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=87}}

===Aeonic Cosmology and Nazism===

The ONA states that cosmic evolution is guided by a "sinister dialectics" of alternating Aeonic energies.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=294}} It divides history into a series of Aeons, believing that each was dominated by a human civilization that emerged, evolved, and then died.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=220}} It states that each Aeon lasts for approximately 2000 years, with its respective dominating human civilization developing within the latter 1500 years of that period.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=261}} It holds that after 800 years of growth, each civilization faces problems, resulting in a "Time of Troubles" that lasts from between 398 and 400 years. In each civilization's final stage is a period that lasts for approximately 390 years, in which it is controlled by a strong military and imperial regime, after which the civilization falls.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}} The ONA claims that humanity has lived through five such Aeons, each with an associated civilization: the Primal, Hyperborean, Sumerian, Hellenic, and Western.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=391}} Both Goodrick-Clarke and Senholt have stated that this system of Aeons is inspired by the work of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]],{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=220|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=261}} with Senholt suggesting that it might also have been influenced by Crowley's ideas regarding [[Thelema|Thelemic]] Aeons.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=261}} However, the ONA has stated that their concept "has nothing to do with Crowley",{{sfn|Long|1992a||p=22}} but is based on the work of both Toynbee and Spengler.{{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=678&amp;ndash;684}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="[[Adolf Hitler]] was sent by our gods&lt;br&gt;To guide us to greatness&lt;br&gt;We believe in the inequality of races&lt;br&gt;And in the right of the [[Aryan]] to live&lt;br&gt;According to the laws of the folk.&lt;br&gt;We acknowledge that the story of the Jewish "holocaust"&lt;br&gt;Is a lie to keep our race in chains&lt;br&gt;And express our desire to see the truth revealed.&lt;br&gt;We believe in justice for our oppressed comrades&lt;br&gt;And seek an end to the world-wide&lt;br&gt;Persecution of National-Socialists."|source=— The ONA's "Mass of Heresy"{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=237}} }}

The ONA claim that current Western civilization has a [[Faustian]] ethos and that it has recently undergone its Time of Troubles, with its final stage, an "Imperium" of militaristic governance, due to commence at some point in 1990&amp;ndash;2011 and last until 2390.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}} This will be followed by a period of chaos from which will be established a sixth Aeon, the Aeon of Fire, which will be represented by the Galactic civilization in which an Aryan society shall colonize the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=294,391|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=221}} However, the Order holds that unlike previous Aeonic civilizations, the Western has been infected with the "Magian/Nazarene" distorion, which they associate with Judeo-Christian religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=220|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=261}} The group's writings state that while Western civilization had once been "a pioneering entity, imbued with elitist values and exalting the way of the warrior", under the impact of the Magian/Nazarene ethos it has become "essentially neurotic, inward-looking and obsessed", embracing [[humanism]], [[capitalism]], [[communism]], as well as "the sham of democracy" and "the dogma of racial equality".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=220}} They believe that these Magian/Nazarene forces represent a counter-evolutionary trend which threaten to prevent the emergence of the Western Imperium and thus the evolution of humanity, opining that this cosmic enemy must be overcome through the force of will.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=220|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=261}} Both Goodrick-Clarke and Sieg note that these ideas regarding the "Magian soul" and "cultural distortion" brought about by Jews were derived from the work of [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Francis Parker Yockey]].{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=220|2a1=Sieg|2y=2013|2p=259}}

The ONA praise [[Nazi Germany]] as "a practical expression of Satanic spirit&amp;nbsp;... a burst of Luciferian light &amp;ndash; of zest and power &amp;ndash; in an otherwise Nazarene, pacified, and boring world."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=221}} Embracing [[Holocaust denial]],{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=221}}{{sfn|ONA|2011|pp=39&amp;ndash;45, 53&amp;ndash;56}} they claim that the [[Holocaust]] was a myth constructed by the Magian/Nazarene establishment in order to denigrate the Nazi administration following the [[Second World War]] and erase its achievements from "the psyche of the West".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=221}} The group believe that a neo-Nazi revolution is necessary to overthrow the Magian-Nazarene domination of Western society and to establish the Imperium, ultimately allowing humanity to enter the Galactic civilization of the future.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=221}} 
Accordingly, positive references to Nazism and neo-Nazism can be found within the group's written material,{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=237}} and it evokes the Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]] as a positive force in its text for the performance of a [[Black Mass]],{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=155}} also known as The Mass of Heresy.{{sfn|ONA|2011|pp=757&amp;ndash;760}} However, some ONA texts stress that members should embrace neo-Nazism and racism not out of a genuine belief in Nazi ideology, but rather as part of a "sinister strategy" to advance Aeonic evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=294|2a1=Sieg|2y=2013|2p=259}} A version of the Black Mass-produced by an Australian ONA group, The Temple of THEM, replaces praise for Hitler with praise for Islamist militant [[Osama bin Laden]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sieg|1y=2013|1p=258|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=359}} while the writings of Chloe Ortega and Kayla DiGiovanni, key publicists for the U.S.-based White Star Acception, express what Sieg termed a "left-anarchist" platform which lacked the condemnation of Zionism and endorsement of [[Aryan]] racialism found in Long's writings.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|p=269}} The Order is thus far more overtly political extreme in its aims than other Satanic and Left Hand Path organisations, seeking to infiltrate and destabilise modern society through both magical and practical means.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=251}}

===Initiation and the Seven Fold Way===

The ONA's core system is known as the "Seven Fold Way" or "Hebdomadry",{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=219|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=257|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=95|4a1=Introvigne|4y=2016|4p=361}} and is outlined in one of the Order's primary texts, ''Naos''.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=106}} The sevenfold system is reflected in the group's symbolic [[cosmology]], the "Tree of Wyrd", on which seven celestial bodies &amp;ndash; the Moon, Venus, Mercury, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn &amp;ndash; are located.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} The term ''[[wyrd]]'' was adopted from [[Old English]], where it referred to [[fate]] or [[destiny]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} Monette identified this as a "hermetic system", highlighting that the use of seven planetary bodies had been influenced by the Medieval Arabic texts ''[[Picatrix|Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm]]'' and ''[[Shams I-Maarif]]''.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=106}}
The Seven Fold Way is also reflected in the group's initiatory system, which has seven grades through which the member can gradually progress.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=219|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=257|3a1=Monette|3y=2013|3p=95}} These are: (1) Neophyte, (2) Initiate, (3) External Adept, (4) Internal Adept, (5) Master/Mistress, (6) Grand Master/Mousa and (7) Immortal.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=258|2a1=Monette|2y=2013|2pp=95&amp;ndash;96}} The group has revealed that very few of its members raise to the fifth and sixth degrees,{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=259}} and in a 1989 article the ONA stated that at that point there were only four individuals who had reached the stage of Master.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=259}}

[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|right|The ONA encourages its members to adopt "insight roles" in anarchist, neo-Nazi, and Islamist groups in order to disrupt modern Western society.]]

The ONA does not initiate members into the group itself, but rather expects an individual to initiate themselves.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=96}} It requires that initiates be in a good physical condition, and recommends a training regimen for prospective members to follow.{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=236}}  Newcomers are expected to take on a magical partner of the opposite sex,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} or of the same sex if they are lesbian or gay.{{sfn|ONA|2015|p=467}} Thenceforth, the practitioner must undertake personal and increasingly difficult challenges in order to move through the different grades.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=96}} Most of the ordeals that allow the initiate to proceed to the next stage are publicly revealed by the Order in its introductory material, as it is believed that the true initiatory element lies in the experience itself and can only be attained through performing them.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=258}} For instance, part of the ritual to become an External Adept involves an ordeal in which the prospective member is to find a lonely spot and to lie there, still, for an entire night without moving or sleeping.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=258}} The initiatory process for the role of Internal Adept entails the practitioner withdrawing from human society for three months, from an equinox to a solstice, or (more usually) for six months, {{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=201&amp;ndash;203}} during which time they must live in the wild without modern conveniences or contact with civilisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1pp=236&amp;ndash;237|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=219|3a1=Senholt|3y=2013|3p=258}}  The next stage – the Ritual of the Abyss – involves the candidate living alone in a dark isolated cavern for a lunar month.{{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=1446&amp;ndash;1459}} According to Jeffrey Kaplan, an academic specialist of the far right, these physically and mentally challenging initiatory tasks reflect "the ONA's conception of itself as a vanguard organization composed of a tiny coterie of Nietzschean elites."{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=237}}

Within the initiatory system of the ONA, there is an emphasis on practitioners adopting "insight roles" in which they work undercover among a politically extreme group for a period of six to eighteen months, thus gaining experience in something different from their normal life.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=269|2a1=Monette|2y=2013|2p=96}} Among the ideological trends that the ONA suggests its members adopt "insight roles" within are [[anarchism]], neo-Nazism, and [[Islamism]], stating that aside from the personal benefits of such an involvement, membership of these groups has the benefit of undermining the Magian-Nazarene socio-political system of the West and thus helping to bring about the instability from which a new order, the Imperium, can emerge.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=269}} However, Monette noted a potential shift in the insight roles recommended by the group over the decades; he highlighted that while the ONA recommended criminal or military activities during the 1980s and early 1990s, by the late 1990s and 2000s they were instead recommending Buddhist monasticism as an insight role for practitioners to adopt.{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=96&amp;ndash;97}}
Therefore, "through the practice of "insight roles", the order advocates continuous transgression of established norms, roles, and comfort zones in the development of the initiate&amp;nbsp;... This extreme application of ideas further amplifies the ambiguity of satanic and Left Hand Path practices of [[Antinomianism#Left-hand path|antinomianism]], making it almost impossible to penetrate the layers of subversion, play and counter-dichotomy inherent in the sinister dialectics."{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=15}} Senholt suggested that Myatt's involvement with both neo-Nazism and Islamism represent such "insight roles" in his own life.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|pp=267, 269}}

===The Acausal Realm, Magick and the Dark Gods===

The ONA believe that humans live within the ''causal'' realm, which obeys the laws of cause and effect. However, they also believe in an ''acausal'' realm, in which the laws of physics do not apply, further promoting the idea that numinous energies from the acausal realm can be drawn into the causal, allowing for the performance of magic.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=100}} Believing in the existence of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] &amp;ndash; which the group spell "magick" following the example of [[Elias Ashmole]]'s 1652 work ''[[Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Further Notes Concerning The Hermetic Origins Of The O9A |author=R. Parker |date=April 2015 |url=http://www.o9a.org/wp-content/uploads/o9a-hermetic-tradition-part2-v3.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6biYBrR6G?url=http://www.o9a.org/wp-content/uploads/o9a-hermetic-tradition-part2-v3.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |access-date=2015-08-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; the ONA distinguish between external, internal, and aeonic magick.{{sfnm|1a1=Senholt|1y=2013|1p=260|2a1=Monette|2y=2013|2p=100}} External magic itself is divided into two categories: ceremonial magick, which is performed by more than two people to achieve a specific goal,{{sfn|ONA|2015|pp=515&amp;ndash;517}} and hermetic magick, which is performed either solitarily or in a pair and which is often [[sex magic|sexual in nature]].{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=260}} Internal magick is designed to produce an [[altered state of consciousness]] in the participant, in order to result in a process of "individuation" which bestows adepthood.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=260}} The most advanced form of magick in the ONA system is aeonic magick, the practice of which is restricted to those who are already perceived to have mastered external and internal magick and attained the grade of master.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=260}} The purpose of aeonic magick is to influence large numbers of people over a lengthy period of time, thus affecting the development of future aeons.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|pp=260&amp;ndash;261}} In particular it is employed with the intent of disrupting the current socio-political system of the Western world, which the ONA believe has been corrupted by Judeo-Christian religion.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=262}}

[[File:Kali; standing triumphantly over Shiva. Chromolitho Wellcome V0045066.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Even though, the ONA Dark Goddess Baphomet has been described as having "strong parallels" with the Hindu Goddess Kali (pictured), {{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=103&amp;ndash;104}} it is unrelated because Goddess Kali symbolizes victory over evil and ignorance.]]

The ONA utilises two methods in its performance of aeonic magick. The first entails rites and chants with the intent of opening a gateway &amp;ndash; known as a "nexion" &amp;ndash; to the "acausal realm" in order to manifest energies in the "causal realm" that will influence the existing aeon in the practitioner's desired direction.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|pp=261&amp;ndash;262}} The second method involves playing an advanced form of a board game known as the Star Game; the game was devised by the group, with the game pieces representing different aeons. The group believes that when an initiate plays the game they can become a "living nexion" and thus a channel for acausal energies to enter the causal realm and effect aeonic change.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=262}} An advanced form of the game is used as part of the training for the grade of Internal Adept.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} According to Myatt, he invented the game in 1975.&lt;ref name=Myatt-stargame&gt;{{cite web |url=https://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/star-game-history.pdf |accessdate=21 September 2015 |title=The Star Game: History and Theory |website=David Myatt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bicJedT9?url=https://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/star-game-history.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Order promotes the idea that "Dark Gods" exist within the acausal realm, although it is accepted that some members will interpret them not as real entities but as facets of the human subconscious.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=103}} These entities are perceived as dangerous, with the ONA advising caution when interacting with them.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=103}} Among those Dark Gods whose identities have been discussed in the Order's publicly available material are a goddess named [[Baphomet]] who is depicted as a mature woman carrying a severed head,{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=103&amp;ndash;105}} with the ONA stating that the name is of ancient Greek origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/baphomet-esoteric-v3a.pdf|accessdate=21 September 2015|title=Baphomet, An Esoteric Signification|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922111657/https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/baphomet-esoteric-v3a.pdf|archivedate = 22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are entities whose names, according to Monette, are borrowed from or influenced by figures from Classical sources and [[astronomy]], such as Kthunae, Nemicu, and Atazoth.{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=103&amp;ndash;105}}

Another of these acausal figures is termed Vindex, after the Latin word for "avenger". The ONA believe that Vindex will eventually incarnate as a human &amp;ndash; although the gender and ethnicity of this individual is unknown &amp;ndash; through the successful "presencing" of acausal energies within the causal realm, and that they will act as a messianic figure by overthrowing the Magian forces and leading the ONA to prominence in the establishment of a new society.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1pp=104, 108&amp;ndash;109|2a1=Sieg|2y=2013|2pp=260, 265&amp;ndash;266|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=360}} Sieg drew comparisons between this belief in Vindex and the ideas of [[Savitri Devi]], the prominent [[Esoteric Hitlerism|Esoteric Hitlerist]], regarding the arrival of [[Kalki]], an avatar of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]], to Earth.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|pp=259&amp;ndash;260}} The ONA also propagate the idea that it is possible for the practitioner to secure an [[afterlife]] within the acausal realm through their spiritual activities.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}} It is for this reason that the final stage of the Seven Fold Way is known as the "Immortal", constituting those initiates who have been able to advance to the stage of dwelling in the acausal realm.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=101}}

===Human sacrifice===

The ONA's writings condone and encourage human sacrifice,{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1pp=218&amp;ndash;219|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} referring to their victims as ''opfers''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}}
The ONA outline their views on human sacrifice in a number of documents: "A Gift for the Prince &amp;ndash; A Guide to Human Sacrifice", "Culling &amp;ndash; A Guide to Sacrifice II", "Victims &amp;ndash; A Sinister Exposé", and "Guidelines for the Testing of Opfers".{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|pp=237&amp;ndash;238}} According to the ONA's beliefs, the killer must allow their victim to "self-select" themselves; this is achieved through testing the victim to see if they expose perceived character faults. If this proves to be the case, the victim is believed to have shown that they are worthy of death, and the sacrifice can commence.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=237|2a1=Ryan|2y=2003|2p=54}} Those deemed ideal for sacrifice by the group include individuals perceived as being of low character, members of what they deem "sham-Satanic groups" like the Church of Satan and Temple of Set, as well as "zealous, interfering Nazarenes", and journalists, business figures and political activists who disrupt the group's operations.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=293&amp;ndash;294|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=155}} The ONA explains that because of the need for such "self-selection", children must never be victims of sacrifice.{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=292|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2000|2p=237}} Similarly, the ONA "despise animal sacrifice, maintaining that it is much better to sacrifice suitable mundanes given the abundance of human dross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.o9a.org/wp-content/uploads/praxis-and-theory-of-the-o9a.pdf |accessdate=21 September 2015 |title=Praxis and Theory of the Order of Nine Angles |website=Order of Nine Angles |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bic6jQfj?url=http://www.o9a.org/wp-content/uploads/praxis-and-theory-of-the-o9a.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sacrifice is then carried out through either physical or magical means, at which point the killer is believed to absorb power from the body and spirit of the victim, thus entering a new level of "sinister" consciousness.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=237|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=293}} As well as strengthening the character of the killer by heightening their connection with the acausal forces of death and destruction,{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=293|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2003|2p=219}} such sacrifices are also viewed as having wider benefits by the ONA, because they remove from society individuals whom the group deems to be worthless human beings.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=293}} Monette noted that no ONA nexion cells publicly admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritual manner, but that members had joined the police and military groups in order to engage in legal violence and killing.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=114}}

The ONA believe that there are historical precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named [[Baphomet]] at the spring equinox and to the [[Arcturus]] star in the autumn.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}} However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set, who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=219}}

===The term "nine angles"===

In its essays and other writings, the ONA offers various differing explanations as to the meaning of the term "Nine Angles".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} One explanation is that it pertains to the seven planets of the group's cosmology (the seven angles), added to the system as a whole (the eighth angle), and the mystic themselves (the ninth angle).{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=105|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=360}} A second explanation is that it refers to seven "normal" [[alchemy|alchemical]] stages, with an additional two processes.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} A third is that it pertains to the nine emanations of the divine, a concept originally found in Medieval texts produced within the Islamic mystical tradition of [[Sufism]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}} Monette further suggested that it was a reference to a classical Indian tradition which divided the [[solar system]] into nine planets.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=105}}

According to the O9A, they use the term "nine angles" in reference to not only the nine emanations, and transformations, of the three basic alchemical substances (mercury, sulfur, salt) as occurs in their occult use of the Star Game,&lt;ref name="Myatt-stargame"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/the-star-game/ |accessdate=2014-11-11 |title=The Star Game |website=O9A: Quintessence of the Order of Nine Angles |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6biat5kZw?url=https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/the-star-game/ |archivedate=2015-09-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in reference to their hermetic journey with its seven spheres and its two acausal aspects.&lt;ref name=seven-fold-way&gt;{{cite web |url=http://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/seven-fold-way/ |accessdate=2014-11-11 |title=Seven Fold Way |website=O9A: Quintessence of the Order of Nine Angles |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bibEs4uM?url=https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/seven-fold-way/ |archivedate=2015-09-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The ONA is a diverse, and world-wide, collective of diverse groups, tribes, and individuals, who share and who pursue similar sinister, subversive, interests, aims and life-styles, and who co-operate when necessary for their mutual benefit and in pursuit of their shared aims and objectives... The criteria for belonging to the ONA is this pursuit of similar sinister, subversive, interests, aims and life-styles, together with the desire to co-operate when it is beneficial to them and the pursuit of our shared aims. There is thus no formal ONA membership, and no Old-Aeon, mundane, hierarchy or even any rules."|source=— The ONA, 2010{{sfn|Sieg|2013|p=273}} }}

The ONA is a secretive organization.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=357}} It lacks any central administration, instead operating as a network of allied Satanic practitioners, which it terms the "kollective".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}} Thus, Monette stated that the Order "is not a structured lodge or temple, but rather a movement, a subculture or perhaps metaculture that its adherents choose to embody or identify with".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=89}} Monette also suggested that this absence of a centralised structure would aid the Order's survival, because its fate would not be invested solely in one particular leader.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=92}} The ONA dislikes the term "member", instead favouring the word "associate".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=89}} In 2012, Long stated that those affiliated with the Order fell into six different categories: associates of traditional nexions, Niners, Balobians, gang and tribe members, followers of the Rounwytha tradition, and those involved with ONA-inspired groups.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}}

The group largely consists of autonomous [[Covert cell|cells]] known as "nexions".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}}&lt;ref name="lapisphilosophicus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lapisphilosophicus.wordpress.com/about-2/ona-faq/ |title=ONA: Frequently Asked Questions |website=The Order of Nine Angles – Labyrinthos Mythologicus |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bics0bdy?url=https://lapisphilosophicus.wordpress.com/about-2/ona-faq/ |archivedate=2015-09-21 |access-date=2013-05-26 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original cell, based in Shropshire, is known as "Nexion Zero", with the majority of subsequent groups having been established in Britain, Ireland, and Germany, however nexions and other associated groups have also been established in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Serbia, Russia and South Africa.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=88}} Some of these groups, such as the U.S.-based Tempel ov Blood, describe themselves as being distinct from the ONA while both having been greatly influenced by it and having connections to it.{{sfn|Monette|2013|pp=89, 90}}

In the ONA's terminology, the terms Drecc and Niner refer to folk-based or gang-based culture or individuals who support the Order's aims by practical (including criminal) means rather than esoteric ones.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=89}} One such group is the White Star Acception, who claim to have perpetrated rapes, assaults, and robberies in order to advance the group's power; Sieg noted that the reality of these actions has not been verified.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|pp=270&amp;ndash;271}}
A Balobian is an artist or musician who contributes to the group through their production of [[fine art]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=89}} The Rounwytha is a tradition of folk-mystics deemed to exhibit gifted [[psychic]] powers reflecting their embodiment of the "sinister feminine archetype". Although a minority are men, most Rounwytha are female, and they often live reclusively as part of small and often lesbian groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1pp=88, 89, 114&amp;ndash;115|2a1=Sieg|2y=2013|2p=267}}

===Outer representative===

Several academic commentators have highlighted the existence of a position within the ONA called an "Outer Representative", who serves as an official spokesperson for the group to the outer world.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=93|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} The first to publicly claim to be the group's "Outer Representative" was Richard Moult, an artist and composer from Shropshire who used the pseudonym of "Christos Beest".{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=93|2a1=Senholt|2y=2013|2p=256}} Moult was followed as "Outer Representative" by "Vilnius Thornian", who held the position from 1996 to 2002,{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=93}} and who has been identified by ONA insiders as the Left Hand Path ideologue [[Michael Ford (Satanist)|Michael Ford]].{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=113}} Subsequently, on the blog of the White Star Acception, the claim was made that the group's member Chloe Ortega was the ONA's Outer Representative, also this blog later became defunct by 2013.{{sfn|Sieg|2013|p=272}} In 2013, a female American Rounwytha using the name of "Jall" appeared claiming to be the Order's "Outer Representative".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=93}}

However, according to Long the "outer representative" was "an interesting and instructive example of [the O9A's] Labyrinthos Mythologicus,&amp;nbsp;... a ploy,"&lt;ref name="our-kind"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/our-kind/|accessdate=2015-08-28|title=Those Who Are Our Kind|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922112140/https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/our-kind/|archivedate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which was designed to "intrigue, select, test, confuse, annoy, mislead".&lt;ref name="understanding-satanism"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/o9a-understanding-satanism-v2.pdf|accessdate=2015-08-28|title=Towards Understanding Satanism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long wrote that "the ploy was for a candidate or an initiate to openly disseminate ONA material, and possibly give interviews about the O9A to the Media, under the guise of having been given some sort of 'authority' to do so even though such an authority – and the necessary hierarchy to gift such authority – was in fact a contradiction of our raison d'être; a fact we of course expected those incipiently of our kind to know or sense."&lt;ref name="our-kind"/&gt; According to Senholt the ONA "does not award titles",{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=259}} with Monette writing that "there is no central authority within the ONA."{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=92}}

Within the ONA was a group of longstanding initiates known as the "Old Guard" or "Inner ONA",{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=92}}&lt;ref name="inner-o9a"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/inner-o9a/|accessdate=2015-09-04|title=The Inner ONA}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose experience with the tradition led to them becoming influential over newer members who often sought their advice.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=92}} Members of this Old Guard included Christos Beest, Sinister Moon, Dark Logos, and Pointy Hat,{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=92}} although in 2011 they stated that they would withdraw from the public sphere.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=93}}

===Membership===

[[File:Fenrir-o9a.png|thumb|right|250px|An issue of the ONA's original ''Fenrir'' magazine]]

While the ONA has stated that it is not an occult organization in the conventional sense but an esoteric philosophy,&lt;ref name="intellection"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/o9a/|accessdate=2015-09-09|title=In The Name Of The O9A|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225043447/http://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/o9a/|archivedate = 22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esoteric-philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/the-esoteric-philosophy-of-the-order-of-nine-angles/|accessdate=2015-09-09|title=The Esoteric Philosophy of the ONA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225051417/http://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/esoteric-philosophy/|archivedate = 22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; several academics have written about ONA membership. In a 1995 overview of British Satanist groups, Harvey suggested that the ONA consisted of less than ten members, "and perhaps fewer than five."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=292}} In 1998, Jeffrey Kaplan and Leonard Weinberg stated that the ONA's membership was "infinitesmally small", with the group acting primarily as a "mail-order ministry".{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} Regarding the question of membership, Anton Long, in a letter to Aquino dated October 1990, wrote that "once the techniques and the essence [of the ONA] are more widely available then membership as such is irrelevant, since everything is available and accessible&amp;nbsp;... with the individual taking responsibility for their own development, their own experiences."{{sfn|Long|1992a|p=11}}

In 2013 Senholt noted that because the group has no official membership, it is "difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the number of ONA members".{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=257}} Senholt suggested that a "rough estimate" of the "total number" of individuals involved with the ONA in some capacity from 1980 to 2009 was "a few thousand"; he had come to this conclusion from an examination of the number of magazines and journals about the subject circulated and the number of members of online discussion groups devoted to the ONA.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=257}} At the same time he thought that the number of "longtime adherents is much smaller."{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=257}} Also in 2013, Monette estimated that there were over two thousand ONA associates, broadly defined.{{sfnm|1a1=Monette|1y=2013|1p=89|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=359}} He believed that the gender balance was roughly equal, although with regional variation and differences among particular nexions.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=89}} Introvigne noted that if Monette's estimate was correct, it would mean that the ONA is "easily... the largest Satanist organization in the world".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=359}}

According to a recent survey, the ONA has more female supporters than either the Church of Satan or the Temple of Set; more women with children; more older supporters; more supporters who are better established in socio-economic terms; and more who politically are further to the Right.&lt;ref&gt;J.R Lewis: ''Satanic Attitudes'', in Asbjorn Dyrendal, James R. Lewis, Jesper A. Petersen (editors), ''The Invention of Satanism'', Oxford University Press, 2015. p.191; pp.&amp;nbsp;194–196. {{ISBN|978-0-19-518110-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
The ONA's main influence lies not with the group itself, but with its prolific release of written material.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2000|1p=236|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=293}} According to Senholt, "the ONA has produced more material on both the practical and theoretical aspects of magic, as well as more ideological texts on Satanism and the Left-Hand Path in general, than larger groups such as the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set has produced in combination [which] makes the ONA an important player in the theoretical discussion of what the Left-Hand Path and Satanism is and should be according to the practitioners".{{sfn|Senholt|2009|p=26}}

These writings were initially distributed to other Satanist and neo-Nazi groups, although with the development of the [[Internet]] this was also used as a medium to propagate its writings,{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=236}} with Monette expressing the view that they had attained "a sizable presence in occult cyberspace",{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=85}} and thus become "one of the most prominent Left Hand Path groups by virtue of its public presence".{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=107}} Many of these writings were then reproduced by other groups.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|p=143}} Kaplan considered the ONA to be "an important source of Satanic ideology/theology" for "the occultist fringe of National Socialism", namely neo-Nazi groups like the [[Black Order (Satanist group)|Black Order]].{{sfn|Kaplan|2000|p=235}} The group gained increased attention following the growth in public interest in Myatt's impact on terrorist groups during the [[War on Terror]] in the 2000s.{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=251}} The historian of esotericism Dave Evans stated that the ONA were "worthy of an entire PhD thesis",{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=374}} while Senholt expressed the view that it would be "potentially dangerous to ignore these fanatics, however limited their numbers might be".{{sfn|Senholt|2013|p=271}}

According to a report by the civil rights group the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] the ONA "holds an important position in the niche, international nexus of occult, esoteric, and/or satanic neo-Nazi groups."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Atomwaffen and the Siege Parallax|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/02/22/atomwaffen-and-siege-parallax-how-one-neo-nazi%E2%80%99s-life%E2%80%99s-work-fueling-younger-generation|website=SPLC Hatewatch|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=March 30, 2018|date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Jack Nightingale'' series of novels by [[Stephen Leather]], a Satanic "Order of Nine Angles" are the leading antagonists.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=107}} Similarly, a fictionalised Satanic group named the "Order of Nine Angels" appear in Conrad Jones' 2013 novel ''Child for the Devil''.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Jones. ''Child for the Devil''. Thames River Press. 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-85728-007-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another of his novels, ''Black Angel'', Jones included a page titled "Additional Information" giving a warning about the Order of Nine Angles.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Jones. ''Black Angel''. Andrews UK Limited. 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-78333-334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ONA influence extends to some [[black metal]] bands such as Hvile I Kaos, who performed at the Blacklight District Lounge in Long Beach, California during May 2018 and who, according to a report in the music section of [[LA Weekly]], "attribute their purpose and themes to the philosophies of the Order of Nine Angles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchestral, Occult-Driven Hvile I Kaos Reinvent Black Metal|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/orchestral-occult-driven-hvile-i-kaos-reinvent-black-metal-9417957|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=May 16, 2018|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performance studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[Performance (disambiguation)|performance]] and uses performance as a lens to study the world. The term 'performance' is broad, and can include artistic and aesthetic performances like concerts, theatrical events, and [[performance art]]; sporting events; social, political and religious events like rituals, ceremonies, proclamations and public decisions; certain kinds of language use; and those components of identity which require someone to do, rather than just be, something. Consequently, performance studies is interdisciplinary, drawing from theories of the performing arts, anthropology and sociology, literary theory, and legal studies.

Performance Studies has been challenged as an emerging discipline. Many academics have been critical of its instability. As an academic field it is difficult to pin down; either that is the nature of the field itself or it is still too young to tell. There are, however, numerous degree-granting programs that train researchers being offered by universities. Some have referred to it as an "inter discipline" or a "post discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, Richard. "Foreword: Fundamentals of Performance Studies," Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer, eds., ''Teaching Performance Studies,'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002. P.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance Studies tends to concentrate on a mix of research methods. The application of practice-led or practice-based research methods has become a widespread phenomenon not just in the anglophone world. As such research projects integrate established methods like literature research and oral history with performance practice, i.e. artistic autoethnographic approaches and verbatim theatre. The documentation of ''Practice-as-Research in Performance'' (PARIP), a devoted research project conducted at the University of Bristol between 2001 and 2006, offers a number of inspiring articles and portraits of such research projects and was key for a breakthrough of using creative thinking within this subject field.&lt;ref&gt;Allegue, L., Jones, S., Kershaw, B., &amp; Piccini, A. (2009). Practice-as-Research in performance and screen. Basingstoke.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and basic concepts==

Richard Schechner author of ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' states that Performance studies examine performances in two categories: Artistic and Cultural Performances. A. Artistic Performance are marked and understood as art. solo-performance, performance art, performance of literature, theatrical storytelling, plays, and performance poetry, This category considers performance as the art form. B. Cultural Performance includes events that occur in everyday life in which a culture values are displayed for their perpetuation: rituals such as parades, religious ceremonies, community festivals, controversial storytelling, and performances of social and professional roles, and individual performances of race, gender, sexuality and class. 

===Theatre and anthropology===
Performance Studies as an academic field has multiple origin narratives. On the theatrical and anthropological front, this origin is often regarded as the research collaborations of director [[Richard Schechner]] and anthropologist [[Victor Turner]]. This origin narrative emphasizes a definition of performance as being "between theatre and anthropology" and often stresses the importance of [[intercultural]] performances as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldwork. [[Dwight Conquergood]] developed a branch of performance ethnography that centered the political nature of the practice and advocated for methodological dialogism from the point of encounter to the practices of research reporting. [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] has contributed an interest in tourist productions and ethnographic showmanship to the field, Judd Case has adapted performance to the study of media and religion,&lt;ref&gt;Case, J. A. "Sounds from the Center: Liriel's Performance and Ritual Pilgrimage" ''Journal of Media &amp; Religion'', October 2009, 209–225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]] has brought a hemispheric perspective on Latin American performance and theorized the relationship between the [[archive]] and the performance repertoire, while Corinne Kratz developed a mode of performance analysis that emphasizes the role of multimedia communication in performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kratz, Corinne A. ''Affecting Performance: Meaning, Movement and Experience in Okiek Women's Initiation'', Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994 (new edition, Wheatmark 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Frederik argues for the importance of ethnographic research and a solid theoretical base in anthropological perspective.

===Literature===
On the literature front, Wallace Bacon (1914–2001), considered by many to be the father of performance theory, taught the performance of literature as the ultimate act of humility. In his defining statement of performance theory, "Our center is in the interaction between readers and texts which enriches, extends, clarifies, and (yes) alters the interior and even the exterior lives of students [and performers and audiences] through the power of texts" (''Literature in Performance'', Vol 5 No 1, 1984; p.&amp;nbsp;84). In addition, Robert Breen's text ''[[Chamber theatre|Chamber Theatre]]'' is a cornerstone in the field for staging narrative texts, though it remains controversial in its assertions about the place of narrative details in chamber productions. Breen is also regarded by many as a founding theorist for the discipline, along with advocate Louise Rosenblatt. More recently, performance theorist and novelist [[Barbara Browning]] has suggested that narrative fiction itself—and particularly the novel—demands the performative participation of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Browning|first1=Barbara|title='Dear Reader': The Novel's Call to Perform|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1m4uWyRjvo|website=YouTube|publisher=The Book Lovers|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speech-act theory and 'performatives'===
An alternative origin narrative stresses the development of [[J.L. Austin|speech-act theory]] by philosophers [[J.L. Austin]] and [[Judith Butler]], literary critic [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], and also [[Shoshana Felman]]. The theory proposed by Austin in ''How To Do Things With Words''  states that "to say something ''is to do something'', or ''in'' saying something we do something, and even ''by'' saying something we do something".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 94&lt;/ref&gt; the most illustrative example being "I do", as part of a marriage ceremony. For any of these performative utterances to be felicitous, per Austin, they must be true, appropriate and conventional according to those with the proper authority: a priest, a judge, or the scholar, for instance. Austin accounts for the infelicitous by noting that "there will always occur difficult or marginal cases where nothing in the previous history of a conventional procedure will decide conclusively whether such a procedure is or is not correctly applied to such a case".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of failure in performatives (utterances made with language and the body) is taken up by Butler and is understood as the "political promise of the performative".&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. ''[[Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative]].'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Her argument is that because the performative needs to maintain conventional power, convention itself has to be reiterated, and in this reiteration it can be expropriated by the unauthorized usage and thus create new futures. She cites Rosa Parks as an example:&lt;blockquote&gt;
When [[Rosa Parks]] sat in the front of the bus, she had no prior right to do so guaranteed by any…conventions of the South. And yet, in laying claim to the right for which she had no prior authorization, she endowed a certain authority on the act, and began the insurrectionary process of overthrowing those established codes of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative.'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 147&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question of the infelicitous  utterance (the misfire)is also taken up by Shoshana Felman when she states "Infelicity, or failure, is not for Austin an accident of the performative, it is inherent in it, essential to it. In other words…Austin conceives of failure not as external but as internal to the promise, as what actually constitutes it."&lt;ref&gt;Felman, Shoshana ''Scandal of the Speaking Body: Don Juan with J.L. Austin, or Seduction in Two Languages'' P. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance studies has also had a strong relationship to the fields of feminism, [[psychoanalysis]], critical race theory and [[queer theory]]. Theorists like [[Peggy Phelan]],&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, Peggy. ''Unmarked: The Politics of Performance''. London; New York: Routledge, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Esteban Muñoz]],&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban. ''Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics''. University of Minnesota Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. Patrick Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Patrick Johnson. Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity. Duke University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Schneider,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Rebecca. ''The Explicit Body in Performance''. London ; New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[André Lepecki]] have been equally influential in both performance studies and these related fields.

==Academic programs==
Performance studies incorporates theories of [[drama]], [[dance]], [[art]], [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[philosophy]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[comparative literature]], [[communication studies]], and increasingly, music performance.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.
Nicholas Cook and Richard Pettengill (eds.), "Taking It to the Bridge. Music as Performance", University of Michigan Press, 2013; Nicholas Cook, "Between Process and Product: Music and/as Performance", in: [http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.01.7.2/mto.01.7.2.cook.html "The Online Journal of the Society for Music Theory", Vol. 7, No. 2, April 2001]; Philip Auslander, "Music as Performance: Living in the Immaterial World," in: [http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/Auslander-Immaterial.pdf "Theatre Survey", Vol. 47, No. 4, Fall 2006]"; Melanie Fritsch and Stefan Strötgen, "Relatively Live: How to Identify Live Music Performances", in: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.5406/musimoviimag.5.1.0047?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103032208791 "Music and the Moving Image", Vol. 5 No. 1, 2012 (March), p. 47–66.]&lt;/ref&gt; More can be found out by reading Schechner's book: ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' or in D. Soyini Madison and Judith Hamera's The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, D. Soyini and Judith Hamera, eds. The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies. SAGE 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance studies department was created at [[New York University|NYU]]. However, there is some debate that the joint-cradles of Performance Studies are [[Northwestern University]] and NYU. For more information on the different origins and disciplinary traditions of performance studies see Shannon Jackson's book ''Professing Performance'' and the introductory chapter in Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer's ''Teaching Performance Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky, Nathan and Cynthia Wimmer, eds. ''Teaching Performance Studies.'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the differences between the NYU and Northwestern models cite different disciplinary concerns. NYU is generally characterized as a program that pushed the definitions of theatrical practice influenced by the thearical avant-garde thus expanding its definition of what can be framed as an event. Interaction with departments that include [[New York University|NYU]]'s Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy have made this an ongoing pursuit. Northwestern transitioned from an elocution and performance of literature tradition to expand its definition of presentational aesthetics beyond oral interpretation. Northwestern's unique brand of performance studies has its origins in [[anthropology]], having been started by the ethnographer [[Dwight Conquergood]] with the goal of understanding all manner of local cultures through their performance practices. In both instances a focus on practice lead to a research methodology beyond theatre or literature/speech. In the United States, the interdisciplinary and multi-focus field has spread to [[Brown University|Brown]], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]], University of Northern Iowa, [[University of California at Irvine|UCI]],  [[University of California at Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], and elsewhere. Undergraduate and graduate programs are offered at [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/graduate-programs/performance-public-practice The University of Texas at Austin], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s [http://www.wacd.ucla.edu/ Culture and Performance Program], [http://performancestudies.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis], [http://drama.arts.uci.edu/graduate-programs/phd/phd-program/ UC Irvine], [[Kennesaw State University]], [[Louisiana State University]], [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[San Jose State University]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Maryland]], the [[University of North Carolina Chapel Hill]], and [https://pad.artsci.wustl.edu/amprogram Washington University in St. Louis]. [[Texas A&amp;M University]]'s [http://performancestudies.tamu.edu/ Department of Performance Studies] is unique in including both Music and Theatre degree programs.

In the United Kingdom [[Aberystwyth University]] offers a degree scheme in performance studies with highly acclaimed performance artists such as Mike Pearson, Heike Roms and Jill Greenhalgh. The [[University of Roehampton]] in London offers a BA in Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies. [[Richmond University]], London also offers a BA in Performance and Theatre Arts. The University of Plymouth has offered a BA in Theatre &amp; Performance since the early 1990s; its postgraduate research programme (ResM and MPhil/PhD) specialises in performance studies. The [[University of Warwick]] also offers a BA in Theatre and Performance Studies, in addition to leading Postgraduate programmes.

In Denmark [[Roskilde University]] offers a master and ph.d. degree in "performance design", focusing on subjects such as theatrical performances, live music, festivals, and urban performances.

In Germany [[University of Hamburg]] offers a master program in performance studies at the centre for performance studies run by [[Gabriele Klein]]. The Centre for Performance Studies at the [[University of Bremen]] offers a certificate in performance studies focussing on the combination of academic and artistic research within performance projects.

In India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] offers MPhil and PhD program in Theatre &amp; Performance Studies at the School of Arts &amp; Aesthetics. Since 2012, School of Culture and Creative Expressions, [[Ambedkar University Delhi]], started a MA program in Performance Studies, which focus on redefining methodologies of cultural studies and research on the basis of the nuances of performance studies. It is formulating the first Practice based PhD in the country and working extensively in the realm of Practice-as-Research. On the similar lines, the Centre for Performance Research and Cultural Studies in South Asia (CPRACSIS), Kerala have organised series of workshops and seminars over the last few years to engage scholars, artists and practitioners in conversation informed by Performance Studies.

In Australia, the [[University of Sydney]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] and [[Queensland University of Technology]] offer degrees majoring in performance studies, Honours, Masters and Phd. Performance Studies in some countries is also an A-level (AS and A2) course consisting of the integration of the discrete art forms of Dance, Music and Drama in performing arts.

In Brazil, The [[Universidade Federal de Goiás]], started an interdisciplinary program (masters) in Performances Culturais (Cultural Performances) in 2012, the first in a Latin country. The goal of this program is to analyze "rituals, games, performances, drama, dance" from a cross-cultural point of view.

'''Project NEXUS''' is a [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) grant funded project based at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] and headed by [[Principal investigator|Principal Investigator]] Dr. J. Randy McGinnis. Its purpose is to investigate an innovative model of teacher preparation.

Originally a collaboration among [[University of Maryland, College Park]] (UM), (a large, primarily majority population university); [[Bowie State University]] (BSU), Maryland (a smaller, [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities|historically black university]]); and [[Hands On Science Outreach, Inc.]] (a national organization developing and administering informal science education classes for children), it has evolved into a collaborative with [[Coppin State University]] (CSU), (Maryland) and available informal science education internships. The award was made in 2005 and ran until 2012.

The key assumption was that science educational practices require systemic reform within the undergraduate science subject matter and education classes, prospective teachers’ field-based experiences, and professional development during new teachers induction years (NSF, 1993;&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, "Proceedings of the National Science Foundation workshop on the role of faculty from  the scientific disciplines in the undergraduate education of future science and mathematics teachers." (Author, Washington, DC 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; NRC, 1997;&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, "Improving teacher preparation and credentialling consistent with the National Science Education Standards."

'''Purism''', referring to the arts, was a movement that took place between 1918 and 1925 that influenced French painting and architecture. Purism was led by [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier|Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier)]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created a variation of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement and called it Purism: where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. The main concepts were presented in their book ''Après le Cubisme'' (After Cubism) published in 1918.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Susan|title=Ozenfant and Purism: The Evolution of a Style 1915–1930|year=1981|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/purism Purism, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post World War I==
[[File:Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte, oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|right|Le Corbusier, 1921, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]]]]
Le Corbusier and Ozenfant were the creators of Purism. [[Fernand Léger]] was a principle associate.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; Purism was an attempt to restore regularity in a war-torn France post World War I.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt; Unlike what they saw as 'decorative' fragmentation of objects in Cubism, Purism proposed a style of painting where elements were represented as robust simplified forms with minimal detail, while embracing technology and the machine.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

Purism culminated in Le Corbusier’s ''Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau'' (Pavilion of the New Spirit), constructed for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925. This included the work of Cubists [[Juan Gris]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]]. Following this exhibition the relationship between Le Corbusier and Ozenfant declined.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

==L'Esprit Nouveau==

Ozenfant and Le Corbusier contributed extensively to an art magazine called ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' from 1920 to 1925 serving as a platform for propaganda towards their Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliel, Carol S. et al.

==Purist Manifesto==
The Purist Manifesto lays out the rules Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created to govern the Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

* Purism does not intend to be a scientific art, which it is in no sense.
* Cubism has become a decorative art of romantic ornamentism.
* There is a hierarchy in the arts: decorative art is at the base, the human figure at the summit.
* Painting is as good as the intrinsic qualities of its plastic elements, not their representative or narrative possibilities.
* Purism wants to conceive clearly, execute loyally, exactly without deceits; it abandons troubled conceptions, summary or bristling executions. A serious art must banish all techniques not faithful to the real value of the conception.
* Art consists in the conception before anything else.
* Technique is only a tool, humbly at the service of the conception.
* Purism fears the bizarre and the ''original''. It seeks the pure element in order to reconstruct organized paintings that seem to be facts from nature herself. 
* The method must be sure enough not to hinder the conception.
* Purism does not believe that returning to nature signifies the copying of nature.
* It admits all deformation is justified by the search for the invariant.
* All liberties are accepted in art except those that are unclear.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67280">{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of law''' (or '''legal sociology''') is often described as a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] or an interdisciplinary approach within [[jurisprudence|legal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For various definitions of the sociology of law,see Ehrlich 1936 (orig 1912); Timasheff 1939; Pound 1943; Selznick 1965, Aubert 1969 and 1980, Black 1972, Stjernquist 1983, Hydén 1986, Tomasic 1987, Ferrari 1989, Podgorecki 1991, Cotterrell 1992, Banakar 2003 and 2011; Mathiesen 2005, Deflem 2008, Travers 2009, Nelken 2009, Scuro 2010, Banakar and Travers 2013, Banakar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see sociology of law as belonging "necessarily" to the field of sociology,&lt;ref&gt;See Deflem 2008:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others tend to consider it a field of research caught up between the disciplines of [[law]] and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003 and 2009, Banakar and Travers 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others regard it neither a subdiscipline of sociology nor a branch of legal studies but as a field of research on its own right within the broader social science tradition. Accordingly, it may be described without reference to mainstream sociology as "the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as a set of social practices or as an aspect or field of social experience".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as treating law and justice as fundamental institutions of the basic structure of society mediating "between political and economic interests, between culture and the normative order of society, establishing and maintaining interdependence, and constituting themselves as sources of consensus, coercion and social control".&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrespective of whether sociology of law is defined as a sub-discipline of sociology, an approach within legal studies or a field of research in its own right, it remains intellectually dependent mainly on the traditions, methods and theories of mainstream [[sociology]] and, to a lesser extent, on other [[social sciences]] such as [[social anthropology]], [[political science]], [[social policy]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. As such, it reflects social theories and employs social scientific methods to study [[law]], [[legal institutions]] and legal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Travers 2005, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, sociology of law consists of various approaches to the study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976; Cotterrell 1992; Hunt 1993; Santos 2002; Banakar 2003; Banakar and Travers 2002; Ferrari 1989; Luhmann 1985; Trevino 2008; Travers 2009, Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of legal institutions, forms of [[social control]], legal [[regulation]], the interaction between [[legal culture]]s, the social construction of legal issues, [[legal profession]] and the relation between law and [[social change]].

Sociology of law also benefits from and occasionally draws on research conducted within other fields such as [[comparative law]], [[critical legal studies]], [[jurisprudence]], [[legal theory]], [[law and economics]] and [[law and literature]]. Its object encompasses the historical movement of law and justice and their relentless contemporary construction such as in the field of jurisprudence focused on institutional questions conditioned by social and political situations, in interdisciplinary dominions such as criminology and through analysis of the economic efficiency and the social impact of legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual origins==
[[File:Veber.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Max Weber]]]]
The roots of the sociology of law can be traced back to the works of sociologists and jurists of the turn of the previous century. The relationship between law and society was sociologically explored in the seminal works of both [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]]. The writings on law by these classical sociologists are foundational to the entire sociology of law today.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other scholars, mainly jurists, also employed social scientific theories and methods in an attempt to develop sociological theories of law. Notably among these were [[Leon Petrazycki]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]].

For [[Max Weber]], a so-called "legal rational form" as a type of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a [[rational-legal authority]]. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on Weber's typology see Kronman 1983: 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with [[restitution]] and [[damages|compensation]] grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies in which there is a high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of [[Durkheim|Durkheim's]] sociology of law see Cotterrell 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law'', [[Eugen Ehrlich]] developed a sociological approach to the study of law by focusing on how social networks and groups organized social life.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich 1936 (orig. 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the relationship between law and general social norms and distinguished between "positive law," consisting of the compulsive norms of state requiring official enforcement, and "living law," consisting of the rules of conduct that people in fact obeyed and which dominated social life. The latter emerged spontaneously as people interacted with each other to form social associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegert 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The centre of gravity of legal development therefore from time immemorial has not lain in the activity of the state, but in society itself, and must be sought there at the present time".|Eugen Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, 1936: 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was subjected to criticism by the advocates of legal positivism such as the jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] for its distinction between "law created by the state and law produced by the organisational imperatives of non-state social associations".&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelsen, Ehrlich had confused ''Sein'' ("is") and ''Sollen'' ("ought").&lt;ref&gt;For a presentation of this debate and references to the original sources of the debate see van Klink 2006. For an analysis of the debate between Kelsen and Ehrlich see Banakar 2008. Banakar argues that Kelsen could not help but miss the point that Ehrlich was making by his distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109&lt;br&gt;* Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Leon Petrazycki]]]]
[[Leon Petrazycki]] distinguished between forms of "official law," supported by the state, and "intuitive law," consisting of legal experiences that, in turn, consist of a complex of psychic processes in the mind of the individual with no reference to outside authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrazycki1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrazycki's work addressed sociological problems and his method was empirical, since he maintained that one could gain knowledge of objects or relationships only by observation. However, he couched his theory in the language of cognitive psychology and moral philosophy rather than sociology. Consequently, his contribution to the development of sociology of law remains largely unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2006; also see Podgórecki 1980; Kurczewski 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Petrazycki's "intuitive law" influenced not only the development of Georges Gurvitch's concept of "social law" (see below), which in turn has left its mark on socio-legal theorising, but also the work of later socio-legal scholars. Among those who were directly inspired by Petrazycki's work is the Polish legal sociologist [[Adam Podgórecki]].&lt;ref&gt;See Podgórecki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Geiger]] developed a close-knit analysis of the Marxist theory of law. He highlighted how law becomes a "factor in social transformation in democratic societies of the kind that are governed by the consent expressed by universal suffrage of the population practised at regular intervals".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger went on to develop the salient characteristics of his antimetaphysical thinking, until he exceeded it with practical [[nihilism]]. Geiger's nihilism of values paved the way for a form of [[legal nihilism]], which encourages the construction of a sober democracy "that is capable of raising conflict to the intellectual level and of anaesthetising feelings, as it is aware of its own inability to make any proclamation of value, ethics or policy about the nature of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Gurvitch]] was interested in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction. His aim was to devise the concept of "social law" as a law of integration and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;see Gurvitch, Georges, ''L'idée du droit social'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Gurvitch's social law was an integral part of his general sociology. "It is also one of the early sociological contributions to the theory of legal pluralism, since it challenged all conceptions of law based on a single source of legal, political, or moral authority".&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the sociology of law had an early reception in Argentina. As a local movement of legal scholars steeming from the work of Carlos Cossio, South American researchers have focused on comparative law and sociological insights, constitutional law and society, human rights, and psycho-social approaches to the legal practices.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Lista, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological approaches to the study of law==

===Modern sociology of law===
The sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the emergence of the "sociological movement" in law after World War II see Deflem 2009: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of [[Talcott Parsons]], for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Cotterrell 1992: 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as [[Philip Selznick]], argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Selznik, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]], developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of [[pure sociology]]. Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the [[autopoietic system]]s theory of the German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]], who presents law or "the legal system" as one of the ten ''function systems'' (see [[Differentiation (sociology)|functional differentiation]]) of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Luhmann 2004 and 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth and Schutz 2015"&gt;[[Steffen Roth]] and Anton Schutz: ''Ten systems. Toward a canon of function systems.'' In: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing'', Vol. 22, No. 4., 2015. Vorversion verfügbar (englisch; [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508950 online] auf ssrn.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|All collective human life is directly or indirectly shaped by law. Law is like knowledge, an essential and all-pervasive fact of the social condition.|Niklas Luhmann, ''A Sociological Theory of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, 1985: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] disagrees with Luhmann and argues that the law can do a better job as a 'system' institution' by representing more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional ''habitus'' of the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his associates (often influenced by [[Petrazycki]]'s ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by [[Per Stjernquist]], and in Norway by [[Vilhelm Aubert]].

In more recent years, a very wide range of theories has emerged in the sociology of law as a result of the proliferation of theories in sociology at large. Among the recent influences can be mentioned the work of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]], [[neo-Marxism]], and [[behaviorism]]. The variety of theoretical influences in the sociology of law has also marked the broader law and society field. The multi-disciplinary law and society field remains very popular, while the disciplinary speciality field of the sociology of law is also "better organized than ever in institutional and professional respects".&lt;ref&gt;Deflem 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Society===
Law and Society is an American movement, which was established after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had a vested interest in the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by [[Lawrence Friedman]]: "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986:780.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders believed that the "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods".&lt;ref&gt;Austin et al, 1998:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Law and Society Association]] in 1964 and of the ''Law and Society Review'' in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.&lt;ref&gt;See Munger 1998 and Simon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one view, the main difference between the sociology of law and Law and Society is that the latter does not limit itself theoretically or methodologically to sociology and tries instead to accommodate insights from all social science disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an example see Friedman 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; "Not only does it provides a home for sociologists and social anthropologists and political scientists with an interest in law, it also tries to incorporate psychologists and economists who study law."&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From another point of view, both sociology of law and Law and Society should be seen as multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary enterprises although sociology of law has special ties to the methods, theories and traditions of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s a number of original empirical studies were conducted by Law and Society scholars on conflict and dispute resolution. In his early work, [[Bill Felstiner|William Felstiner]], for example, focused on alternative ways to solve conflicts (avoidance, mediation, litigation etc.). Together with [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]] and [[Austin Sarat]], Felstiner developed the idea of a disputes pyramid and the formula "naming, blaming, claiming", which refers to different stages of conflict resolution and levels of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;"See, Felstiner, Abel and Sarat 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological jurisprudence===
The sociology of law is often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some of the debates within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faigman|first=David L.|title=Laboratory of Justice: The Supreme Court's 200-Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Henry Holt |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Roscoe. "Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence." ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 24 (1910): 591. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid E. Rumble, Jr., "Legal Realism, Sociological Jurisprudence and Mr. Justice Holmes," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1965) 26#4 pp. 547-566 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708499 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and the Russian-French sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinguishing between different branches of the social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse the development of the sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful for the development of the field as whole. For the social scientific studies of law to transcend the theoretical and empirical limits, which currently define their scope, they need to go beyond such artificial distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-legal studies==
'Socio-legal studies' in the UK has grown mainly out of the interest of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a methodological approach, it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not, therefore, be confused with the legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services'&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that it "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001: 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include [[Carol Smart|Professor Carol Smart]], co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building#External links|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]], (named after the sociologist, [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]]), as well as [[Mavis Maclean|Professor Mavis Maclean]] and [[John Eekelaar]] who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP).

'''Socio-legal methods of investigation'''

The sociology of law has no methods of investigation which have been developed specifically for conducting socio-legal research. Instead, it employs a wide variety of social scientific methods, including qualitative and quantitative research techniques, to explore law and legal phenomena. Positivistic&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interpretive (such as discourse analysis) and ethnographic&lt;ref&gt;See Travers 1997, Flood 2005 and 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; approaches to data collection and analysis is used within the socio-legal field.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of various methods see Banakar and Travers 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of law in Britain==
Sociology of law was a small, but developing, sub-field of British sociology and legal scholarship at the time when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.

'''Symbolic interactionism and Marxism'''

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionism]] had become popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a politically radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing society as a system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Becker 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused on the process of law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paterson 1982; Flood 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential sociological approach during this period was, however, Marxism—which claimed to offer a scientific and comprehensive understanding of society as a whole in the same way as structural-functionalism, although with the emphasis on the struggle between different groups for material advantage, rather than value-consensus. This approach caught the imagination of many people with left-wing political views in law schools, but it also generated some interesting empirical studies. These included historical studies about how particular
statutes were used to advance the interests of dominant economic groups, and also Pat Carlen's memorable ethnography,&lt;ref&gt;Pat Carlen 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined analytic resources from Marxism and interactionism, especially the sociology of Erving Goffman, in writing about magistrates' courts.

'''The Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies'''

The 1980s were also a fruitful time for empirical sociology of law in Britain, mainly
because Donald Harris deliberately set out to create the conditions for a fruitful
exchange between lawyers and sociologists at the [[University of Oxford]] Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was fortunate enough to recruit a number of young and
talented social scientists, including J. Maxwell Atkinson and Robert Dingwall who were interested in ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociology
of the professions, and Doreen McBarnet who became something of a cult figure on the left after publishing her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Doreen McBarnet 1981&lt;/ref&gt; which advanced a particularly clear and vigorous Marxist analysis of the criminal justice system. Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches have a lot in common when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a sociologist at the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Drew, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest developed at Oxford during this period was the sociology of the professions. Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; edited what remains an interesting and theoretically diverse collection, bringing together specialists from the sociology of law and medicine. The best known study to date has, however, been published by the American scholar [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;Abel 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who employed ideas and concepts from functionalist, Marxist, and Weberian
sociology to explain the high incomes and status that British lawyers enjoyed for most of the twentieth century.

'''Recent developments'''

Since the 1980s, relatively few empirical studies of law and legal institutions have been conducted by British sociologists, i.e. studies which are empirical and at the same time engage with the theoretical concerns of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some exceptions. To begin with, sociology of law, along with so many areas of academic work, has been enlivened and renewed through engagement with feminism. There has been a great deal of
interest in the implications of Foucault's ideas on governmentality for understanding
law,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Wickham 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and also in continental thinkers such as Niklas Luhmann and Pierre Bourdieu. Again, one can argue that rather fewer empirical studies have been produced than one might have hoped, but a great deal of interesting work has been published.

A second exception is to be found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1997; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.

Despite the relatively limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law have been important in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from [[David Nelken]] exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and the potential of the idea of legal cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2004; 2007; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cotterrell]] seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars, such as [[David Schiff]] and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory and the extent to which law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social.&lt;ref&gt;Nobles and Schiff 2006; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.

==Devising a sociological concept of law==
In contrast to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on [[law]]), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The rule-based aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009; Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, legal sociology regards law as a set of institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar and Travers 2005 and Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example [[Eugen Ehrlich]]'s concept of "living law" and [[Georges Gurvitch]]'s "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of legal pluralism see Dalberg-Larsen 2000; Merry 1988; Chiba 1989; John Griffiths 1986; Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western sociology of law==

The interest in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Deva, 2005; Baxi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but we find only a limited amount of socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier overview of the field, see Ferrari, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the disparity between Western and non-Western sociology of law see Banakar 2011 at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary perspectives==

===Legal pluralism===
[[Legal pluralism]] is a concept developed by legal sociologists and social anthropologists "to describe multiple layers of law, usually with different sources of legitimacy, that exist within a single state or society".&lt;ref&gt;Olgiati 2007; also see Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also defined "as a situation in which two or more legal systems coexist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Engle Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralists define law broadly to include not only the system of courts and judges backed by the coercive power of the state, but also the "non-legal forms of normative ordering".&lt;ref&gt;Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralism consists of many different methodological approaches and as a concept, it embraces "diverse and often contested perspectives on law, ranging from the recognition of different legal orders within the nation-state, to a more far reaching and open-ended concept of law that does not necessarily depend on state recognition for validity. This latter concept of law may come into being whenever two or more legal systems exist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The ideology of legal positivism has had such a powerful hold on the imagination of lawyers and social scientists that its picture of the legal world has been able successfully to masquerade as fact and has formed the foundation stone of social and legal theory.|John Griffiths, "What is Legal Pluralism"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, 1986:5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal pluralism has occupied a central position in socio-legal theorising from the very beginning of the sociology of law. The sociological theories of [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]] were early sociological contributions to legal pluralism. It has, moreover, provided the most enduring topic of socio-legal debate over many decades within both the sociology of law and legal anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and has received more than its share of criticism from the proponents of the various schools of [[legal positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Tamanaha 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics often ask: "How is law distinguished in a pluralist view from other normative systems? What makes a social rule system legal?".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy arises mainly "from the claim that the only true law is the law made and enforced by the modern state".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This standpoint is also known as "legal centralism". From a legal centralist standpoint, John Griffiths writes, "law is and should be the law of the state, uniform for all persons, exclusive of all other law, and administrated by a single set of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to legal centralism, "customary laws and religious laws are not properly called 'law' except in so far as state has chosen to adopt and treat any such normative order as part of its own law".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between the "weak" and the "strong" versions of legal pluralism. The "weak" version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of "legal centralism", but only recognises that within the domain of the Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths, 2002: 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "weak" version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…".&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha 1993: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong" version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion,"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter 1981: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism directed at legal pluralism often uses the basic assumptions of legal positivism to question the validity of theories of legal pluralism which aim at criticising those very (positivistic) assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roger Cotterrell]] explains, the pluralist conception should be understood as part of "the legal sociologist's effort to broaden perspectives on law. A legal sociologist's specification of law might be different from that presupposed by a lawyer in practice, but it will relate (indeed, in some way incorporate) the latter because it must (if it is to reflect legal experience) take account of lawyers' perspectives on law. Thus a pluralist approach in legal theory is likely to recognise what lawyers typically recognize as law, but may see this law as one species of a larger genus, or treat lawyers' conception of law as reflecting particular perspectives determined by particular objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopoiesis===
[[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] originally coined the concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by [[Niklas Luhmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ziegert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising a solution to the problem of the humanised 'subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most challenging idea incorporated in the theory of autopoiesis is that social systems should not be defined in terms of human agency or norms, but of communications. Communication is in turn the unity of utterance, information and understanding and constitutes social systems by recursively reproducing communication. This sociologically radical thesis, which raises the fear of a dehumanised theory of law and society, attempts to highlight the fact that social systems are constituted by communicative."&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Max Travers 2005: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Cotterrell]], "Luhmann... treats the theory as the basis for all general sociological analysis of social systems and their mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret whatever this research may discover."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cultures===
[[Legal culture]] is one of the central concepts of the sociology of law. The study of legal cultures may, at the same time, be regarded as one of the general approaches within the sociology of law.

As a concept, it refers to "relatively stable patterns of legally-oriented social behaviour and attitudes," and as such is regarded as a subcategory of the concept of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelken, 2004: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new concept which, according to [[David Nelken]], can be traced to "terms like legal tradition or legal style, which have a much longer history in comparative law or in early political science. It presupposes and invites us to explore the existence of systematic variations in patterns in 'law in the books' and 'law in action,' and, above all, in the relation between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an approach, it focuses on the cultural aspects of law, legal behaviour and legal institutions and, thus, has affinity with [[cultural anthropology]], legal pluralism, and [[comparative law]].

[[Lawrence M. Friedman]] is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 193. But for criticism of the vagueness of this and other formulations of the concept of legal culture in sociology of law, see Cotterrell, 2006, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.

===Feminism===
Law has always been regarded as one of the important sites of engagement for feminism. As pointed out by Ruth Fletcher feminist engagement with the law has taken many forms through the years, which also indicates their successful merging of theory and practice: "Through litigation, campaigns for reform and legal education, feminists have engaged explicitly with law and the legal profession. In taking on the provisions of specialist advice services, women's groups have played a role in making law accessible to those in need. By subjecting legal concepts and methods to critical analysis, feminists have questioned the terms of legal debate."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Globalization]] is often defined in terms of economic processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth&lt;ref&gt;Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkmar Gessner&lt;ref&gt;Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the relatively early empirical studies see Dezalay and Garth 1996. For a collection of empirical studies of law and globalization see Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pointed out by Halliday and Osinsky, "[[Economic globalization]] cannot be understood apart from global business regulation and the legal construction of the markets on which it increasingly depends. Cultural globalization cannot be explained without attention to intellectual property rights institutionalized in law and global governance regimes. The globalization of protections for vulnerable populations cannot be comprehended without tracing the impact of international criminal and humanitarian law or international tribunals. Global contestation over the institutions of democracy and state building cannot be meaningful unless considered in relation to constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday and Osinsk 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socio-legal approaches to the study of globalization and global society often overlap with, or make use of, studies of legal cultures and legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;See Teubner 1996; Feest and Nelken 2007, Friedman and Perez-Perdomo 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solidere s.a.l.''' is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[société anonyme libanaise|joint-stock company]] in charge of [[urban planning|planning and redeveloping]] [[Beirut Central District]] following the conclusion, in 1990, of the devastating [[Lebanese Civil War]]. By agreement with the government, Solidere enjoys special powers of [[eminent domain]] as well as a limited regulatory authority codified in law, making the company a unique form of [[public-private partnership]].

Solidere was founded on 5 May 1994 under the authority of the Council of Development and Reconstruction and following the vision of then-[[Prime Minister of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] [[Rafik Hariri]]. Solidere was incorporated as a privately owned company listed on the stock exchange. The name stands for ''Société Libanaise pour le Développement et la Reconstruction du Centre-ville de Beyrouth'', [[French language|French]] for "The Lebanese Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut Central District".

==Projects==
Solidere is widely credited as the most important force behind Beirut's reemergence, in recent years, as a bustling urban destination with a chance to earn back its prewar title of "Paris of the Middle East". Solidere's main functions are the supervision of the government-authorized reconstruction plan, financing and developing the [[infrastructure]], new construction and rehabilitation of war-torn structures, [[landscape architecture|urban landscaping]] and the management of property.&lt;ref name="YS"&gt;{{Cite book|edition=illustrated|publisher=Routledge| isbn=9780415411561|page=314|last=Elsheshtawy|first=Yasser|title=The evolving Arab city: tradition, modernity and urban development|series=Planning, history, and the environment series|accessdate=17 October 2009|year=2008|url= https://books.google.com/?id=BmsechJmz60C&amp;pg=PT97&amp;lpg=PT97&amp;dq=souk+al+tawileh#v=onepage&amp;q=tawileh&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solidere has worked to attract global retailers such as [[Virgin Megastores]] to Beirut Central District. Its most significant single project to date has been [[Beirut Souks]], a 100,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; retail center that was scheduled to open by 2008; it opened in 2009. Other projects that are central to the company's cultural strategy for the center are the [http://www.beirutexhibitioncenter.com/ Beirut Exhibition Center], add Saifi Village - Quartier des Arts, a residential neighbourhood with a high density of design shops and art galleries.

==Controversy and Challenges==

Solidere was founded after the government chose the framework of the public-private Real Estate Holding Company (REHCO) as the most viable option to reconstruct the central district, which was severely damaged and demolished, and emptied of its pre-war economic and demographic activity. Some research points out that the REHCO solution was the only viable option.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Economic Consultants. Feasibility Study for Beirut Central District. Beirut. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The practical nonexistence of a functional government after the war, and the near-impossibility to align all stakeholders, including property owners, into one unified and feasible vision, called for private resources to plan and execute a project of such scale and importance. Hariri's credibility as a business person and the speed and efficiency of submitting plans and investments models all played in favor of the REHCO model. It can be argued that without this large-scale intervention, the centre would have at best re-developed in a chaotic and uncoordinated manner, the way that other areas of the capital are experiencing.

The first axis of controversy relates to the mechanisms and masterplans of the reconstruction. Several opposition groups emerged to challenge the REHCO model and propose alternatives to it. Among those was a group of academics and urban planners who fueled a public debate about the goals and methods of reconstruction, especially the large-scale demolition and redesign, as outlined by an initial plan submitted by Dar Al Handassah.

A modified plan emerged and was evaluated by the Engineer's Union, but it never approved by the public before being sent to government.

The second axis of controversy relates to the mechanism of property expropriation, deemed forced and enabled by Capital's pressure on the government and Hariri's influence as prime minister and the valuation of property, deemed inappropriately low. By law, the company had six months to secure the necessary cash subscriptions to balance out the land value. Were it not for that conservative valuation of land, the whole project would have collapsed when the government had no alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;H. Schmid.

{{Citations broken|section|date=November 2017}}
Its shares are listed on the Beirut Stock Exchange, and its [[Global Depository Receipt]]s trade on the London Stock Exchange. Its share price on the Beirut exchange has risen sharply in recent years, from about US$5 in early 2004 to a high of $39 in September 2008. Between 1995 and 2015, Solidere has approved more than $1B in dividends to its shareholders.

Solidere's 36,000 shareholders are mostly Lebanese , in addition to Arab nationals, banks, and Arab or international funds. There are two categories of shares: '''A''' held by previous property owners and '''B''' by new investors. Rafik Hariri's share in the company has been a controversial subject in the Lebanese political spectrum. Some rumors say that he owned a majority stake in Solidere before his assassination in 2005, and the Hariri family continues to be a principal shareholder today. However, the Hariri family rejected those rumors, saying that he owned only 6% of the company's shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2006/07/verbal_clashes.php|title=Verbal clashes|website= Ya Libnan|date= July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Solidere prohibits any shareholder from acquiring more than 10% of the company's capital, either directly or indirectly.{{citation needed| date= November 2017}}

{{technical|date=October 2012}}
'''Spatial–temporal reasoning''' is an area of [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence]] which draws from the fields of [[computer science]], [[cognitive science]], and [[cognitive psychology]]. The theoretic goal—on the cognitive side—involves representing and reasoning spatial-temporal knowledge in mind. The applied goal—on the computing side—involves developing high-level control systems of robots for navigating and understanding time and space. 

== Influence from cognitive psychology ==
A convergent result in cognitive psychology is that the connection relation is the first spatial relation that human babies acquire, followed by understanding orientation relations and distance relations. Internal relations among the three kinds of spatial relations can be computationally and systematically explained within the theory of cognitive prism as follows: (1) the connection relation is primitive; (2) an orientation relation is a distance comparison relation: you being in front of me can be interpreted as you are nearer to my front side than my other sides; (3) a distance relation is connection relations using a third object: you being one meter away from me can be interpreted as an object with the maximum extension of one meter can be connected with you and me simultaneously. 

== Fragmentary representations of temporal calculi ==
Without addressing internal relations among spatial relations, AI researchers contributed many fragmentary representations. Examples of temporal calculi include [[Allen's interval algebra]], and Vilain's &amp; Kautz's [[point algebra]]. The most prominent spatial calculi are [[Mereotopology|mereotopological calculi]], [[Andrew U. Frank|Frank]]'s [[cardinal direction calculus]], Freksa's double cross calculus, Egenhofer and Franzosa's [[9-intersection calculus|4- and 9-intersection calculi]], Ligozat's [[flip-flop calculus]], various [[region connection calculus|region connection calculi]] (RCC), and the [[Oriented Point Relation Algebra]]. Recently, spatio-temporal calculi have been designed that combine spatial and temporal information. For example, the [[spatiotemporal constraint calculus]] (STCC) by Gerevini and Nebel combines Allen's interval algebra with RCC-8. Moreover, the [[qualitative trajectory calculus]] (QTC) allows for reasoning about moving objects.

== Quantitative abstraction ==
An emphasis in the literature has been on [[Qualitative reasoning|qualitative]] spatial-temporal reasoning which is based on qualitative abstractions of temporal and spatial aspects of the common-sense background knowledge on which our human perspective of physical reality is based.  Methodologically, qualitative [[Constraint satisfaction|constraint]] calculi restrict the vocabulary of rich mathematical theories dealing with temporal or spatial entities such that specific aspects of these theories can be treated within [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] fragments with simple qualitative (non-[[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]) languages. Contrary to mathematical or physical theories about space and time, qualitative constraint calculi allow for rather inexpensive reasoning about entities located in space and time.  For this reason, the limited expressiveness of qualitative representation formalism calculi is a benefit if such reasoning tasks need to be integrated in applications.  For example, some of these calculi may be implemented for handling spatial [[Geographic information system|GIS]] queries efficiently and some may be used for navigating, and communicating with, a mobile [[robot]].

== Relation algebra ==
Most of these calculi can be formalized as abstract [[relation algebra]]s, such that reasoning can be carried out at a symbolic level. For computing solutions of a [[constraint network]], the [[Local consistency#Path_consistency|path-consistency algorithm]] is an important tool.

== Software ==

'''The Fund for American Studies''' is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]] Founded in 1967, the organization's stated goal is "to change the world by developing leaders for a free society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=1912|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TFAS is a conservative organization specializing in the free market. It has professional associations with conservative organisations like the State Policy Network and Charles Koch Institute&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/professional-education/partner-organizations/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://spn.org/directory/&lt;/ref&gt; and receives regular donations.&lt;ref&gt;http://conservativetransparency.org/top/?recipient=848&amp;yr=&amp;yr1=1987&amp;yr2=2014&amp;submit=&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Fund for American Studies headquarters.JPG|thumb|The Fund for American Studies headquarters located in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In 1967, [[Charles Edison]] took the first steps toward establishing the institution that is known today as The Fund for American Studies. Edison was a former governor of New Jersey, Secretary of the Navy and son of inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]].

Concerned about an eroding confidence in the American system of government, Edison recruited [[Walter H. Judd]], David R. Jones, [[Marvin Liebman]], and [[William F. Buckley,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], to build a program that would educate college students about American government, politics, and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frohnen|first1=Bruce|last2=Beer|first2=Jeremy|last3=Jeffrey|first3=Nelson|title=American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia|date=2014|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=9781497651579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 1967, the group incorporated the Charles Edison Youth Fund. In 1969 Governor Edison died suddenly. To honor him and carry on his mission, the organization was renamed the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund. In 1985 the organization was renamed again to its present-day title, The Fund for American Studies. In the summer of 1970, the Edison Fund organized the inaugural Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems. Fifty-seven students attended the first Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messer-Davidow|first1=Ellen|title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse|date=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822383581|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Fund for American Studies sponsors 11 collegiate academic programs. Nine Institutes are held each summer in Washington, D.C., the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Hong Kong]]. A tenth Institute is held during the fall and spring semesters in Washington, D.C., and an eleventh Institute is held in [[Santiago, Chile]], in January. The institutes combine lectures, coursework, internships, evening lectures, and site briefings at key institutions of national government.

In addition to its summer and semester Institutes, TFAS sponsors other educational programs and conferences for professors and students throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs|url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=221|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engalitcheff Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems (ICPES) ===

Since it was established in 1970, over 4,000 students have attended ICPES. This Institute is intended primarily for students interested in careers in government, international affairs, public policy and academia. Students study the American political system and market economics and hold internships with places of political and economic interest such as [[Capitol Hill]], federal agencies, think tanks, political groups, or international affairs organizations.

The Institute was named in 1994 in honor of entrepreneur John Engalitcheff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Featured Supporter: John Engalitcheff|url=https://www.tfas.org/featured-supporter-john-engalitcheff|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Political Journalism (IPJ)===
IPJ was established in 1985 to educate future journalists about ethical reporting and covering issues involving economic concepts.

The competitive program accepts a limited number of undergraduate journalism students to attend the Institute each summer. Program participants attend classes in economics and ethics and intern with major news organizations. The students also attend events at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] and regular briefings at principal news sites such as Congress, the [[U.S. State Department]] and the Federal Reserve Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&amp;id=21|title=TFAS 2006 Annual Report Page 11|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Business and Government Affairs (IBGA)===

Established in 1990, IBGA explores the practical and theoretical questions surrounding the dynamic business-government relationship. Students examine the economic and political issues that shape how business and government interact as well as the importance of representing the interests of business before Congress. Accepted students earn course credit, intern with corporate governmental affairs office and trade associations and attend panel discussions with leaders in the profession.

The Institute was established in 1990 and was named in honor of [[Bryce Harlow]] until 2006 when it was renamed the Institute on Business and Government Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tfas.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=244|title=TFAS Website |accessdate=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Philanthropy and Voluntary Service (IPVS)===

IPVS was established in 1999 as an academic and internship program for college students involved in volunteer activities and interested in a professional career in the nonprofit sector.  The program curriculum includes service projects, an internship matched to the student’s interest and course credit.&lt;ref name="TFAS U.S. Programs Page"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=244&amp;srcid=221|title=TFAS U.S. Programs Page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&amp;id=21|title=TFAS 2006 Annual Report Page 19|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Economics and International Affairs (IEIA)===

Approximately 60 undergraduate leaders attend the Institute on Economics and International Affairs (IEIA) in order to gain real-world experience in the nation's capital interning on Capitol Hill, federal agencies, think tanks, foreign policy groups, embassies, or international affairs organizations. Academic study is focused on current foreign policy issues, political trends and the economics of the free market.&lt;ref name="TFAS U.S. Programs"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=244|title=TFAS U.S. Programs Page|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital Semester (CS)===

Capital Semester is a 15-week academic and internship program offered each fall and spring in Washington, D.C. Participants of the program are enrolled as full-time students, placed with an internship in their area of interest and housed in furnished apartments on Capitol Hill. Students also attend briefings at the White House, State Department, and Capitol Hill as well as guest lectures from government officials and policy makers.  In 2007 CS added a political journalism component for students interested in print or broadcast journalism, politics or public relations.&lt;ref name="TFAS U.S. Programs Page"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&amp;id=21|title=TFAS 2006 Annual Report Page 23|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Studies Institute (LSI)===
LSI was established in the summer of 2007. The ten-week program combines legal clerkships, academic coursework for credit, networking opportunities, and career development activities. Participants of the program interact with leaders of the legal profession and visit points of judicial and executive interest in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=847&amp;srcid=244|title=TFAS Programs: Legal Studies Page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International programs===

====American Institute on Political and Economic Systems (AIPES), [[Prague, Czech Republic]]====
AIPES was established in 1993 to educate young leaders from central and Eastern Europe about free-market economics and constitutional democracy. Participants of the program attend classes, engage in a parliamentary simulation and listen to guest speakers.

====Asia Institute for Political Economy (AIPE), [[Hong Kong]]====
Established in 2002, AIPE promotes discussions of political economy among young leaders from across Asia. Participants attend courses on American studies and debate issues of economics, global trade, and economic developments with  guest lecturers. The Institute is administered each summer in partnership with the [[University of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="tfas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=245&amp;srcid=847|title=TFAS International Programs Webpage |accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&amp;id=21|title=TFAS 2006 Annual Report Page 21|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
The book received extremely favourable reviews, with ''[[New Scientist]]'' proclaiming that "if you could only ever read one science book, this should probably be it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19726452.400-review-ithe-oxford-book-of-modern-science-writingi-selected-by-richard-dawkins.html |title=Review: The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing, selected by Richard Dawkins |accessdate=26 March 2008 |publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Forbes of ''[[The Independent]]'' praised Dawkins' inclusions, stating that "every reader is likely to make a discovery or two".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-oxford-book-of-modern-science-writing-ed-richard-dawkins-828939.html |title=The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing, ed.

The '''United States Institute of Peace''' ('''USIP''') is an American [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] institution tasked with promoting conflict resolution and prevention worldwide. It provides research, analysis, and training to individuals in diplomacy, mediation, and other peace-building measures. 

Following years of proposals for a national "peace academy", the USIP was established in 1984 by Congressional legislation signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. It is officially nonpartisan and independent, receiving funding only through congressional appropriation to prevent outside influence. The Institute is governed by a bipartisan Board of Directors with fifteen members——which must include the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the President of the National Defense University——who are appointed by the [[United States President|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. 

The Institute's [[United States Institute of Peace Headquarters|headquarters]] is in the [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], situated at the northwest corner of the [[National Mall]] near the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]. It currently employs around 300 personnel and has trained more than 65,000 professionals since its inception.

==Mission==
The United States Institute of Peace Act, passed in 1984, calls for the Institute to "serve the people and the
Government through the widest possible range of education and training, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence".&lt;ref name="United States Institute of Peace Act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title22/chapter56&amp;edition=prelim| publisher=U.S. House of Representatives | title=United States Institute of Peace Act (22 USC Ch 56, sect. 4601-4611) |

==History==
[[File:Nancy Lindborg, president, United States Institute of Peace.jpg|thumb|Nancy Lindborg, current president of USIP]]
President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the United States Institute of Peace Act in 1984.&lt;ref name="United States Institute of Peace Act"/&gt;

Spurred by a [[grassroots]] movement in the 1970s and 1980s, Senator [[Jennings Randolph]] joined Senators [[Mark Hatfield]] and [[Spark Matsunaga]] and Rep. [[Dan Glickman]] in an effort to form a national peace academy akin to the national [[US Service academies|military academies]].&lt;ref name="Below the Radar: A Federal Peace Agency"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/below-the-radar-a-federal-peace-agency/ | work=The New York Times | title=Below the Radar: A Federal Peace Agency | date=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984 act creating USIP followed from a 1981 recommendation of a commission formed to examine the peace academy issue appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]] and chaired by Matsunaga.

Robert F. Turner was the Institute's first president and CEO, holding that position from 1986 to 1987. He was followed by Ambassador [[Samuel W. Lewis]] (1987–1992), Ambassador [[Richard H. Solomon]], (1992–2012), and former Congressman [[Jim Marshall (Georgia politician)|Jim Marshall]] (2012–2013). Kristin Lord served as acting President (2013–2014). Nancy Lindborg was sworn in as president on February 2, 2015. In its early years, the Institute first sought to build the field of international conflict management and peacebuilding. In a 2011 letter of support for USIP, the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs noted that this analytical work has "helped to build the conflict management and resolution field, both as an area of study and as an applied science".&lt;ref name="APSIA Letter of Support"/&gt;

Under Solomon's leadership, the Institute expanded its operations in conflict zones and its training programs, initially in the Balkans and, after September 11, 2001, in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;ref name=Leon&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1691| title = Leon Panetta Dean Acheson Lecture: "Building Partnership in the 21st Century"| date = 28 June 2012| accessdate = 28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became the home of several congressionally mandated blue-ribbon commissions, including the Iraq Study Group, the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, and the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel. Today, the Institute conducts active programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Sudan, South Sudan, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Peace-Building That Pays Off"/&gt;

In 1996, Congress authorized the [[US Navy|Navy]] to transfer jurisdiction of the federal land—a portion of its Potomac Annex facility on what has been known as [[Old Naval Observatory|Navy Hill]]—to become the site of the permanent USIP headquarters, across the street from the National Mall at 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue NW, in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/entertainment/MI51121/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130209135333/http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/entertainment/MI51121/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-02-09 | work = Associated Press | title = Peace institute approved to begin construction on National Mall | date = 2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its construction, the Institute leased office space in downtown Washington. Construction of the headquarters building concluded in 2011.

==Budget==
[[File:U4u at USIP.jpg|thumb|A USIP event]]
USIP is funded annually by the U.S. Congress. For fiscal year 2012 Congress provided $39 million.&lt;ref name="H.R.2055 -- Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.2055.enr: | title = H.R.2055 -- Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 | date = 23 December 2011 | accessdate = 28 November 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, USIP receives funds transferred from government agencies, such as the Department of State, [[USAID]], and the Department of Defense. By law, USIP is prohibited from receiving private gifts and contributions for its program activities. The restriction on private fundraising was lifted for the public-private partnership to construct the USIP headquarters.

===Budget debate===
An op-ed in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' on February 16, 2011, by Republican congressman [[Jason Chaffetz]] of Utah and former Democratic congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] of New York, attacked funding for USIP as part of the broader debate about federal spending. "The USIP is a case study in how government waste thrives", they wrote. "The idea began during the Cold War as a modest proposal with $4 million in seed money. But the organization received government funding year after year essentially because it had been funded the year before—and because it had important allies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703703804576144723935786138 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Jason | last1=Chaffetz | first2=Anthony | last2=Weiner | title=Small Budget Cuts Add Up | date=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[U.S. Central Command]] Commander [[Anthony Zinni]] wrote an  op-ed, published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on March 7, 2011, in support of USIP. "Congress would be hard-pressed to find an agency that does more with less. The institute's entire budget would not pay for the Afghan war for three hours, is less than the cost of a fighter plane, and wouldn't sustain even 40 American troops in Afghanistan for a year. Within the budget, peace-building is financed as part of national security programs, and is recognized as an important adjunct to conventional defense spending and diplomacy. The institute's share of the proposed international affairs budget, $43 million, is minuscule: less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the State Department's budget, and one-hundredth of 1 percent of the Pentagon's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/opinion/08zinni.html | work=The New York Times | first=Anthony C. | last=Zinni | title=Why Congress Should Keep Financing the U.S. Institute of Peace | date=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2011, the House of Representatives for the 112th [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] voted to eliminate all funding for the U.S. Institute of Peace in FY 2011 continuing resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/02/17/house-votes-to-cut-all-funding-for-us-institute-of-peace/ | work=The Raw Story | title=House votes to cut all funding for US Institute of Peace | first=Eric| last=Dolan| date=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_131/ornstein_institute_peace_target_spending_war-206090-1.html?zkMobileView=false | work=Roll Call | title=U.S. Institute of Peace is Target in Spending War | first=Norman| last=Ornstein| date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the Institute was eventually restored by both the House and Senate on April 14, 2011, through the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011.&lt;ref name="H.R.1473 -- Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1473.enr:| title = H.R.1473 -- Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011| date = 14 April 2011| accessdate = 28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace Tech Lab===
The Peace Tech Lab is a 501(C)3 spun out of United States Institute of Peace in 2014. It created the Lab as a separate entity to further advance its core mission to prevent, mitigate, and reduce violent conflict around the world. The Lab continues USIP's work developing technology and media tools for peacebuilding. In real terms, the Lab brings together engineers, technologists, and data scientists from industry and academia, along with experts in peacebuilding from USIP, other government agencies, NGOs and the conflict zones. These experts collaborate to design, develop, and deploy new and existing technology tools for conflict management and peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Peace Tech Lab: Areas of Focus|url=http://www.peacetechlab.org/areas-of-focus/|access-date=2015-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224102605/http://www.peacetechlab.org/areas-of-focus|archive-date=2014-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convened tribes in Iraq===
In Iraq in 2007, USIP helped broker the initial peace agreement that is seen as the turning point in the war there. USIP experts were asked to assist the U.S. Army's [[10th Mountain Division]] in the reconciliation effort in [[Mahmoudiyah, Iraq|Mahmoudiya]], located in what was known as "the Triangle of Death" in Iraq's western [[Anbar Province]]. USIP was seen{{By whom|date=August 2017}} as a neutral player that was able to convene Sunni tribal leaders, Iraq's Shiite government leaders, and senior members of the U.S. military. Soon after the meeting, attacks and casualties declined significantly. The agreement led to a reduction of the U.S. military presence there from a brigade-level unit of about 3,500 soldiers to a battalion-level unit of about 650. General [[David Petraeus]], the senior commander in Iraq, noted that the turnabout was "striking". Petraeus also said that USIP "is a great asset in developing stronger [[unity of effort]] between civilian and military elements of government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1673698,00.html | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| title=A Local Peace Accord: Cause for Hope? | first=Darrin | last=Mortenson | date=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq Study Group===
{{Main|Iraq Study Group}}
The U.S. government used USIP to help convene the bipartisan Iraq Study Group in 2006 that studied the conflict in Iraq and recommended ways forward. USIP facilitated the group's trip to Iraq and hosted several meetings of the group. According to USIP, the group's political neutrality made it an appropriate entity to host the group's sensitive deliberations. The effort was undertaken at the urging of several members of Congress with agreement of the White House. A final report was released to Congress, the White House, and the public on December 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usip.org/programs/initiatives/iraq-study-group | work=U.S. Institute of Peace| title=The Iraq Study Group | accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--SECONDARY SOURCE NEEDED HERE.--&gt;

===Genocide Prevention Task Force===
In Fall 2008, U.S. Institute of Peace, the U.S. [[Holocaust Memorial Museum]], and the [[American Academy of Diplomacy]] jointly convened the [[Genocide Prevention Task Force]] to "spotlight genocide prevention as a national priority and to develop practical policy recommendations to enhance the capacity of the U.S. government to respond to emerging threats of genocide and mass atrocities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usip.org/programs/initiatives/genocide-prevention-task-force | work=U.S. Institute of Peace| title=Genocide Prevention Task Force | accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14-member task force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usip.org/genocide-prevention-task-force/members | work=U.S. Institute of Peace| title=Genocide Prevention Task Force | accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-chaired by former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] and former Defense Secretary [[William Cohen]], outlined "a national blueprint to prevent genocide and mass atrocities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/opinion/21albright.html | work=The New York Times | title=Never again, for real | date=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, the task force released its report "Preventing Genocide: A Blueprint for U.S. Policymakers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://media.usip.org/reports/genocide_taskforce_report.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Genocide Prevention Task Force |work=Genocide |date=December 8, 2008 |page= |accessdate=2011-08-03 |title=Preventing Genocide: A Blueprint for U.S. Policymakers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911040022/http://media.usip.org/reports/genocide_taskforce_report.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing its recommendations and guidelines. ''[[The Economist]]'' praised it as a "report steeped in good sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/12773216?story_id=12773216 | work=The Economist | title=Preventing genocide | date=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2011, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced a proclamation suspending U.S. entry to individuals active in "serious human rights and humanitarian law violations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

===Preventing electoral violence in Sudan===
Ahead of [[Sudan]]'s April 2010 [[Sudanese general election, 2010|national elections]] (the first since 1986) and the January 2011 [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|South Sudanese independence referendum]], USIP staff traveled to some of the more unstable regions to help prepare people for the elections. Amid heightened tensions, USIP experts focused on improving cultural awareness, citizenship skills, and training Sudanese on electoral violence triggers—all critical steps to ensure that the polls did not turn violent. The elections and referendum were held with relatively no bloodshed and were widely deemed a success. Building upon USIP's successful electoral violence prevention training, USIP is implementing a series of violence prevention workshops throughout the country post-election and post-referendum.

===Publication of ''The Iran Primer''===
''The Iran Primer: Power, Politics, and U.S. Policy'' "offers a comprehensive but concise overview of [[Iran]]'s politics, economy, military, foreign policy, and nuclear program". It convenes 50 experts to discuss Iran's evolving relationship with the West and "chronicles [[Iran–United States relations|U.S.-Iran relations]] under six American presidents and probes five options for dealing with Iran". ''The Iran Primer'' is edited by USIP staff member [[Robin Wright (author)|Robin Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/publications/the-iran-primer ''The Iran Primer: Power, Politics, and U.S. Policy''].

==Criticism==
{{Outdated|section|date=November 2018}}
Sarah Diamond and Richard Hatch, writing in the July/August 1990 issue of [[Left-wing politics in the United States|leftist]] publication ''[[Z Magazine]]'', stated that the supposed peace research "looks more like the study of new and potential means of aggression," through trade embargoes, austerity programs, and electoral intervention. When it was established in 1984, its board looked like a "'who's who' of right-wing ideologues from academia and the Pentagon," and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency may assign officers and employees to the Institute. Nearly half its board played a role in Iran-contra operations.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The first president was Robert F. Turner, who worked for the State Department arguing for increased aid to the Nicaraguan contras.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Sarah; Hatch, Richard (July/August 1990).

Linguist and political critic [[Noam Chomsky]] described the USIP's decision to release the [[Trump administration]]’s 2018 [[National Military Strategy|National Defense Strategy]] on its website as a case where "lacking a sense of irony, the bureaucracy is quite happy to caricature Orwell."&lt;ref name="Polychroniou2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Polychroniou |first1=CJ |title=Noam Chomsky: Moral Depravity Defines US Politics |url=https://truthout.org/articles/noam-chomsky-moral-depravity-defines-us-politics/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=[[Truthout]] |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">'''''Urmonotheismus''''' (German for "[[:wikt:ur-|primeval]] monotheism") or '''primitive monotheism''' is the hypothesis of a [[monotheistic]] ''[[Urreligion]]'', from which non-monotheistic religions degenerated. This is diametrically opposed to the evolutionary view of religion, another hypothesis which holds that religion progressed from simple forms to complex: first preanimism, then [[animism]], [[totemism]], [[polytheism]] and finally monotheism (see [[Anthropology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=Dhavamony &gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dhavamony | first1 = Mariasusai | title = Phenomenology of religión | publisher = Editrice Pontificia Università Gregoriana | year = 1973 | pages = 60–64 | isbn = 88-7652-474-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Scottish anthropologist [[Andrew Lang]] concluded in 1898 that the idea of a high god or "All Father" existed among some of the simplest of contemporary tribes prior to Western contact.&lt;ref name=Dhavamony/&gt;

Urmonotheism was first defended by [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)| Wilhelm Schmidt]] (1868–1954), in his ''Der Ursprung der Gottesidee'' appearing from 1912, opposing the "Revolutionary Monotheism" approach that traces the emergence of monotheistic thought as a gradual process spanning the Bronze and Iron Age [[Religions of the Ancient Near East]] and [[Classical Antiquity]].&lt;ref name = Pettazzoni &gt;{{cite journal | title = Das Ende des Urmonotheismus | journal = [[Numen (journal) |Numen]] |date = April 1958| first = Raffaele | last = Pettazzoni |authorlink= Raffaele Pettazzoni | volume = 5 | issue = 2 |language= German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alleged traces of primitive monotheism were located in the deities Assyrian [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and [[Marduk]], and Hebrew [[YHWH]]. Monotheism in Schmidt's view is the "natural" form of theism, which was later overlaid and "degraded" by [[polytheism]].&lt;ref name = Pettazzoni/&gt;

Schmidt's hypothesis was controversially discussed during much of the first half of the 20th century. In the 1930s, Schmidt adduced evidence from [[Native American mythology]], Australian aborigines and other primitive civilizations in support of his views.&lt;ref&gt;''High Gods in North America'', 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Origin and Growth of Religion: Facts and Theories," 1931&lt;/ref&gt; He also responded to his critics. For instance, he rejected Rafael Pettazzoni's claim that the sky gods were merely a dim personification or embodiment of the physical sky, writing in "The Origin and Growth of Religion": "The outlines of the Supreme Being become dim only among later peoples".&lt;ref name="Schmidt 1972, page 211"&gt;Schmidt, "The Origin and Growth of Religion: Facts and Theories," New York: Cooper Square Publishers, 1972, page 211&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that "a being who lives in the sky, who stands behind the celestial phenomena, who must 'centralize' in himself the various manifestations [of thunder, rain, etc.] is not a personification of the sky at all".&lt;ref name="Schmidt 1972, page 211"/&gt; According to Ernest Brandewie in ''Wilhelm Schmidt and the Origin of the Idea of God'', Schmidt also claims that Pettazzoni fails to study Schmidt's work seriously and often relies on incorrect translations of Schmidt's German.&lt;ref&gt;Brandewie, ''Wilhelm Schmidt and the Origin of the Idea of God'', Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1983, page 251&lt;/ref&gt; Brandewie also says Pettazzoni's definition of primitive ethical monotheism is an "arbitrary" straw-man argument, but he says Schmidt went too far when he claimed that such ethical monotheism was the earliest religious idea.&lt;ref&gt;Brandewie, pages 44 and 119&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s the academic establishment had rejected the hypothesis of primitive ethical monotheism, so the proponents of Schmidt's "Vienna school" rephrased his ideas to the effect that while ancient cultures may not have known "true monotheism", they at least show evidence for "original [[theism]]" (''Ur-Theismus'', as opposed to non-theistic [[animism]]), with a concept of ''Hochgott'' ("High God", as opposed to ''Eingott'' "Single God"). [[Christian apologetics]] in the light of this have moved away from postulating a "memory of revelation" in pre-Christian religions, replacing it with an "inkling of redemption" or [[virtuous paganism]] unconsciously anticipating monotheism.&lt;ref name = Pettazzoni/&gt; That said, [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] noted in ''Theories of Primitive Religion'', first published in 1962, that most anthropologists have abandoned all evolutionary schemes like Schmidt and Pettazzoni's for the historical development of religion, adding that they have also found monotheistic beliefs existing side-by-side with other religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;

Voice itself could be 'packaged' and sent through the IP backbone so that it reaches its marked 'address'. In a technical sense, the process of sending 'voice packets' is a semi passive way of communication. However, given the speed at which it could be delivered can make the communication sound seamless.
