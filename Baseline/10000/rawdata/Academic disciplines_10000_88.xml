In [[Multi-hop routing|multi-hop networks]], '''Adaptive Quality of Service routing''' (AQoS or AQR) protocols {{Definition|date=July 2009}} have become increasingly popular and have numerous applications.  One application in which it may be useful is in [[Mobile ad hoc network]]ing (MANET). 

Adaptive QoS routing is a [[cross-layer optimization]] [[adaptive routing]] mechanism. The cross-layer mechanism provides up-to-date local QoS information for the adaptive routing algorithm, by considering the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link performance. The multiple QoS requirements are satisfied by adaptively using forward error correction and multipath routing mechanisms, based on the current network status. The complete routing mechanism includes three parts: (1) a modified dynamic source routing algorithm that handles route discovery and the collection of QoS related parameters; (2) a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node; and (3) an integrated
decision-making system to calculate the number of routing paths, coding parity length, and traffic distribution rates.

== Introduction ==
A [[wireless ad hoc network]] consists of a collection of mobile nodes interconnected by multihop wireless paths with wireless transmitters and receivers. Such networks can be spontaneously created and operated in a self-organized manner, because they do not rely upon any preexisting network infrastructure.

The emergence of multimedia applications in communications has generated the need to provide
[[mobile quality-of-service]] (QoS) support in ad hoc networks, and such applications require a stable path to guarantee QoS requirements. However, the topology of ad hoc networks is highly dynamic due to the unpredictable node mobility. In addition, wireless channel bandwidth is limited. So, QoS provisioning in such networks is complex and challenging.

QoS routing usually involves two tasks: collecting and maintaining up-to-date state information about the network and finding feasible paths for a connection based on its QoS requirements.  Many approaches currently exist to perform QoS routing, most of which consist of routing across the [[Network layer]] of the [[OSI model]] only.  Some approaches utilize both the Network and [[Data link layer]] but do not consider the cross layer behaviors.  This makes quantifying the QoS parameters difficult and leads to considerations of QoS but does not guarantee QoS.  

To address this problem, appropriate cross-layer cooperation is required.  Adaptive QoS schemes provide QoS information by factoring the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link parameters into QoS performance. 

=== Traditional QoS Approaches ===
Most QoS approaches tend to focus on only one QoS parameter (e.g., packet loss, end-to-end delay, and bandwidth). For example, while many of the QoS-related schemes are successful in reducing packet loss by adding redundancy in the packet, they do this at the expense of end-to-end delay. Because packet loss and end-to-end delay are inversely related, it may not be possible to find a path that simultaneously satisfies the delay, packet loss, and bandwidth constraints. Some proposed QoS routing algorithms do consider multiple metrics, but without considering cross-layer cooperation. Multipath routing is another type of QoS routing that has received much attention, since it can provide load balancing, fault tolerance, and higher aggregate bandwidth. Although this approach decreases packet loss and end-to-end delay, it is only efficient and reliable if a relationship can be found between the number of paths and QoS constraints.

== Adaptive QoS Scheme Overview ==
To implement an adaptive multipath routing scheme, three functions distributed in different parts of the network are needed. First, a modified dynamic source routing function is needed. It handles route discovery and collecting the local QoS-related information along the selected
routes. Second, there is a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node. This function is used to support the above routing function. It will manage
and build the local routing information in each node, which includes a QoS-related table. The third function will be in charge of the final decision-making process. The adaptive
routing parameters are derived from the decision-making algorithm based on the QoS constraints. They are the number N of selected paths, parity length k of the FEC, code and the set {R} of the traffic distribution rates on each path. With these functions, adaptive multipath QoS routing is implemented.

QoS requirements can be based on either a delay or a delay and bandwidth requirement, or a packet loss requirement. FEC parity length is derived from the difference between the QoS
delay requirement and the average delay on selected paths under the packet-loss constraint. Average packet loss under this FEC scheme is achieved by using multiple routing paths.
At the same time, the packet distribution rate on each path is determined under fair packet-loss and load-balance principles.  Routing maintenance under the same QoS guarantees
is achieved without increasing its computational complexity.This required to be understand.

== Adaptive QoS Performance ==
Three functions (routing function, local statistic computation and monitoring function, and integrated decisionmaking function) are implemented in the different parts of the mobile network. Due to the distributed structure, the computation and implementation complexity of the
routing scheme are reduced. Also, since routes are discovered based on the up-to-date local information and selected by the optimization computation, routing parameters (e.g., number of paths, FEC parity length, and traffic distribution rate) are dynamic and optimized. In addition
to supporting multiple QoS requirements, traffic balancing and bandwidth resources are factored into our decisionmaking process. The distributed structure of the local QoS statistics used in the routing enables this QoS support mechanism to be scalable in mobile networks. Simulation
results indicate that the performance (i.e., packet loss and end-to-end delay) are much better and less susceptible to the state changes (i.e., node mobility, transmission power, channel characteristics, and the traffic pattern) of the network, compared to a nonadaptive routing strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">'''Autopharmacology''' relates to the [[scientific]] study of the [[homeostasis|regulation]] of body functions by the activity of its naturally existent (or [[endogenous]]) chemical factors of the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s. A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on [[physiological]] functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, H.H. Adventures in Physiology, with Excursions into Autopharmacology: a Selection from the Scientific Publications of Sir Henry Hallett Dale. London: Pergamon press, 1953. {{OCLC|459029325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best example is the class of [[endorphin]]s, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the [[brain]] and have specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s in it,&lt;ref&gt;Pert, Candace: Molecules Of Emotion: The Science Between Mind-Body Medicine Scribner (1999), {{ISBN|0-684-84634-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by investigations on the mechanism of action of [[opioid]]s, such as [[morphine]].

Historically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physiologist]] and [[pharmacologist]] [[Henry Hallett Dale|Henry Dale]] in the 1910s, discovered the role of [[acetylcholine]] in [[synaptic transmission]],&lt;ref&gt;Tansey, T: Sir Henry Dale and autopharmacology: the role of acetylcholine in neurotransmission. ''Clio Med.'' 1995;33:179-93.&lt;/ref&gt; and later proved by [[Austria]]n physiologist [[Otto Loewi]], to be the [[neurotransmitter]] involved in the proximal synapses of the [[autonomic nervous system]] (initially named ''[[Vagusstoff]]'' by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, [[noradrenaline]] (''Akzeleransstoff'' by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, [[adrenaline]], a hormone secreted by the [[adrenal gland]]s. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for their pioneering and important contributions.

A research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of [[pain]] and [[inflammation]],&lt;ref&gt;Leme, J.G. Regulatory mechanisms in inflammation: new aspects of autopharmacology. ''General Pharmacology'' 02/1981; 12(1):15-24.&lt;/ref&gt; due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the [[circulatory system]] and [[renal]] functions and their interactions (such as the [[renin/angiotensin system]]) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor [[Mauricio Rocha e Silva]], leader of the team of [[Brazil]]ian researchers who discovered [[bradykinin]] in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in [[hypotension]] in [[circulatory shock]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawgood B.J. Mauricio Rocha e Silva MD : Snake venom, bradykinin and the rise of autopharmacology. ''Toxicon'' 1997, vol. 35, no11, pp. 1569-1580 (1 p.1/2) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9428104 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, all these systems are of extreme importance for [[clinical practice]] and for the discovery of new [[therapeutic drugs]].

Endogenous substances that could fall under the concept of autopharmacology are:

* [[Endorphins]]
* [[Dynorphin]]
* [[Bradykinin]]
* [[Prostaglandins]]
* [[Angiotensin]]
* [[Secretin]]
* [[Gastrin]]
* [[Cholecystokinin]]
* [[Histamine]]
* [[Cannabinoids]]
* [[Substance P]]

The main scientific criterion for an autopharmacological agent is the discovery of specific membrane receptors for it and, hopefully, its [[Signal transduction|transduction]] and [[cell signaling]] mechanisms.

The term was never much of a mainstream concept, and has fallen into disuse, as research on basic mechanisms has advanced. In a [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=autopharmacology recent literature search] on [[PubMed]], only six titles refer to the term ''autopharmacology''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12416">'''Bleed air''' produced by [[gas turbine]] engines is [[compressed air]] that is taken from the compressor stage of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. In modern airliner engines, two regulator valves (high stage and low stage) turn on and off automatically and are controlled by at least "...two air supply and cabin pressure controllers (ASCPCs) which open and close appropriate valves. Engine bleed air comes from the high stage or low stage engine compressor section. Low stage air is used during high power setting operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low power setting operations."&lt;ref name="777 Bleed Air"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://meriweather.com/flightdeck/777/over/bleed.html | title=777 Bleed Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global 300 Bleed Air"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/download.php?path=docs/&amp;file=Bombardier_Challenger_Global_300-Air_Cond_and_Press.pdf | title=Global 300 Bleed Air}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, [[cabin pressurization]], [[pneumatic actuator]]s, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as "customer bleed air".&lt;ref name="US Navy"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/eng/64b7-205.html | title=Naval Operations Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Space Agency"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.easa.europa.eu/certification/type-certificates/docs/engines/EASA-TCDS-E.021_%28IM%29_GE_CF34--10E_series_engines-05-03012013.pdf | title=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mil-specs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mil-spec.tpub.com/MIL-E/MIL-E-8593A/MIL-E-8593A00103.htm | title=mil-spec}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high [[temperature]] and high [[pressure]] (typical values are 200–250&amp;nbsp;°C and 275 kPa (40 PSI), for regulated bleed air exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).

== Uses ==
[[File:Pxctl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cabin pressure and bleed air controls in a [[Boeing 737-800]]]]
In civil aircraft, bleed air's primary use is to provide pressure for the aircraft [[cabin (aircraft)|cabin]] by supplying air to the [[environmental control system]]. Additionally, bleed air is used to keep critical parts of the plane (such as the wing [[leading edge]]s) ice-free.&lt;ref name="skybrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Bleed_Air_Systems | title=Bleed Air Systems | publisher=Skybrary.aero | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleed air is used on many aircraft systems because it is easily available, reliable, and a potent source of power. For example, bleed air from an airplane engine is used to start the remaining engines. [[Aircraft lavatory|Lavatory]] water storage tanks are pressurized by bleed air that is fed through a [[pressure regulator]].&lt;ref name="skybrary" /&gt;

When used for [[cabin pressurization]], the bleed air from the engine must first be cooled (as it exits the compressor stage at temperatures as high as 250&amp;nbsp;°C) by passing it through an air-to-air [[heat exchanger]] cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an [[air cycle machine]] unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.&lt;ref name="skybrary" /&gt;

Bleed air is also used to heat the engine [[intake]]s. This prevents ice from forming, accumulating, breaking loose, and being ingested by the engine, possibly damaging it.&lt;ref name="skybrary2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Ice_Protection_Systems | title=Ice Protection Systems | publisher=Skybrary | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On aircraft powered by jet engines, a similar system is used for [[Ice protection system|wing anti-icing]] by the 'hot-wing' method. In icing conditions, water droplets [[condensation|condensing]] on a wing's leading edge can freeze. If that happens, the ice build-up adds weight and changes the shape of the wing, causing a degradation in performance, and possibly a critical loss of control or [[Lift (force)|lift]]. To prevent this, hot bleed air is pumped through the inside of the wing's leading edge, heating it to a temperature above freezing, which prevents the formation of ice. The air then exits through small holes in the wing edge.

On propeller-driven aircraft, it is common to use bleed air to inflate a rubber boot on the leading edge, breaking the ice loose after it has already formed.&lt;ref name="skybrary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skybrary2" /&gt;

Bleed air from the high-pressure compressor of the engine is used to supply [[Harrier Jump Jet#Specifications|reaction control valves]] as used for part of the [[flight control system]] in the [[Harrier jump jet]] family of military aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.harrier.org.uk/technical/Basic_TechNet.htm Technical]" page on harrier.org.uk website, viewed 2013-11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contamination==
{{Main|Fume event}}
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
On rare occasions, bleed air used for air-conditioning, and pressurization can be contaminated by chemicals such as oil or hydraulic fluid.&lt;ref name=WSJ_&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204900904574302293012711628 | title=Up in the Air: New Worries About ‘Fume Events’ on Planes | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=30 July 2009 | accessdate=29 December 2012 | author=Sarah Nassauer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a fume event. While those chemicals can be irritating, such rare events have not been established to cause long term harm.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204900904574302293012711628 | title=Up in the Air: New Worries About 'Fume Events' on Planes | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=July 30, 2009 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Nassauer, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skydrol.com/pages/faqs.asp | title=Skydrol FAQ | publisher=Skydrol | accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain neurological and respiratory ill health effects have been linked [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotally]] to exposure to bleed air that has been alleged to have been contaminated with toxic levels on commercial and military aircraft. This alleged long-term illness is referred to as [[Aerotoxic Syndrome]] by agenda groups, but it is not a medically recognized syndrome. One alleged potential contaminant is [[tricresyl phosphate]].

Many lobbying groups have been set up to advocate for research into this alleged hazard. The groups include the Aviation Organophosphate Information Site (AOPIS) (2001), the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive (2006) and the UK-based [[Aerotoxic Association]] (2007). Cabin Environment Research is one of many functions of the ACER Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.acer-coe.org/index.html|title= Airliner Cabin Environment Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their researchers have not yet established any [[Causality|causal relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esam.aero/main/docs/ecam08/No%207%20Bagshaw%20paper.pdf | title=The Aerotoxic Syndrome | publisher=European Society of Aerospace Medicine | date=September 2008 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Bagshaw, Michael | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827071537/http://www.esam.aero/main/docs/ecam08/No%207%20Bagshaw%20paper.pdf | archivedate=August 27, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/121/12107.htm|author=Select Committee on Science and Technology|publisher=House of Lords|title=Science and Technology – Fifth Report|chapter=Chapter 4: Elements Of Healthy Cabin Air|accessdate=2010-07-05|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a study made for the EU in 2014 confirmed that contamination of cabin air could be a problem, that study also stated:

::"A lot of reported fume events caused comfort limitations for the occupants but posed no danger. A verification of cabin air contamination with toxic substances (e.g. TCP/TOCP) was not possible with the fume events the BFU investigated."&lt;ref name="EU Study"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bfu-web.de/EN/Publications/Safety%20Study/Studies/140507_Fume_Events.pdf?__blob=publicationFile | title=Study of Reported Occurrences in Conjunction with Cabin Air Quality in Transport Aircraft | publisher=German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation | accessdate=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no scientific evidence to date has found that airliner cabin air has been contaminated to toxic levels (exceeding known safe levels, in ppm, of any dangerous chemical), a court in Australia in March 2010, found in favor of a former airline flight attendant who claimed she suffered chronic respiratory problems after being exposed to oil fumes on a trip in March 1992, although she was able to continue working as a flight attendant and in other jobs for over 10 years after the fume event&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWDDT/2009/10.html Turner v Eastwest Airlines Limited (2009) at Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bleedless aircraft ==
Bleed air systems have been in use for several decades in passenger jets. Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled pneumatic power systems to be replaced by electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|Boeing 787]], each engine has two variable-frequency electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in engine efficiency, lower weight, and ease of maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_07/AERO_Q407_article2.pdf AERO 787 No Bleed Systems] The Boeing Company 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
A bleedless aircraft achieves fuel efficiency by eliminating the process of compressing and decompressing air, and by reducing the aircraft's mass due to the removal of ducts, valves, heat exchangers, and other heavy equipment.&lt;ref name="boeing"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_07/article_02_1.html | title=787 No-Bleed Systems | publisher=Boeing | year=2008 | accessdate=January 1, 2013 | author=Sinnett, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APU (auxiliary power unit) does not need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are improved due to the lack of bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure [[air cycle machine]] (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.&lt;ref name="boeing" /&gt;

Lastly, advocates of the design say it improves safety as heated air is confined to the engine pod, as opposed to being pumped through pipes and heat exchangers in the wing and near the cabin, where a leak could damage surrounding systems.&lt;ref name="boeing" /&gt;

===Tradeoffs===
In the 787, cabin air enters from under the fuselage and is compressed as required. De-icing is achieved by electro-thermal heating elements embedded in the wing's leading edge. Hydraulic pumps for flaps, slats, speed brakes and other control surfaces are also powered electrically.

Eliminating bleed air increases the electric load, as cabin pressurization, anti-ice/de-ice systems, and other functions need to be powered electrically instead. This necessitates an increased size of electrical generators as well as higher-power power distribution boards and more sophisticated backup and control systems.

A '''comedy club''' is a venue—typically a [[nightclub]], [[bar (establishment)|bar]], [[casino]], or [[restaurant]]—where people watch or listen to performances, including [[stand-up comedian]]s, improvisational [[comedian]]s, [[impersonator]]s, [[impressionist]]s, [[magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[ventriloquist]]s, and other comedy acts. The term "comedy club" usually refers to venues that feature stand-up comedy, as distinguished from [[improvisational theatre]]s, which host improv or sketch comedy, and variety clubs (which may also host musical acts).

==Types of comedy clubs==
Comedy clubs are usually broken down by comedians into "A rooms", "B rooms", and "C rooms":
*A rooms usually cater to people with movie deals, people with television shows, and generally well known acts.
*B rooms are where the best aspects of both A rooms and C rooms meet. Young comics need B rooms as a stepping stone. These are rooms where someone doing a 10- to 15-minute set (hosting/MCing) can be asked, after they've been going up long enough, to do a 20-minute set (featuring) and so on. These clubs also typically allow dirtier material, since they can become established names for "dirty" comedy or shows that usually cover adult themes.
*C rooms act as "neighborhood" comedy clubs, for the most part. The headliners are not usually very well known or popular, and the audiences are random walk-ins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5080">'''Confidence weighting (CW)''' is concerned with measuring two variables: (1) what a respondent believes is a correct answer to a question and (2) what degree of certainty the respondent has toward the correctness of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebel|first=R. L.|title=Confidence Weighting and Test Reliability|journal=Journal of Educational Measurement|year=1965|volume=2|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1965.tb00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Confidence weighting'' when applied to a specific answer selection for a particular test or exam question is referred to in the literature from [[cognitive psychology]] as item-specific confidence, a term typically used by researchers who investigate metamemory or [[metacognition]], comprehension monitoring, or feeling-of-knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lundeberg|first=M.|author2=Fox, P. W. |author3=Puncochaf, J. |title=Highly Confident but Wrong: Gender Differences and Similarities in Confidence Judgments|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1994|volume=86|issue=1|pages=114–121|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.86.1.114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Item-specific confidence is defined as calibrating the relationship between an objective performance of accuracy (e.g., a test answer selection) with the subjective measure of confidence, (e.g., a numeric value assigned to the selection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=D. J.|title=Handbook of Metacognition in Education|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=222–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on self-confidence and metacognition during test taking (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleitman|first=S.|author2=Stankov, L.|title=Ecological and Person-Oriented Aspects of Metacognitive Processes in Test-Taking|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2005|volume=15|issue=3|pages=321–341|doi=10.1002/acp.705}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleitman|first=S.|author2=Stankov, L.|title=Self-confidence and metacognitive processes|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=17|issue=2|pages=161–173|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2007.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have used item-specific confidence as a way to assess the accuracy and confidence underlying knowledge judgments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5835">'''Convergent extension''' ('''CE'''), sometimes called '''convergence and extension''' ('''C&amp;E'''), is the process by which the tissue of an embryo is restructured to converge (narrow) along one axis and extend (elongate) along a perpendicular axis by cellular movement.   An example of this process is where the [[anteroposterior axis]] (the axis drawn between the head and tail end of an embryo) becomes longer as the lateral tissues (those that make up the left and right sides of the embryo) move in towards the dorsal midline (the middle of the back of the animal).&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallingford JB, Fraser SE, Harland RM |title=Convergent extension: the molecular control of polarized cell movement during embryonic development |journal=Dev Cell |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=695–706 |year=2002 |pmid=12062082 |doi=10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00197-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process plays a crucial role in shaping the body plan during [[embryogenesis]] and occurs during [[gastrulation]], [[neurulation]], axis elongation, and [[organogenesis]] in both [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] embryos.  In [[chordate]] animals, this process is utilized within a vast population of cells; from the smaller populations in the [[notochord]] of the sea squirt (ascidian) to the larger populations of the dorsal mesoderm and neural ectoderm of frogs (Xenopus) and fish.  Many characteristics of convergent extension are conserved in the teleost fish, the bird, and very likely within mammals at the molecular, cellular, and tissue level.&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Keller R, Shook D, Skoglund P |title= The forces that shape embryos: physical aspects of convergent extension by cell intercalation.|journal= Phys. Biol. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |year=2008 |pmid=18403829 |doi=10.1088/1478-3975/5/1/015007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Morphogenic movements4567.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Figure 1. Morphogenic Movements (Adapted from &lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;)]]

Convergent extension has been primarily studied in frogs and fish due to their large embryo size and their development outside of a maternal host (in egg clutches in the water, as opposed to in a uterus).&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;  Within frogs and fish, however, there exist fundamental differences in how convergent extension is achieved.  Frog embryogenesis utilizes cell rearrangement as the sole player of this process.  Fish, on the other hand, utilize both cell rearrangement as well as directed migration&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt; (Fig. 1) .  Cellular rearrangement is the process by which individual cells of a tissue rearrange to reshape the tissue as a whole, while cellular migration is the directed movement of a singular cell or small group of cells across a substrate such as a membrane or tissue.

Frog (Xenopus), as well as other amphibian, [[gastrulation]] serves as an excellent example of the role of convergent extension in embryogenesis.  During gastrulation in frogs, the driving force of convergent extension is the morphogenic activity of the presumptive dorsal mesodermal cells; this activity is driven by the [[mesenchymal]] cells that lie beneath the presumptive mesodermal and neural tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;  These tissues exist within the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) of the embryo which lies between the vegetal endoderm and the posterior neural tissue.  The IMZ is integral to gastrulation and R. Keller et al. eloquently exemplify the importance of convergent extension in Xenopus gastrulation. “…the IMZ, true to its name, involutes or rolls over the blastoporal lip and turns inside out.  As it involutes, it converges along the mediolateral axis and extends along the future anterior-posterior axis of the notochordal and somitic mesoderm.  Convergence and extension of these tissues squeezes the blastopore shut and simultaneously elongate the body axis.  Elongation continues through the neurula and tailbud stages…As these involuted dorsal mesodermal tissues converge and extend on the inside of the gastrula, the presumptive posterior neural tissue converges and extends on the outside of the embryo, parallel to the underlying mesoderm, and then rolls up to form the neural tube, which later forms the hindbrain and spinal cord of the central nervous system".&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;  Should convergent extension be interrupted or incomplete, the resulting organism will have a short anteroposterior axis, wide notochord, and broad, open neural tube.&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;

The cellular signals required for convergent extension are not fully understood, however, it is known that the non-canonical [[Wnt signaling pathway]] plays an important role,.&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;  Current research is shedding light on the cellular mechanisms of convergent extension and recently the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway was implicated in regulating the cell polarity of the factors involved in convergent extension.  This is an interesting development as the PCP pathway is an integral and well-studied pathway in flies, but has classically been thought to be unemployed by vertebrates.&lt;ref name="pmid12062082"/&gt;  In addition to the non-canonical Wnt and PCP pathways involvement in convergent extension, the down-regulation of certain cell-cell adhesion molecules, such as C-cadherin and fibronectin/integrin interactions, may also play a role.&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;  Reduction of the activity of these cell-cell adhesion molecules allows for cells undergoing convergent extension to move more freely.  Consistent with a role for a reduction of cell-cell adhesion in convergent extension, when cell-cell adhesion is not reduced, convergent extension cannot occur.&lt;ref name="pmid18403829"/&gt;

'''Convolute''' as a verb literally means to "roll together" or "roll around", from the Latin ''convolvere''. In general application the word can mean to "tangle" or "complicate", but in botanical descriptions convolute usually is an adjective from the Latin ''convolutus'', meaning "rolled around".&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to a special class of [[imbricate]] structures &amp;mdash; those where the overlapping edges of leaves, scales or similar elements are spirally wrapped, each scale having one edge within the previous scale and one outside the next scale. In the family [[Restionaceae]] the leaf sheaths commonly are convolute in this sense.&lt;ref name= "DyerGen"&gt;Dyer, R. Allen, The Genera of Southern African Flowering Plants”. {{ISBN|0 621 02854 1}}, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; However in structures such as a [[spathe]], where there is only one element, a convolute (or "convolutive") element is spirally wrapped around itself or its branch.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt; This is common in the buds of leaves and inflorescences of members of the family [[Araceae]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2159">The '''Dana/Spicer Model 50''' was an automotive axle manufactured by the [[Dana Holding Corporation]] for 25 years and was used solely in OEM [[Ford]] applications. Dana 50's were made as front axles only. The Dana 50 has a "50" cast in to the housing and is regarded to have more strength than a [[Dana 44]], but not as much as a [[Dana 60]]. It was only produced in a reverse cut gear set aka a high pinion.

The Dana 50 was made as a solid axle and as a [[Twin Traction Beam]] (TTB) which pivots in the center allowing the wheels to move independently of each other. A unique quality of the Dana 50 axle is the lack of variation in both TTB and Solid axle versions, which simplifies repairs and upgrades. There were no carrier breaks and only one spline count (30 spline). Gross axle weight ratings were lowered by Ford for safety and tire reasons.

[[File:Dana50TTB.jpg|thumb|Dana 50 TTB from a 1996 F-250]]

__TOC__

==General Specifications==
* Ring gear measures 9.0".
* 30 Spline Axle shafts.
* Gear Ratios: 3.54:1 - 5.38:1
* No carrier breaks
* Pinion shaft diameter: 1.375"
* Pinion shaft splines: 26

==Twin Traction Beam==
The Twin Traction Beam or TTB was used in the Ford F-250 from 1980 to 1997. The TTB Dana 50 was also used selectively in the F-350 from 1980 to 1986. The [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVW]] was lower in a F-350 with a TTB Dana 50, than a F-350 with a solid axle. The [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] of a TTB Dana 50 was 4600&amp;nbsp;lbs.

*The Dana 50 TTB spindles will accept the Dana 60 hubs however the knuckles ''are not'' interchangeable. 
*All Dana 50 TTB axles were leaf sprung axles.

==Solid Axle==
The solid axle Dana 50 was used in the Ford F-250 and the F-350 from 1999 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivetrainshop.com/Dana_50_s/88.htm|title=Dana 50 specs|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This axle was also the only OEM axle used in [[Four-wheel drive]] [[Ford Excursion]]s. The GAWR of a solid axle Dana 50 is 5000&amp;nbsp;lbs.

''' Design history ''' is the study of objects of design in their historical and stylistic contexts.

With a broad definition, the contexts of design history include the social, the cultural, the economic, the political, the technical and the aesthetic. Design history has as its objects of study all designed objects including those of [[architecture]], [[fashion]], [[crafts]], [[interiors]], [[textiles]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]] and [[product design]].

Design history has had to incorporate criticism of the 'heroic' structure of its discipline, in response to the establishment of [[material culture]], much as [[art history]] has had to respond to [[visual culture]], (although visual culture has been able to broaden the subject area of art history through the incorporation of the televisual, film and new media). Design history has done this by shifting its focus towards the acts of production and consumption.

== Design history as a component of British practice-based courses ==

Design history also exists as a component of many practice-based courses.

The teaching and study of design history within art and design programs in Britain are one of the results of the National Advisory Council on Art Education in the 1960s. Among its aims was making art and design education a legitimate academic activity, to which ends a historical perspective was introduced. This necessitated the employment or ‘buying in’ of specialists from art history disciplines, leading to a particular style of delivery: “Art historians taught in the only way that art historians knew how to teach;  they switched off the lights, turned on the slide projector, showed slides of art and design objects, discussed and evaluated them and asked (art and design) students to write essays – according to the scholarly conventions of academia”.&lt;ref&gt;Raein, M. (2005). "Integration of studio and theory in the teaching of graphic design." Art, Design &amp; Communication in Higher Education 3(3): 163–174&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious effect of the traditional approach design history as sequential, in which X begat Y and Y begat Z. This has pedagogical implications in that the realization that assessment requires a fact-based regurgitation of received knowledge leads students to ignore discussions of the situations surrounding a design’s creation and reception and to focus instead on simple facts such as who designed what and when.

This 'heroic/aesthetic' view – the idea that there are a few great designers who should be studied and revered unquestioningly – arguably instills an unrealistic view of the design profession. Although the design industry has been complicit in promoting the heroic view of history, the establishment of the UK government of [[Creative &amp; Cultural Skills]] has led to calls for design courses to be made less 'academic' and more attuned to the 'needs' of the industry. Design history, as a component of design courses, is under increasing threat in the UK at least and it has been argued that its survival depends on an increased focus on the study of the processes and effects of design rather than the lives of designers themselves.

Ultimately it appears that design history for practice-based courses is rapidly becoming a branch of social and cultural studies, leaving behind its art historical roots. This has led to a great deal of debate as the two approaches forge distinct pedagogical approaches and philosophies.

=== Debates over the merits of different approaches to teaching design history on practice-based courses ===

The debate over the best way to approach the teaching of design history to practice-based students is often heated, but it is notable that the biggest push to adopt a 'realistic' approach (i.e. non-hero-based, analysing the production and consumption of design that would otherwise be viewed as ephemeral) comes from teachers delivering these programmes, while critics are predominantly those who teach 'pure' design history courses.

The biggest criticism of the 'realistic' approach appears to be that it imposes anonymity on designers, while the counter argument is that the vast majority of designers ''are'' anonymous and that it is the uses and users of design that are more important.

The research literature suggests that, contrary to critics' predictions of the death of design history, this realistic approach is beneficial. Baldwin and McLean at the University of Brighton (now at the University of Dundee and Edinburgh College of Art respectively) reported attendance figures for courses using this model rising dramatically,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, J and McLean, S "Abandoning History: delivering historical and critical studies to practice-based students" at the New Views conference, LCC 29 October 2005. [http://www.jonathanbaldwin.co.uk/assets/AbandoningHistory.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and improved interest in the subject, as did Rain at Central St. Martin's. This compares with the often-reported low attendance and low grades of practice-based students facing the 'death by slideshow' model.

'''ERIH PLUS''' (originally called the '''European Reference Index for the Humanities''' or '''ERIH''') is an [[abstracting and indexing system|index]] containing bibliographic information on [[academic journal]]s in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/erihplus/about/index |title=About |work=ERIH PLUS |publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index includes all journals that meet the following requirements: "explicit procedures for external peer review; an academic editorial board, with members affiliated with universities or other independent research organizations; a valid ISSN code, confirmed by the international ISSN register; abstracts in English and/or another international language relevant for the field for all published articles; information on author affiliations and addresses; a maximum two thirds of the authors published in the journal from the same institution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/erihplus/about/criteria_for_inclusion |title=Criteria for inclusion |work=ERIH PLUS |publisher=[[Norwegian Social Science Data Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERIH was originally established by the [[European Science Foundation]] and was transferred to the [[Norwegian Social Science Data Services]] in 2014, mainly because it already operates the [[Norwegian Scientific Index]].&lt;ref name="uniforum" /&gt; At the same time it was extended to also include social science disciplines and renamed ERIH PLUS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/erihplus/ ERIH PLUS], Norwegian Social Science Data Services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17025">The '''EVR model''' is a [[life cycle assessment]] based method to analyse consumption patterns, business strategies and design options in terms of eco-efficient value creation. Next to this it is used to compare products and service systems (e.g. [[benchmarking]]).

The '''eco-costs/value ratio''' ('''EVR''') is an indicator to reveal sustainable and un[[sustainable consumption]] patterns of people. The [[eco-costs]] is an indicator for the environmental pollution of the products people buy, the value is the price they pay for it in our free market economy. Example: When somebody spends 1000 euro per month on housing (in Europe: EVR approx. 0,3) it is less harmful for the environment than when 1000 euro is spend on diesel (in Europe: EVR approx. 1,0). See section 3.1.

The EVR is also relevant for business strategies, because companies are facing the slow but inevitable internalization of environmental costs. At the moment the costs of products don't take into account the environmental damage caused by these products. This "pollution is for free" mentality is less and less accepted by communities.

The EVR makes companies aware of the relative importance of the environmental pollution of their products, and the relative risk they run that future production costs will increase because of this internalization of environmental costs. 
By using the EVR, companies can make decisions for their product portfolio: abandon products with low value and high environmental costs and stimulate products with high value and low environmental costs. See sections 2.3 and 3.2.

==Background information==
The EVR model has been introduced in 1998 and published in 2000–2004 in the International Journal of LCA,&lt;ref&gt;Vogtländer J.: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m464712867ph38k0/fulltext.pdf "The virtual eco-costs '99 A single LCA-based indicator for sustainability and the eco-costs-value ratio (EVR) model for economic allocation"], International Journal of LCA, 2001, 6 (3) pp 157-166&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Journal of Cleaner Production.&lt;ref&gt;Vogtländer J.: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6VFX-44CVVBS-8-11&amp;_cdi=6022&amp;_user=499885&amp;_orig=search&amp;_coverDate=02%2F28%2F2002&amp;_sk=999899998&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVlz-zSkzV&amp;md5=9fcd2ef852be07c9b7de3b4fb3b9b3eb&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf " Communicating the eco-efficiency of products and services by means of the eco-costs/value model"], Journal of Cleaner Production 10, 2002, pp 57-67&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of EVR is based on [[eco-costs]]. In 2007, 2012 and in 2017, the eco-costs system was updated. General databases of eco-costs are provided (open source) at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com] of Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands). In 2010 a book named "LCA-based assessment of sustainability: the Eco-costs/Value Ratio (EVR)"&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Vogtländer;[http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b004.htm ''LCA-based assessment of sustainability: the Eco-costs/Value Ratio (EVR)''], VSSD, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was published containing the most important articles about the EVR.

==Working principle==

===The model===
EVR = Eco-costs/value. The basic idea of the EVR model is to link the '[[value chain]]'&lt;ref&gt;Porter, M. E.: Competitive advantage, Free Press, New York 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  to the ecological product chain. In the value chain, the added value (in terms of money) and the added costs are determined for each step of the product 'from cradle to grave'. Similarly, the ecological impact of each step in the product chain is expressed in terms of money, the so-called '[[eco-costs]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Vogtländer J.G. [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com] Website. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 1. Note that there exists also a Porter chain from the right to the left in Figure 1, starting with waste and adding value by recycling. In this way the Porter chain becomes circular.

===Eco-costs===
[[Eco-costs]] express the amount of environmental burden of a product on basis of prevention of that burden. They are the marginal prevention costs (money) which should be made to reduce the environmental pollution and materials depletion in our world to a level which is in line with the carrying capacity of our earth.

As such, the eco-costs are virtual costs, since they are not yet integrated in the real life costs of current production chains (Life Cycle Costs). The eco-costs should be regarded as hidden obligations.
 
For example: for each 1000&amp;nbsp;kg {{CO2}} emission, one should invest €135,- in offshore windmill parks (or other {{CO2}} reduction systems at that price or less). When this is done consequently, the total {{CO2}} emissions in the world will be reduced by 65% compared to the emissions in 2008. As a result global warming will stabilise. In short: "the eco-costs of 1000kg {{CO2}} are € 135,-".
Similar calculations can be made on the environmental burden of acidification, eutrification, summer smog, fine dust, eco-toxicity, and the use of metals, fossil fuels and land (nature).

Eco-costs are used in Life Cycle Assessment, [[Life Cycle Assessment|LCA]], to assess the environmental performance of different materials, processes and End of Life methods.

===Of products===
[[File:EVR Eco-costs costs value bars.gif|350px|right|thumb|Figure 2: The decomposition of 'virtual eco-costs', costs and value of a product.]]

The EVR combines eco-cost and value to see whether a product will be successful. The product should have low environmental impact in its lifecycle (low eco-costs) and an attractive value for consumers.  The value here is the market value (perceived customer value, also called fair price).  Figure 2 depicts the three dimensions of a product: the value, the costs and the eco-costs.

It is a trend in society that heavy pollution of industry is not accepted anymore by the inhabitants of a country. This results in stricter regulations by countries (e.g. tradable emission rights, enforcement of best available technologies, eco-taxes, etc.). Eco-costs will then become part of the internal production costs. This internalizing of eco-costs might be a threat to a company, but it might also be an opportunity: “When my product has less eco-burden than that of my competitor, my product can withstand stricter regulations of the government. So this characteristic of low eco-costs of my product is a competitive edge.” 
To analyse the short term and the long term market prospects of a product or a product service combination (Product Service System, PSS), each product or PPS can be positioned in the portfolio matrix of Figure 3. The basic idea of the product portfolio matrix is the notion that a product, service or PSS is characterized by: 
* its short term market potential: high value/costs ratio
* its long term market requirement: low eco-costs.

[[File:product portfolio EVR.png|350px|left|thumb|Figure 3: Product portfolio matrix for EVR product strategy of companies.]]In terms of product strategy, the matrix results in 3 strategic directions:

# enhance the value/costs ratio of a green design to create a bigger market
# lower the eco-costs of current successful products to make it fit for future markets
# abandon products with a low value/ costs ratio (not much profit, small market) and high eco-costs

For many 'green designs', the usual problem is that they have a low current value/costs ratio. In most of the cases the production costs are higher than the production costs of the classic solution, in some cases even the (perceived) quality is poor. There are two ways to do something about it:

a. enhance the (perceived) quality of the product

b. attach to the product a service (create a PSS) in a way that the value of the bundle of the product and the service is more than the value of its components.

For a product which has a good present value/costs ratio, but high eco-costs, the product and the production process have to be redesigned to lower the eco-costs. This road towards [[sustainability]] is often far more promising than the strategy of enhancing the value/costs ratio of a green design. [[File:Figure 4 product strategy matrix.jpg|330px|right|thumb|Figure 4: Design strategies to enhance the EVR of a product.]]The reason is that the economies of scale for production and distribution are available and that the new product is marketed to an existing client base which is used to the brand name, the quality standards, the service system, etc.

Note: The most common fear of business managers is that their new green products end up with a deteriorated value/costs ratio, and hence will have a cumbersome position in the market. The stability of the governmental policy plays an important role here. When governmental regulations which level the playing field are postponed or even abandoned, proactive companies with sound product strategies are harmed. This can cause severe damage to the transition process and may lead to reluctance of players to move proactively in the future.
 
The most successful design options are depicted in Figure 4. The best design strategy is: 
* to increase value where value is high
* to decrease the eco-costs where the eco-costs are high

==Use==

===De-linking===
[[File:Consumers spending NL.JPG|340px|right|thumb|Figure 5. The consumer's side: preference of expenditures in Dutch households.]]
[[File:Spending.JPG|340px|right|thumb|Figure 6. The EVR and the total expenditures of all consumers in the EU25 (from EIPRO)]]
In economics, de-linking (also known as [[Decoupling (organizational studies)|decoupling]]) is often used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. In this context, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without corresponding increases in environmental pressure. In many economies increasing production (GDP) would involve increased pressure on the environment. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth, without also experiencing a worsening of environmental conditions, is said to be de-linked.

There is a consumer's side of the de-linking of economy and ecology. Under the assumption that most of the households spend in their life what they earn in their life, the total EVR of the spending of households is the key towards sustainability. Only when this total EVR of the spending gets lower, the eco-costs related to the total spending can be reduced even at a higher level of spending. There are two ways of achieving this: 
* At the production side: the improvement of eco-efficiency ('lowering EVR') of products and services by the industry
* At the consumer's side: the change of lifestyle of customers in the direction of 'low EVR' products.

At the production side, society is heading in the right direction: gradually, industrial production is achieving higher levels of the value/costs ratio and is at the same time becoming cleaner. At the consumer's side, however, society is suffering from the fact that the consumers preferences are heading in the wrong direction: towards products and services with an unfavourable EVR (like driving in SUVs, more kilometres, intercontinental flights for holidays). These unfavourable preferences can be concluded from Figure 5.

Figure 5 shows that people in the Netherlands (and probably in the other EC countries as well) spend relatively more money on cars and holidays when they have more money available. Other studies show that people tend to have intercontinental holidays at the moment they can afford it. This shift in consumer spending will become a big problem in the near future, since the EVR of e.g. housing and health care is much lower than the EVR of transport and (inter)continental holidays by plane. 
Figure 6 shows the EVR (= ecocosts/price) on the Y/axis as a function of the cumulative expenditures of all products and services of all citizens in the EU 25 on the X-axis. The data is from the EIPRO study of the European Commission (EIPRO = environmental impact of products).

The area underneath the curve is proportional to the total eco-costs of the EU25. Basically there are two strategies to reduce the area under the curve: - ask industry to reduce the eco-costs of their products (this will shift the curve downward) - try to reduce expenditures of consumers in high end of the curve, and let them spend this money at the low end of the curve (this will shift the middle part of the curve to the right). 
The question is now how designers and engineers can contribute to this required shift towards sustainability and what this means to product portfolio strategies of companies. The solution is Eco-efficient Value Creation.

===Eco-efficient value creation===
[[File:double objective EVR.png|350px|right|thumb|Figure 7: The double objectvive for design &amp; engineering: less eco-costs, more value.]]
The way towards sustainability requires a double aim in product innovation, see Figure 7: 
* lower eco-costs, and at the same time
* higher value (a higher market price).

We call this: eco-efficient value creation. 
The reason we need value creation for eco-efficient products is threefold:

# the higher price in the market is required to cover the higher production cost of green products (note that a higher price is only accepted by the consumer when the perceived value is higher, otherwise the consumer will not buy the product)
# the higher price prevents the rebound effect
# lowering the EVR appears the key to a sustainable development at the level of countries (Figure 6)

Below, an example of eco-efficient value creation is given, which is the introduction of the [[Lexus RX (XU30)|Lexus RX 400h]] in the USA: 
* the customer value has increased, by emphasising its combined power and comfort (from the advertisement in the US: "……While it may have a V6 engine under the hood, the extra boost from the electric-drive motor gives the vehicle the acceleration power of a V8……. and the noise levels in Lexus hybrid vehicles have been reduced even more")
*  the eco-costs of driving are lower, since its excellent overall fuel economy

Note that the acceleration of a car is an interesting issue in terms of value. High acceleration is associated with expensive sports cars (Porsche, Ferrari). But people who buy these fast cars hardly use it. For these people acceleration is more part of the image of the product than it is part of the product qualities they use on a daily basis. So reducing the acceleration is the wrong strategy: it eliminates the extra value, and it hardly reduces the overall eco-costs in practice.

===Environmental benchmarking in LCA===
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the generally accepted method to compare two (or more) alternative products or services. A prerequisite for such a comparison is that the functionality ('functional unit') and the quality of the alternatives are the same (you cannot compare [[apples and oranges]] in the classical LCA). In cases of product design and architecture, however, this prerequisite seems to be a fundamental flaw in the application of LCA: the designer or architect is aiming at a better quality (in the broad sense of the word: including intangible aspects like beauty and image), so the new design never has the same quality. In some cases the functionality of the design is not the same, since the design solution is limited by a maximum budget, in some cases the functionality is the same, but the higher quality results in a higher price. In all these cases a single indicator in LCA (like the eco-costs) is not suitable for environmental benchmarking.
In these cases however, it does make sense to compare the design alternatives on the basis of the eco-costs/value ratio (EVR), where the value is the perceived customer value (the fair price). See section 3.1 on Delinking.

Example 1. Different types of armchairs differ in terms of comfort, aesthetics, etc. rather than in terms of functionality. A classical LCA (with a single indicator like eco-costs, carbon footprint, etc.) does not make sense here. Selection on the basis of EVR, however, is the key to a sustainable consumption pattern. The chair with the lowest EVR is the best solution in terms of sustainability.

Example 2. In LCA, the comparison of a new building and a renovated building is in the majority of cases not possible, since, in practice, both solutions differ in almost all quality aspects (tangible as well as intangible). However, the solution with lowest EVR is the best in terms of sustainable consumption.

Note that the renovated building is the best solution in most of the cases, because it has the lowest EVR in the production phase. However, in some cases the renovated building is not the best solution, because of unfavourable energy consumption (high EVR) in the use phase.

'''Emanuel Tov''' ({{lang-he|עמנואל טוב}}; born September 15, 1941, Amsterdam, Netherlands) is [[emeritus Professor]] in the Department of [[Bible]] at the [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]].

==Biography==
Emanuel Tov was born in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]] during the German occupation (1941). When he was one year old his parents entrusted him to the care of a [[Christian]] family. His parents perished in the [[Holocaust]], and following the war he grew up with his uncle and aunt as one of their children. He studied at a “gymnasium”, where he learned classical and modern European languages, and at the same time learned [[Hebrew]] at [[Talmud Torah]]. From age 14, he was active in the [[Zionism|Zionistic]] youth movement “Ichud Habonim” and served as one of its leaders. At age 18, the movement sent him to [[Israel]] for training as a leader and in 1960 he became the general secretary of that movement in the Netherlands. In 1961, he immigrated to Israel. He studied at the Hebrew University ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] Bible; [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] Bible and [[Greek literature]]), while serving also as an assistant in the Bible Dept. and at the Hebrew University Bible Project. In 1967-1969, he continued his studies at the Dept. for [[Near Eastern]] Studies and Languages at Harvard University. His dissertation, written under the guidance of Professors [[Shemaryahu Talmon]] of the Hebrew University and [[Frank Moore Cross]] of [[Harvard University]], was submitted to the Hebrew University in 1973 as “The [[Septuagint]] Translation of [[Jeremiah]] and [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]].” Upon his return to Israel, he served as an “assistant” at the [[University of Haifa]] and at the Hebrew University.

In 1986, he was appointed Professor at the Hebrew University and in 1990 he became the J. L. Magnes Professor of Bible Studies. Served as visiting Professor at the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]], [[Doshisha University|Doshisha]] (Kyoto), Macquarie and [[University of Sydney|Sydney]] (Australia), [[Stellenbosch University|Stellenbosch]] (South Africa), [[Vrije Universiteit]] (Amsterdam), [[University of Pennsylvania]] (Philadelphia), the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] (Rome), and Halle (Germany). He stayed at Institutes for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study|NIAS]] (the Netherlands), Annenberg (Philadelphia), Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies and the Lichtenberg Kolleg (Göttingen, Germany).

From 1990-2009 he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the international Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project, which during those years produced 33 volumes of the series ''[[Discoveries in the Judean Desert]]'' as well as two [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]]s
.&lt;ref&gt;Full list of the volumes is found in
the introductory volume: E. Tov (ed.), The Texts from the Judaean Desert: Indices and an Introduction to the Discoveries in the Judaean Desert Series (DJD XXXIX; Oxford: Clarendon, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also published an electronic edition of all the extra-biblical [[Qumran]] scrolls and a six-volume printed edition of the scrolls meant for the general public. 
&lt;ref&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls Reader, Parts 1-6  (Leiden/ Boston: E. J. Brill, 2004-2005; second revised edition, 2014). 
&lt;/ref&gt; He also created electronic
editions of the Hebrew and Greek Bible.&lt;ref&gt;See Tov's

==Research==

===Septuagint===

Emanuel Tov's studies on the Septuagint focused first on inner-translational developments and gradually moved to the importance of this translation for the study of the Bible: the early revisions of the Septuagint, translation technique, the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Greek translation, the value of the Septuagint for the textual study of the Hebrew Bible, the importance of certain Septuagint books for the exegesis of the Hebrew books and the understanding of their literary development, the place of the Hebrew source of the Septuagint in the development of the text of the Bible.
&lt;ref&gt;See items 3*, 7a*, 65, 181, 207 in [http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~tov Tov's bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728184807/http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~tov/ |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tov's initial publications on the Septuagint deal with that translation's early revisions that were intended to approximate the Greek text to the Hebrew text current in Israel from the 1st century BCE until the 2nd century CE. For that research, he established sound principles by determining the criteria for defining and characterizing the revisions. His preoccupation with matters of translation technique and the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint was influenced by his practical work in the HUBP (Hebrew University Bible Project). In that research, he combined the field work in that project with the formulation of abstract rules for the evaluation of details in the Septuagint, constantly cross-fertilizing both areas. These rules were formulated in his theoretical book on the Septuagint that grew out of his courses at the Hebrew University, each year on a different Bible book
&lt;ref&gt;The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (Third Edition, Completely Revised and Enlarged; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2015). 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the focus of Tov's interest moved to the importance of the Septuagint for biblical scholarship, both for textual and literary criticism. In several books, the Septuagint reflects a Hebrew basis that needs to be taken into consideration in the exegesis of those books beyond small details, both when, according to Tov, the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint preceded the Masoretic Text (Joshua, 1 Samuel 16–18, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.) and when it serves as an exegetical layer reacting to the forerunner of the Masoretic Text (1 Kings, Esther, and Daniel). According to Tov, in all these books the exegete of the Hebrew books must take the Greek translation into consideration. A precondition for this procedure is that the analysis of the translation technique as described in the previous paragraph will have established that the Septuagint is a good source for analyzing the text that lay in front of him. From among all the early witnesses of the biblical text, the best ones for analyzing the stages of its literary development are the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, a few Qumran texts and the Samaritan Pentateuch. Tov believes that the analysis of early witnesses such as the Septuagint enriches our exegesis and helps us in understanding the last stages of the development of the biblical literature in specific books.

===Development of the Bible text===

Emanuel Tov does not describe the development of the biblical text based on abstract theories, but tries to take the evidence of the ancient manuscripts and versions as his point of departure. It is clear that in antiquity many versions of the Bible were circulating, as is evident from the textual plurality at Qumran. All the manuscripts differed from one another, but within that plurality one may recognize some groups (families). Tov  qualified this plurality by providing  the internal statistics of the different types of the Qumran scrolls. He also described the socio-religious background of some groups of the Judean Desert scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;See items 171 and 178 in Tov's bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important link in this argumentation is the group of the so-called 4QReworked Pentateuch texts.  Ten years after Tov published this group of  documents
,&lt;ref&gt;Together with S. A. White: “4QReworked Pentateuchb–e and 4QTemple?“ in H. Attridge et al., in consultation with J. VanderKam, Qumran Cave 4.VIII, Parabiblical Texts, Part 1 (DJD XIII; Oxford:  
Clarendon, 1994) 187–351, 459–63 and plates XIII–XXXXVI&lt;/ref&gt;  he realized that these texts do not reflect a single non-biblical rewritten Pentateuch composition, but  a cluster of biblical texts that included many exegetical elements. These texts reflect a link in the series of developing biblical texts. 
&lt;ref&gt;See items 206a and 216 in Tovs bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tov's studies on the Septuagint and 4QReworked Pentateuch led him to new thoughts regarding the development of the last stages of the biblical books and the original text of these books. In his view, the early stages of the biblical books such as reflected in the Septuagint of 1 Samuel, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, show that the formulations of these books developed stage by stage. This reconstructed development makes it difficult to posit an original text of the biblical books. In Tov's view, there was not one original text, but a series of “original texts.” This view developed after the appearance of the second edition of his  Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible (2001) and was emphasized more in
the third edition (2012).
&lt;ref&gt;See “The Many Forms of Scripture: Reflections in Light of the LXX and 4QReworked Pentateuch,” in From Qumran to Aleppo: A Discussion with Emanuel Tov about the Textual History of Jewish Scriptures in Honor of his 65th Birthday (ed. A. Lange et al.; FRLANT 230; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2009) 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The development of the text of the Torah===
In studies primarily carried out in the 2010s, Tov focused on the
special textual status of the Torah.
&lt;ref&gt;See items 210, 224,
244, 260, 261, 264, 283, 290 in the bibliography in the website&lt;/ref&gt;
In his view, the textual development of the Torah differed from that
of all other Scripture books, probably because of its popularity.
The Masoretic Text reflects the presumed original text better than
all other preserved texts, all of which reflect more secondary
elements than MT, especially the one-time joined tradition of the
Samaritan Pentateuch and the LXX. Further, the number of the 
non-Masoretic textual branches in the Torah is much larger than in
all other Scripture books.

===Dead Sea Scrolls and the Qumran scribes===

Emanuel Tov dealt with various aspects of the Qumran scrolls, but his most central publications pertain to the Qumran scribes. In 2004, he published a detailed monograph on the scribal practices reflected in the Qumran scrolls,   suggesting that the information about these scribal practices allows us to obtain a better understanding of the Qumran scrolls. 
&lt;ref&gt;Scribal Practices and Approaches Reflected in the Texts Found in the Judean Desert (STDJ 54; Leiden/Boston: E. J. Brill, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
This monograph describes the technical aspects of all the Judean Desert texts, such as the measurements of the columns and sheets, the beginnings and ends of scrolls, systems of correcting mistakes, orthography systems, and a classification of the scrolls according to these parameters.

An important part of this description is Tov's theory on the Qumran scribes. Since 1986, Tov has suggested the division of the Qumran scrolls into two groups distinguished by external features. Group 1 is written in a special spelling (forms like ki’), specials linguistic forms (like malkehemah, me’odah), and special scribal habits (writing the divine name in the old Hebrew script, erasing elements with lines and writing cancellation dots above and below words and letters, writing dots in the margins guiding the drawing of the lines, etc.). The great majority of the Qumran sectarian scrolls belong to this group; hence Tov's suggestion that these scrolls were written by sectarian scribes, possibly at Qumran. These scribes copied biblical as well as extra-biblical scrolls, altogether one-third of the Qumran scrolls, while the other scrolls (group 2) were brought to Qumran from outside, from one or more localities.
&lt;ref&gt;For the latest formulation of this view, see item 13 in list 4 below, "Books Authored" (Scribal Practices)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer-assisted research of the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls===

Emanuel Tov believes that the examination of the Bible and Dead Sea Scrolls needs to be aided by computer-assisted research and that therefore databases and computer programs need to be developed. He supervised the electronic encoding of the Leningrad Codex in the 1980s.
&lt;ref&gt;This encoding was published among others in: JPS Hebrew–English Tanakh: The Traditional Hebrew Text and the New JPS Translation (2d. ed.; Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, he also embarked upon a research project together with Prof. Robert A. Kraft of the University of Pennsylvania (CATSS = Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint Studies). That project, based in Philadelphia and Jerusalem, created a comparative database of all the words in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint. It was published as a module within the Accordance program (subsequently also within Bible Works and Logos). With the aid of that program, which allows for advanced searches and statistical research, several such investigations have been carried out by Tov and others.
&lt;ref&gt;
For a listing, see Tov's website under bibliography, CATSS
&lt;/ref&gt;
Another database edited by Tov contains all the texts and images of the para-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls, in the original languages and in translation, with morphological analysis and search programs.  All these programs serve the international community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7382">'''Ernst Terhardt''' (born 11 December 1934) is a German engineer and [[psychoacoustician]] who made significant contributions in diverse areas of audio communication including pitch perception, music cognition, and [[Fourier transformation]].  He was professor in the area of acoustic communication at the Institute of Electroacoustics, Technical University of Munich, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Parncutt, R. (2014). Thinking outside the box: A tribute to Ernst Terhardt on his 80th birthday. Zeitschrift für Audiologie (Audiological Acoustics), 53 (4), 166-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kollmeier, B. (2000). Laudatio für Prof. Dr. Ing. Ernst Terhardt anläßlich der Verleihung der Ehrenmitgliedschaft der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Audiologie. http://www.dga-ev.com/ehrenmitglieder/terhardt/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Terhardt studied electrical engineering at the [[University of Stuttgart]]. His Master's thesis (Diplomarbeit) was entitled "Ein Funktionsmodell des Gehörs" (A functional model of hearing). His Dissertation was entitled "Beitrag zur Ermittlung der informationstragenden Merkmale von Schallen mit Hilfe der Hörempfindungen" (literally, "Contribution to determination of information-carrying characteristics of sounds with the help of auditory sensations"). Both projects were supervised by [[Eberhard Zwicker]], with whom he founded the Institute for Electroacoustics, Technical University of Munich in 1967. Terhardt's Habilitation thesis (1972) was entitled "Ein Funktionsschema der Tonhöhenwahrnehmung von Klängen" (A model of pitch perception in complex sounds).

==Pitch perception==

According to Terhardt’s theory of pitch perception,&lt;ref&gt;Terhardt, E. (1972). Zur Tonhöhenwahrnehmung von Klängen [On the perception of pitch in complex sounds]. Acustica, 26, 173-199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terhardt, E., Stoll, G., &amp; Seewann, M. (1982). Algorithm for extraction of pitch and pitch salience from complex tonal signals. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 71(3), 679-688.&lt;/ref&gt; pitch perception can be divided into two separate stages: auditory spectral analysis and harmonic pitch pattern recognition. In the first stage, the inner ear (cochlea and basilar membrane) performs a running spectral analysis of the incoming signal. The parameters of this analysis (e.g. the effective length and shape of the analysis window) depend directly on physiology and indirectly on the co-evolution of ear and voice as our human and prehuman ancestors interacted with their social and physical environments.  The output of this first stage is called a spectral pitch pattern, when it is determined by psychoacoustic experiments in which listeners make subjective judgments, matching the perceived pitch of a pure reference tone to that of a successively presented complex tone. The spectral pitches differ in perceptual salience since their sound pressure levels differ physically, they lie at different distances above the threshold of hearing, they mask each other (and therefore lie at different distances above the masked threshold), and may or may not lie in a region to which the ear is particularly sensitive (a dominance region of pitch perception). A cornerstone of Terhardt’s is approach is the idea that because spectral pitches are subjective, we must not jump to conclusions about the relationship between them and their physiological (physical) foundations in the ear and brain.

In second stage of pitch perception, harmonic patterns among the spectral pitches are spontaneously recognized by the auditory system, in a process analogous to pattern recognition in vision. The output of this stage is a set of virtual pitches that correspond approximately to the fundamentals of approximately harmonic series of pitches. In this process, the auditory system tolerates a certain degree of mistuning, for two main reasons. First, the partials of complex tones in the environment may be physically mistuned relative to a harmonic series (e.g. piano tones). Second, the frequencies of partials may be known only approximately due to the uncertainty principle: the shorter is the effective time window, the less accurately can the frequency be known. The auditory system is physically unable to determine frequencies accurately in very short sound presentations, or in tones that are changing quickly in fundamental frequency, for example in speech.

If only one virtual pitch is perceived in a sound, it is generally the one with the highest salience. The output of Terhardt’s algorithm for pitch perception is a series of virtual pitches of differing salience, of which the most salient is the prediction for “the” pitch of the sound. The existence of several competing virtual pitches can explain the ambiguity of the pitch of many sounds. Bells with non-harmonic spectra are an obvious example (it is often possible to hear the main virtual pitch as the strike tone at the start of the sound, and the main spectral pitch as a hum tone which becomes directly audible as the sound dies away). But Terhardt and his colleagues also demonstrated that regular harmonic complex tones in speech and music are slightly ambiguous in pitch, which may be the ultimate origin of octave equivalence in music and the perceived tonal affinity of successive tones at octave or fifth intervals. 
Terhardt claimed that the root of a chord in western music typically corresponds to its most salient virtual pitch, and that the virtual pitch phenomenon is the ultimate origin of the root effect. He also investigated the perception of roughness in music and claimed that musical consonance and dissonance has two main psychoacoustic components, roughness and harmony, harmony being related to the perception of virtual pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Terhardt, E. (1974). Pitch, consonance, and harmony. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 55(5), 1061-1069.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustic communication==

Terhardt’s approach to acoustic communication &lt;ref&gt;Terhardt, E. (1998). Akustische Kommunikation. Berlin: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on Karl Popper’s theory of three worlds &lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. (1972). Objective knowledge: An evolutionary approach. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; according to which reality is either physical, experiential (perception, sensations, emotions) or abstract (thoughts, knowledge, information, culture). Terhardt maintains that these three aspects of acoustic communication must be carefully separated before we empirically explore the relationships between them. In the physical world, we consider the physics of sound sources such as the voice and musical instruments; auditory environments including reflectors; electroacoustic systems such as microphones and loudspeakers; and the ear and brain, considered as a purely physical system. Sound is a signal that is that is analysed by the ear; to understand this process, we need foundations of signal processing. To understand auditory perception, we perform psychoacoustic experiments, which are generally about relationships between and among Popper’s three worlds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17955">'''Expectancy-value theory''' has been developed in many different fields including education, health, communications, marketing and economics. Although the model differs in its meaning and implications for each field, the general idea is that there are expectations as well as values or beliefs that affect subsequent behavior.

==Education model==

===History and model overview===
[[John William Atkinson]] developed the expectancy-value theory in the 1950s and 1960s in an effort to understand the achievement motivation of individuals.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"&gt;Eccles, J. (1983). Expectancies, values, and academic behaviors. In J. T. Spence (Ed.), Achievement and achievement motives: Psychological and sociological approaches (pp. 75-146). San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[Jacquelynne Eccles]] expanded this research into the field of education.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; According to expectancy-value theory, students' achievement and achievement related choices are most proximally determined by two factors,&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; expectancies for success, and subjective task values. Expectancies refer to how confident an individual is in his or her ability to succeed in a task whereas task values refer to how important, useful, or enjoyable the individual perceives the task. Theoretical&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt;  and empirical;&lt;ref name="Nagengast2011"&gt;Nagengast, B., Marsh, H. W., Scalas, L. F., Xu, M. K., Hau, K. T., &amp; Trautwein, U. (2011). Who took the "×" out of expectancy-value theory? A psychological mystery, a substantive-methodological synergy, and a cross-national generalization. Psychological Science, 22(8), 1058-1066.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trautwein2012"&gt;Trautwein, U., Marsh, H. W., [[Nagengast, B.]], Lüdtke, O., Nagy, G., &amp; Jonkmann, K. (2012). Probing for the multiplicative term in modern expectancy–value theory: A latent interaction modeling study. Journal of educational psychology, 104(3), 763-777.&lt;/ref&gt; work suggests that expectancies and values interact to predict important outcomes such as engagement, continuing interest, and academic achievement.  Other factors, including demographic characteristics, [[Stereotype|stereotypes]], prior experiences, and perceptions of others' beliefs and behaviors affect achievement related outcomes indirectly through these expectancies and values. This model has most widely been applied and used in research in the field of education.

===Expectancies===
Expectancies are specific beliefs individuals have regarding their success on certain tasks they will carry out in the short-term future or long-term future.&lt;ref name="EcclesWig2002"&gt;Eccles, J. S. &amp; Wigfield, A. (2002). Motivational beliefs, values, and goals. Annual Review of Psychology, 53, 109-132.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectancies an individual has shaped their behaviors as well as the choices they make. For example, a high school student might believe that they really struggle on standardized tests. This leads them to expect that they will perform poorly on the SAT. These beliefs then impact their actual performance on the SAT. These expectancies are tied to concepts such as self-concept and self-efficacy. [[Self-concept]] is a broad concept that involves one's beliefs about their own abilities to reach their goals.&lt;ref name="BongSkaalvik203"&gt;Bong, M. &amp; Skaalvik, E.M. (2003). Academic self-concept and self-efficacy: How different are they really?. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 15(1), 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-efficacy]] is similar in an academic context, because it involves one's beliefs about their abilities and competence; however, it is specific to certain domains, such as math and history.&lt;ref name="BongSkaalvik203"/&gt;

===Subjective task values===

According to Eccles and colleagues&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; subjective task value can be thought of the motivation that allows an individual to answer the question "Do I Want to do This Activity and Why?"&lt;ref name="WigCam2010A"&gt;Wigfield. A., Cambria. J., "Student's achievement values, goal orientations, and interest: Definitions, development, and relations to achievement outcomes, " ''Developmental Review'' 30, 2010, 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective task values can be broken into four subcategories:&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; Attainment Value (Importance for identity or self), Intrinsic Value (Enjoyment or Interest), Utility Value (Usefulness or Relevance), and Cost(loss of time, overly-high effort demands, loss of valued alternatives, or negative psychological experiences such as stress). Traditionally, attainment value and intrinsic value are more highly correlated. What's more, these two constructs tend to be related to intrinsic motivation, interest, and task persistence.&lt;ref name="Hulleman2008"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., Durik, A. M., Schweigert, S. B., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2008). Task values, achievement goals, and interest: An integrative analysis. Journal of Educational Psychology, 100(2), 398-416&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, utility value has both intrinsic and extrinsic components.&lt;ref name="SD&amp;W2004"&gt;Simons, J., Dewitte, S., &amp; Lens, W. (2004). The role of different types of instrumentality in motivation, study strategies, and performance: know why you learn, so you'll know what you learn! The British journal of educational psychology, 74(Pt 3), 343-60. doi:10.1348/0007099041552314&lt;/ref&gt; and has been related to both intrinsic and extrinsic outcomes such as course performance and interest.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2009). Promoting interest and performance in high school science classes. Science, 326(5958), 1410-1412&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that utility value has time-dependent characteristics as well.&lt;ref name="H&amp;L1999"&gt;Husman, J., &amp; Lens, W. (1999). The role of the future in student motivation. Educational Psychologist, 34(2), 113-125&lt;/ref&gt; Cost has been relatively neglected in the empirical research;&lt;ref name="WigCam2010A"/&gt; however, the construct has received some attention more recently.&lt;ref name="Luttrell2010"&gt;Luttrell, V. R., Callen, B. W., Allen, C. S., Wood, M. D., Deeds, D. G., &amp; Richard, D. C. (2010). The mathematics value inventory for general education students: Development and initial validation. Educational and Psychological measurement, 70(1), 142-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Feather combined subjective task values with more universal human values&lt;ref name="WE&amp;T2004"&gt;Wigfield, A., Tonks, S., &amp; Eccles, J. S. (2004). Expectancy-value theory in cross-cultural perspective. In D. M. McInerney &amp; S. Van Etten (Eds.), Research on sociocultural influences on motivation and learning, volume 4: Big theories revisited (pp. 165-198). Greenwich, CT: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that the former are just one type of general human motives that help to direct behavior.

===Applications===

====Developmental trajectories====
Researchers have found that expectancies and values can be distinguished as separate types of motivation as early as 6 years old.&lt;ref name="WigCam2010B"&gt;Wigfield, A., &amp; Cambria, J. (2010). Expectancy-value theory: Retrospective and prospective. Advances in motivation and achievement, 16, 35-70&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, types of value (e.g., attainment vs. utility) can be distinguished within an academic domain as early as fifth grade.&lt;ref name = "WigCam2010B"/&gt; Generally speaking, Eccles and colleagues&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; implicate a wide array of different factors that determine an individual's expectancies and values, including: 
* the cultural milieu
* socializer's beliefs and behaviors
* differential aptitudes of the individual
* previous achievement-related experiences
* individual perceptions of social beliefs
* individual's interpretations of experiences
* affective memories
* general goals
* self-concepts
Experts agree that student motivation tends to decline throughout their time in school.&lt;ref name="EcclesWig2002"/&gt; Longitudinal research has confirmed this general trend of motivational decline and also demonstrated that motivation is domain specific.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2002"&gt;Jacobs, J. E., Lanza, S., Osgood, D. W., Eccles, J. S., &amp; Wigfield, A. (2002). Changes in children's self-competence and values: Gender and domain differences across grades one through twelve. Child development, 73(2), 509-527&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also demonstrated that there are gender differences in motivation.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; Motivation decline is particularly steep for Math achievement, but less so for reading or sports domains among both boys and girls.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2002"/&gt; Researchers offer two general explanations for these declines in motivation.&lt;ref name="WE&amp;T2004"/&gt; The first is that students' conceptualizations of different domains become more complex and nuanced—they differentiate between subdomains, which results in an appearance of mean-level decrease. In fact, children as young as 11 years old have demonstrated that they can differentiate between academic domains.&lt;ref name="WigCam2010B"/&gt; The second is that the focus of their environment changes as they age. As students reach higher grades, the focus shifts from learning to achievement. In fact, a large body of research exists showing that shifts from learning to performance as an educational focus can be detrimental to student motivation.&lt;ref name="Hulleman2010"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., Schrager, S. M., Bodmann, S. M., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2010). A meta-analytic review of achievement goal measures: Different labels for the same constructs or different constructs with similar labels?. Psychological bulletin, 136(3), 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interventions====
Expectancy-value theory constructs can and have been applied to intervention programs that strive to change motivational beliefs. These interventions are able to increase expectancy&lt;ref name ="Blackwell2007"&gt;Blackwell, L. S., Trzesniewski, K. H., &amp; Dweck, C. S. (2007). Implicit theories of intelligence predict achievement across an adolescent transition: A longitudinal study and an intervention. Child development, 78(1), 246-263.&lt;/ref&gt; and value&lt;ref name = "Hulleman2010"/&gt; or decrease cost.&lt;ref name = "R&amp;B2011"&gt;Ramirez, G., &amp; Beilock, S. L. (2011). Writing about testing worries boosts exam performance in the classroom. science, 331(6014), 211-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Such interventions not only target motivation, but also ultimately increase general student achievement and help to close traditionally problematic achievement gaps.&lt;ref name = "H&amp;H2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Good2003"&gt;Good, C., Aronson, J., &amp; Inzlicht, M. (2003). Improving Adolescents' Standardized Test Performance: An Intervention to Reduce the Effects of Stereotype Threat. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 24, 645-662.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, value- focused interventions have been developed to help teachers design their curriculum in ways that allow students to see the connections between the material they learn in the classroom and their own lives.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"/&gt; Promoting interest and performance in high school science classes.&lt;ref name ="H&amp;H2009"/&gt; This intervention is able to boost student's performance and interest, particularly for students who have low initial expectancy. According to the expectancy-value theory, this intervention is effective because it increases students interest in the material.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"/&gt;

==Psychology, health, communications, marketing, and economics model==
Expectancy-value theory was originally created in order to explain and predict individual's attitudes toward objects and actions. Originally the work of [[psychologist]] [[Martin Fishbein]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}, the [[theory]] states that attitudes are developed and modified based on assessments about beliefs and values. Primarily, the theory attempts to determine the [[Mind|mental]] [[calculation]]s that take place in attitude development. Expectancy-value theory has been used to develop other theories and is still utilized today in numerous fields of study.

===History===
Dr. Martin Fishbein is credited with developing the expectancy-value theory (EVT) in the early to mid-1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It is sometimes referred to as Fishbein's expectancy-value theory or simply expectancy-value model. The primary work typically cited by scholars referring to EVT is Martin Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen]]'s 1975 book called ''Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research''. The seed work of EVT can be seen in Fishbein's doctoral dissertation, ''A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation of the Interrelation between Belief about an Object and the Attitude toward that Object'' (1961, UCLA) and two subsequent articles in 1962 and 1963 in the journal ''Human Relations''. Fishbein's work drew on the writings of researchers such as Ward Edwards, [[Milton J. Rosenberg]], Edward Tolman, and [[John B. Watson]].

===Concepts===
EVT has three basic components. First, individuals respond to novel information about an item or action by developing a belief about the item or action. If a belief already exists, it can and most likely will be modified by new information. Second, individuals assign a value to each attribute that a belief is based on. Third, an expectation is created or modified based on the result of a calculation based on beliefs and values. For example, a student finds out that a professor has a reputation for being humorous. The student assigns a positive value to humor in the classroom, so the student has the expectation that their experience with the professor will be positive. When the student attends class and finds the professor humorous, the student calculates that it is a good class. EVT also states that the result of the calculation, often called the "attitude", stems from complex equations that contain many belief/values pairs. Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) represented the theory with the following equation where attitudes (a) are a factorial function of beliefs (b) and values (v).

Theory of Reasoned Action:
Formula
In its simplest form, the TRA can be expressed as the following equation:
&lt;math&gt;BI {{=}} (AB)W_1 + (SN)W_2&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt;BI&lt;/math&gt; = behavioral intention

&lt;math&gt;(AB)&lt;/math&gt; = one's attitude toward performing the behavior

&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = empirically derived weights

&lt;math&gt;SN&lt;/math&gt; = one's subjective norm related to performing the behavior

(Source: Hale, 2002)

===Current usage===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fishbein and Ajzen expanded expectancy-value theory into the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA). Later Ajzen posited the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB) in his book ''Attitudes, Personality, and Behavior'' (1988). Both TRA and TPB address predictive and explanatory weaknesses with EVT and are still prominent theories in areas such as health communication research, marketing, and economics. Although not used as much since the early 1980s, EVT is still utilized in research within fields as diverse as audience research (Palmgreen &amp; Rayburn, 1985) advertising (Shoham, Rose, &amp; Kahle 1998; Smith &amp; Vogt, 1995), child development (Watkinson, Dwyer, &amp; Nielsen, 2005), education (Eklof, 2006; Ping, McBride, &amp; Breune, 2006), health communication (Purvis Cooper, Burgoon, &amp; Roter, 2001; Ludman &amp; Curry, 1999), and organization communication (Westaby, 2002).

'''Exposure assessment''' is a branch of [[environmental science]] and [[occupational hygiene]] that focuses on the processes that take place at the interface between the [[biophysical environment|environment]] containing the [[contaminant]](s) of interest and the [[organism]](s) being considered.  These are the final steps in the path to release an environmental contaminant, through transport to its effect in a biological system. It tries to measure how much of a contaminant can be absorbed by an exposed target organism, in what form, at what rate and how much of the absorbed amount is actually available to produce a [[biological effect]]. Although the same general concepts apply to other organisms, the overwhelming majority of applications of exposure assessment are concerned with [[human health]], making it an important tool in [[public health]].

==Definition==
Exposure assessment is the process of estimating or measuring the magnitude, frequency and duration of exposure to an agent, along
with the number and characteristics of the population exposed. Ideally, it describes the sources, pathways, routes, and the uncertainties in the assessment.

Exposure analysis is the science that describes how an individual or population comes in contact with a contaminant, including quantification of the amount of contact across space and time. 'Exposure assessment' and 'exposure analysis' are often used as synonyms in many practical contexts. [[Risk#Health, safety, and environment|Risk]] is a function of exposure and hazard. For example, even for an extremely toxic (high hazard) substance, the risk of an adverse outcome is unlikely if exposures are near zero. Conversely, a moderately toxic substance may present substantial risk if an individual or a population is highly exposed.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA, "Expocast" http://www.epa.gov/ncct/expocast/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vallero, D.A. (2004). Environmental Contaminants: Assessment and Control. Academic Press, New York, NY, {{ISBN|0127100571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Quantitative measures of exposure are used: in [[risk assessment]], together with inputs from [[toxicology]], to determine risk from substances released to the environment, to establish protective standards, in [[epidemiology]], to distinguish between exposed and control groups, and to protect workers from [[occupational hazard]]s.

==Receptor-based approach==
The receptor-based approach is used in exposure science. It starts by looking at different contaminants and concentrations that reach people. An exposure analyst can use direct or indirect measurements to determine if a person has been in contact with a specific contaminant or has been exposed to a specific risk (eg accident). Once a contaminant has been proved to reach people, exposure analysts work backwards to determine its source. After the identification of the source, it is important to find out the most efficient way to reduce [[adverse health effect]]s. If the contaminant reaches a person, it is very hard to reduce the associated adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=12464 US EPA Exposure Factors Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is very important to reduce exposure in order to diminish the risk of adverse health effects. It is highly important to use both [[regulatory]] and non-regulatory approaches in order to decrease people’s exposure to contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=12464 US EPA Exposure Factors Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, it is better to change [[behaviour|people’s activities]] in order to reduce their exposures rather than regulating a source of contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=12464 US EPA Exposure Factors Handbook&lt;/ref&gt;
The receptor-based approach can be opposed to the source-based approach. This approach begins by looking at different sources of contaminants such as industries and power plants. Then, it is important to find out if the contaminant of interest has reached a receptor (usually humans). With this approach, it is very hard to prove that a pollutant from a source has reached a target.

==Exposure==
In this context ''exposure'' is defined as the contact between an agent and a target. Contact takes place at an exposure surface over an exposure period.
Mathematically, exposure is defined as &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E=\int_{t_1}^{t_2} C(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is exposure, ''C''(''t'') is a concentration that varies with time between the beginning and end of exposure. It has dimensions of mass times time divided by volume. This quantity is related to the potential [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]] of contaminant by multiplying it by the relevant contact rate, such as [[breathing rate]], [[food intake]] rate etc. The contact rate itself may be a function of time.&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=15263 US EPA Guidelines for Exposure Assessment&lt;/ref&gt;

===Routes of exposure===
Contact between a contaminant and an organism can occur through any route. The possible routes of exposure are: [[Inhalation Exposure|inhalation]], if the contaminant is present in the air; ingestion, through food, drinking or hand-to-mouth behavior; and dermal absorption, if the contaminant can be absorbed through the skin.

Exposure to a contaminant can and does occur through multiple routes, simultaneously or at different times. In many cases the main route of exposure is not obvious and needs to be investigated carefully. For example, exposure to byproducts of [[water chlorination]] can obviously occur by drinking, but also through the skin, while swimming or washing, and even through inhalation from droplets [[aerosolize]]d during a shower. The relative proportion of exposure from these different routes cannot be determined ''a priori''. Therefore, the equation in the previous section is correct in a strict mathematical sense, but it is a gross oversimplification of actual exposures, which are the sum of the integrals of all activities in all microenvironments. For example, the equation would have to be calculated with the specific concentration of a compound in the air in the room during the time interval. Similarly, the concentration in the ambient air would apply to the time that the person spends outdoors, whereas the concentration in the food that the person ingests would be added. The concentration integrals via all routes would be added for the exposure duration, e.g. hourly, daily or annually as

:&lt;math&gt;E=sum(\int_{t_1}^{t_2} C(t)\, dt ... \int_{t_y}^{t_z} C(t)\, dt)&lt;/math&gt;

where y is the initial time and z the ending time of last in the series of time periods spent in each microenvironment over the exposure duration.&lt;ref name="Vallero, D.A."&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Air Pollution|author=Vallero, D.A.|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|url=http://store.elsevier.com/Fundamentals-of-Air-Pollution/Daniel-Vallero/isbn-9780123736154/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement of exposure==

To quantify the exposure of particular individuals or populations two approaches are used, primarily based on practical considerations:

===Direct approach===
[[File:NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program - Measuring Contaminants in the Air at a Workplace.webm|thumb|A video about measuring contaminants in the air at a workplace as part of a [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] [[Health Hazard Evaluation Program]] exposure assessment]]
[[File:NIOSH HHE - Measuring Contaminants on Workers’ Skin and Workplace Surfaces.webm|thumb|A video about measuring contaminants on workers' skin and workplace surfaces as part of a NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program exposure assessment]]

The direct approach measures the exposures to pollutants by monitoring the pollutant concentrations reaching the respondents.  The pollutant concentrations are directly monitored on or within the person through point of contact, biological monitoring, or [[biomarker]]s.  The point of contact approach indicates the total concentration reaching the host, while biological monitoring and the use of biomarkers infer the dosage of the pollutant through the determination of the body burden.&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Wayne, [[Anne C. Steinemann|Anne Steinemann]], and Lance Wallace. Exposure Analysis. Taylor &amp; Francis group, 2007. 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The respondents often record their daily activities and locations during the measurement of the pollutants to identify the potential sources, microenvironments, or human activities contributing the pollutant exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Wayne, Anne Steinemann, and Lance Wallace. Exposure Analysis. Taylor &amp; Francis group, 2007. 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  An advantage of the direct approach is that the exposures through multiple media (air, soil, water, food, etc.) are accounted for through one study technique.  The disadvantages include the invasive nature of the data collection and associated costs.

Point of contact is continuous measure of the contaminant reaching the target through all routes.

[[Biomonitoring|Biological monitoring]] is another approach to measuring exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lioy | first = Paul | year = 1990  | title =Assessing total human exposure to contaminants | journal =  Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 938–945  | doi = 10.1021/es00077a001 |bibcode = 1990EnST...24..938L }}&lt;/ref&gt; measures the amount of a pollutant within body tissues or fluids (such as blood or urine). Biological monitoring measures the body burden of a pollutant but not the source from whence it came. The substance measured may be either the contaminant itself or a biomarker which is specific to and indicative of an exposure to the contaminant.[[Biomarkers of exposure assessment]] is a measure of the contaminant or other proportionally related variable in the body.

[[Air sampling]] measures the contaminant in the air as concentration units of ppmv (parts per million by volume), mg/m^3 (milligrams per cubic meter) or other mass per unit volume of air.  Samples can be worn by workers or researchers to estimate concentrations found in the breathing zone (personal) or samples collected in general areas that can be used to estimate human exposure by integrating time and activity patterns.  Validated and semi-validated air sampling methods are published by [[NIOSH]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], ISO and other bodies.

[[Surface or dermal sampling]] measures of the contaminant on touchable surfaces or on skin.  Concentrations are typically reported in mass per unit surface area such as mg/100&amp;nbsp;cm^2. 

===Indirect approach===
The indirect approach measures the pollutant concentrations in various locations or during specific human activities to predict the exposure distributions within a population.  The indirect approach focuses on the pollutant concentrations within microenvironments or activities rather than the concentrations directly reaching the respondents.  The measured concentrations are correlated to large-scale activity pattern data, such as the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), to determine the predicted exposure by multiplying the pollutant concentrations by the time spent in each microenvironment or activity for by multiplying the pollutant concentrations b the contact rate with each media.&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Wayne, Anne Steinemann, and Lance Wallace. Exposure Analysis. Taylor &amp; Francis group, 2007. 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The indirect approach or exposure modeling determines the estimated exposure distributions within a population rather than the direct exposure an individual has experienced. The advantage is that process is minimally invasive to the population and is associated with lower costs than the direct approach. A disadvantage of the indirect approach is that the results were determined independently of any actual exposures, so the exposure distribution is open to errors from any inaccuracies in the assumptions made during the study, the time-activity data, or the measured pollutant concentrations.

In general, direct methods tend to be more accurate but more costly in terms of resources and demands placed on the subject being measured and may not always be feasible, especially for a population exposure study.

Examples of direct methods include air sampling though a personal portable pump, split food samples, hand rinses, breath samples or [[blood sample]]s. Examples of indirect methods include environmental water, air, dust, soil or consumer product sampling coupled with information such as activity/location diaries.  [[Mathematical exposure modeling|Mathematical exposure models]] may also be used to explore hypothetical situations of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Vallero D., Isukapalli S., Zartarian V., McCurdy T., McKone T., Georgopoulos P.G. and Dary C. (2010). Modeling and predicting pesticide exposures. Chapter 44. In ''Hayes’ Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology - Third Edition''. Krieger, R. (ed.), Academic Press: pp.&amp;nbsp;995–1020. [http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/720542/description]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure factors===
Especially when determining the exposure of a population rather than individuals, indirect methods can often make use of relevant statistics about the activities that can lead to an exposure. These statistics are called ''exposure factors''. They are generally drawn from the scientific literature or governmental statistics. For example, they may report informations such as amount of different food eaten by specific populations, divided by location or age, breathing rates, time spent for different modes of commuting, showering or vacuuming, as well as information on types of residences. Such information can be combined with contaminant concentrations from ''ad-hoc'' studies or monitoring network to produce estimates of the exposure in the population of interest. These are especially useful in establishing protective standards.

Exposure factor values can be used to obtain a range of exposure estimates such as [[average]], high-end and bounding estimates. For example, to calculate the lifetime average daily dose one would use the equation below:

:&lt;math&gt;LADD = (Contaminant Concentration)(Intake Rate)(Exposure Duration)/(Body Weight)(Average Lifetime)&lt;/math&gt;

All of the variables in the above equation, with the exception of contaminant concentration, are considered exposure factors. Each of the exposure factors involves humans, either in terms of their characteristics (e.g., body weight) or behaviors (e.g., amount of time spent in a specific location, which affects exposure duration). These characteristics and behaviors can carry a great deal of [[Human variability|variability]] and [[uncertainty]]. In the case of lifetime average daily dose, variability pertains to the distribution and range of LADDs amongst individuals in the population. The uncertainty, on the other hand, refers to exposure analyst's lack of knowledge of the standard deviation, mean, and general shape when dealing with calculating LADD.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s ''Exposure Factors Handbook''&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=12464 US EPA Exposure Factors Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; provides solutions when confronting variability and reducing uncertainty.

==Defining acceptable exposure for occupational environments==
[[File:Hierarchies of Exposure Assessment and Management.JPG|thumb|Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information]]

[[Occupational]] exposure limits are based on available toxicology and epidemiology data to protect nearly all workers over a working lifetime.  Exposure assessments in occupational settings are most often performed by occupational/industrial hygiene (OH/IH) professionals who gather "basic characterization" consisting of all relevant information and data related to workers, agents of concern, materials, equipment and available exposure controls. The exposure assessment is initiated by selecting the appropriate exposure limit averaging time and "decision statistic" for the agent. Typically the statistic for deciding acceptable exposure is chosen to be the [[majority]] (90%, 95% or 99%) of all exposures to be below the selected occupational exposure limit. For [[retrospective]] exposure assessments performed in occupational environments, the "decision statistic" is typically a [[central tendency]] such as the [[arithmetic mean]] or [[geometric mean]] or [[median]] for each worker or group of workers. Methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in "A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures".&lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock AIHA Press" http://iweb.aiha.org/iweb/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=AEAK06-327/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure assessment is a continuous process that is updated as new information and data becomes available.

[[File:Demonstration of pumping faecal sludge from a "wet" VIP pit (8152015980).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Fecal sludge from a [[pit latrine]] is pumped out to empty the pit ([[Durban]], South Africa)]]

'''Fecal sludge management''' ('''FSM''') (or '''faecal sludge management''' in [[British English]]) is the collection, transport, and treatment of fecal sludge from [[pit latrine]]s, [[septic tank]]s or other [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|onsite sanitation]] systems. Fecal sludge is a mixture of [[human excreta]], water and [[Municipal solid waste|solid wastes]] (e.g. [[toilet paper]] or other [[anal cleansing]] materials, [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene]] materials) that are disposed in pits, tanks or vaults of onsite sanitation systems. Fecal sludge that is removed from septic tanks is called '''septage'''. 

FSM is necessary in densely populated areas where a proportion of population is not connected to a [[sewerage|sewerage network]], and the covering and rebuilding pit latrines is not possible. This is the case in most urban areas of [[developing countries]], but such services are also used in developed countries where sewerage systems are unavailable. FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector services providers, local governments, water authorities and [[Public utility|utilities]]. However, in many developing countries FSM services are often unavailable or if they are available are often informal, unregulated, unhygienic and unsafe. This can lead to [[Water pollution|surface water]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[groundwater pollution]], spreading of [[pathogen]]s into the environment and adverse [[public health]] impacts. It can also result in unreliable services with relatively high costs to the households which need them.

Fecal sludge collection services can be made available on a scheduled basis or on a call-for-service basis (also known as on-demand, on-request or non-scheduled services). The collected fecal sludge may be transported to treatment plants by using a [[vacuum truck]]; a tank and pump mounted on a flatbed truck; a small tank pulled by a motorcycle; or in containers on a hand cart. Mobile or permanent transfer stations can be used to improve the efficiency of fecal sludge transportation by transferring the waste to larger tankers for haulage to treatment. The wider use of multiple decentralized sludge treatment facilities within the city (to avoid long haulage distances) is currently being researched and piloted.

The collected fecal sludge should preferably be processed at dedicated fecal sludge treatment plants, instead of being co-treated with [[sewage]] in municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants, unless these are able to take the additional load, and facilities to separate liquids and solids are available.&lt;ref name="FSM book 9"&gt;Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014).

IWA Publishing, UK ({{ISBN|9781780404738}})&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of mechanized and non-mechanized processing technologies may be used, including [[constructed wetland]]s, [[anaerobic digestion]], and [[waste stabilization pond]]s. The treatment process can produce useful products such as treated [[effluent]] that can be used for [[irrigation]]. Another possibility is to use the treated fecal sludge after [[compost]]ing as a [[soil conditioner]] or for the production of [[biogas]], charcoal, [[biodiesel]], powdered industrial fuel and [[electricity]]. Historically, the term [[night soil]] was used for fecal sludge.&lt;ref name="Tilley" /&gt; {{TOC level|3}}

[[Image:Septage pump truck Highland Michigan.JPG|thumb|right|Vacuum truck to transport septage, [[Highland, Michigan]]]]
Fecal sludge management (FSM) requires safe and hygienic [[septic tank]] and [[pit latrine]] emptying services, along with the effective treatment of solids and liquids and the reuse of treated produce where possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publikationen/faecal-sludge-management-fsm-book/ Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation]. IWA Publishing, UK ({{ISBN|9781780404738}})&lt;/ref&gt; It may include a range of options including on-site and offsite treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of the products of the treatment process into such as [[biogas]], [[compost]] and energy.

FSM is used synonymously with the term "septage management", but they are not the same. Septage is a specific type of fecal sludge: it is the partially digested fecal solids that accumulates in septic tanks. Fecal sludge from pit latrines may have a lower water content compared to septage and may contain more solid waste. 

Pit latrines generate fecal sludge, and these are sometimes classified as [[dry toilet]]s, although wet pits are also common, especially in Asia. However, other types of dry toilets - those that are designed to be easily emptied, without the addition of water - do not generate fecal sludge but dried [[Human feces|feces]] (in the case of [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s) or [[compost]] (in the case of [[composting toilet]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s), for example. In the case of [[Arborloo]] toilets, nothing is ever extracted from the pit and, instead, the lightweight outhouse/superstructure is moved to another shallow hole and a tree is planted on top of the filled hole.

Collectively, the collection, transport, treatment and [[reuse of excreta]] constitute the "value chain" of fecal sludge management.

In India some government policy documents are using the term FSSM for "Fecal sludge and septage management".&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and Urban Management Centre (UMC) (2018).

National Institute of Urban Affairs, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Septage===
{{Further|Septic tank}}
Septage or "septic tank sludge" is partially treated sludge that is accumulated and stored in a [[septic tank]] or similar [[onsite sewage facility]]. Septage is a by-product from the pretreatment of household wastewater ([[sewage]]) in a septic tank. After a few years of accumulation, septage is usually pumped out of a septic tank by a [[vacuum truck]]. Septic tanks are receiving [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] from [[Flush toilet|flush toilets]], as well as [[greywater]]. This means that septage only contains the kind of solid waste that can be flushed, such as [[toilet paper]]. Septage may also include "scum", which is material that floats at the top and contains fats, oil and grease as well as any floating solid waste.  

The term "septage" has been used in the United States since at least 1992.&lt;ref&gt;USAID (1992) [http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/30004NKA.pdf Guide to Septage Treatment and Disposal], United States Environmental Protection Agency, USA&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in projects by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;AECOM International Development, Inc. and the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (Sandec) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) (2010) [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADS118.pdf A Rapid Assessment of Septage Management in Asia'','' Policies and Practies in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam]
&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of septage is: "A historical term to define sludge removed from septic tanks."&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph. and Zurbrügg, C. (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies (2nd Revised Edition)]. Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Septage waste is periodically removed (with a frequency depending on tank capacity, system efficiency, and usage level, but typically less often than annually) from the septic tanks by specialized vehicles known as vacuum truck. They pump the septage out of the tank, and transport it to a local [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]]. It could also be used by farmers for fertilizer, or stored in large septage waste storage facilities for later treatment or use on crops.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Worldwide there is an increasing interest and awareness of FSM issues, particularly in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Oxfam (2016).

Such research is being carried out and funded by many organizations, and also at scale by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhry, S., Koné, D. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1662 Business Analysis of Fecal Sludge Management: Emptying and Transportation Services in Africa and Asia] - Draft final report. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

In many developing countries, fecal sludge is not properly managed. This may be due to a lack of mandated institutions and little awareness of the impact of poor sanitation; the lack of technical expertise and experience; inability to source funds for to purchase of vacuum trucks and treatment, or lack of knowledge required to be initiate and implement successful FSM programs. This can result in the poor performance of onsite sanitation facilities (OSSFs), septic tank and pit latrine overflows, unsafe emptying of pit latrines, and the dumping of untreated pathogenic fecal sludge into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;WIN-SA (2011).

=== Purposes ===
[[File:Desluding using proper PPE. Dumaguete Philippines.jpg|thumb|Desludging using proper [[personal protective equipment]] in Dumaguete, Philippines]]
[[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Goal 6]] of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for (water and) sanitation has helped to increase awareness of the risks of poor sanitation management along the entire sanitation chain. It has provided a motivation to many countries, cities and organizations to improve the range of improved sanitation services available. Among these are FSM programs to:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  
* Improve the functioning of onsite sanitation systems and to reduce the potential for human contact with fecal-borne pathogens;
* Minimize odors and nuisances, and the uncontrolled discharge of organic matter from overflowing tanks or pits;
* Support the upgrading of onsite sanitation upgrading programs;
* Safeguard public health against indiscriminate disposal of collected fecal sludge;
* Derive agricultural and energy products, including soil conditioner from composting or co-composting and energy products such as biogas, charcoal pellets, industrial powdered fuel etc.
* Stimulate economic development, job creation and livelihood opportunities while addressing the issues of the social stigma and operator health and safety issues that continue to impact informal workers.

FSM programs can be drivers of [[sanitation]] improvement in different ways. They can encourage OSSF upgrades that reduce (or increase) the frequency of desludging and therefore the operational and environmental costs. They can also be drivers of economic development all along the sanitation value chain. This can include provision of materials and parts for new toilets and septic tanks; contractors and equipment installers; sludge collection personal including drivers and emptiers; treatment and reuse systems operators; and production and sale of the end-products of the sludge treatment process.

These products may include recycled water for agriculture and industry, soil conditioners, biogas, biodiesel or electricity. There are many pilot, demonstration and full-scale FSM programs now operating in Asia and Africa, but few that have demonstrated a sustained impact upon the value chain.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Elements of successful programs ===
[[File:Desludging truck in action Nepal.jpg|thumb|Desludging truck ([[vacuum truck]]) in action in Nepal]]
FSM services can be provided as demand based (often called on-request, on-call, on-demand, ad-hoc or non-scheduled) or scheduled (also known as regular) desludging, or a combination of both. Under either mechanism, OSSFs are desludged on a periodic basis or when the household requests it or due to inspection by a competent authority indicates desludging is needed.

An analysis of 20 FSM Innovation Case Studies and research and advocacy of successful programs carried out by [[Oxfam]] Philippines has demonstrated that common elements for successful FSM programs include:&lt;ref name="blackett2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Well formulated and practical policy, rules and regulation: While these are essential they are almost useless, even counterproductive, on their own, and must be supported by complementary factors such as those below;
* Local leadership and clearly mandated and resourced institutions to manage services, even where actual services are delivered by the private sector;
* Partnerships between stakeholders contributes to developing services at scale, building community confidence and achieving sustainability;
* A sustained program of community engagement, marketing and awareness raising is as essential to FSM as sludge treatment – but is frequently under-valued, under-budgeted and sometimes abandoned after an initial period;
* Capacity-building for FSM service providers helps ensure that they can effectively meet all segments of demand and achieve long-term viability. This may include training in both technical matters and business management, and the facilitation of capital formation through grants, equipment leasing, loan guarantees and other financial instruments;
* Tariffs that are pro-poor and representative of operational costs for providing the service;
* Technology that is appropriate to the capacity to operate and maintain the system and the realities of the value chain.

=== Characteristics of fecal sludge ===
Fecal sludge (FS) is the [[human waste]], [[wastewater]], trash and debris that accumulates in [[pit latrine]]s and [[septic tank]]s or other onsite sanitation systems.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fecal sludge is an offensive material that contains [[pathogen]]s, can generate odors and cause surface [[water pollution]], as well as [[groundwater pollution]]. Characteristics of fecal sludge may vary widely due to climate, toilet type, diet and other variables. Performing a waste characterization study to understand local conditions provides data that factors into treatment plant sizing, as well as estimating the value of the products that can be derived from the treatment process.

The main physico-chemical parameters commonly measured to characterize fecal sludge include:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]], [[total suspended solids]], % solids, indication of sand, [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]], [[ammonium]], total nitrogen and total phosphorus, Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG), [[Sludge volume index|Sludge Volume Index]] (SVI), pH, [[alkalinity]].

System designers often use default values, such as 2,000&amp;nbsp;mg/l for BOD and 5,000&amp;nbsp;mg/l of TSS (which might be an average country-wide) in order to size the treatment system. If no such data exists, or if local conditions are not adequately reflected in assumed values, a waste characterization study can be conducted.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Relatively little data exists on [[pathogen]] content in fecal sludge. One study from rural Bangladesh determined 41 [[Helminths|helminth eggs]] per g of fecal sludge from pit latrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balasubramanya|first=Soumya|last2=Evans|first2=Barbara|last3=Ahmed|first3=Rizwan|last4=Habib|first4=Ahasan|last5=Asad|first5=N. S. M.|last6=Vuong|first6=Luan|last7=Rahman|first7=Mominur|last8=Hasan|first8=Mahmudul|last9=Dey|first9=Digbijoy|date=2016-09-01|title=Pump it up: making single-pit emptying safer in rural Bangladesh|url=http://washdev.iwaponline.com/content/6/3/456|journal=Journal of Water Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=456–464|doi=10.2166/washdev.2016.049|issn=2043-9083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of fecal sludge may be influenced by:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Methods, techniques and the skill levels of personnel conducting the desludging;
* The efficiency of the different types of equipment used in desludging;
* Seasonality - presence of groundwater or flood water that may infiltrate into tanks and dilute the contents;
* The last time the tank was desludged (age of fecal sludge).
More research into conducting waste characterization studies in developing countries is needed. For developed countries, more data is available.&lt;ref&gt;Bilhimer, D. (2001) [https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/0107007.pdf Washington State Septage Characterization Analysis], Washington State Department of Ecology, Solid Waste &amp; Financial Assistance Program&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practice==

===Cities===
[[File:Desludging fleet Manila Water.jpg|thumb|Fleet of [[vacuum truck]]s used for desludging services by Manila Water in Manila, Philippines]]
FSM is a critical sanitation service in cities and towns in all countries where households use onsite sanitation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Peal, A., Evans, B., Blackett, I., Hawkins, P., Heymans, C. (2015). [http://Engaging%20the%20stakeholders%20early%20on%20will%20help%20the%20implements%20to%20craft%20programs%20that%20serve%20each%20socioeconomic%20sector%20of%20the%20society. A Review of Fecal Sludge Management in 12 Cities] - (Final Draft). World Bank - Water and Sanitation Program&lt;/ref&gt; Citywide FSM programs may utilize multiple or one treatment facility, use stationary and mobile transfer stations, and engage with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises that may conduct some or all of the services.&lt;ref name="blackett2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2760|title=FSM Innovation Case Studies - Case Studies on the Business, Policy and Technology of Faecal Sludge Management|last=Blackett|first=I.|last2=Hawkins|first2=P.|publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5136-2513-3|location=Seattle, USA|pages=4–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}} Programs may be phased in over time to accommodate growing demand.

===Peri urban areas===
Peri urban areas are often less densely populated than urban centers. Therefore they have more space and on-site sanitation systems can be effective for solid and liquid treatment. In most such peri-urban areas, it is less likely that they will be connected to a conventional centralized sanitary sewer system in the short or medium term. Therefore, these areas will rely on a mix of onsite-sanitation systems and services, decentralized wastewater management systems, or by condominial or [[simplified sewerage]] connected to decentralized or centralized treatment. In all of these situations, FSM is a necessary service to keep the sanitation systems functioning properly.

===Rural areas===
[[File:Passing the faecal sludge to the top of the pit latrine.jpg|thumb|Bad practice example: A worker removing fecal sludge out of the pit of a [[pit latrine]] without wearing any [[personal protective equipment]] (in a village in [[Burkina Faso]]). ]]
Rural areas with low population density may not need formal FSM services if the local practice is to cover and rebuild latrines when they fill up. However, this if is not possible, rural areas often lack treatment facilities within a reasonable (say 30 minutes drive) distance; are difficult for tankers to access and often have limited demand for emptying making transport and treatment uneconomic, and unaffordable for most people. Therefore options such as relocating latrines on-site, double (alternating) pit or [[Arborloo]] toilets could be considered. Also sharing decentralized FSM services and sludge treatment between nearby villages, or direct safe removal burial of waste could be considered and organized.

== Design considerations ==

===Selecting the operator of FSM services===

FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector service providers, local governments, water authorities and [[Public utility|utilities]]. Water utilities with a high percentage of water connectivity (homes with piped water connections) are logical operators of FSM programs. If water is sold to customers through a tariff, an additional tariff to cover FSM services may be added. For larger cities, it is usually the water and sewerage service provider that will be the most appropriate operator.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Local governments may choose to provide services by using their own staff and resources for collection, transportation and treatment. This is often the case in smaller cities or municipalities where the water utility may not have a broad reach. In many cases, cooperation between the city government and the water utility may be strategically advantageous. Dumaguete City, Philippines is one example where the Water District (utility) and Local Government have joint ownership and responsibilities for the FSM program.&lt;ref&gt;City Septage Management Program a Galing Pook, Youtube video (2013): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDOnMPP-nIQ , City Planning and Devt. Office Dumaguete City, Philippines
&lt;/ref&gt; Organized larger scale FSM programs may be able to provide the service more cheaply and more hygienically than the independent private operators working on an ''ad hoc'' basis. Ensuring services are affordable is an important selling point when promoting the program to citizens and encouraging them to participate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The local private sector is an important player in providing FSM services. In such cases, private sector contractors may work directly for households (under regulation) or bid on desludging contracts let by the city. The private sector can also provide services in operating and maintaining the treatment works, and in processing and selling the commodities resulting from the treatment process. San Fernando City, La Union, Philippines is an example of a local government that has contracted out the treatment facility construction and collection program to the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psa.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=81|title=USAID-Rotary San Fernando City Sewerage and Septage Management Project|last=|first=|date=21 October 2010|website=|publisher=USAID Philippine Sanitation Alliance|access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synergy with other programs ===
FSM is but one aspect of citywide sanitation that also includes: 
* [[Municipal solid waste]] management;
* Drainage and [[greywater]] management; 
* Wastewater collection and treatment including effluent overflows from on-site systems where soils based dispersal systems are insufficient to assimilate the volume; 
* Water safety; and
* Food safety.  
There are important synergies between many of these services and FSM, and investigating co-management opportunities can yield benefits. MSW can often be co-managed with fecal waste, especially when thermal treatment technologies are used. Food waste from restaurants and markets can be co-composted with fecal waste to produce a high value soils amendment. Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) from commercial grease traps can be added to biodigesters to increase methane production, or used in conjunction with fecal sludge as a feedstock for biodiesel production.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Robbins, Owen George, Rachel Burton (2011) [http://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/resources/managing_fats_oil_and_grease_for_local_governments_in_india.pdf Developing Programs to Manage Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG) for Local Governments in India], VthWorld Aqua Congress—New Delhi, India, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water supply]] is also closely linked with FSM as it is often the water utility that will manage programs and their customers that will pay for services through tariffs.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Scheduled desludging programs ===
In Southeast Asia, there is increasing interest in scheduled desludging programs as a means of providing services. Under this scheme, users pay monthly tariffs that are included with their water bill to cover the cost of services. The trucks move from neighborhood to neighborhood on a scheduled cycle. Truck operators are licensed and compensated based on the volume of waste delivered to the treatment plant, which serves as an incentive against illegal dumping. The concept was first introduced in the Philippines in 2010 and has been replicated there successfully.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Co-treatment at wastewater treatment plants ===
Co-treatment of septage at [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] is the method of choice for cities where almost all households have access to [[sewerage]]. In those situations the volume of septage is small in comparison with that of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/book/10.3362/9781780449869|title=Faecal Sludge and Septage Treatment|last=Tayler|first=Kevin|date=|publisher=Practical Action Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781853399862|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.3362/9781780449869}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Technology components and infrastructure ==

===Technology selection===
[[File:Training of enumerators for septage survey Nepal.jpg|thumb|Training of enumerators for a survey regarding fecal sludge management needs in Nepal]]
A formal process should be used for making an informed technology selection for the treatment of the fecal sludge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is usually ''a'' collaborative process conducted by stakeholders, consultants, the operator and the future owner of the facility''.'' The process is based on a long term vision planning with stakeholders as part of citywide sanitation planning. The expected waste flows (volume), their strength, characteristics, and variability in each area need to be known. A formal and transparent process for developing appropriate plans and designs for wastewater and fecal sludge treatment plants will achieve local buy-in and ownership of technology decisions, which is critical for the long term success and sustainability of the program.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Collection vehicles and equipment===
{{Further|Vacuum truck}}
[[File:Fig.1. Gulper used to desludge tanks in eThekwini, South Africa.JPG|thumb|The "Gulper", a device for manual pumping of fecal sludge from pits used in eThekwini ([[Durban]]), South Africa.]]

If the fecal sludge is liquid enough, it is usually collected by using vacuum pumps or centrifugal style booster pumps. A variety of manual and motorized devices designed to excavate thick and viscous sludge and accumulated trash are also available in the market.

After sitting for years in septic tanks and pit latrines, the accumulated sludge becomes hardened and is very difficult to remove. It is still common that workers enter pits in order to desludge them, even though this practice is generally unsafe and undesirable (in India, this practice is called "[[manual scavenging]]"). A number of low-cost pumping systems exist to remove this hardened sludge hygienically from the ground surface, although many of them are still in the experimental stage (e.g. Excravator, Gulper, e-Vac).&lt;ref name="Still2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Still|first1=David|last2=Foxon|first2=Kitty|title=Tackling the challenges of full pit latrines : report to the Water Research Commission|date=2012|publisher=Water Research Commission|location=Gezina [South Africa]|isbn=9781431202935|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fecal sludge can also be treated inside the tank or pit as well, by use of the "in-pit lime stabilization process", which treats the waste before it is removed from the tank or pit. This methodology was first pioneered by iDE Cambodia in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;iDE Cambodia (2013) Treating waste with lime, Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDGefsKq8vM
&lt;/ref&gt; Once removed, it is transported to onsite or off site treatment and processing facilities.

Some advanced transfer stations and vacuum trucks can dewater fecal sludge to some extent, and this water may be placed in sewer lines to be treated in wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This allows more sludge to be dealt with more efficiently and may constitute one of the best cases of co-treatment of fecal sludge in wastewater treatment plants.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Transfer stations===
 
Transfer stations are intermediary drop off locations often used where treatment facilities are located too far away from population centers to make direct disposal feasible. In other locations, traffic concerns or local truck bans during daylight hours may make transfer stations feasible. In addition, municipalities where a significant percentage of homes cannot be accessed by tanker truck should utilize transfer stations. Transfer stations are used if:

* More than 5% of the homes are inaccessible by a vacuum truck;
* The treatment plant is too far away from the homes for transport in one haul to be practical;
* Trucks are not permitted on the streets during the day; or
* Heavy traffic during daylight hours impedes the movement of vacuum trucks.

==== Mobile transfer stations ====
Mobile transfer stations are nothing more than larger tanker trucks or trailers that are deployed along with small vacuum trucks and motorcycle or hand carts. The smaller vehicles discharge to the larger tanker, which then carries the collected sludge to the treatment plant. These work well in scheduled desludging business models.

==== Fixed transfer stations ====
Fixed transfer stations are dedicated facilities installed strategically throughout the municipality that serve as drop off locations for collected fecal sludge. They may include a receiving station with screens, a tank for holding the collected waste, trash storage containers, and wash down facilities. These may be more appropriate for FSM programs using the "call-for-service" business model.

While static transfer stations are fixed tanks, mobile transfer stations are simply tanker trucks or trailers that work alongside the SVVs and actually do the longer haul transferring of the waste from the community to the treatment plant. Mobile transfer stations work best for scheduled desludging programs where there are no traffic restrictions or truck bans, and a relatively large number of homes that are inaccessible to the larger vehicles.

===Treatment plants===
[[File:Sand drying bed for emergency septage treatment Oxfam Philippines.jpg|thumb|Drying bed for emergency fecal sludge treatment by [[Oxfam]] in the Philippines]]
[[File:Sand drying bed Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Drying bed for fecal sludge in Bangladesh]]
Fecal Sludge is often processed through a series of treatment steps to first separate the liquids from the solids, and then treat both the liquid and solid trains while recovering as much of the energy or nutritive value as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Common processes at fecal sludge treatment plants include:

* Fecal sludge reception - where the truck interfaces with the treatment plant and sludge is unloaded. 
* Preliminary treatment - to remove garbage, sand, grit, and FOG (fats, oil and grease);
* Primary treatment - simple separation by physical means, or separation with microbial digestion;
* Liquids treatment - for example by using [[constructed wetlands]], [[Stabilization pond|waste stabilization ponds]], [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]]; and 
* Solids processing - using the solids resulting from fecal sludge treatment for beneficial use where possible.

Constructed wetlands are gaining attention as a low-cost treatment technology that can be constructed in many instances using local materials and labor. For sites with enough land and a ready supply of gravel and sand, this technology offers low cost, scalability, and simple operation.&lt;ref&gt;Thammarat Koottatep, Chongrak Polprasert and Nguyen Thi Kim Oanh, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228581103_Design_considerations_of_constructed_wetlands_for_septage_treatment_at_the_AIT_pilot_plant Design considerations of constructed wetlands for septage treatment at the AIT pilot plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drying beds ====
Simple sludge drying beds can be used, as they are a cheap and simple method to dry fecal sludge (they are also widely used to dry [[sewage sludge]]). Drainage water must be captured; drying beds are sometimes covered but usually left uncovered. 

Drying beds are typically composed of four layers consisting of gravel and sand. The first layer is coarse gravel that is 15 to 20 centimeters thick. Followed by fine gravel that is 10 centimeters thick. The third layer is sand that can be between 10 to 15 centimeters and serves as the filter between the sludge and gravel. Sludge dries up and water percolates to the first layer that is collected at the drainage pipe that is beneath all layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KsWLsxWZJk|title=Introduction to Faecal Sludge Management, Unplanted drying beds|last=Gold|first=Moritz|date=|website=youtube.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emerging technologies ====
Emerging technologies for fecal sludge treatment include:&lt;ref name="Diener"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diener|first1=Stefan|last2=Semiyaga|first2=Swaib|last3=Niwagaba|first3=Charles B.|last4=Muspratt|first4=Ashley Murray|last5=Gning|first5=Jean Birane|last6=Mbéguéré|first6=Mbaye|last7=Ennin|first7=Joseph Effah|last8=Zurbrugg|first8=Christian|last9=Strande|first9=Linda|title=A value proposition: Resource recovery from faecal sludge—Can it be the driver for improved sanitation?|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|date=July 2014|volume=88|pages=32–38|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.04.005|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Thermal processes which can achieve cost effectiveness by eliminating the need for separate processes. They convert the fecal sludge along with certain fractions of [[sewage sludge]] or municipal solid waste to produce energy or fuel by using certain [[sewage sludge treatment]] technologies.
* Biodiesel can be manufactured by using fats, oils and grease as feedstocks. Research by [[RTI International]] is being conducted to use fecal sludge for biodiesel production.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  
* Electricity can be produced by thermal processes that burn fecal and solid waste together to maintain stable combustion and the heat is used to make steam that drives generators.

===Treatment products and reuse options===
[[File:Sludge pellets after LaDePa process (8151957937).jpg|thumb|Sludge pellets after processing (including heating, drying and pelletizing) in a LaDePa process, eThekwini Municipality (South Africa)]]

[[Compost]]ing is a process whereby organic matter is digested in the presence of oxygen with the byproduct of heat. For fecal sludge, the heat deactivates the pathogens while the digestion process breaks down the organic matter into a humus-like material that acts as a soils amendment, and nutrients that are broken down into a form that is more easily taken up by plants. Properly treated fecal sludge can be reused in agriculture (see also [[reuse of excreta]]).

Fecal sludge is rich in nitrogen. When they are mixed with materials that are rich in carbon, such as shredded crop wastes, the composting process can be maximized. Proper mixture to achieve a ratio of 20 to 1 to 30 to 1 of carbon to nitrogen is best.

[[Biogas]] is a byproduct of the anaerobic digestion process.

Treated effluent can be used for agricultural or landscape [[irrigation]].

These by-products have the potential to offset some of the costs of the program, thereby reducing tariffs for the public. However, value addition all the way to biogas, biodiesel and electricity is difficult to achieve in practice due to technological and operational challenges.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Costs and fees ==
FSM is considered an entry point for sanitation improvement programs that are led by local governments. Such programs may include tariffs or user fees, promotions campaigns to raise the willingness to pay for the service, and local ordinances that define the rules and regulations governing FSM. In the Philippines, tariffs around $1 USD per family per month are generally enough to achieve full cost recovery within a period of 3 to 7 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Promotional campaigns are used to raise the willingness to pay for services, and local procedures and ordinances provide additional incentives for compliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3323">{{for|other uses of the term|flexibility (disambiguation)}}
'''Flexibility''' is used as an attribute of various types of [[systems]]. In the field of [[engineering]] systems design, it refers to designs that can adapt when external changes occur. Flexibility has been defined differently in many fields of engineering, architecture, biology, economics, etc. In the context of engineering design one can define flexibility as the ability of a system to respond to potential internal or external changes affecting its value delivery, in a timely and cost-effective manner. Thus, flexibility for an engineering system is the ease with which the system can respond to [[uncertainty]] in a manner to sustain or increase its value delivery. Uncertainty is a key element in the definition of flexibility. Uncertainty can create both [[risks]] and opportunities in a system, and it is with the existence of uncertainty that flexibility becomes valuable.

== Flexible Manufacturing System ==
Flexibility has been especially thoroughly studied for [[manufacturing]] systems. For manufacturing science eleven different classes of flexibility have been identified [Browne, 1984], [Sethi and Sethi, 1990]:

* '''Machine flexibility''' - The different operation types that a machine can perform.
* '''Material handling flexibility''' - The ability to move the products within a manufacturing facility.
* '''Operation flexibility''' - The ability to produce a product in different ways.
* '''Process flexibility''' - The set of products that the system can produce.
* '''Product flexibility''' - The ability to add new products in the system.
* '''Routing flexibility''' - The different routes (through machines and workshops) that can be used to produce a product in the system.
* '''Volume flexibility''' - The ease to profitably increase or decrease the output of an existing system. At firm level, it is the ability of a firm to operate profitably at different output levels. Firms often use volume flexibility as a benchmark to assess their performance vis-à-vis their competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, Samir K and Bansal, Sahil, "Measuring and Comparing Volume Flexibility across Indian Firms", ''International Journal of Business Performance Management'', 14(1), 2013,  pp. 38-51.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expansion flexibility''' - The ability to build out the capacity of a system.
* '''Program flexibility''' - The ability to run a system automatically.
* '''Production flexibility''' - The number of products a system currently can produce.
* '''Market flexibility''' - The ability of the system to adapt to market demands.

These definitions yield under current conditions of the system and that no major setups are conducted or investments are made (except ''expansion flexibility''). Many of the flexibility types are linked to each other; increasing one flexibility type also increases another. But in some cases tradeoffs between two flexibility types are needed.

'''Genetically engineered blood''' is blood that has been modified for therapeutic or other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Startup Says Engineered Blood Cells Can Deliver Drugs to the Body {{!}} MIT Technology Review|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/544281/turning-red-blood-cells-into-versatile-drug-carriers/|website = MIT Technology Review|last=Orcutt |first=Mike  |date=December 9, 2015|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

Genetically modifying red blood [[stem cells]] allows them to produce specific therapeutic proteins on the surface or inside the cell. The stem cells are taken from [[mammal]]ian [[bone marrow]] and are modified in culture. Before they become mature, mammalian red blood cells eject their genetic material. Culturing cells that produce a new protein of interest requires only a few weeks. Using the [[sortagging]] [[protein labeling]] technique, the researchers used the [[bacterial enzyme]] [[sortase A]] to establish a strong chemical bond between the surface protein and a substance of choice, such as a small-molecule therapeutic agent or an [[antibody]]. The modifications leave the cells and their surfaces otherwise intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Engineered red blood cells as carriers for systemic delivery of a wide array of functional probes|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/10131|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2014-07-15|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4104923|pmid = 24982154|pages = 10131–10136|volume = 111|issue = 28|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1409861111|language = en|first = Jiahai|last = Shi|first2 = Lenka|last2 = Kundrat|first3 = Novalia|last3 = Pishesha|first4 = Angelina|last4 = Bilate|first5 = Chris|last5 = Theile|first6 = Takeshi|last6 = Maruyama|first7 = Stephanie K.|last7 = Dougan|first8 = Hidde L.|last8 = Ploegh|first9 = Harvey F.|last9 = Lodish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

One application is to engineer [[red blood cells]] into drug-delivery vehicles. Mature red cells carry no genetic material, potentially presenting fewer safety risks than other [[gene therapy|gene]] and [[cell therapies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home|url = http://www.rubiustx.com/|website = Rubius Therapeutics|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human red blood cells circulate for as long as four months, meaning they could potentially form the basis of long-term therapies. The cells move throughout body via the [[bloodstream]] and are unnoticed by the [[immune system]].

'''The Geneva Centre for Education and Research in Humanitarian Action''' ({{lang-fr|Centre d'enseignement et de recherche en action humanitaire de Genève}}) (CERAH) offers a wide range of comprehensive and specialized postgraduate training programmes for professionals active in the humanitarian sector. A joint Centre of the [[University of Geneva]] and the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/research/research-community/centres-conjoints.html|title=The Graduate Institute, Geneva - Joint Programmes|website=graduateinstitute.ch|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; CERAH is firmly anchored in Geneva's rich academic environment. It is one of the few institutes dedicated to the study of humanitarian action. It offers modular and flexible academic training programmes, distance or residential ones, and scholarship opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/home/|title=CERAH Homepage|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Geneva's academic platform for humanitarian action, CERAH's focus lies on capacity strengthening and the reinforcement of both individual and collective competencies with the ultimate goal of contributing to an improved quality of the humanitarian response. Its programmes allow participants to develop a strong understanding of various conceptual and operational aspects of humanitarian action and equip them to define and implement strategic humanitarian responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/files/1914/7627/9340/CERAH-ActivityReport_2015-16_web.pdf|title=CERAH Activity Report 2015/16|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cerahgeneve.ch|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offering a variety of courses ranging from short courses (TSC) to a comprehensive Master's programme, CERAH provides flexible and modular opportunities for professionals to deepen their knowledge. The current educational offer encompasses seven postgraduate programmes (a [http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/master/ master programme], one diploma, and five certificate courses) and a dozen of intensive courses on specific issues (TSC). Responding to its international audience, CERAH offers a distance-learning course in "Designing Strategies and Projects for Humanitarian Action" which allows participants to study and learn from their own context, without having to be in Geneva. During the course students develop an action plan, which they can directly implement in their work situation. In addition, CERAH offers a Massive Open Online Course on Humanitarian Communications, in partnership with the University of Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CERAH launches its first massive open online course (MOOC): Humanitarian communication, addressing key challenges|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/fr/cerah-launches-its-first-massive-open-online-course-mooc-humanitarian-communication-addressing-key-c|website=International Geneva|publisher=International Geneva|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanitarian studies lie at the crossroads of various disciplines. As a result, CERAH promotes a multi-disciplinary approach to learning, and draws on the expertise of a range of academics and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaq.ch/download/verfahrensberichte/vb-programm/2015-07-15%20UniGE%20MAS-HA%20External%20review%20report.pdf|title=Academic Programme Accreditation MAS in Humanitarian Action|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CERAH also undertakes critical research that aims to assess concepts, policies and responses in order to improve humanitarian responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|url=http://cerahgeneve.ch/research/|website=CERAH|publisher=CERAH|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CERAH was founded in 1998 with the support of the University of Geneva and the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]]. Its existence is a testimony to the gradual and collective effort over the past 19 years of bringing together a multitude of academic and humanitarian actors.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of CERAH|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/cerah/history/|website=CERAH|publisher=CERAH|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre underwent several phases of transformation. At the time of its establishment, it was known as the Multifaculty Programme for Humanitarian Action (PPAH) and only offered a university diploma. It was set up to provide high-level, continuing university education to humanitarian practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geneva Centre for Education and Research in Humanitarian Action|url=http://www.masteretudes.fr/universites/Suisse/Geneva-Centre-for-Education-and-Research-in-Humanitarian-Action/|website=MASTERETUDES.FR|publisher=MASTERETUDES.FR|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was transformed in 2004, following its partnership with the Graduate Institute of International Aid Development studies. Renamed as the Interdisciplinary Programme in Humanitarian Action (PIAH), it introduced an advanced masters programme in collaboration with the I [https://www.icrc.org/en International Committee of the Red Cross] and [http://www.msf.ch/ Médecins Sans Frontières] (MSF) Suisse. A reform process in 2008 led to the creation of CERAH, as we know it today. Changes at the international level as well as in the academic and humanitarian fields led the Geneva university community to envisage a more ambitious role for CERAH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geneva Centre for Education and Research in Humanitarian Action|url=http://www.healthcarestudies.com/universities/Switzerland/Geneva-Centre-for-Education-and-Research-in-Humanitarian-Action/|website=HEALTHCARESTUDIES.COM|publisher=HEALTHCARESTUDIES.COM|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years, particularly after 2011, under the leadership of Professor Doris Schopper, CERAH revised its postgraduate educational offer to better respond to the needs of humanitarian organizations and professionals. It led to the development of seven postgraduate degrees (1 MAS, 1 DAS, 5 CAS) and several one-week intensive seminars on specific issues.

== Degree and Training Programmes ==

=== Master of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action (MAS) ===

The MAS in Humanitarian Action is a 10- to 12-month full-time programme of 60 [[European Credit Transfer System]] (ECTS) credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/master/|title=Master of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action (MAS)|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is focused on building in-depth understanding of the central conceptual and operational aspects of humanitarian action.

The multidisciplinary and interactive programme, delivered in English, comprises three parts:
* A core curriculum of three months focusing on the theory and fundamental questions of humanitarian action (30ECTS);
* Two elective specialising courses of seven weeks each (20ECTS in total) to be chosen by the participants among different themes;
* An academic dissertation (10 ECTS), introduced by a 3 weeks course on research and methodology. 
Since 2012, the MAS in Humanitarian Action is offered to international managers in the humanitarian and development sector (with at least 2 years of working experience and holding a higher education institution degree), who wish to deepen their competencies in specific areas and add an academic and analytical dimension to their professional skills. Its modular set-up allows for maximum flexibility. Participant can complete the MAS in 1, 2 or 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/master/programme/|title=MAS modularity|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This programme was awarded unconditional accreditation by the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (AAQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaq.ch/download/verfahrensberichte/vb-programm/2015-07-15%20UniGE%20MAS-HA%20External%20review%20report.pdf|title=Programme Accreditation PDF|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cerahgeneve.ch|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diploma of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action (DAS) ===

The Diploma of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action is a 19-week programme of 30 ECTS credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerahgeneve.ch/training/diploma/|title=Diploma of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Action (DAS)|website=CERAH|publisher=CERAH|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This core course is divided in three modules and completed by an individual work (dissertation). Through the study of past and present humanitarian crises, participants acquire the tools needed to analyse, understand and engage in critical reflection on the response to humanitarian emergencies today.

Academics and experts from a wide range of NGOs and international organisations deliver lectures. The programme is participatory, based on case studies and discussions.

=== Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) ===

CERAH also offers seven-week 10-ECTS certificate courses. The courses are designed for managers to improve their competencies and leadership in defining and implementing specific strategies, while focusing on problem-solving in professional realities.

List of CAS courses available:

* [https://www.cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/courses-project-cycle-management/people-management/ People Management in Humanitarian Settings]

==== Distance Learning Programme ====
Within the CAS programmes, CERAH offers an 8-month distance-learning programme "[http://cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/distance-learning/designing-strategies-and-projects/ Designing Strategies and Projects in Humanitarian Action]", which comprises 15 ECTS. The course enhances the capacity of individual and institutional humanitarian actors to devise and implement effective humanitarian responses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerahgeneve.ch/training/humanitarian-distance-learning/|title=Measuring the Effectiveness of Humanitarian Capacity Building through Distance Learning|website=Inter Agency Working Group on Disaster Preparedness for East and Central Africa|publisher=Inter Agency Working Group on Disaster Preparedness for East and Central Africa|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Learn as you work, work as you learn."''' Specifically adapted to the needs of working humanitarian professionals, this course allows participants to study and learn from their own context. During the course students develop an action plan, which they can directly implement in their work situation. The programme is fairly autonomous where students develop their own learning objectives based on current challenges. At the end of the programme, participants develop relevant competencies to design and adapt humanitarian strategies and projects according to the specifics of each context.

The course involves e-learning, a residential session in Kampala (Uganda) and individual coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerahgeneve.ch/training/humanitarian-distance-learning/|title=HDL: Humanitarian Distance Learning|website=CERAH|publisher=CERAH|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CERAH developed the Humanitarian Distance Learning programme to increase access to training particularly for national staff as well as to allow students to study from their own context.

=== Thematic Short Courses (TSC) ===
Specific themes are proposed as 1-week Thematic Short Courses (TSC). Offering topics that matter (e.g. nutrition, sexual violence, forced migration, negotiation) the courses attract new audiences and eventually, encourage participants to enrol in other trainings.

=== MOOC ===
The Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) "Humanitarian communication: addressing key challenges" focuses on the challenges of communication in humanitarian settings and the means of addressing these. This 5-week online course is repeated throughout the academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cerahgeneve.ch/education-training/distance-learning/humanitarian-communication/|title=Humanitarian communication|website=www.cerahgeneve.ch|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

CERAH staff conducts research on a range of themes linked to humanitarian action including health, law, protracted crises and the political economy of humanitarian crises.

The [https://humanitarianencyclopedia.org/ Humanitarian Encyclopedia] is a flagship project from CERAH to explore the different ways key humanitarian concepts are understood across space, time and disciplines .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cerahgeneve.ch/research/res/|title=Research - Humanitarian Encyclopedia|last=|first=|date=|website=Humanitarian Encyclopedia|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new project offers a conceptual framework for humanitarian action, and providing a dynamic platform for national and international practitioners, community leaders, policy makers and academics to reflect on humanitarian concepts and practice for the 21st century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">The '''Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)''' is a spatial database of the [[country subdivision|administrative units]] for all the [[country|countries]] in the world. It is a project of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]]. 

==Mission==
The GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable geographic information on [[country subdivision|administrative units]] for all the [[country|countries]] in the world, thereby contributing to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. In this framework, its purposes are:

* to overcome the fragmentation of the global dataset occurring when administrative units layers are digitized on a country-by-country basis
* to keep historical track of changes occurring on the shapes and extent of the administrative units
* to promote a unified [[georeference|coding]] system that reduces maintenance efforts.

==Characteristics==
The GAUL always maintains global geographic layers (in [[shapefile]] format) with a unified coding system at the levels of country, first administrative (e.g. regions), and second administrative (e.g. districts). In addition, when data is available, it provides layers on a country-by-country basis down to third, fourth and lower levels. The target beneficiary of the GAUL data is the UN community, universities, and other authorized international and national institutions/agencies. Data might not be officially validated by authoritative national sources and can not be distributed to the general public. A disclaimer should always accompany any use of the GAUL data. 

Because the GAUL works at global level, controversial [[border|boundaries]] can not be ignored. The approach of the GAUL is to maintain [[territorial dispute|disputed]] areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries.

The coastline of the GAUL is mostly compliant with the coast of the International Boundary map delivered by the UN Cartographic Section except for some countries (e.g. [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], etc.) where it has been updated according to the satellite images (e.g. [[Landsat program|Landsat]] ETM). For future releases of the GAUL, the process of updating the coastline will go on, country by country, through a comparison with the satellite images.

The GAUL keeps track of administrative units that have been changed, added, or deleted in the past. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in the GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named the '''GAUL Set'''. The GAUL project does not implement changes dated before 1990.

GAUL codes are numeric and unique for all administrative units at any of the administrative hierarchical level. Any GAUL code is independent from the codes of its higher administrative levels. GAUL codes assigned to administrative units of a given country are not necessarily sequential numbers. The main benefit of the GAUL Coding System is that changing in the codes of an administrative unit might not imply a change of codes of the correspondent units at lower levels. This means that the effort to maintain the links between thematic data and associated administrative units is reduced to a minimum.

==Organization==
The implementation of the GAUL initiative is based on a collaborative work among international agencies and national authorities generating and collecting spatial information on administrative units. The role of FAO is to keep this network of collaborators active, to evaluate and compile data from available sources, to establish procedures for data integration, to generate the GAUL codes and periodically to disseminate the GAUL Set. The overall methodology consists in:

# collecting the best available data from most reliable sources
# establishing validation periods of the geographic features (when possible)
# adding selected data to the global layer based on the international boundaries provided by the UN Cartographic Unit
# generating codes using the GAUL Coding System
# distributing data to the users

The GAUL has a consistent framework for the delivery of the data. Once a year, an updated version of the GAUL set is released through [http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/ Geonetwork].  A new version includes all updates made in the course of the previous year. The dataset is free of charge and it can be downloaded by login (to receive an account, just send an email to the contacts listed at the bottom of this article). The new version GAUL 2009 will be available on Geonetwork from January 2009.

[[Image:WaterScrewPerpetualMotion.png|thumb|right|An engraving of [[Robert Fludd]]'s 1618 "water screw" perpetual motion machine.]]
The history of [[perpetual motion]] machines dates at least back to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pomeroy |first1=Ross |title=Perpetual Motion Is Impossible... Right? |url=https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/06/perpetual-motion.html |website=realclearscience.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, but modern theories of [[thermodynamics]] have shown that they are impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to construct such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents sometimes use other terms, such as "overunity", to describe their inventions.

There are two types of perpetual motion machines:
* ''Perpetual motion machines of the first kind'' are those devices that violate the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the principle of conservation of energy, creating energy out of nothing. Most attempts fall into this category.
* ''Perpetual motion machines of the second kind'' are devices that violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Even though they obey the principle of conservation of energy, they attempt extraction of work from a single heat reservoir, violating the principle of no [[entropy]] decrease in an isolated macroscopic thermodynamic system.

===Pre-19th century===
There are some unsourced claims&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Eberhart(2007):''Feeding the fire: the lost history and uncertain future of mankind's energy'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; that a perpetual motion machine called the "magic wheel" (a wheel spinning on its axle powered by lodestones) appeared in 8th-century [[Bavaria]]. This historical claim appears to be unsubstantiated though often repeated.

Early designs of perpetual motion machines were done by Indian [[Indian mathematics|mathematician]]–[[Indian astronomy|astronomer]] [[Bhāskara II|Bhaskara II]], who described a wheel ([[Bhāskara's wheel]]) that he claimed would run forever.&lt;ref name="Lynn Townsend White 1960 p. 522-526"&gt;[[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]] (April 1960). "Tibet, India, and Malaya as Sources of Western Medieval Technology", ''The American Historical Review'' '''65''' (3), p. 522-526.&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawing of a perpetual motion machine appeared in the sketchbook of [[Villard de Honnecourt]], a 13th-century  French master [[stonemason|mason]] and architect. The sketchbook was concerned with [[mechanics]] and [[architecture]]. Following the example of Villard, [[Peter of Maricourt]] designed a magnetic globe which, if it were mounted without friction parallel to the celestial axis, would rotate once a day. It was intended to serve as an automatic [[armillary sphere]].&lt;ref name="Lynn Townsend White 1960 p. 522-526"/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] made a number of drawings of devices he hoped would make free [[energy]]. Leonardo da Vinci was generally against such devices, but drew and examined numerous overbalanced wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Time-Life Books (1991). ''Inventive Genius''. 143 pages. Page 125. {{ISBN|0-8094-7699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Philip J. Mirowski, (1991). ''More Heat Than Light: Economics As Social Physics: Physics As Nature's Economics'' 462 pages. Page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Anthony Zimara, a 16th-century Italian scholar, proposed a self-blowing windmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=022yYXnS_GQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22Directions+for+constructing+a+Perpetual+Motion+Machine+without+the+Use+of+Water+or+a+Weight%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0CRBPA8XUb&amp;sig=HG5hN7WSjTWvjywmNe5Qs4lIFtQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E-R7TfqZCqKD0QGHkKXrAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Directions%20for%20constructing%20a%20Perpetual%20Motion%20Machine%20without%20the%20Use%20of%20Water%20or%20a%20Weight%22&amp;f=false |title=Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession |first=Arthur W.

Various scholars in this period investigated the topic. In 1607 [[Cornelius Drebbel]] in "Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh" dedicated a Perpetuum motion machine to [[James I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Wondervondt.pdf |title=Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by Heinrich Hiesserle von Chodaw in 1621.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drebbel.net/1621%20PPM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310193332/http://www.drebbel.net/1621%20PPM.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]] devised the "perpetual vase" ("perpetual goblet" or "hydrostatic paradox") which was discussed by [[Denis Papin]] in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' for 1685.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/pascal.html "Inventor of the Week Archive: Pascal : Mechanical Calculator"], May 2003. "Pascal worked on many versions of the devices, leading to his attempt to create a perpetual motion machine. He has been credited with introducing the roulette machine, which was a by-product of these experiments."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Bernoulli]] proposed a fluid energy machine. In 1686, [[Georg Andreas Böckler]], designed a "self operating" self-powered [[water mill]] and several perpetual motion machines using balls using variants of [[Archimedes' screw]]s. In 1712, [[Johann Bessler]] ([[Orffyreus]]), claimed to have experimented with 300 different perpetual motion models before developing what he said were working models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simaneck |first1=Donald E. |title=Perpetual Futility |url=https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/museum/people/people.htm |website=lockhaven.edu |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1760s, [[James Cox (inventor)|James Cox]] and [[John Joseph Merlin]] developed [[Cox's timepiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Arthur W. J. G. Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-60131-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cox claimed that the timepiece was a true perpetual motion machine, but as the device is powered by changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] via a [[mercury barometer]], this is not the case.

In 1775, the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris]] made the statement that the Academy "will no longer accept or deal with proposals concerning perpetual motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scaffer |first1=Simon |title=The Show That Never Ends: Perpetual Motion in the Early Eighteenth Century |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=June 1995 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=157 - 189 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027676?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===

====19th century====
In 1812, [[Charles Redheffer]], in [[Philadelphia]], claimed to have developed a "generator" that could power other machines. The machine was open for viewing in Philadelphia, where Redheffer raised large amount of money from the admission fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/nov/13/research.highereducation2|title=Too good to be true|last=Radford|first=Tim|date=2003-11-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redheffer moved his machine to New York, after his cover was blown in Philadelphia, while applying for government funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Clifford B. (April 1961). "Why won't they work?". ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage Magazine]]''. American Heritage Publishing Company. Retrieved 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that [[Robert Fulton]] exposed Redheffer's schemes during an exposition of the device in New York City (1813). Removing some concealing wooden strips, Fulton found a [[catgut]] belt drive went through a wall to an attic. In the attic, a man was turning a crank to power the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/redheffer.html|title=This page has moved|author=|date=|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information originally at www.skepticfiles.org/skep2/pmotion2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi438.htm|title=No. 438: Redheffer's PMM-I|author=|date=|website=www.uh.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet]] devised a machine running on [[capillary action]] that would disobey the principle that water seeks its own level, so to produce a continuous ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over pulleys. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of sponge, a bed and, over this, again an endless band of heavy weights jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still water. Congreve believed his system would operate continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perpetual Motion |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/perpetual-motion-1911-11-18/ |website=scientificamerican.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1868, an Austrian, Alois Drasch, received a US patent for a machine that possessed a "thrust key-type [[gear]]ing" of a [[rotary engine]]. The vehicle driver could tilt a trough depending upon need. A heavy ball rolled in a cylindrical trough downward, and, with continuous adjustment of the device's levers and power output, Drasch believed that it would be possible to power a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp-gramatke.de/pmm_physics/german/page0300.htm|title=HPs Perpetuum Mobile Physik. Die Geschichte der schiefen Ebene und   ihrer Verwendung in perpetua Mobilia.|author=|date=|website=www.hp-gramatke.de|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, E.P. Willis of New Haven, Connecticut made money from a "proprietary" perpetual motion machine. A story of the overcomplicated device with a hidden source of energy appears in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' article "The Greatest Discovery Ever Yet Made". Investigation into the device eventually found a source of power that drove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogyimagesofhistory.com/images/amotion.JPG|title=Image of Scientific American|author=|date=|website=genealogyimagesofhistory.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ernst Worrell Keely]] claimed the invention of an induction resonance motion motor. He explained that he used "etheric technology". In 1872, Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the vibrations of [[tuning fork]]s. Scientists investigated his machine which appeared to run on water, though Keely endeavoured to avoid this. Shortly after 1872, [[venture capitalist]]s accused Keely of fraud (they lost nearly five million dollars). Keely's machine, it was discovered after his death, was based on hidden air pressure tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Keely's Secret Disclosed.; Scientists Examine His Laboratory and Discover Hidden Tubes in Proof of His Deception. | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | pages =  | year =  | date = 20 January 1899 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/01/20/102408633.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1900 to 1950====
In 1900, [[Nikola Tesla]] claimed to have discovered an abstract principle on which to base a perpetual motion machine of the [[Perpetual motion classification#Classification|second kind]]. No prototype was produced. He wrote:{{cquote|A departure from known methods – possibility of a "self-acting" engine or machine, inanimate, yet capable, like a living being, of deriving energy from the medium – the ideal way of obtaining motive power.&lt;ref name="Tesla 2018 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Tesla | first=N. | title=The Problem of Increasing Human Energy: with Special References to the Harnessing of the Sunâ€™s Energy | publisher=Charles River Editors | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-5080-1717-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EF9lDwAAQBAJ | access-date=1 July 2018 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Unaipon]], Australian inventor, had a lifelong fascination with perpetual motion. One of his studies on Newtonian mechanics led him to create a [[Sheep shearing|shearing]] machine in 1910 that converted curvilineal motion into straight line movement. The device is the basis of modern mechanical shears.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Jenkin, ''Conquest of the Ngarrindjeri'' (1979), pp. 234-236, {{ISBN|0-7270-1112-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s and 1920s, Harry Perrigo of Kansas City, Missouri, a graduate of [[MIT]], claimed development of a free energy device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/list.cfm?list=sub&amp;SubjectareaID=77176 Harry E. Perrigo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008094240/http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/list.cfm?list=sub&amp;SubjectareaID=77176 |date=2007-10-08 }}, a vertical file at the [http://www.kclibrary.org/ Kansas City Public Library] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], described as follows: "Photos, illustrations, and information on Harry Perrigo, a local inventor of a "free energy" device in the 1910s-1920s turning out to be a hoax. Energy source of "invention" supposedly "from thin air" or from "ether waves" but in actually from a hidden battery."&lt;/ref&gt; Perrigo claimed the energy source was "from thin air" or from aether waves. He demonstrated the device before the Congress of the United States on December 15, 1917. Perrigo had a pending application&lt;ref&gt;filed December 31, 1925; Serial Number 78,719&lt;/ref&gt; for the "Improvement in Method and Apparatus for Accumulating and Transforming Ether Electric Energy". Investigators report that his device contained a hidden motor battery.&lt;ref&gt;Citations originally at www.kclibrary.org resources Subject area ID 77176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perpetual Motion by Norman Rockwell.jpg|thumb|222px|Cover of the October 1920 issue of ''Popular Science'' magazine]]
''[[Popular Science]]'', in the October 1920 issue, published an article on the lure of perpetual motion.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Rowland. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pykDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;f=false "The undying lure of perpetual motion"]. ''Popular Science'', October 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===

====1951 to 1980====
During the middle of the 20th century, [[Viktor Schauberger]] claimed to have discovered some special vortex energy in water. Since his death in 1958, people are still studying his works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010409231732/http://www.frank.germano.com/viktorschauberger.htm Who was Viktor Schauberger?] frank.germano.com.

In 1966, [[Josef Papp]] (sometimes referred to as Joseph Papp or Joseph Papf) supposedly developed an alternative [[car engine]] that used [[noble gas|inert gases]]. He gained a few investors but when the engine was publicly demonstrated, an explosion killed one of the observers and injured two others. Papp blamed the accident on interference by  physicist [[Richard Feynman]], who later shared his observations in an article in ''Laser'', the journal of the Southern Californian Skeptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/comments/papparticle2.html|title=Feynman on Papp|author=|date=|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papp continued to accept money but never demonstrated another engine.

On December 20 of 1977, Emil T. Hartman received {{US patent|4215330}} titled "Permanent magnet propulsion system". This device is related to the [[Simple Magnetic Overunity Toy]] (SMOT).

[[Guido Franch]] reportedly had a process of [[Alchemy|transmuting]] water molecules into high-[[octane]] [[gasoline]] compounds (named [[Mota fuel]]) that would reduce the price of gasoline to 8 cents per gallon. This process involved a green [[Powder (substance)|powder]] (this claim may be related to the similar ones of John Andrews (1917)). He was brought to court for [[fraud]] in 1954 and [[acquittal|acquitted]], but in 1973 was convicted. [[Judge|Justice]] William Bauer and Justice Philip Romiti both observed a demonstration in the 1954 case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_399.html|title=Is there a pill that can turn water into gasoline?|author=|date=14 December 1984|website=straightdope.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Otis T. Carr]] from [[Oklahoma]] formed a company to manufacture [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]-styled [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s and [[hovercraft]]. Carr sold [[stock]] for this [[Commerce|commercial]] endeavour. He also promoted [[Second law of thermodynamics|free energy]] [[machine]]s. He claimed inspiration from [[Nikola Tesla]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keelynet.com/gravity/carr3.htm|title=Otis Carr Flying Machine - KeelyNet 12/23/01|author=|date=|website=www.keelynet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, physicist [[Richard Feynman]] discussed a [[Brownian ratchet]] that would supposedly extract meaningful work from [[Brownian motion]], although he went on to demonstrate how such a device would fail to work in practice.&lt;ref name="Feynman" &gt;{{cite book | last = Feynman | first = Richard P. | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 1 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1963 | location = Massachusetts, USA | pages = Chapter 46 | isbn =0-201-02116-1 | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, David Hamel produced the Hamel generator, an "[[antigravity]]" device, supposedly after an [[alien abduction]].

[[File:USPatent4151431-2.png|thumb|222px|right|Howard R. Johnson's US Patent 4151431]]
[[Howard Robert Johnson]] developed a permanent magnet motor and, on April 24, 1979, received {{US patent|4151431}}.[The United States Patent office main classification of his 4151431 patent is as a "electrical generator or motor structure, dynamoelectric, linear" (310/12).] Johnson said that his device generates motion, either rotary or linear, from nothing but permanent magnets in rotor as well as stator, acting against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Science &amp; Mechanics|author=Jorma Hyypia|title=Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor |date= Spring 1980|url=http://www.newebmasters.com/freeenergy/sm-pg45.html }} (Cover illustration is [http://www.rexresearch.com/johnson/1johnson.htm#scimech here].)&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated that permanent magnets made of proper hard materials should lose less than two percent of their magnetization in powering a device for 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qsYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lmcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6671,6264163 |title=Industrial Engineer Gets Patent for a Device Powered by Magnets |date=April 29, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motionless electromagnetic generator (MEG) was built by Tom Bearden. Allegedly, the device can eventually sustain its operation in addition to powering a load without application of external electrical power. Bearden claimed that it didn't violate the first law of thermodynamics because it extracted [[zero-point energy|vacuum energy]] from the immediate environment.&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;[[Martin Gardner]], [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/dr._bearden_vacuum_energy/ "'Dr' Bearden's Vacuum Energy"], ''Skeptical Inquirer'', January/February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Critics dismiss this theory and instead identify it as a perpetual motion machine with an unscientific rationalization.&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn040502.html "Free Energy: Perpetual Motion Scams are at an All-Time High"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622223211/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn040502.html |date=2012-06-22 }}, ''What's New'', APS, 5 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn050302.html "Vacuum Energy: How Do You Patent a Perpetual-Motion Machine?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622223334/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn050302.html |date=2012-06-22 }}, ''What's New'', APS, 3 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parkJune2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fnal.gov/~prebys/talks/perpetual_motion/perpetual_motion_public.pdf Energy: No Such Thing as a Free Lunch"], Eric Prebys, Guest Lecture at Columbia University, November 4, 2008.

'''HyShot''' is a research project of The [[University of Queensland]], [[Australia]] [http://hypersonics.mechmining.uq.edu.au/ Centre for Hypersonics], to demonstrate the possibility of supersonic combustion under flight conditions using two scramjet engines, one designed by The University of Queensland and one designed by QinetiQ (formerly the MOD's Defence Evaluation &amp; Research Agency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael K. Smart, Neal E. Hass, and Allan Paull.  "Flight Data Analysis of the HyShot 2 Scramjet Flight Experiment", AIAA Journal, Vol. 44, No. 10 (2006), pp. 2366-2375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British scramjet engine prepares for Australian space tests |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=2350 |publisher=[[The University of Queensland]] |format= |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The project has involved the successful launch of one engine designed by The University of Queensland, and one launch of the [[scramjet]] designed by the British company [[QinetiQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=2350 |title=British scramjet engine prepares for Australian space tests |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each combustion unit was launched on the nose of a [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]]-[[Orion (rocket)|Orion]] Mk70 [[sounding rocket]] on a high [[ballistics|ballistic]] trajectory, reaching altitudes of approximately 330&amp;nbsp;km.  The rocket was rotated to face the ground, and the combustion unit ignited for a period of 6–10 seconds while falling between 35&amp;nbsp;km and 23&amp;nbsp;km at around [[Mach number|Mach]]&amp;nbsp;7.6.  The system is not designed to produce thrust.

* The first HyShot flight was on 30 October 2001 but was a failure due to the rocket going off course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4832254.stm |title=Revolutionary jet engine tested |work=BBC News |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first successful launch (Hyshot II) was of a University of Queensland scramjet on 30 July 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is believed by many to be the first successful flight of a [[scramjet]] engine, although some dispute this and point primarily to earlier tests by [[Russia]]n scientists.&lt;ref&gt;A.Roudakov,
 V.Semenov, J.Hicks "Recent Flight Test Results of the Joint CIAMNASA 
Mach 6.5 Scramjet Flight Program" NASA/TP-1998-206548.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A second successful flight (HyShot III) using a [[QinetiQ]] scramjet was achieved on 25 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=9258 |title=HyShot scramjet experiment blasts off in South Australian desert |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later QinetiQ prototype is cylindrical with four stainless steel combustors around the outside.  The aerodynamics of the vehicle is improved by this arrangement but it was expensive to manufacture.
* The HyShot IV flight on 30 March 2006 launched successfully, and telemetry was received, however it is believed that the scramjet did not function as expected. Data analysis is required to confirm what occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=9303 |title=HyShot™4 scramjet experiment lifts off |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* HyCAUSE was launched on 15 June 2007. (The HyCAUSE experiment differed from the HyShot launches in that a Talos-Castor combination was used for launch and the target Mach number was 10.)
The carrier rocket for the HyShot experiments was composed of a [[RIM-2 Terrier]] first stage (6 second burn, 4000&amp;nbsp;km/h) and an [[Orion (US-rocket)|Orion]] second stage (26 second burn, 8600&amp;nbsp;km/h, 56&amp;nbsp;km altitude).  A fairing over the payload was then jettisoned.  The package then coasted to an altitude of around 300&amp;nbsp;km. Cold gas [[nitrogen]] [[attitude control]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] were used to re-orient the payload for [[atmospheric reentry]].  The experiments each lasted for some 5 seconds as the payload descended between approximately 35 and 23 kilometers altitude, when [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel was fed to the scramjet. [[Telemetry]] reported results to receivers on the ground for later analysis.  The payload landed about 400&amp;nbsp;km down range from the launch site, at which time its temperature was still expected to be about 300 degrees Celsius, which may be enough to cause a small brush fire and thereby make spotting and recovery easier even though a [[radio beacon]] was in the payload.

There has been much analysis of the data obtained in flight and comparison with results from experiments conducted in ground-testing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, AD; Hannemann, K; Paull, A; Steelant, J "Post flight analysis of the HyShot supersonic combustion flight experiment in HEG", In: Proceedings of the Fifth European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles. Editor: Danesy, D. ESA SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS, Volume: 563, Pages: 535-540. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The team continue to work as part of the [[Australian Hypersonics Initiative]], a joint program of The [[University of Queensland]], the [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of New South Wales]]' [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] campus, the governments of [[Government of Queensland|Queensland]] and [[Government of South Australia|South Australia]] and the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian Defence Department]].

The Hyshot program spawned the [[HyCAUSE]] (Hypersonic Collaborative Australian/United States Experiment) program [http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=5546]: a collaborative effort between the United States’ Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) and Australia's [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO), also representing the research collaborators in the Australian Hypersonics Initiative (AHI)[http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/news/5118/].

[[File:HiFire5b badge.jpg|thumb|right|Badge of the HiFire 5b launch program.]]
The Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE) program was created jointly by DSTO and the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] (AFRL). HIFiRE was formed to investigate hypersonic flight technology, the fundamental science and technology required, and its potential for next generation aeronautical systems.  This will involve up to ten flights with The [[University of Queensland]] involved in at least the first three:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Centre for Hypersonics - HyShot Flight Program &amp; HIFiRE program |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/hypersonics/index.html?page=19501 |publisher=[[The University of Queensland]] |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[ecclesiastical]] societies related to the College society at that point of time (1969) included:&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt;

* [[South Andhra Lutheran Church]] Society,
* [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] Society,
* [[Methodist Church in India|Methodist Church of South Asia]] Society,
* [[Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars]] Society,
* [[Church of South India]] Society (Dioceses of [[Diocese of Dornakal|Dornakal]], [[Krishna-Godavari Diocese|Krishna-Godavari]], [[Diocese of Medak|Medak]], and [[Diocese of Rayalaseema|Rayalaseema]]&lt;ref&gt;The Diocese of Karimnagar came into existence only in 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Church of India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon]] Society, Diocese of [[Diocese of Nandyal|Nandyal]]&lt;ref&gt;The Diocese of Nandyal was under the ecclesiastical purview of the Anglican Church and later the Church of North India at the time of formation of the College.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=O_hq6JUSLToC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=diocese%20of%20nandyal%20church%20of%20north%20india&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=diocese%20of%20nandyal%20church%20of%20north%20india&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society

The Commission Report was tabled before the Board of Governors of the College Society which eventually led to the building&lt;ref&gt;James A. Bergquist, P. Kambar Manickam, ''The Crisis of Dependency in Third World Ministries: A Critique of Inherited Missionary Forms in India'', Christian Literature Society, Madras, 1976, pp. 50, 63.[https://books.google.com/books?id=HPEcAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kretzmann+commission&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=kretzmann]&lt;/ref&gt; up of curriculum-intensive courses&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; and the equipping of the [[Seminarians]] with capacities to lead the [[Christian Church|Church]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].  Theological education took an upward rise with the Kretzmann Commission Report.  The Kretzmann Commission was enabled with the assistance of the Theological Education Fund of the [[World Council of Churches]] and the Board of World Missions of the [[Lutheran Church in America]].&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt;  The Secretary of the Board of Governors, [[W. D. Coleman]] on behalf of the Board of Governors published a 1,000&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; copies to be circulated among the Churches in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].

A couple of years before the Kretzmann Commission was constituted, [[Seminarians]] deliberated on the Church's mission with special reference to [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].  In 1966, a graduate thesis was undertaken by a candidate studying at [[Serampore College]], [[Serampore]] entitled ''The Hebrew Concept of 'Righteousness' as proclaimed by the 8th century Prophets and its implications for the Church's mission in [[Andhra Pradesh]]''&lt;ref&gt;G. Babu Rao, ''The Hebrew Concept of 'Righteousness' as proclaimed by the 8th century Prophets and its implications for the Church's mission in [[Andhra Pradesh]]'', an unpublished graduate thesis presented to the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Bachelor of Divinity degree, Serampore, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission members==
* [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] M. L. Kretzmann, [[D.D.]], Secretary for planning, study and research, Department of World Missions of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] (Convenor),
* [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] [[K. Devasahayam]], [[M.A.]], [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] ([[Hon.]]), [[S.T.M.]], [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]],

* [[The Right Reverend|The Rt. Rev.]] C. S. Sundaresan, [[Bishop]] - in - [[Diocese of Rayalaseema|Rayalaseema]], [[Church of South India]]

==Findings==
The Commission members met during various points of time during the latter half of 1969,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; first on 25 October 1969 to draw up a plan and again a month later during 26–29 November to summarize its findings.  The members of the Commission met at different places for visitation and consultation.  As part of field visits,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; the members had been to,
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Luther Giri.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Chapel ([[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church|AELC]]-Christ Church) in [[Rajahmundry]], the erstwhile campus of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]].]] --&gt;

* [[St. John's Regional Seminary|St. John's Regional Seminary (Theologiate)]], [[Ramanthapur]],
* [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary, [[Ramayapatnam]],
* Lutheran Bible Training Institute, [[Rajahmundry]].

In addition, the members of the Commission also had special consultations&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; with [[Canon Emani Sambayya]], [[Dr.]] P. David [[Ph.D.]] ([[Yale University|Yale]]) and [[The Reverend|Rev.]] Erik W. Nielsen.  As for the background material, the Commission members accessed scholarly action reports relating&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; to the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society, especially the papers of [[B. V. Subbamma]], [[S. W. Schmitthenner]], [[W. P. Peery]] and James A. Bergquist, the papers of the [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]], the [[National Council of Churches in India]] and other papers.  The Commission took cognizance of the concerns of the Church in [[Andhra Pradesh]] ([[Telangana]] included).

The Commission also devised a structured questionnaire&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; for use among two kinds of respondents, the Church Leaders and the Old Students, during field visits.

==Outcome==
At the very outset, the Commission recommended for [[Indian people|Indian]] Teachers&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; to be placed in Seminaries to take up theological curriculum, especially for the core subjects in theology.  The Commission further recommended that theological education broaden its horizons in keeping up with the changing times.  Based on the recommendations of the Commission, the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] did away with the erstwhile [[Licentiate in Theology]] programme and embarked on two graduate programmes,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; namely, the [[Bachelor of Theology]] and the [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degrees.  As part of the curruculum study, the Commission Members foresaw the need to include [[Worship]], Social Analysis, [[Inter-faith]], [[gender]] concerns, [[inculturation]], [[Psychology]], Language [[Usability]], personal devotion, [[Sociology]] and many other inter-disciplinary courses.&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt;  In the ensuing [[decade]], the Faculty Members were able to upgrade their academics at national and international [[Universities]] and returned to teach in the College who include,&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ACTC tower.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Bell Tower of the Protestant Regional Theologiate in [[Hyderabad]], the present campus of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]].]] --&gt;

Many of these Teachers also played a role at the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] and subsequent curriculum revisions at the University level.  In 1985, a [[Content analysis]] of theological [[syllabi]] being taught at the [[Seminaries]] in the country was undertaken by the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society, [[Bangalore]].  The [[New Testament]] Scholar M. V. Abraham&lt;ref name="Siga"/&gt; and the [[Old Testament]] Scholar G. Babu Rao,&lt;ref&gt;G. Babu Rao, "Content Analysis of Theological Syllabi – Old Testament" in ''Religion and Society'', Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society, Bangalore, 1985.  [https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;q=g.babu+rao+doctoral+studies&amp;btnG=Search+Books]&lt;/ref&gt; the former being associated with the Leonard Theological College, [[Jabalpur]] and the latter associated with the [[Bible Society of India]] in [[Translations]] were given the task of finding out the extent of theological [[syllabi]] using the [[statistical]] [[tool]] of [[Content analysis]].&lt;ref name="Siga"/&gt;

Similarly, a research on the theological education in India was also undertaken by [[Siga Arles]] in the [[nineties]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and its findings were published with the title ''Theological education for the mission of the church in India, 1947–1987: theological education in relation to the identification of the task of mission and the development of ministries in India, 1947-1987, with special reference to the Church of South India''&lt;ref name="Siga"&gt;Siga Arles, ''Theological education for the mission of the church in India, 1947–1987: theological education in relation to the identification of the task of mission and the development of ministries in India, 1947–1987, with special reference to the Church of South India'', Peter Lang, Frankfurt, 1990.

'''Lateral computing''' is a [[lateral thinking]] approach to solving [[computing problem]]s.
Lateral thinking has been made popular by [[Edward de Bono]].&lt;ref name="DeBono90"&gt;{{cite book|first = E.|last = de Bono|year = 1990|title = Lateral Thinking for Management: A Handbook|publisher = Penguin Books|isbn = 0-07-094233-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This thinking technique is applied to generate creative ideas and solve problems. Similarly, by applying lateral-computing techniques to a problem, it can become much easier to arrive at a computationally inexpensive, easy to implement, efficient, innovative or unconventional solution.

The traditional or conventional approach to solving computing problems is to either build mathematical models or have an [[Conditional (computer programming)|IF- THEN -ELSE]] structure. For example, a [[brute-force search]] is used in many [[chess engine]]s,&lt;ref name="Hsu02"&gt;{{cite book|first =F. H.|last = Hsu|year=2002|title = Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer That Defeated the World Chess Champion|publisher = Princeton University Press|isbn =0-691-09065-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes may arrive at poor solutions. It is for problems like this that lateral computing can be useful to form a better solution.

A simple problem of truck backup can be used for illustrating lateral-computing{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This is one of the difficult tasks for traditional computing techniques, and has been efficiently solved by the use of [[fuzzy logic]] (which is a lateral computing technique).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Lateral-computing sometimes arrives at a novel solution for particular computing problem by using the model of how living beings, such as how humans, ants, and honeybees, solve a problem; how pure crystals are formed by annealing, or evolution of living beings or quantum mechanics etc.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}

==Logical thinking and artificial intelligence==
[[Chess]] position analysis can be used to illustrate the logical thinking. The following board position describes a chess problem which has to be solved with two moves.

The white has several options to make a move and [[checkmate]] the black. The move Rd5 × Rd7 or Rf7 × Rd7 will immediately provide material advantage to white. There are similar moves which capture pieces and provide immediate material advantages to the white. But a knight move Nc6 which does not provide any material advantage, provides a solution for checkmate for black in two moves.

|-

|-
|1||...||Rdxf7||2||Rd6++
|-
|1||...||Rfxf7||2||Re5++
|}

This is an example which illustrates the use of logical thinking. The logical thinking in chess progresses by evaluating the immediate material gain in each move. This will result in a solution which will require more number of moves or failure to checkmate. However, the not so obvious move of knight results in a very powerful checkmate. Even though this move does not look logical, it is the solution to two-move checkmate problem. A [[chess computer|computer programmed to play chess]] might miss out some good opportunities if it does a material-based search to find moves. Several attempts have been made to build the powerful chess computers in history.&lt;ref name="Hsu02" /&gt; But these chess computers have been defeated by [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[List of chess grandmasters|human chess players]].

===Logic programming===
The attempts to use [[logic programming]] such as prolog{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} to represent knowledge and build artificial intelligent systems has not provided the anticipated thrust to solving interesting problems.&lt;ref name="Boden90"&gt;{{cite book|first=M. A.|last = Boden|year =1990|title= The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-824855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RusselNovig03"&gt;{{cite book|first1=S.|last1=Russell|first2=P.|last2=Norvig|year=2003|title= Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|publisher= Prentice Hall Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of generalization and learning capability of these systems and exponential growth of the [[Conditional (programming)|IF-THEN ELSE]] rules has made this approach unpopular. An example to illustrate{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} the failure of the rule-based system is the following flawed proof:
{| style="margin:auto;"
|-
|Start with 81/4 = 81/4
|-
|Adding -20 to LHS and RHS gives:&lt;br&gt;-20 + 81/4 = -20 + 81/4
|-
|Splitting –20 as ( -36 + 16 ) on the LHS and ( -45 + 25 ) on the RHS:&lt;br&gt;16 + 81/4 -36 = -45 + 81/4 +25
|-
|Now expressing the terms 16, 25 and 81/4 as squares of 4, 5 and 9/2 respectively:&lt;br&gt;4² + (9/2)² - 2 * (9/2) * 4 = 5² + (9/2)² – 2 * (9/2) * 5
|-
|Expressing this as a² + b² – 2*a*b = (a-b)² gives:&lt;br&gt;(4 - 9/2)² = (5 - 9/2)²
|-
|Taking the [[square root]]s,&lt;br&gt;4 - 9/2 = 5 – 9/2
|}
This would imply that 4 = 5, which a wrong result. While taking the [[square root]]s, the step of considering the signs has been missed. This has resulted in an absurd outcome. A rule-based system, even if it missed a simple rule in its database may yield such an unacceptable output.

Another interesting mathematical proof gone wrong is as follows:

:Let a = b
:''Multiply both sides by b''
:ab = b²
:''Subtract a² from both sides''
:ab - a² = b² - a²
:''Factor each side''
:a(b - a) = (b+a)( b - a )
:''cancelling (b-a) from both sides''
:a = b+a

If a = 1, then we get an absurd result of 1 = 2

==From lateral-thinking to lateral-computing==
[[Lateral thinking]] is technique for creative thinking for solving problems.&lt;ref name="DeBono90" /&gt; The brain as center of thinking has a self-organizing information system. It tends to create patterns and traditional thinking process uses them to solve problems. The lateral thinking technique proposes to escape from this patterning to arrive at better solutions through new ideas. Provocative use of information processing is the basic underlying principle of lateral thinking,

The [[provocative operator]] (PO) is something which characterizes lateral thinking. Its function is to generate new ideas by provocation and providing escape route from old ideas. It creates a provisional arrangement of information.

[[Water logic]] is contrast to traditional or [[rock logic]].&lt;ref name="DeBono91"&gt;{{cite book|first =E.|last =de Bono|year=1991|title= Water Logic|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn =0-670-84231-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water logic has boundaries which depends on circumstances and conditions while rock logic has hard boundaries. Water logic, in someways, resembles [[fuzzy logic]].

===Transition to lateral-computing===
Lateral computing does a provocative use of [[information processing]] similar to lateral-thinking. This is explained with the use of evolutionary computing which is a very useful lateral-computing technique. The evolution proceeds by change and selection. While [[random mutation]] provides change, the selection is through [[survival of the fittest]]. The random mutation works as a provocative information processing and provides a new avenue for generating better solutions for the computing problem.

Lateral computing takes the analogies from real-world examples such as:

* How slow cooling of the hot gaseous state results in pure crystals ([[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]])
* How the [[neural network]]s in the brain solve such problems as face and [[speech recognition]]
* How simple insects such as ants and honeybees solve some sophisticated problems
* How [[evolution]] of human beings from molecular life forms are mimicked by evolutionary computing
* How living organisms defend themselves against diseases and heal their wounds
* How electricity is distributed by grids

Differentiating factors of "lateral computing":

* Does not directly approach the problem through mathematical means.
* Uses indirect models or looks for analogies to solve the problem.
* Radically different from what is in vogue, such as using "photons" for computing in optical computing. This is rare as most conventional computers use electrons to carry signals.
* Sometimes the Lateral Computing techniques are surprisingly simple and deliver high performance solutions to very complex problems.
* Some of the techniques in lateral computing use "unexplained jumps". These jumps may not look logical. The example is the use of "Mutation" operator in genetic algorithms.

===Convention – lateral===
It is very hard to draw a clear boundary between conventional and lateral computing. Over a period of time, some unconventional computing techniques become integral part of mainstream computing. So there will always be an overlap between conventional and lateral computing. It will be tough task classifying a computing technique as a conventional or lateral computing technique as shown in the figure. The boundaries are fuzzy and one may approach with fuzzy sets.

==Formal definition==
Lateral computing is a [[fuzzy set]] of all computing techniques which use unconventional computing approach. Hence Lateral computing includes those techniques which use semi-conventional or hybrid computing. The degree of membership for lateral computing techniques is greater than 0 in the fuzzy set of unconventional computing techniques.

The following brings out some important differentiators for lateral computing.

;Conventional computing:
* The problem and technique are directly [[correlation|correlated]].
* Treats the problem with rigorous mathematical analysis.
* Creates mathematical models.
* The computing technique can be analyzed mathematically.

;Lateral computing:
* The problem may hardly have any relation to the computing technique used
* Approaches problems by analogies such as human information processing model, [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], etc.
* Sometimes the computing technique cannot be mathematically analyzed.

===Lateral computing and parallel computing===
[[Parallel computing]] focuses on improving the performance of the computers/algorithms through the use of several computing elements (such as processing elements).&lt;ref name="Hwang93"&gt;{{cite book|first=K.|last = Hwang|year =1993|title = Advanced Computer Architecture: Parallelism, Scalability, Programmability|publisher = McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York|isbn=0-07-031622-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computing speed is improved by using several computing elements. Parallel computing is an extension of conventional [[sequential computing]]. However, in lateral computing, the problem is solved using unconventional information processing whether using a sequential or parallel computing.

==A review of lateral-computing techniques==
There are several computing techniques which fit the Lateral computing paradigm. Here is a brief description of some of the Lateral Computing techniques:

===Swarm intelligence===
[[Swarm intelligence]] (SI) is the property of a system whereby the collective behaviors of (unsophisticated) agents, interacting locally with their environment, cause coherent functional global patterns to emerge.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}&lt;ref name="Bonabeau99"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvTDhzqMr7cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Swarm Intelligence: From Natural to Artificial Systems|last1=Bonabeau|first1=E.|last2=Dorigo|first2=M.|last3=THERAULUZ|first3=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-19-513158-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SI provides a basis with which it is possible to explore collective (or distributed) problem solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model.

One interesting swarm intelligent technique is the [[Ant colony optimization|Ant Colony algorithm]]:&lt;ref name="Dorigo99"&gt;{{cite book|first1=M.|last1=Dorigo|first2=G.|last2=DI CARO|first3= L. M.|last3 =Gamberella|year=1999|title = Ant Algorithms for Discrete Optimization, Artificial Life|publisher = MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ants are behaviorally unsophisticated; collectively they perform complex tasks. Ants have highly developed sophisticated sign-based communication.
* Ants communicate using pheromones; trails are laid that can be followed by other ants.
* Routing Problem Ants drop different pheromones used to compute the "shortest" path from source to destination(s).

===Agent-based systems===
Agents are encapsulated computer systems that are situated in some environment and are capable of flexible, autonomous action in that environment in order to meet their design objectives.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}&lt;ref name="Bradshaw97"&gt;{{cite book|first=J. M.|last = Bradshaw|year = 1997|title= Software Agents|publisher= AAAI Press/The MIT Press|isbn=0-262-52234-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents are considered to be [[autonomous]] (independent, not-controllable), reactive (responding to events), pro-active (initiating actions of their own volition), and social (communicative). Agents vary in their abilities: they can be static or mobile, or may or may not be intelligent. Each agent may have its own task and/or role. Agents, and multi-agent systems, are used as a [[metaphor]] to model complex distributed processes. Such agents invariably need to interact with one another in order to manage their [[interdependency|inter-dependencies]]. These interactions involve agents cooperating, negotiating and coordinating with one another.

Agent-based systems are computer programs that try to simulate various complex phenomena via virtual "agents" that represent the components of a business system. The behaviors of these agents are programmed with rules that realistically depict how business is conducted. As widely varied individual agents interact in the model, the [[simulation]] shows how their collective behaviors govern the performance of the entire system - for instance, the emergence of a successful product or an optimal schedule. These simulations are powerful strategic tools for "what-if" scenario analysis: as managers change agent characteristics or "rules," the impact of the change can be easily seen in the model output

===Grid computing===
By [[analogy]], a computational grid is a [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] infrastructure that provides dependable, consistent, pervasive, and inexpensive access to high-end computational capabilities.&lt;ref name="Foster99"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ian|last = Foster|year = 1999|chapter= Computational Grids, Chapter 2|title= The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure, Technical Report|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applications of [[grid computing]] are in:
* Chip design, [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] problems, medical instrumentation, and [[supercomputing]].
* Distributed supercomputing applications use grids to aggregate substantial computational resources in order to tackle problems that cannot be solved on a single system.

===Autonomic computing===
{{Main|Autonomic computing}}
The [[autonomic nervous system]] governs our heart rate and body temperature, thus freeing our conscious brain from the burden of dealing with these and many other low-level, yet vital, functions. The essence of [[autonomic computing]] is self-management, the intent of which is to free system administrators from the details of system operation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Murch04"&gt;{{cite book|first=R.|last=Murch|year=2004|title= Autonomic Computing|publisher=Pearson Publishers|isbn=0-13-144025-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four aspects of autonomic computing are:
* Self-configuration
* Self-optimization
* Self-healing
* Self-protection

This is a grand challenge promoted by [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="IBM04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/|title=Autonomic|year = 2004|publisher = IBM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical computing===
[[Optical computing]] is to use photons rather than conventional electrons for computing.&lt;ref name="KarimAwwal92"&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. A.|last1 = Karim|first2 =A. A. S.|last2 = Awwal|year = 1992|title= Optical Computing: An Introduction|publisher = Wiley Publishers|isbn=0-471-52886-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are quite a few instances of optical computers and successful use of them.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The conventional logic gates use [[semiconductor]]s, which use electrons for transporting the signals. In case of optical computers, the photons in a light beam are used to do computation.

There are numerous advantages of using optical devices for computing such as immunity to [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] interference, large bandwidth, etc.

===DNA computing===
[[DNA computing]] uses strands of DNA to encode the instance of the problem and to manipulate them using techniques commonly available in any molecular biology laboratory in order to simulate operations that select the solution of the problem if it exists.

Since the DNA molecule is also a code, but is instead made up of a sequence of four bases that pair up in a predictable manner, many scientists have thought about the possibility of creating a molecular computer.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} These computers rely on the much faster reactions of DNA nucleotides binding with their complements, a [[Brute-force search|brute force]] method that holds enormous potential for creating a new generation of computers that would be 100 billion times faster than today's fastest PC. DNA computing has been heralded as the "first example of true [[nanotechnology]]",{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and even the "start of a new era",{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} which forges an unprecedented link between computer science and life science.

Example applications of DNA computing are in solution for the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] which is a known NP{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} complete one. The number of required lab operations using DNA grows linearly with the number of vertices of the graph.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}&lt;ref name="Pisanti97"&gt;{{cite techreport|first=N.|last=Pisanti|year =1997|title = A Survey of DNA Computing|number= TR-97-07|institution = University of Pisa, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular algorithms have been reported that solves the cryptographic problem in a [[polynomial]] number of steps. As known, factoring large numbers is a relevant problem in many cryptographic applications.

===Quantum computing===
In a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]], the fundamental unit of information (called a quantum bit or [[qubit]]), is not binary but rather more [[quaternary]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Braunstein99"&gt;{{cite book|first=S.|last =Braunstein|year=1999|title= Quantum Computing|publisher= Wiley Publishers|isbn=3-527-40284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.|last =Fortnow|date=July 2003|title= Introduction of Quantum Computing from the computer science perspective and reviewing activities|journal = Special issue on Quantum Information Technology, NEC Res and Dev Journal|volume = 44|issue = 3|pages= 268–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; This qubit property arises as a direct consequence of its adherence to the laws of quantum mechanics, which differ radically from the laws of classical physics. A qubit can exist not only in a state corresponding to the logical state 0 or 1 as in a classical bit, but also in states corresponding to a blend or [[quantum superposition]] of these classical states. In other words, a qubit can exist as a zero, a one, or simultaneously as both 0 and 1, with a numerical coefficient representing the probability for each state. A quantum computer manipulates qubits by executing a series of [[quantum gate]]s, each a unitary transformation acting on a single qubit or pair of qubits. In applying these gates in succession, a quantum computer can perform a complicated unitary transformation to a set of qubits in some initial state.

===Reconfigurable computing===
[[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA) are making it possible to build truly [[reconfigurable computing|reconfigurable computers]].&lt;ref name="Suthikshn96"&gt;{{cite techreport|last=Suthikshn|first=Kumaryear=1996|number = PhD Thesis|title=Reconfigurable Neurocomputers: Rapid Prototyping and Design Synthesis of Artificial Neural Networks for Field Programmable Gate Arrays|institution = University of Melbourne, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer architecture is transformed by on the fly reconfiguration of the FPGA circuitry. The optimal matching between architecture and algorithm improves the performance of the reconfigurable computer. The key feature is hardware performance and software flexibility.

For several applications such as fingerprint matching, DNA sequence comparison, etc., reconfigurable computers have been shown to perform several orders of magnitude better than conventional computers.&lt;ref&gt;Compton and Hauck, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulated annealing===
The [[Simulated annealing]] algorithm is designed by looking at how the pure crystals form from a heated [[gaseous state]] while the system is cooled slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Arts and Krost, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The computing problem is redesigned as a simulated annealing exercise and the solutions are arrived at. The working principle of simulated annealing is borrowed from metallurgy: a piece of metal is heated (the atoms are given thermal agitation), and then the metal is left to cool slowly. The slow and regular cooling of the metal allows the atoms to slide progressively their most stable ("minimal energy") positions. (Rapid cooling would have "frozen" them in whatever position they happened to be at that time.) The resulting structure of the metal is stronger and more stable. By simulating the process of annealing inside a computer program, it is possible to find answers to difficult and very complex problems. Instead of minimizing the energy of a block of metal or maximizing its strength, the program minimizes or maximizes some objective relevant to the problem at hand.

===Soft computing===
One of the main components of "Lateral-computing" is [[soft computing]] which approaches problems with human information processing model.&lt;ref&gt;Proc IEEE, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Soft Computing technique comprises Fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary-computing, machine learning and probabilistic-chaotic computing.

===Neuro computing===
Instead of solving a problem by creating a non-linear equation model of it, the biological neural network analogy is used for solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Masters95"&gt;{{cite book|first = T.|last = Masters|year = 1995|title = Neural, Novel and Hybrid Algorithm for Time Series Prediction|publisher = John Wiley and Sons Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neural network is trained like a human brain to solve a given problem. This approach has become highly successful in solving some of the [[pattern recognition]] problems.

===Evolutionary computing===
The [[genetic algorithm]] (GA) resembles the natural evolution to provide a universal optimization.&lt;ref name="Goldberg00"&gt;{{cite book|first = D. E.|last = Goldberg|year = 2000|title = Genetic Algorithms in search, optimization and Machine Learning|publisher = Addison Wesley Publishers|isbn = 0-201-15767-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic algorithms start with a population of chromosomes which represent the various solutions. The solutions are evaluated using a [[fitness function]] and a selection process determines which solutions are to be used for competition process. These algorithms are highly successful in solving search and optimization problems. The new solutions are created using evolutionary principles such as mutation and crossover.

===Fuzzy logic===
[[Fuzzy logic]] is based on the fuzzy sets concepts proposed by [[Lotfi Zadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of membership concept is central to fuzzy sets. The fuzzy sets differ from crisp sets since they allow an element to belong to a set to a degree (degree of membership). This approach finds good applications for control problems.&lt;ref name="Kosko97"&gt;{{cite book|first=B.|last=Kosko|year=1997|title = Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems: A Dynamical Systems Approach to Machine Intelligence|publisher = Prentice Hall Publishers|isbn=0-13-611435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fuzzy logic has found enormous applications and has already found a big market presence in consumer electronics such as washing machines, microwaves, mobile phones, Televisions, Camcoders etc.

===Probabilistic/chaotic computing===
Probabilistic computing engines, e.g. use of probabilistic graphical model such as [[Bayesian network]]. Such computational techniques are referred to as randomization, yielding probabilistic algorithms. When interpreted as a physical phenomenon through classical statistical thermodynamics, such techniques lead to energy savings that are proportional to the probability p with which each primitive computational step is guaranteed to be correct (or equivalently to the probability of error, (1–p).&lt;ref&gt;Palem, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Chaotic Computing is based on the chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractals===
[[Fractals|Fractal Computing]] are objects displaying [[self-similarity]] at different scales.&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals generation involves small iterative algorithms. The fractals have dimensions greater than their topological dimensions. The length of the fractal is infinite and size of it cannot be measured. It is described by an iterative algorithm unlike a Euclidean shape which is given by a simple formula. There are several types of fractals and [[Mandelbrot set]]s are very popular.

Fractals have found applications in image processing, image compression music generation, computer games etc. Mandelbrot set is a fractal named after its creator. Unlike the other fractals, even though the Mandelbrot set is self-similar at magnified scales, the small scale details are not identical to the whole. I.e., the Mandelbrot set is infinitely complex. But the process of generating it is based on an extremely simple equation. The Mandelbrot set ''M'' is a collection of complex numbers. The numbers ''Z'' which belong to ''M'' are computed by iteratively testing the Mandelbrot equation. ''C'' is a constant. If the equation converges for chosen ''Z'', then ''Z'' belongs to ''M''.
Mandelbrot equation:

===Randomized algorithm===
A [[Randomized algorithms|Randomized algorithm]] makes arbitrary choices during its execution. This allows a savings in execution time at the beginning of a program. The disadvantage of this method is the possibility that an incorrect solution will occur. A well-designed randomized algorithm will have a very high probability of returning a correct answer.&lt;ref&gt;Motwani and Raghavan, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The two categories of randomized algorithms are:
* [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]
* [[Las Vegas algorithm]]

Consider an algorithm to find the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of an array. A deterministic approach would be to choose a pivot element near the median of the list and partition the list around that element. The randomized approach to this problem would be to choose a pivot at random, thus saving time at the beginning of the process. Like approximation algorithms, they can be used to more quickly solve tough NP-complete problems. An advantage over the approximation algorithms, however, is that a randomized algorithm will eventually yield an exact answer if executed enough times

===Machine learning===
Human beings/animals learn new skills, languages/concepts. Similarly, [[machine learning]] algorithms provide capability to generalize from training data.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; There are two classes of Machine Learning (ML):

* Supervised ML
* Unsupervised ML

One of the well known machine learning technique is Back Propagation Algorithm.&lt;ref name="Masters95" /&gt; This mimics how humans learn from examples. The training patterns are repeatedly presented to the network. The error is back propagated and the network weights are adjusted using gradient descent. The network converges through several hundreds of iterative computations.

===Support vector machines&lt;ref&gt;Joachims, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;===
This is another class of highly successful machine learning techniques successfully applied to tasks such as text classification, speaker recognition, image recognition etc.

==Example applications==
There are several successful applications of lateral-computing techniques. Here is a small set of applications that illustrates lateral computing:

* [[Bubble sort]]ing: Here the computing problem of sorting is approached with an analogy of bubbles rising in water. This is by treating the numbers as bubbles and floating them to their natural position.
* Truck backup problem: This is an interesting problem of reversing a truck and parking it at a particular location. The traditional computing techniques have found it difficult to solve this problem. This has been successfully solved by Fuzzy system.&lt;ref name="Kosko97" /&gt;
* Balancing an inverted pendulum: This problem involves balancing and inverted pendulum. This problem has been efficiently solved by neural networks and fuzzy systems.&lt;ref name="Kosko97" /&gt;
* Smart volume control for mobile phones: The volume control in mobile phones depend on the background noise levels, noise classes, hearing profile of the user and other parameters. The measurement on noise level and loudness level involve imprecision and subjective measures. The authors have demonstrated the successful use of fuzzy logic system for volume control in mobile handsets.&lt;ref name="Suthikshn03"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1109/MWC.2004.1308949|last = SUTHIKSHN|first=KUMAR|date=June 2003|title= Smart Volume Tuner for Cellular Phones|journal = IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine|volume= 11|issue= 4|pages= 44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Optimization using [[genetic algorithm]]s and [[simulated annealing]]: The problems such as [[traveling salesman problem]] have been shown to be [[NP complete]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Garey and Johnson, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Such problems are solved using algorithms which benefit by heuristics. Some of the applications are in VLSI routing, partitioning etc. Genetic algorithms and Simulated annealing have been successful in solving such optimization problems.&lt;ref name="Goldberg00" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aarts and Krost, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Programming The Unprogrammable]] (PTU) involving the automatic creation of computer programs for unconventional computing devices such as [[cellular automata]], [[multi-agent system]]s, [[parallel system]]s, [[field-programmable gate array]]s, field-programmable analog arrays, ant colonies, [[swarm intelligence]], distributed systems, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Koza et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{Essay-like|section|an academic essay|date=July 2009}}
Above is a review of lateral-computing techniques. Lateral-computing is based on the lateral-thinking approach and applies unconventional techniques to solve computing problems. While, most of the problems are solved in conventional techniques, there are problems which require lateral-computing. Lateral-computing provides advantage of computational efficiency, low cost of implementation, better solutions when compared to conventional computing for several problems. The lateral-computing successfully tackles a class of problems by exploiting tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost. Lateral-computing techniques which use the human like information processing models have been classified as "Soft Computing" in literature.

Lateral-computing is valuable while solving numerous computing problems whose mathematical models are unavailable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} They provide a way of developing innovative solutions resulting in smart systems with Very High Machine IQ (VHMIQ). This article has traced the transition from lateral-thinking to lateral-computing. Then several lateral-computing techniques have been described followed by their applications. Lateral-computing is for building new generation artificial intelligence based on unconventional processing.

In 2001, Egypt's [[Grand Mufti]] issued a fatwa stating that the show "من سيربح المليون؟" (''Man sa yarbah al malyoon?''&amp;nbsp;– literally "Who will Win the Million?"), modelled on the British show [[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]], was un-Islamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1457145.stm|title='Millionaire' fatwa rejected|date=2001-07-26|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2010-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031106063935/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1457145.stm#|archive-date=2003-11-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheikh of Cairo's [[Al-Azhar University]] later rejected the fatwa, finding that there was no objection to such shows since they spread general knowledge.

==Fatwa regarding theology==
* [[al-Azhar Shia Fatwa]] on July 6, 1959:
:''"The [[Jafari]] [[fiqh]] of the [[Shi'a]] is a school of thought that is religiously correct to follow in worship as are other [[Sunni]] schools of thought."

Many other fatwas have been [[Sunni fatwas on Shias|made by Sunnis]] regarding the Shia.

==The Fatwa against production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons==
{{main|Khamenei's fatwa against nuclear weapons}}
It refers to the [[fatwa]] against the acquisition, development and use of [[nuclear weapons]] by [[supreme leader]] of [[Iran]], [[Ali Khamenei]].&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{cite web|last=L Afrasiabi|first=Kaveh|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HC17Ak02.html|title=An Iran option the US prefers to ignore|date=17 March 2006|work=[[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the fatwa originally dates back to mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="forein policy" /&gt; the first public issue of it is reported to be that of October 2003, which was followed by an official statement at a meeting of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in [[Vienna]], two years later on August 2005.

The fatwa have received criticisms regarding the existence, applicability and  constancy of it.&lt;ref name="Kessler-7-4-15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker Did Iran’s supreme leader issue a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/27/did-irans-supreme-leader-issue-a-fatwa-against-the-development-of-nuclear-weapons/|accessdate=7 April 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=November 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403161326/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/27/did-irans-supreme-leader-issue-a-fatwa-against-the-development-of-nuclear-weapons/#|archive-date=2015-04-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalaji"&gt;{{citation|last=Eisenstadt|first=Michael|last2=Khalaji|first2=Mehdi|5=|url=https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus115.pdf|title=Nuclear Fatwa; Religion and Politics in Iran’s Proliferation Strategy|publisher=[[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]|date=September 2011|access-date=2015-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428003851/http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus115.pdf#|archive-date=2015-04-28|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Khalaji, Khamenei may alter his fatwa under critical circumstances, in a similar manner as [[Khomeini]] did.&lt;ref name="Khalaji"/&gt; While, according to [[Gareth Porter]] in [[Foreign Policy]], Iran has sincerely banned the atomic bombs considering the "historical episode during its eight-year [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iraq]]", when Iran never sought revenge for Iraqis chemical attacks killing 20,000 Iranians and severely injuring 100,000 more.&lt;ref name="forein policy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Gareth|authorlink=Gareth Porter|title=When the Ayatollah Said No to Nukes|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/16/when-the-ayatollah-said-no-to-nukes/|accessdate=21 August 2015|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=16 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921001025/https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/16/when-the-ayatollah-said-no-to-nukes/#|archive-date=2017-09-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the fatwa is considered consistent with Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name="Khalaji"/&gt;

==Fatwa against illegal hunting and wildlife trade==
In March 2014 the [[Indonesian Council of Ulama]] (Indonesia's highest Islamic clerical body) issued a fatwa against illegal hunting and wildlife trafficking. The fatwa instructed Muslims to protect [[endangered species]] by conserving their habitat and stopping illegal trade. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] described the fatwa as a positive step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26452346|title=Muslim clerics ban illegal hunting and wildlife trade|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2014-03-05|access-date=2018-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806044120/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26452346#|archive-date=2017-08-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatwas against terrorism, Al-Qaeda and ISIS==
[[Islam in Spain|Spanish Muslims]] proclaimed a fatwa against [[Osama Bin Laden]] in March 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturekitchen.com/archives/002868.html |title=Text of the Fatwa Declared Against Osama Bin Laden by the Islamic Commission of Spain |accessdate=2006-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727013942/http://www.culturekitchen.com/archives/002868.html |archivedate=2005-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; issued by Mansur Escudero Bedate, Secretary General of the [[Islamic Commission of Spain]]. The ruling says that [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]] and "his" [[al-Qaeda]] had [[apostacy|abandoned their religion]] and should thus be called "al-Qaeda terrorists" without using the [[adjective]] "Islamic". The fatwa urges other Muslims to make similar proclamations. They were followed in July 2005 by the [[Fiqh Council of North America]], a ruling council that issued a fatwa against providing support to "terrorist" groups that make up their own rules by unjustifiably referring to Islam (see [[Istihlal]]).

===Fatwa on terrorism===
The [[Fatwa on Terrorism]] is a 600-page Islamic decree against terrorism and suicide bombings released in March 2010. This fatwa is a direct refutation of the ideology of [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]]. It is one of the most extensive rulings, an "absolute" condemnation of terrorism without "any excuses or pretexts" which goes further than ever and declares [[terrorism]] as [[kufr]] under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Jerome |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html |title=Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists |publisher=The Independent |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912181128/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html# |archive-date=2011-09-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced in [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/03/30/tor-ul-qadri-gta.html |title=Influential Pakistani cleric based in GTA |publisher=CBC News |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402102656/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/03/30/tor-ul-qadri-gta.html# |archive-date=2010-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by an influential Muslim scholar Dr [[Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri]] and was launched in [[London]] on March 2, 2010. Dr Qadri said during the launch "Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses or ifs or buts." According to [[CNN]], experts see the fatwa as a significant blow to terrorist recruiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khalid |first=Kiran |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/terror.fatwa.analysis/index.html |title=Some experts see fatwa as significant blow to terrorist recruiting |publisher=CNN |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108010752/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/terror.fatwa.analysis/index.html# |archive-date=2012-11-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2013 in [[Lahore]], 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings declaring them as Haram or forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1022298 |title=Fatwa issued against suicide bombings, targeted killings and terrorism |date=2 July 2013 |location=Lahore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have also declared that terrorism is not Islamic by issuing fatwas against terrorism and fifteen lakh muslims support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html|title=Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202021756/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html#|archive-date=2015-02-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70000-clerics-issue-fatwa-against-terrorism-15-lakh-Muslims-support-it/articleshow/50100656.cms|title=70,000 clerics issue fatwa against terrorism, 15 lakh Muslims support it|work=The Times of India|accessdate=5 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105231801/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70000-clerics-issue-fatwa-against-terrorism-15-lakh-Muslims-support-it/articleshow/50100656.cms#|archive-date=2018-11-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwa on ISIS membership===
On March 11, 2015, [[Syed Soharwardy]], the founder of the [[Islamic Supreme Council of Canada]], and 37 other Muslim leaders of various Islamic sects from across Canada gathered in [[Calgary]] and issued a fatwa condemning followers of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State (ISIS)]] as non-Muslims. Soharwardy cited capturing opponents and beheading them, killing Muslims who disagree with ISIS's actions, destroying mosques, burning enemy soldiers alive and encouraging Muslim girls to join ISIS, among others, as acts by ISIS that violate Islamic law. Under this fatwa, anybody who even wishes to join the group will be "excommunicated from the Muslim community" and no longer considered Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canadian-imams-issue-fatwa-isil-supporters-calling-them-183339522.html# |title=Canadian Press story about Calgary fatwa |access-date=2015-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143620/https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canadian-imams-issue-fatwa-isil-supporters-calling-them-183339522.html# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/resources/historic-islamic-edict-fatwa-on-joining-isis-isil/# |title=ISCC's announcement of fatwa against ISIS |access-date=2015-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312160925/http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/resources/historic-islamic-edict-fatwa-on-joining-isis-isil/# |archive-date=2015-03-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatwas promoting violence against a particular individual==
Fatwas involving violence are more likely to be well known than other fatwas, especially to non-Muslims. One possible reason is that non-Muslims regard most fatwas as not affecting them, but fatwas involving violence can potentially affect them. Fatwas do not only affect non-Muslims. It is important to note that a Fatwa is meant to be issued by a legal scholar, not by any political entity. Generally, any given case may have many fatwas (legal opinions) written by the scholars of the region and time. The fatwa backed by the State is the one with legal power. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

{{main|Jerry Falwell}}

In an interview given on September 30, 2002, for the October 6 edition of ''[[60 Minutes]]'', American [[Southern Baptist]] [[pastor]] and [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[Jerry Falwell]] said: "I think Muhammad was a terrorist. I read enough by both Muslims and non-Muslims, [to decide] that he was a violent man, a man of war."

The following Friday, [[Mohsen Mojtahed Shabestari]], an Iranian cleric, issued a fatwa calling for Falwell's death, saying Falwell was a "mercenary and must be killed." He added, "The death of that man is a religious duty, but his case should not be tied to the Christian community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2002/10/WeeklyReview2002-10-15#20030930004639-8368231218 Weekly Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009212052/http://harpers.org/archive/2002/10/WeeklyReview2002-10-15#20030930004639-8368231218#20030930004639-8368231218 |date=2011-10-09 }}, Harper's Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salman Rushdie===
{{main|Salman Rushdie}}
{{main|The Satanic Verses controversy}}

One of the first well-known fatwas was proclaimed in 1989 by the [[Iran]]ian [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], against [[Salman Rushdie]] over his novel ''[[The Satanic Verses (novel)|The Satanic Verses]]''. The reason was an allegedly blasphemous statement taken from an early biography of [[Muhammad]], regarding the incorporation of pagan [[goddess]]es into Islam’s strongly monotheistic structure. Khomeini died shortly after issuing the fatwa. In 1998 Iran stated it is no longer pursuing Rushdie’s death; however, that decree was again reversed in early 2005 by the present [[theocrat]], [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]].

In 1991, Rushdie's [[Japanese language|Japanese]] translator, [[Hitoshi Igarashi]], was stabbed to death in [[Tokyo]], and his [[Italian language|Italian]] translator was beaten and stabbed in [[Milan]]. In 1993, Rushdie's [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] publisher [[William Nygaard]] was shot and severely injured in an attack outside his house in [[Oslo]]. Thirty-seven guests died when their hotel in [[Sivas, Turkey]] was torched by locals protesting against [[Aziz Nesin]], Rushdie's [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translator.

In February 2016, in celebration of the anniversary of the fatwa against Rushdie, Iranian state-run median agencies added $300,000 to the estimated $3.3 Million bounty for the death of Rushdie.

===Taslima Nasreen===
{{main|Taslima Nasreen}}

Fundamentalists in [[Bangladesh]] proclaimed a fatwa against [[Taslima Nasreen]] in 1993, against a series of newspaper columns in which she was critical of the treatment of [[women in Islam|women under Islam]]. The next year she wrote ''[[Lajja]]'' (Shame) which described the abuse of women and minorities. Again there were calls for her death, and her passport was confiscated. Within the legal system, she felt that she might have faced a jail term of up to two years, where she was likely to be murdered. She managed to escape the country via [[Calcutta]], was granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in [[Sweden]], and then lived in [[Paris]], and finally went to India. Even in India, she had to flee the city of [[Kolkata]] and move to [[Delhi]] under the Indian government's strict orders following riots in Kolkata.

[[Image:Ole Bull's villa entrance stairs.jpg|thumb|Villa Lysøen entrance stairs]]

'''Lysøen''' is an island in the municipality of [[Os, Hordaland|Os]], [[Hordaland]], [[Norway]]. 
Lysøen is also the site of '''Villa Lysøen''' (''Ole Bulls villa på Lysøen''), the home of Norwegian violin-virtuoso and composer [[Ole Bull]] until his death in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergen-guide.com/55.htm ''Lysoen Island and Ole Bull's Villa'' (Bergen Guide)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Villa Lysøen==
The island was originally the site of a farm established around 1670. The island was bought by Ole Bull in 1872 who constructed the villa. Ole Bull drew the plans for the villa himself, under the supervision of renowned Norwegian architect [[Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe]] (1833–1901).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Conrad_Fredrik_von_der_Lippe  ''Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt; Ole Bull had a large villa built on the island, inspired by numerous architectural styles, including the [[Swiss chalet style]] and [[Moors|Moorish]] architecture. It has a tower formed as an [[onion dome]], common in Russian architecture, and many wooden carvings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Lys%C3%B8en ''Lysøen'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ole Bull transformed his {{convert|175|acre|km2|adj=on}} island property into a fairy-tale kingdom by having romantic paths, ponds and [[gazebo]]s made by planting exotic trees and bushes in the native pine forest. The island has 13&amp;nbsp;km of walkways and paths. His second wife Sara Chapman Thorp (1850–1911) accompanied him to their summer villa on Lysøen.

The highest point on the island, 76 meters above sea level, is the site of a lookout tower which was built in 1903 by Ole Bull's [[United States|American]] descendants. In 1974, Bull's granddaughter Sylvea Bull Curtis of [[Connecticut]] donated the island to the [[Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments]]. Lysøen granted status as a museum in 1984 and has since been open to the public. Guided tours are conducted from early May to August.  The villa serves as a museum in the summer and is used for concerts during the annual [[Bergen International Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortidsminneforeningen-hordaland.no/lysoen.htm ''Museet Lysøen'' (Lysøen i Lysefjorden)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724181026/http://www.fortidsminneforeningen-hordaland.no/lysoen.htm |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jōmon period==

Magatama first appeared in Japan in the [[Jōmon period|Final Jōmon period]], c. 1000 to 300 BCE, and in this period magatama were made from relatively simple, naturally occurring materials, including [[clay]], [[talc]], [[slate]], [[quartz]], [[gneiss]], [[jadeite]], [[nephrite]], and [[serpentinite]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) (日本大百科全書 (ニッポニカ)) | title = Magatama | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-03-26 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lack the uniformity of design found in magatama produced in later periods.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; Magatama from the Jōmon period were irregularly shaped, lacked continuity in form from region to region, and have been called "[[Stone Age]] magatama" for this reason.&lt;ref name="kokushi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama are thought to be an imitation of the teeth of large animals, pierced with a hole, which are found in earlier Jōmon remains.&lt;ref name="dijitaru-magatama"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Dijitaru daijisen| title = Magatama | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-04-01 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resemble magatama, but more recent scholarship indicates that these early Jōmon may have simply had a decorative function, and have no relationship to magatama.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt;  Magatama in the Jōmon period appear to have moved from the purely decorative to having a status and ceremonial function by the end of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Naumann | first = Nelly |authorlink=Nelly Naumann | year = 2000 | title = Japanese prehistory : the material and spiritual culture of the Jōmon period | chapter = From early to middle Jōmon | series = Asien- und Afrika-Studien der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin | volume = 6 | publisher = Harrassowitz | place = Wiesbaden | page = 18 | isbn = 9783447043298 | oclc = 45797690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "middle Jōmon exchange network" may have existed, whereby magatama were produced in regions where materials for their manufacture were readily plentiful. Jade and talc examples produced in bead-making villages located in present-day [[Itoigawa, Niigata]] have been found at a large number of sites in along the northern coast, central mountains, and [[Kantō region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Barnes | first = Gina Lee | year = 1999 | title = The rise of civilization in East Asia: the archaeology of China, Korea and Japan | edition = 1st paperback | publisher = Thames and Hudson | place = New York, N.Y. | page = 30 | isbn = 9780500279748 | oclc = 43664418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological sites (Jōmon)===

*Examples of magatama from the Jōmon period have been discovered in large numbers at the Kamegaoka site in [[Tsugaru, Aomori|Tsugaru]], [[Aomori Prefecture]]. The Kamegaoka remains are among the largest known Jōmon settlement in Japan, and the magatama, among other decorative objects found, may be an indicator of the high social status of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*Other sites associated with the Kamegaoka settlement have yielded magatama, including the Ōboriya [[midden|shell mound]], in the northwest corner of [[Ōfunato Bay]], which yielded a huge number of beads, as well as the Karekawa site, near [[Hachinohe, Aomori|Hachinohe]], [[Aomori Prefecture]].

*Stone and clay magatama and magatama-like [[bead]]s have also been discovered at the Amataki site, [[Ninohe, Iwate|Ninohe]], [[Iwate Prefecture]], Osagata site, [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], and the Kou site, [[Fujiidera, Osaka|Fujiidera]], [[Osaka Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

==Yayoi period==
[[File:Magatama40.JPG|left|thumb|Agate magatama, {{Nihongo|[[Kobe Archaeology Center]]|神戸市埋蔵文化財センター|Kōbeshi Maizō Bunkazai Sentā}}]]

Magatama in the [[Yayoi period]], c.  300 BCE to 300 CE, are notably different from Jōmon-period magatama. The jewels moved from a primitive, non-standard form towards more polished and uniform form in this period.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; The technology to cut large gemstones and polish jewels notably advanced in the Yayoi period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Saitō | first = Tadashi | year = 1958 | title = Genshi (原始) | chapter = Seikatsu yōshiki no hatten (生活様式の発展) | series = Nihon zenshi (日本全史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Tōkyō Daigaku Shuppankai | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 82 | oclc = 35922174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refined materials such as jadeite, serpentinite, and [[glass]] replaced the less sophisticated materials of the Jōmon period.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Yayoi period magatama are noted for their reverse C-shaped form, which by the end of the period became an almost squared shape.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; From the Yayoi period on magatama uniformly feature a bored hole that allowed the jewels to be held on a string.

The Yayoi period is marked by specific centers specializing in magatama and the widespread trade of magatama. The period is marked by the formation of power centers that came to be individual states. The development of weapons increased in this period to protect increasingly developed rice fields and fishing rights. Trade greatly increased in this period, as did the specialization of production of certain items, including magatama. Magatama producing areas exchanged their product with other products, specifically [[rice]], leading to the widespread distribution of magatama across Japan.&lt;ref name="yomiuri-kuni"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | chapter = Kuniguni no matomari (国々のまとまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 110 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magatama were commonly used to create necklaces and bracelets worn on the wrists or ankles. The necklace was typically constructed of jadeite magatama separated by cylindrical bored-holed pieces of jasper. Small beads of dark-blue glass are also not uncommon on the necklace. The bracelet was typically also used shells from the coastal areas of Shikoku and the Inland Sea, wood, and bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | chapter = Kawatte kita shakai seikatsu (変わってきた社会生活) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 99 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period the use of the [[mirror]], [[sword]], and jewels as status symbols for village, and later regional leaders of all kinds, emerged in the Yayoi period, and point to the origin of the mirror, sword, and magatama as the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]].&lt;ref name="yomiuri-1"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 122 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', the earliest historical document with a reference to Japan, describes the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa people]], an ancient country of [[Yamatai]], and its queen, [[Himiko]]. The ''Record'' indicates that when Himiko died her relative Iyo, a girl of thirteen, was made queen and sent a delegation of twenty officials under Yazuku, an imperial general, to offer tribute to the [[Northern Wei]] court. "The delegation visited the capital and [] offered to the court five thousand white gems and two pieces of carved jade, as well as twenty pieces of brocade with variegated designs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tsunoda | first = Ryunosuke| title = Sources of Japanese tradition | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York  | series = Records and civilization, sources and studies | chapter = The earliest records of Japan | pages = 8–16 | year = 1958 | isbn = 0231022549|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carved jade in the ''Record'' likely describes a tribute of two jade magatama.

===Archaeological sites (Yayoi)===
[[File:Tamatsukuri-inari-jinja museum.jpeg|right|thumb|Museum housing artifacts of magatama production, Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine, Osaka]]

*The large-scale Yayoi period remains at the [[Yoshinogari site]], [[Yoshinogari, Saga|Yoshinogari]] and [[Kanzaki, Saga|Kanzaki]] in [[Saga Prefecture]] revealed examples of [[lead glass]] magatama typical of the Yayoi period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kidder | first = J.

*In 2003 the excavation of a large Yayoi period settlement in [[Tawaramoto, Nara]], revealed two large jade magatama, one {{Convert|4.64|cm|in}}, the second {{Convert|3.63|cm|in}} in length. The larger Tawaramoto magatama is the 10th largest found to date in Japan. Both jade magatama from the site are of unusually high-quality brilliant green jade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.47news.jp/CN/200309/CN2003091801000474.html 弥生で最大級のひすい製品　唐古・鍵遺跡出土の勾玉]{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*One known center of Yayoi magatama production was in the area of the [[Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine]] in [[Osaka]]. Tamatsukuri literally means "jewel making" and a [[guild]], the Tamatsukuri-be, was active from the Yayoi period. An existing jewel at the shrine is said to have great spiritual power. Magatama appear on all sorts of implements of the present-day temple, including [[amulet]]s, roof [[tile]]s, and lanterns. The [[Inari Ōkami|inari]] female [[fox]] at the gate of a subshrine of Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine wears a necklace of magatama. The shrine has an exhibit on the history and production of magatama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Smyers | first = Karen Ann | year = 1999 | title = The fox and the jewel: shared and private meanings in contemporary Japanese inari worship | chapter = Introducing Inari | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | place = Honolulu | pages = 23–24 | isbn = 9780824820589 | oclc = 39523475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kofun period==
[[Image:Magatamarm.jpg|thumb|Necklace of jade magatama from a Japanese burial]]
[[Image:Magatamas.JPG|thumb|Magatamas in Kofun period]]

Magatama became very common in the [[Kofun period]], c. CE 250 to CE 538, and by the end of the period almost all [[kofun]] [[tumulus|tumuli]] contained magatama.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; In the early Kofun period magatama were made from jadeite as in earlier periods, but by the middle of the period were made from [[jasper]], and by the end of the period, almost exclusively of [[agate]] and [[jade]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama capped by silver or gold also appear towards the end of the period. Large magatama made of [[talc]], imitations of smaller ones made of more precious materials, were used as [[grave goods]].&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; Magatama are found in [[kofun]] tumuli across Japan from the period. Their use went from merely decorative to sacred and ceremonial grave goods.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yomiuri"&gt;{{Citation | editor = Okada, Akio| year = 1959 | title = Nihon no hajimari (日本のはじまり) | series = Nihon no rekishi (日本の歴史) | volume = 1 | publisher = Yomiuri Shinbunsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | page = 29 | oclc = 33688869|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Nihongo|Chōjigashira magatama|丁字頭勾玉}} are magatama with inscriptions that look like flowers of the [[clove]] tree and have a hole suitable to attach to a string.&lt;ref name="kawade"/&gt; These first appear in the Kofun period.&lt;ref name="kokushi"/&gt; In the Kofun period magatama appear on necklaces, with several magatama set between bored [[cylinder]]s. Archeological remains show evidence of similar ankle bracelets, but they are less common. Clay [[haniwa]] funerary objects of the Kofun period commonly depict people wearing the necklaces and ankle bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Holtom | first = Daniel Clarence | year = 1928 | title = The Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia | chapter = The jewels | publisher = Kyo Bun Kwan | publication-place = Tokyo | page = 33 | oclc = 1983823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological sites (Kofun)===

Examples of stone magatama from the Kofun period are especially numerous.

*An excavation of the Kamegaoka Kofun, [[Kishiwada, Osaka]], revealed a local who had been buried with a jade, jasper, and alabaster magatama necklace, as well as magatama placed near the feet. A bronze mirror imported from China accompanying the burial is dated to 239 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*Ceremonial offerings from a burial from the Kisami-Araida area of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka]], reveal clay reproductions of magatama used as effigies. The excavation of the Ubusuna Kofun&lt;ref name="kyotango"&gt;[http://www.city.kyotango.kyoto.jp/service/digitalmuseum/siteibunkazai/ubusunayamakofun.html 史跡　産土山古墳]{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kyōtango]], Kyoto yielded two fully intact magatama necklaces of jade and agate with segments between 1.7 and 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref name="kyotango"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*The large Muro Miyayama Kofun of [[Katsuragi, Nara]], on the Yamato Plain, 238&amp;nbsp;mm in length, was plundered long before its excavation, but revealed 600 talc ceremonial magatama among other funerary objects, which also included 10 bronze Han Chinese mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*The [[Hiraide remains]] of [[Shiojiri, Nagano]], is one of the three largest prehistoric sites in Japan, and was far from any regional power center. The Hiraide site not only includes typical Kofun period remains, but also objects associated with modern Shinto ceremonial practice. Nevertheless, kofun in Hiraide reveal both plain and elaborate magatama among other funerary objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aikens | first = C.

*The Sakurai Kofun in [[Sakurai, Nara]], excavated in 1949, represents a kofun from the final phase of the Kofun period, and is possibly from a ruler associated with the imperial family. The kofun is {{Convert|25|m|ft}} high and shows evidence of being surrounded by a [[moat]]. Among the very large number of funerary objects were high-quality weapons, including swords, 10 mirrors, and a necklace of jadeite magatama, agate cylinders, and glass beads used to make a magatama-style necklace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Inoue | first = Mitsusada | year = 1965 | title = Shinwa kara rekishi he (神話から歴史へ) | chapter = Nazo no seiki (なぞの世紀)　| edition = Shohan | series = 日本の歴史 (Nihon no rekishi) | volume = 1 | publisher = Chūō Kōronsha | place = Tōkyō | language = Japanese | pages = 309–310 | oclc = 21390677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of magatama forms ==

Archaeologists and historians are unable yet to explain what the origins of magatama forms are, or whether these forms can be traced back to one convergent source. However, these alternative explanations have been provided:&lt;ref&gt;Nishimura, Y. (2018). The Evolution of Curved Beads (Magatama 勾玉/曲玉) in Jōmon Period Japan and the Development of Individual Ownership. Asian Perspectives 57(1), 105-158. University of Hawai'i Press. Retrieved October 18, 2018, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Magatama may be fashioned after animal fangs/teeth
* Magatama may be modeled after the shape of fetuses
* Magatama could symbolize the shape of the soul
* Magatama may be modeled after the shape of the moon
* That there is meaning and connotation attached to the shape of the magatama itself (i.e. meaning comes from the form itself, and not that magatama has been patterned after anything else)

==In Japanese mythology==
[[File:Amaterasu.png|right|thumb|Artist's rendition of Amaterasu emerging from the cave; Amaterasu holds a magatama necklace in her left hand with a sword]]

The [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]], completed in the 8th century, have numerous references to magatama.&lt;ref name="nipponika"/&gt; They appear in the first chapter of the Nihon Shoki, which largely describes the mythology of Japan. [[Susanoo]], god of the sea and storms, received five hundred magatama from [[Tamanoya no mikoto]], or Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto, the jewel-making deity.&lt;ref name="gods"&gt;{{Citation | last = Czaja | first = Michael | year = 1974 | title = Gods of myth and stone: phallicism in Japanese folk religion | chapter = The celestial matsuri | edition = 1st | publisher = Weatherhill | place = New York | page = 228 | isbn = 9780834800953 | oclc = 1085538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanoo went to heaven and presented them to his sister, the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], who bit off successive parts of the magatama, and blew them away to create other deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

In the legend Amaterasu later shuts herself in a cave. [[Ama-no-Koyane-no-mikoto]] hung magatama, among other objects, on a five hundred-branch [[sakaki]] tree, to successfully lure Amaterasu from the cave.&lt;ref name="gods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

Tuttle Co. | place = Rutland, Vt. | page = 40 | isbn = 9780804809849 | oclc = 354027}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 58, in the reign of the [[Emperor Suinin]], the Nihon shoki records that a dog kills and disembowels a ''mujina'', a type of [[badger]], and a magatama was discovered in its stomach. This magatama was presented to Suinin, who enshrined it at Isonokami Shrine, where it is said to presently reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

Chūai made an inspection trip to the Tsukushi, or [[Kyūshū]], and was presented with an enormous sakaki tree hung with magatama as well as other sacred objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Aston | editor-first = W.

===Yasakani no Magatama===

A noted magatama is the {{Nihongo|Yasakani no Magatama|八尺瓊勾玉|extra=also {{lang|ja|八尺瓊曲玉}} and {{lang|ja|八坂瓊曲玉}}}}, one of the three [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-regalia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Japan | title = Imperial regalia | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-04-01 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swords, mirrors, and jewels were common objects of status for regional rulers in Japan as early as the Yayoi period,&lt;ref name="yomiuri-1"/&gt; and were further widespread in the Kofun period, as shown by their ubiquitous presence in kofun tumuli.&lt;ref name="yomiuri"/&gt; The Yasakani no Magatama is stored at the {{Nihongo|Kashiko-dokoro|賢所|}}, the central shrine of the [[Three Palace Sanctuaries]] at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]], and is used in the [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|enthronement ceremony of the Emperor of Japan]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-regalia"/&gt;

[[D. C. Holtom|Daniel Clarence Holtom]] stated in 1928 in ''Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia'' that the Yasakani no Magatama is the only one of the three regalia that exists in its original form;&lt;ref name="holtom-1928"&gt;{{Citation | last = Holtom | first = Daniel Clarence | year = 1928 | title = The Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia | chapter = The jewels | publisher = Kyo Bun Kwan | publication-place = Tokyo | page = 55 | oclc = 1983823}}&lt;/ref&gt; post-[[World War II]] scholarship supports the claim. Replicas of the sword and mirror were made as early as the 9th century, and the originals were entrusted to other shrines.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-imp"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Japan | title = Kurayoshi Plain | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-04-12 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Ryūkyūan religion==

[[D. C. Holtom]] stated that [[noro (priestess)|noro priestesses]] of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] wore magatama necklaces early in the twentieth century for ceremonial purposes, but provides no other details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Holtom | first = Daniel Clarence | year = 1928 | title = The Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia | chapter = The jewels | publisher = Kyo Bun Kwan | publication-place = Tokyo | page = 37 | oclc = 1983823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematics and architecture''' are related, since, [[mathematics and art|as with other arts]], [[architect]]s use [[mathematics]] for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering [[building]]s, architects use [[geometry]]: to define the spatial form of a building; from the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, [[aesthetic]] and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

In &lt;!--[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient China]], Needs section in article before we put this here--&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Architecture of India|India]], and the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]], buildings including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, mosques, palaces and [[mausoleum]]s were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric tiling patterns]] are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a [[fractal]]-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in [[Hindu cosmology]]. In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.

In [[Renaissance architecture]], [[symmetry]] and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], influenced by [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'' from [[Ancient Rome]] and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.
At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Vladimir Shukhov]] in [[Russia]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] in [[Barcelona]] pioneered the use of [[hyperboloid structures]]; in the [[Sagrada Família]], Gaudí also incorporated [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s, tessellations, [[catenary arch]]es, [[catenoid]]s, [[helicoid]]s, and [[ruled surface]]s. In the twentieth century, styles such as [[modern architecture]] and [[Deconstructivism]] explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. [[Minimal surface]]s have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at [[Denver International Airport]], while [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]] pioneered the use of the strong [[thin-shell structure]]s known as [[geodesic dome]]s.

==Connected fields==
[[File:CdM, presunto autoritratto di leon battista alberti, white ground.jpg|thumb|upright|In the [[Renaissance]], an [[architect]] like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was expected to be knowledgeable in many disciplines, including [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]].]]

The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between [[architecture]] and [[mathematics]], note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure [[Number theory|study of number]] and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Ancient Rome, [[Vitruvius]] described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily [[geometry]], to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the [[Middle Ages]], where graduates learnt [[arithmetic]], geometry and [[aesthetics]] alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the [[trivium]]) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the [[Renaissance]], the [[quadrivium]] of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the [[Renaissance man]] such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Similarly in England, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.&lt;ref name=Ostwald1&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: from Antiquity to the 1500s |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00136-4 |pages=chapter 1. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]], identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be [[revolutionary]], introducing wholly new ideas; [[reactionary]], failing to introduce change; or [[revivalist artist|revivalist]], actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian [[Mannerism]] of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century [[Baroque]] and [[Palladian]] movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as [[Futurism]] and [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to [[Modernist]] architecture.

[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The interior of the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], 1758]]

The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and ''symmetria''. Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. ''Symmetria'' in Vitruvius's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at [[Fano]], he uses ratios of small integers, especially the [[triangular number]]s (1, 3, 6, 10,&amp;nbsp;...) to proportion the structure into [[Vitruvian module|(Vitruvian) modules]].{{efn|In Book 4, chapter 3 of ''[[De architectura]]'', he discusses modules directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitruvius |title=VITRUVIUS, BOOK IV, CHAPTER 3 On the Doric order |url=http://www.vitruvius.be/boek4h3.htm|website=Vitruvius.be |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus the Basilica's width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitruvius |title=On Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBLNbOp46CYC&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-193195-1 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dehio 1 Pantheon Floor plan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Pantheon]]

Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his ''[[De architectura]]'', c. 15 B.C.: firmness, usefulness (or "Commodity" in [[Henry Wotton]]'s 16th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsOstwald2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Kim |last2=Ostwald |first2=Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: Antiquity to the 1500s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWKYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |date=9 February 2015 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-319-00137-1 |pages=42, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Pantheon====
{{main article|Pantheon (Rome)}}

The [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] in Rome has survived intact, illustrating classical Roman structure, proportion, and decoration. The main structure is a dome, the apex left open as a circular [[oculus]] to let in light; it is fronted by a short colonnade with a triangular pediment. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, {{convert|43.3|m|ft}}, so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube, and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book | last=Roth | first=Leland M. | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, And Meaning | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder | year=1992 | isbn=0-06-438493-4 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions make more sense when expressed in [[ancient Roman units of measurement]]: The dome spans 150 [[Roman foot|Roman feet]]{{efn|A [[Roman foot]] was about {{convert|0.296|m|ft}}.}}); the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high.&lt;ref name=Claridge&gt;{{cite book | last=Claridge | first=Amanda | title=Rome | series= Oxford Archaeological Guides |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford Oxfordshire | year=1998| isbn=0-19-288003-9 |pages=204–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pantheon remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite book | last=Lancaster | first=Lynne C. | title=Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome: Innovations in Context | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=2005 | isbn=0-521-84202-6 |pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{further information|Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], [[Florence]], 1470. The frieze (with squares) and above is by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].]]

The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti's 1450 ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius's ''De architectura'' and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:{{radic|2}}, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:{{radic|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=March |first1=Lionel |title=Renaissance mathematics and architectural proportion in Alberti's De re aedificatoria |journal=Architectural Research Quarterly |date=1996 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–65 |doi=10.1017/S135913550000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sphere circumscribing a cube |url=http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/solid-mensuration-solid-geometry/013-insciribed-and-circumscribed-sphere-about-cube-volume- |website=Mathalino.com Engineering Math Review |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti also documented [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s discovery of [[linear perspective]], developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The next major text was [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s ''Regole generali d'architettura'' (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books 1 and 2) covered geometry and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Two of Serlio's methods for constructing perspectives were wrong, but this did not stop his work being widely used.&lt;ref name="Andersen2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Kirsti |title=The Geometry of an Art: The History of the Mathematical Theory of Perspective from Alberti to Monge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8B_JeMxNUIkC&amp;pg=PA120 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-48946-9 |pages=117–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villa Pisani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrea Palladio]]'s plan and elevation of the [[Villa Pisani (Bagnolo)|Villa Pisani]]]]
In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] published the influential ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture) in [[Venice]]. This widely printed book was largely responsible for spreading the ideas of the Italian Renaissance throughout Europe, assisted by proponents like the English diplomat Henry Wotton with his 1624 ''The Elements of Architecture''.&lt;ref name=Ruhl&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruhl |first1=Carsten |title=Palladianism: From the Italian Villa to International Architecture |url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-on-the-road/educational-journey-grand-tour/carsten-ruhl-palladianism |publisher=European History Online |accessdate=3 October 2015 |date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Copplestone, Trewin |year=1963 |title=World Architecture |publisher=Hamlyn |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladio permitted a range of ratios in the ''Quattro libri'', stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wassell |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Mathematics Of Palladio's Villas: Workshop '98 |url=http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/Wassell.html |publisher=Nexus Network Journal |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Palladio, Andrea |title=I quattro libri dell'architettura |author2=Tavernor, Robert; Schofield, Richard (trans.) |publisher=MIT Press |year=1997 |origyear=1570 |page=book I, chapter xxi, page 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[fractals]] has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall [[gopuram]] gatehouses of [[Hindu]] temples such as the [[Virupaksha Temple, Hampi|Virupaksha Temple]] at [[Hampi]] built in the seventh century, and others such as the [[Kandariya Mahadev Temple]] at [[Khajuraho]], the parts and the whole have the same character, with [[fractal dimension]] in the range 1.7 to 1.8. The cluster of smaller towers (''shikhara'', lit. 'mountain') about the tallest, central, tower which represents the holy [[Mount Kailash]], abode of Lord [[Shiva]], depicts the endless repetition of universes in [[Hindu cosmology]].&lt;ref name=Rian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite web |title=Fractals in Indian Architecture |url=https://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/Architecture/IndianArch/IndianArch.html |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious studies scholar William J.

The [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] is a large complex with multiple shrines, with the streets of [[Madurai]] laid out concentrically around it according to the shastras.

===Ancient Greece===
{{further information|Greek architecture|golden ratio|Pythagoreanism|Euclidean geometry}}
[[File:The Parthenon Athens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] was designed using [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ratios.]]

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that "all things are numbers". They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word ''symmetria'' originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building's smallest details right up to its entire design.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.

[[File:Parthenon-top-view.svg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]
The [[Parthenon]] is {{convert|69.5|m|ft}} long, {{convert|30.9|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|13.7|m|ft}} high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight&lt;ref name="Maor2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maor|first=Eli|title=The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-year History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12526-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pythagoreans 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This sets the module as 0.858&amp;nbsp;m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ({{convert|21.44|m|ft}} wide by 48.3&amp;nbsp;m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, {{convert|1.905|m|ft}}, and the spacing of their centres, {{convert|4.293|m|ft}}, is also 4:9.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The Parthenon is considered by authors such as [[John Julius Norwich]] "the most perfect Doric temple ever built".&lt;ref name=Norwich/&gt; Its elaborate architectural refinements include "a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns".&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;{{cite book |author=Norwich, John Julius |title=Great Architecture of the World |publisher=Artists House |year=2001 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penrose, Francis |title=Principles of Athenian Architecture |publisher=Society of Dilettanti |year=1973 |origyear=1851 |page=ch. II.3, plate 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: "all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, Gorham P. |title=Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=66 |issue=3 |date=July 1962 |pages=337–338 |doi=10.2307/501468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden ratio was known in 300 B.C., when [[Euclid]] described the method of geometric construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euclid's Elements|Euclid. ''Elements'']]. Book 6, Proposition 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings, as well as sculptures, paintings, and vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Archibald, R.

The [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]], Turkey, was built by [[Mimar Sinan]] to provide a space where the [[mihrab]] could be see from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by 8 enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of {{convert|31.25|m|ft}} diameter and {{convert|43|m|ft}} high.

The buildings include a [[mosque]] in red sandstone on the west, and an almost identical building, the Jawab or 'answer' on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex. The formal [[charbagh]] ('fourfold garden') is in four parts, symbolising the four rivers of paradise, and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum.

The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz. Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon, used repeatedly in the complex, is given sides of 7 units, then it has a width of 17 units,{{efn|A square drawn around the octagon by prolonging alternate sides adds four right angle triangles with hypotenuse of 7 and the other two sides of {{radic|49/2}} or 4.9497..., nearly 5.

[[Antoni Gaudí]] used a wide variety of geometric structures, some being minimal surfaces, in the [[Sagrada Família]], [[Barcelona]], started in 1882 (and not completed as of 2015). These include hyperbolic [[paraboloid]]s and [[hyperboloid|hyperboloids of revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Drawing Together Euclidean and Topological Threads (pdf) | last=Burry | first=M.C., J.R.

This varied mix of geometries is creatively combined in different ways around the church. For example, in the Passion Façade of Sagrada Família, Gaudí assembled stone "branches" in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids, which overlap at their tops (directrices) without, therefore, meeting at a point. In contrast, in the colonnade there are hyperbolic paraboloidal surfaces that smoothly join other structures to form unbounded surfaces. Further, Gaudí exploits [[patterns in nature|natural patterns]], themselves mathematical, with [[column]]s derived from the shapes of [[tree]]s, and [[lintel]]s made from unmodified [[basalt]] naturally cracked (by cooling from molten rock) into [[List of places with columnar jointed volcanics|hexagonal columns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Geometry of Antoni Gaudi |url=http://euler.slu.edu/escher/index.php/The_Geometry_of_Antoni_Gaudi |website=Math &amp; the Art of MC Escher |publisher=Saint Louis University Mathematics and Computer Science |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Usvat |first1=Liliana |title=Antony Gaudi and Mathematics |url=http://www.mathematicsmagazine.com/Articles/AntonyGaudiandMathematics.php#.VhFZ7WtUWHg |publisher=Mathematics Magazine |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burry&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.C.

Several medieval [[Nordic round churches|churches in Scandinavia are circular]], including four on the Danish island of [[Bornholm]]. One of the oldest of these, [[Østerlars Church]] from c. 1160, has a circular nave around a massive circular stone column, pierced with arches and decorated with a fresco. The circular structure has three storeys and was apparently fortified, the top storey having served for defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordenskirker.dk/Tidligere/oesterlars_kirke/oesterlars_kirke.htm |title=Østerlars kirke |publisher=Nordens kirker |language=Danish |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical decoration==

===Islamic architectural decoration===
{{main article|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Islamic buildings are often decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] which typically make use of several mathematical [[tessellations]], formed of ceramic tiles ([[girih]], [[zellige]]) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Symmetries such as stars with six, eight, or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns. Some of these are based on the 'Khatem Sulemani' or Solomon's seal motif, which is an eight-pointed star made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees from the other on the same centre.&lt;ref name=Ronning&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/ronning%20_geometry_and_Islamic_patterns.pdf | title=Islamic Patterns And Symmetry Groups | publisher=University of Exeter | accessdate=18 April 2014 | author=Rønning, Frode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic patterns exploit many of the 17 possible [[wallpaper groups]]; as early as 1944, Edith Müller showed that the Alhambra made use of 11 wallpaper groups in its decorations, while in 1986 [[Branko Grünbaum]] claimed to have found 13 wallpaper groups in the Alhambra, asserting controversially that the remaining 4 groups are not found anywhere in Islamic ornament.&lt;ref name=Ronning/&gt;

===Modern architectural decoration===
{{further information|Ornament (art)|Contemporary architecture}}

Towards the end of the 20th century, novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48/&gt; In 1913, the Modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] had declared that "Ornament is a crime",&lt;ref name=Gibberd&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibberd |first1=Matt |last2=Hill |first2=Albert |title=The Return of Ornamentation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/7279/the-return-of-ornamentation.html |accessdate=12 October 2015 |work=The Telegraph |date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; influencing architectural thinking for the rest of the 20th century. In the 21st century, architects are again starting to explore the use of [[Ornament (art)|ornament]]. 21st century ornamentation is extremely diverse. Henning Larsen's 2011 [[Harpa Concert and Conference Centre]], Reykjavik has what looks like a crystal wall of rock made of large blocks of glass.&lt;ref name=Gibberd/&gt; Foreign Office Architects' 2010 [[Ravensbourne College]], London is tessellated decoratively with 28,000 anodised aluminium tiles in red, white and brown, interlinking circular windows of differing sizes.

==Defence==

===Europe===
{{further information|Star fort}}

The architecture of [[fortification]]s evolved from [[medieval fortification|medieval fortresses]], which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical [[star fort]]s able to resist [[artillery]] bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include [[Michelangelo]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]], [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] and [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Duffy, C. |year=1975 |title=Fire &amp; Stone, The Science of Fortress Warfare 1660–1860 |publisher=Booksales |isbn=978-0-7858-2109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler |first1=David |title=The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough |date=1990 |publisher=Spellmount |isbn=978-0-946771-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural historian [[Siegfried Giedion]] argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance [[Urban planning|ideal city]]: "The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giedion, Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Giedion |title=Space, Time and Architecture |publisher=Harvard University Press |origyear=1941 |date=1962 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===China===
[[File:HakkaYongding.jpg|thumb|A [[tulou]] in [[Yongding County]], [[Fujian province]]]]

In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Neill |first1=Tom |title=China's Remote Fortresses Lose Residents, Gain Tourists |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150102-hakka-china-tulou-fujian-world-heritage-culture-housing/ |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=6 January 2017 |date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental goals==
[[File:Yakhchal of Yazd province.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yakhchal]] in [[Yazd]], Iran]]

Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals.&lt;ref name="SimitchWarke2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simitch |first1=Andrea |last2=Warke |first2=Val |title=The Language of Architecture: 26 Principles Every Architect Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2v-1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191 |year=2014 |publisher=Rockport Publishers |isbn=978-1-62788-048-0 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Foster and Partners]]' [[30 St Mary Axe]], London, known as "[[#Top|The Gherkin]]"&lt;!--links to top (lead image)--&gt; for its [[cucumber]]-like shape, is a [[solid of revolution]] designed using [[Computer aided design|parametric modelling]]. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise whirling air currents at its base. Despite the building's apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are [[quadrilateral]]s, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.&lt;ref name=Freiberger&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freiberger |first1=Marianne |title=Perfect buildings: the maths of modern architecture |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/perfect-buildings-maths-modern-architecture|publisher=Plus magazine|accessdate=5 October 2015|date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[yakhchal]] (ice pit) of [[Iran|Persia]] functioned as an [[evaporative cooler]]. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well. The subterranean space and the thick heat-resistant construction insulated the storage space year round. The internal space was often further cooled with [[windcatcher]]s. The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen dessert [[faloodeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahdavinejad |first=M. |author2=Javanrudi, Kavan |title=Assessment of Ancient Fridges: A Sustainable Method to Storage Ice in Hot-Arid Climates |journal=Asian Culture and History |date=July 2012 |volume=4 |issue=2 |doi=10.5539/ach.v4n2p133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MSCP Generic Poster.PNG|thumb|right|MSCP Poster outlining the various activities of the organisation. [http://www.mscp.org.au/ MSCP Website]]]

The '''Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy''' ('''MSCP''') is an institution dedicated to scholarly, extensive and engaged readings of key figures and texts in the history of modern European thought and contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au MSCP Identity Statement]&lt;/ref&gt; The School was founded in 2003 and formalised its status as an independent, [[not-for-profit]] organisation in 2004. It is based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and is housed by [[The University of Melbourne]].

== Formation and early years ==

In January 2002, Cameron Shingleton, Jon Roffe, Matt Sharpe and David Rathbone ran a summer school with four courses (on Nietzsche, on Deleuze, on Zizek and on Hegel, respectively) in the 1888 Building at the University of Melbourne.  Sharpe had just finished his PhD on Zizek with Marion Tapper and Jon Rundell at Melbourne; Rathbone had returned to Melbourne from studies with Agnes Heller and Reiner Schurmann at the New School for Social Research in New York; Shingleton had completed his honors degree on Nietzsche in the German department; and Roffe his, in French.  All four were of the opinion that the formalities of institutional academia alone were not sufficient to undertaking philosophical and critical thought. They thus formed the MSCP in the spirit of a [[guild]] of philosophers with the intention of preserving and fostering genuine intellectual engagement with continental philosophy. In 2003, they were joined by Sean Ryan, Craig Barrie, and Ashley Woodward, and later, Esther Anatolitis, Felicity Joseph, Jack Reynolds, Kate Noble, Alex Murray, Atliana Safich, Mark Tomlinson, Marc Hiatt, James Garrett, Bryan Cooke, Paul Daniels, Andrea Leon-Martino, and Sherah Bloor, all of whom have all been involved in various ways during the five years 2004-2009, running annual Summer and Winter Schools, as well as several conferences and research days.

== Events and activities ==
===Summer and Winter Schools===

The MSCP runs Summer and Winter Schools at the University of Melbourne during the university vacation breaks. Courses in the Schools consist of five two-hour lectures over a week and do not involve assessment or require any demonstrated prior knowledge of the topic in question. As the MSCP is a not-for-profit organisation, registration costs are minimal.

MSCP courses seek a detailed and scholarly encounter with philosophical thinkers and themes. In particular, the courses attempt to promote constructive ways of engaging with philosophy which are not widely represented in contemporary academic discourse. The courses aim to locate philosophy in the context of its historical and cultural milieu, encouraging lively, academic debate, emphasising the interdisciplinary aspects of philosophy. Classes are informal but strive to be rigorous and faithful to the philosophers and texts being studied.

Past courses have covered philosophers such as [[Hegel]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[Lyotard]], [[Derrida]], [[Deleuze]] and [[Badiou]]. A series of courses has run over several Summer and Winter Schools entitled 'MSCP History of Philosophy Series' which assessed philosophy from the [[pre-Socratics]] to [[modern empiricism]]. Similar courses, treating a theme rather than a particular philosopher or text, have included 'Three Centuries of Aphorism' and 'Democracy, Elites and Violence'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/past.html MSCP past sessions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===

The MSCP has run conferences including:

* 2002 Australasian Society of Continental Philosophy conference at the University of Melbourne (the MSCP hosted this conference in conjunction with the Department of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascp.org.au/conferences.htm ASCP 2002 conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in December 2002
* 'Immanuel Kant Today', commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death of [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/kant_papers.html Immanuel Kant Today conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in February 2004
* 'Sensorium', a conference on philosophy and [[aesthetics]], held in June 2005
* '[[Sartre]] Colloquium' which included a performance of ''[[Huis Clos]]'' (held in conjunction with the Department of French, Italian and Spanish Studies and the Department of Philosophy), held in October 2005
* '200 Years of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/community/events/starters/archive/arts-starters-06-27-07.html "200 Years of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit''"]&lt;/ref&gt; held in July 2007

===Research days===

The MSCP has initiated a series of research days where philosophers in a particular field converge on a specific topic and workshop their papers together. So far, "[[Spinoza]] and the [[Infinity (philosophy)|Infinite]]", convened by Jon Roffe was held in December 2005 and was attended by [[Justin Clemens]], Simon Duffy, Minna Koivuniemi and Jon Roffe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/research/spinoza_infinite.html 'Spinoza and the Infinite' research day]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parrhesia Journal.PNG|thumb|left|''Parrhesia'' An International Journal of Critical Philosophy. [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/ Parrhesia Journal]]]

=== ''Parrhesia'' Journal ===
''[[Parrhesia: A Journal of Critical Philosophy]]'' is an international journal of [[Critical Philosophy]] affiliated with MSCP. It is edited by four MSCP members: Alex Murray, Matthew Sharpe, Jon Roffe and Ashley Woodward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org Parrhesia Journal website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000041083174 National Library of Australia entry for Parrhesia Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2006 and has included articles by [[Alain Badiou]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou1.pdf Badiou, Alain, "A musical variant on the metaphysics of the subject", trans. Justin Clemens, in ''Parrhesia'', 2, 2007, pp. 29 - 36]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou2.pdf Badiou, Alain, "The Event in Deleuze", trans. Jon Roffe, in ''Parrhesia'', 2, 2007, pp. 37 - 44 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacques Rancière]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia01/parrhesia01_ranciere.pdf Rancière, Jacques, "Thinking between disciplines: an aesthetics of knowledge," trans. Jon Roffe, in ''Parrhesia'', 1, 2006, pp. 1 - 12 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The MSCP and the University of Melbourne ==

[[File:Old Arts Building, University of Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Law Quadrangle at the University of Melbourne, home to the School of Philosophy. The MSCP office is located in this building.]]
 
During 2004, the founding Convenor, Jon Roffe, negotiated an informal relationship between the MSCP and the Philosophy Department with Chris Cordner (then Head of the Philosophy Department).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ Link to the MSCP via the School of Philosophy website ]&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the MSCP to undertake its activities using an office in the Department and University of Melbourne resources and teaching spaces. Late 2004, the MSCP invited Dr Marion Tapper of the University of Melbourne Philosophy Department to become a member. This merely formalised her involvement as she had always been supportive of the MSCP both philosophically and on account of knowing all of its members personally from teaching and supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html Marion Tapper, School of Philosophy staff profile]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One way in which the MSCP attempts to transcend its university boundaries is by seeking new ways to teach and engage with philosophy.  In particular, MSCP events strive to be both informal and rigorous. With their courses offering no credit or assessment, students who attend are usually there for the joy of philosophy and seek to further their own intellects outside of a formal classroom setting. Being a not-for-profit organisation, the MSCP charges a minimum for its courses; again, this is aimed at transcending the current economic climate of university funding.

== Membership ==

New members are typically recommended by current members and, largely because the organisation was founded by postgraduate students, they are usually honours year or postgraduate students themselves.

}}
'''Paolo Soleri''' (21 June 1919 – 9 April 2013)&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; was an Italian [[architect]]. He established the educational [[Cosanti]] Foundation and [[Arcosanti]]. Soleri was a lecturer in the College of Architecture at [[Arizona State University]] and a [[National Design Award]] recipient in 2006.  He died at home of natural causes on 9 April 2013 at the age of 93.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri authored six books, including ''The Omega Seed'', "Arcology - City In the Image of Man", and numerous essays and monographs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Early life==
Soleri was born in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], [[Europe]]. He was awarded his "laurea" (master's degree) in [[architecture]] from the [[Politecnico di Torino]] in 1946. He visited the [[United States]] in December 1946 and spent a year and a half in fellowship with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] at [[Taliesin West]] in Arizona, and at [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin. During this time, he gained international recognition for a bridge design that was displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1950, Soleri, with his wife Colly (née Corolyn Woods), returned to [[Italy]] where he was commissioned to build a large ceramics factory, Ceramica Artistica Solimene, in [[Vietri sul Mare|Vietri]] on the Amalfi coast.&lt;ref name="Solimene Ceramics Factory Video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFOXomHEZ-w|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2011|title=Solimene Ceramics Factory Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soleri adapted ceramics industry processes learned at this time to use in his award-winning designs and production of ceramic and bronze windbells and [[silt-cast]] architectural structures. For more than 40 years, proceeds from sales of the wind-bells have been an important source of funds for construction that is meant to test his theoretical work. Ceramic and bronze bells continue to be produced and sold at [[Arcosanti]] and [[Cosanti]] in Arizona.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1956, Soleri settled in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], with Colly and the elder of their two daughters; the younger was born in Arizona. He began building [[Arcosanti]] in 1970 with the help of architecture and design students, as a place to test his urban design hypotheses. This "urban laboratory" (so-dubbed by Ada Louise Huxtable, who at the time was the architectural critic of The NY Times) became internationally renowned.&lt;ref name="karissa"/&gt;

Paolo and Colly Soleri made a lifelong commitment to research and experimentation in [[urban planning]]. They established the Cosanti Foundation, a 501-3C educational non-profit foundation. Soleri's philosophy and works were strongly influenced by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[paleontologist]] and philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri died on 9 April 2013 and was buried at Arcosanti in its private cemetery, beside his wife.&lt;ref name="karissa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Karissa|first=Rosenfield|title=Remembering Paolo Soleri 1919–2013|url=http://www.archdaily.com/357747/remembering-paolo-soleri-1919-2013/ |work=Architecture Daily|publisher=ArchDaily| accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arcosanti==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
The Cosanti Foundation's major project is [[Arcosanti]]. Arcosanti, as originally designed by Soleri, was intended for 5,000 people; it has been in construction since 1970. Located near Cordes Junction, about {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and visible from Interstate I-17 in central [[Arizona]], the intention of the project is to provide a model that can demonstrate Soleri's concept of "[[Arcology]]", [[architecture]] coherent with [[ecology]]. Arcology was envisioned by Soleri as a hyper-dense city, designed to: maximize human interaction with ready access to shared, cost-effective infrastructural services; conserve water and reduce sewage; minimize the use of energy, raw materials and land; reduce waste and [[environmental pollution]]; increase interaction with the surrounding natural environment. In 2010, construction was underway to complete Arcosanti's Greenhouse Apron, but that initiative was put on hold not long after Soleri's death in 2013.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Arcosanti is intended as a prototype of a desert arcology. Soleri's other arcology designs envisioned sites such as the ocean (Nova Noah), ''et al.'' (see: Arcology: City in the Image of Man). Since 1970, over 7000 people have participated in Arcosanti's construction.  Their international affiliation group is called the Arcosanti Alumni Network.&lt;ref&gt;Arcosanti Alumni Network. Retrieved from https://arcosanti.org/node/30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other achievements==
The International Architecture Symposium "Mensch und Raum" (Man and Space) at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] in 1984 received international attention. Paolo Soleri participated with, among others: [[Justus Dahinden]], [[Dennis Sharp]], [[Bruno Zevi]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Otto Kapfinger]], [[Frei Otto]], [[Pierre Vago]], [[Ernst Gisel]], and [[Ionel Schein]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Soleri was a distinguished lecturer in the College of Architecture at [[Arizona State University]] and a member of the [[Lindisfarne Association]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1966, Paolo Soleri began working on the design for the [[Paolo Soleri Amphitheater]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]. It was built for the IAIA (Institute of American Indian Arts) on what is now the campus of the [[Santa Fe Indian School]] using large silt cast forms. The property is owned by the nineteen Native American Pueblos of New Mexico and is therefore not protected by local or state preservation laws.&lt;ref name="krqe-demolish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/paolo-soleri-to-be-demolished-/|date=June 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2011|title=Paolo Soleri to be demolished|publisher=KRQE.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319150840/http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/paolo-soleri-to-be-demolished-/|archivedate=March 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark exhibition, "City in the Image of Man - The Architectural Visions of Paolo Soleri", organized in 1970 by the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]], traveled extensively thereafter in the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]], breaking records for attendance. "Two Suns Arcology, A Concept for Future Cities" opened in 1976 at the [[Xerox Square Center]] in [[Rochester, New York]]. In 1989, "Paolo Soleri Habitats: Ecologic Minutiae", an exhibition of arcologies, space habitats, and bridges, was presented at the New York Academy of Sciences. More recently, "Soleri's Cities, Architecture for the Planet Earth and Beyond" was featured at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts in [[Scottsdale, AZ]]. A Soleri bell appears in the film [[What the *Bleep* Do We Know?]] His work has been exhibited worldwide.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1976, Paolo Soleri was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements, held it Vancouver, [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], [[North America]]. Soleri appeared there together with Buckminster Fuller.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Paolo Soleri Archives, the collection of Soleri's drawings and writings, is located at Arcosanti. The Soleri Archives is managed by Sue Kirsch under the direction of Tomiaki Tamura, a Cosanti Board Trustee and Arcosanti's Director of Special Projects. Tomiaki Tamura resides at Arcosanti.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

An interview with Soleri was featured in the environmental documentary [[The 11th Hour (2007 film)|''The 11th Hour'']] (2007).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

On 10 December 2010, the Soleri Bridge and Plaza was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottsdalepublicart.org/permanent-art/soleri-bridge-and-plaza Soleri Bridge and Plaza. Retrieved from scottsdalepublicart.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The structure had been commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art. The {{convert|130|ft|m|adj=on}} pedestrian bridge based on Paolo Soleri's design is located on the South Bank of the Arizona Canal and connects a developed retail area of the Scottsdale Waterfront with Old Town Scottsdale. The bridge is incorporated into a {{convert|22,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} plaza including silt cast artwork, as well as a large bell assembly called The Goldwater Bell, also designed by Paolo Soleri.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The feature-length documentary film ''[[The Vision Of Paolo Soleri: Prophet In The Desert]]'' (2013) contains interviews with [[Morley Safer]], [[Paul Goldberger]], [[Catherine Hardwicke]], [[Will Bruder]], [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]], [[Steven Holl]], and [[Eric Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name="documentary"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vision of Paolo Soleri: Prophet in the Desert|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250180/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Soleri received fellowships from the [[Graham Foundation]] and from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] (1964, Architecture, Planning, &amp; Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Fellows (S)|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all?index=s&amp;page=23|publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|accessdate=19 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819044304/http://www.gf.org/fellows/all?index=s&amp;page=23|archivedate=19 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Sexual abuse allegation ==
On 13 November 2017, Daniela Soleri—Paolo Soleri's daughter—published an article on the site ''[[Medium (website)|Medium]]'' accusing her father of persistent sexual abuse, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In my early adolescence, my father, an architect and craftsman, began sexually molesting me, eventually attempting rape when I was 17."&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@soleri/sexual-abuse-its-you-him-and-his-work-88ecb8e99648|title=Sexual abuse: It's you, him, and his work|last=Soleri|first=Daniela|date=2017-11-14|website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Encouraged to publish the article by the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], Daniela wrote that she had already come forward to many of her father's colleagues but received little response:

{{Quote|I finally told some of Soleri's inner circle about my experiences about 24 years ago, others learned of them six years ago when I tendered my letter of resignation from the board of Soleri's Cosanti Foundation, with an explanation of why. In response to receiving my letter, one of my father's long time colleagues and board member wrote "I am disappointed in everyone." A strange reaction from a man I had known since I was seven. Two years later he presided at a memorial seminar eulogizing Soleri and his work. His message seemed to be that, yes, he's disappointed that those things occurred, but he's equally disappointed that they are being brought up, instead of silenced.&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt;}}

In the article, Daniela wrote about her lingering admiration for some of Soleri's work and ideas. However, she also warned against uncritical praise of artists with abusive tendencies and the tendency to "accept abusive behavior as a necessary and justified cost for the contributions of intellect or creativity".&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt; Of her father, Daniela wrote:

{{Quote|Soleri has been dead for nearly five years. The swell of hagiographic films, essays and performances has slowed, hopefully making room for a more useful perspective that includes not only consideration of his work, but also honest acknowledgment that he was flawed. That work will have to stand on its own, and not be seen as an inseparable part of Soleri as a person, including his best and worst behaviors.&lt;ref name="Daniela Medium" /&gt;}}

As noted in ''[[Dezeen]]'', Daniela's article suggested that she had approached ''[[The New York Times]]'' or other news publishers to discuss her father's abuse, but had been turned away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/18/paolo-soleri-sexual-abuse-daughter-daniela-soleri/|title=Paolo Soleri accused of sexual abuse by daughter|last=Gibson|first=Eleanor|date=2017-12-18|website=[[Dezeen]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cosanti Foundation Board released an official statement in response to Daniela Soleri's:

{{Quote|We are saddened by Daniela Soleri's trauma. Her decision to speak out about her father's behavior towards her helps us confront Paolo Soleri's flaws, and compels us to reconsider his legacy. With Paolo Soleri's creative intelligence, he understood the need for discipline and limits to the urban form. However, his narcissism prevented him from understanding the need for discipline and limits on abusive behavior. We support and stand firmly with Daniela.

We know that Arcosanti and Cosanti are much greater than the ideas of one man. Over the past fifty years, more than 8,000 participants from all over the world have contributed to Arcosanti and Cosanti through our workshops and programs. Our work in urban planning will continue. It was considered radical fifty years ago and has proven itself relevant today. Our goal is a built environment inspired by Soleri's architecture that fosters community, integrates the natural world, and nurtures the best of human nature.&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/12/15/16781940/paolo-soleri-abuse-daughter-arcosanti|title=Architect Paolo Soleri's daughter Daniela recounts childhood abuse in open letter|last=Keith|first=Kelsey|date=2017-12-15|website=[[Curbed]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[Curbed]]'' editor-in-chief Kelsey Keith wrote "[Daniela] Soleri's account is breathtaking not only for its thorough and very personal reckoning with the truth, but for its clear-eyed articulation of the reasons why assigning all intellectual power to a solitary genius is so harmful."&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed" /&gt; Keith noted that architecture as a profession "hasn't (yet) experienced its Weinstein moment", referring to the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]] and the resulting "[[Weinstein effect]]" of reporting sexual misconduct committed by powerful men in media and other industries.&lt;ref name="Keith Curbed" /&gt; In a 2018 ''Curbed'' article, Hilary George-Parkin said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"While Hollywood, tech, sports, media, politics, the restaurant industry, and others are reeling from high-profile revelations and resignations, the design world has remained—with the notable exception of Daniela Soleri's account of sexual abuse by her father, architect Paolo Soleri—mostly undisturbed in the public realm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/2/28/17058496/architecture-sexual-harassment-me-too-policies-gender|title=How top architecture firms measure up in the #MeToo era|last=Hilary|first=George-Parkin|date=2018-02-28|website=[[Curbed]]|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32982">{{planes of existence}} 
In [[esoteric cosmology]], a '''plane''' is conceived as a subtle state, level, or region of reality, each plane corresponding to some type, kind, or category of [[being]].

The concept may be found in [[religious]] and [[esotericism|esoteric]] teachings—''e.g.'' [[Vedanta]] ([[Advaita Vedanta]]), [[Ayyavazhi]], [[shamanism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Kashmir Shaivism]], [[Sant Mat]]/[[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Druze]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], [[Rosicrucianism]] ([[Esoteric Christianity|Esoteric Christian]]), [[Eckankar]], [[Ascended Master Teachings]], etc.—which propound the idea of a whole series of subtle planes or worlds or dimensions which, from a center, interpenetrate themselves and the physical [[planet]] in which we live, the [[planetary system|solar systems]], and all the physical structures of the universe. This interpenetration of planes culminates in the universe itself as a physical structured, dynamic and evolutive expression emanated through a series of steadily denser stages, becoming progressively more material and embodied.

The [[emanationism|emanation]] is conceived, according to esoteric teachings, to have originated, at the dawn of the universe's manifestation, in ''[[Great Architect of the Universe|The Supreme Being]]'' who sent out—from the unmanifested ''[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]'' beyond comprehension—the dynamic force of creative energy, as ''sound-vibration'' ("the Word"), into the abyss of space. Alternatively, it states that this dynamic force is being sent forth, through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe.

==Origins of the concept==
The concept of planes of existence might be seen as deriving from shamanic and traditional mythological ideas of a vertical world-axis&amp;mdash;for example a cosmic [[mountain]], [[tree]], or pole (such as [[Yggdrasil]] or [[Mount Meru]])&amp;mdash;or a philosophical conception of a [[Great Chain of Being]], arranged metaphorically from [[God]] down to inanimate matter.

However the original source of the word ''plane'' in this context is the late [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] [[Proclus]], who refers to ''to platos'', "breadth", which was the equivalent of the 19th-century theosophical use. An example is the phrase ''en to psychiko platei''.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, cited in Poortman, 1978, vol II, p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions in ancient traditions==
Directly equivalent concepts in Indian thought are [[loka]]s and bhuvanas. In [[Hindu]] cosmology, there are many lokas or worlds, that are identified with both traditional cosmology and states of [[meditation]].

Planes of existence may have been referred to by the use of the term corresponding to the word "egg" in English. For example, the Sanskrit term [[Brahmanda]] translates to "The entire creation" as opposed to the lazy inference "The Egg of Creation". Certain Puranic accounts posit that the Brahmanda is the superset of a set of fractal smaller Eggs, as is seen in the assertion of the equivalence of the Brahmanda and the [[Pinda (riceball)|Pinda]].&lt;ref&gt;Kak, Subhash: ''The Architecture of Knowledge''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Norse mythology gave the name "[[Ginnungagap]]" to the primordial "Chaos," which was bounded upon the northern side by the cold and foggy "[[Niflheim]]"—the land of mist and fog—and upon the south side by the fire "[[Muspelheim]]." When heat and cold entered into space which was occupied by Chaos or Ginnungagap, they caused the crystallization of the visible universe.

In the medieval West and Middle East, one finds reference to four worlds (''olam'') in [[Kabbalah]], or five in [[Sufism]] (where they are also called ''[[tanazzulat]]''; "descents"), and also in [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic Kabbalah]]. In Kabbalah, each of the four or five worlds are themselves divided into ten [[Sephirah|sefirot]], or else divided in other ways.

==Esoteric conceptions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Charles Leadbeater Planes.jpg|thumb|300px|right| The planes according to [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]].]] --&gt;
The [[alchemy|alchemists]] of the [[Middle Ages]] proposed ideas about the constitution of the universe through a [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] language full of esoteric words, phrases, and signs designed to cloak their meaning from those not initiated into the ways of alchemy. In his "Physica" (1633), the Rosicrucian alchemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], wrote: "Ad huc spiritum incognitum Gas voco" q.e., "This hitherto unknown Spirit I call Gas." Further on in the same work he says, "This vapor which I have called Gas is not far removed from the [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] the ancients spoke of." Later on, similar ideas would evolve around the idea of aether.

In the late 19th century, the metaphysical term "planes" was popularised by the theosophy of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], who in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' and other writings propounded a complex cosmology consisting of seven planes and subplanes, based on a synthesis of Eastern and Western ideas. From theosophy the term made its way to later esoteric systems such as that of [[Alice Bailey]], who was very influential in shaping the worldview of the [[New Age]] movement. The term is also found in some Eastern teachings that have some Western influence, such as the cosmology of [[Sri Aurobindo]] and some of the later [[Sant Mat]], and also in some descriptions of Buddhist cosmology. The teachings of [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] also include several planes of the creation within both the [[macrocosm and microcosm]], including the Bramanda egg contained within the Sach Khand egg. [[Max Theon]] used the word "States" (French ''Etat'') rather than "Planes", in his [[cosmic philosophy]], but the meaning is the same.

The planes in Theosophy were further systematized in the writings of [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]].

In the early 20th century, [[Max Heindel]] presented in ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' a cosmology related to the scheme of evolution in general and the evolution of the [[solar system]] and the [[Earth]] in particular, according to the Rosicrucians. He establishes, through the conceptions presented, a bridge between modern [[science]] (currently starting research into the subtler [[Etheric plane|''etheric'']] plane of existence behind the physical) and [[religion]], in order that this last one may be able to address man's ''[[spirituality|inner]]'' questions raised by scientific advancement.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] proposed that there are six planes of consciousness that must be experienced before one can attain [[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]] on the seventh plane: "Each definite stage of advancement represents a state of consciousness, and advancement from one state of consciousness to another proceeds side by side with crossing the inner planes. Thus six intermediate planes and states of consciousness have to be experienced before reaching the seventh plane which is the end of the journey and where there is final realisation of the God-state."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967).

==Emanation vs. Big Bang==

However, in [[esoteric cosmology]] expansion refers to the [[emanation]] or unfolding of steadily denser planes or spheres from the spiritual summit, what Greek philosophy called ''[[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]]'', until the lowest and most material world is reached.
	 
According to [[Rosicrucian]]s, another difference is that there is no such thing as empty or void space. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The space is Spirit in its attenuated form; while matter is crystallized space or Spirit. Spirit in manifestation is dual, that which we see as Form is the negative manifestation of Spirit--crystallized and inert. The positive pole of Spirit manifests as Life, galvanizing the negative Form into action, but both Life and Form originated in Spirit, Space, Chaos! On the other hand, Chaos is not a state which has existed in the past and has now entirely disappeared. It is all around us at the present moment. Were it not that old forms--having outlived their usefulness--are constantly being resolved back into that Chaos, which is also as constantly giving birth to new forms, there could be no progress; the work of evolution would cease and stagnation would prevent the possibility of advancement."&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' (Chapter XI: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng11.htm The Genesis and Evolution of our Solar System]), 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The planes==
In occult teachings and as held by psychics and other esoteric authors there are seven planes of existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetadnaactivation.com/medical2.html Seven Planes of Existence - Theta Medical Intuition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most occult and esoteric teachings are in agreement that seven planes of existence exist; however, many different occult and metaphysical schools label the planes of existence with different terminology.

===Physical plane===
The '''physical plane''' or '''physical universe''', in [[emanation]]ist metaphysics taught in [[Neoplatonism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], refers to the visible [[reality]] of [[space]] and [[time]], [[energy]] and [[matter]]: the physical universe in [[Occultism]] and [[esoteric cosmology]] is the lowest or [[density|densest]] of a series of planes of existence.

According to Theosophists, after the physical plane is the '''etheric plane''' and both of these planes are connected to make up the first plane.&lt;ref&gt;John Friedlander, Gloria Hemsher ''Psychic Psychology: Energy Skills for Life and Relationships'' 2011, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy also teaches that when the [[physical body]] dies the [[etheric body]] is left behind and the [[soul]] forms into an [[astral body]] on the astral plane.&lt;ref&gt;Norman C. McClelland ''Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma'' 2010, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researcher [[F. W. H. Myers]] proposed the existence of a “[[metetherial world]]”, which he wrote to be a world of images lying beyond the physical world. He wrote that apparitions have a real existence in the metetherial world which he described as a dream-like world.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, F. H. W. (1903). Human personality and its survival of death. London: Longmans.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astral plane===
[[File:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The astral spheres were thought to be planes of angelic existence intermediate between Earth and [[heaven]]'']]
The '''[[astral plane]]''', also known as the '''emotional plane''' is where consciousness goes after physical death. According to [[occult]] philosophy man possesses an [[astral body]]. The astral plane (also known as the astral world) was postulated by classical (particularly [[neo-Platonic|neoplatonic]]), medieval, oriental, and [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies and [[mystery cult|mystery religions]].&lt;ref name="G.R.S.Mead, 1919"&gt;G.R.S.Mead, ''The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition'', Watkins 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world of the [[celestial spheres|planetary spheres]], crossed by the soul in its [[astral body]] on the way to being born and [[afterlife|after death]], and generally said to be populated by [[angel]]s, spirits, or other immaterial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', trans. Desmond Lee, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th and early 20th century the term was popularised by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and neo-[[Rosicrucianism]].

Throughout the [[Renaissance]], philosophers, [[Paracelsus|Paracelsians]], [[Rosicrucians]] and alchemists continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between Earth and the divine. The ''[[Barzakh]]'', ''olam mithal'' or intermediate world in [[Islam]] and the "World of ''[[Yetzirah]]''" in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] are related concepts.

According to occult teachings the astral plane can be visited consciously through [[astral projection]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]], [[near death experience|near-death experience]], [[lucid dreaming]], or other means.  Individuals that are trained in the use of the astral vehicle can separate their consciousness in the astral vehicle from the physical body at will.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Brennan, ''Astral Doorways'', Thoth Publications 1996 {{ISBN|978-1-870450-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theosophist]] author [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]] wrote: "When a person dies, they become fully conscious in the astral body. After a certain time, the astral body disintegrates, and the person then becomes conscious on the mental plane." &lt;ref&gt;First Principles of Theosophy, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

Occultist [[George Arundale]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the astral world exist temporarily all those physical entities, men and animals, for whom sleep involves a separation of the physical body for a time from the higher bodies. While we "sleep", we live in our astral bodies, either fully conscious and active, or partly conscious and semi-dormant, as the case may be, according to our evolutionary growth; when we "wake", the physical and the higher bodies are interlocked again, and we cease to be inhabitants of the astral world.” &lt;ref&gt;Curuppumullagē Jinarājadāsa ''First Principles of Theosophy'' Theosophical Publishing House, 1922, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some writers have claimed the astral plane can be reached by [[dream]]ing. [[Sylvan Muldoon]] and psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] in their book ''The Projection of the Astral Body'' (1929) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"When you are dreaming you are not really in the same world as when you are conscious – in the physical – although the two worlds merge into one another. While dreaming, you really are in the astral plane, and usually your astral body is in the zone of quietude."&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan J. Muldoon and Hereward Carrington ''Projection of the Astral Body'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Astral projection]] author Robert Bruce describes the astral as seven planes that take the form of planar surfaces when approached from a distance, separated by immense coloured "buffer zones".  These planes are endlessly repeating ruled [[Cartesian coordinate system]] grids, tiled with a single signature pattern that is different for each plane. Higher planes have bright, colourful patterns, whereas lower planes appear far duller. Every detail of these patterns acts as a consistent portal to a different kingdom inside the plane, which itself comprises many separate realms. Bruce notes that the astral may also be entered by means of long tubes that bear visual similarity to these planes, and conjectures that the grids and tubes are in fact the same structures approached from a different perceptual angle.

In his book ''[[wikisource:Autobiography of a Yogi|Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', [[Paramhansa Yogananda]] provides details about the astral planes learned from his resurrected guru [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]].&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN6fdZR6rXkC&amp;pg=PA400&amp;lpg=PA400|title=Autobiography of a Yogi (Google books)|author=Paramhansa Yogananda|year=1946|work=|publisher=The Philosophical Library, Inc|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda reveals that nearly all individuals enter the astral planes after death. There they work out the seeds of past [[karma (Hinduism)|karma]] through astral incarnations, or (if their karma requires) they return to earthly incarnations for further refinement. Once an individual has attained the meditative state of [[nirvikalpa|nirvikalpa samadhi]] in an earthy or astral incarnation, the soul may progress upward to the "illumined astral planet" of Hiranyaloka.&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"/&gt; After this transitional stage, the soul may then move upward to the more subtle causal spheres where many incarnations allow them to further refine until [[Satcitananda|final unification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reluctant-messenger.com/yogananda/chapter_43.htm|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|author=Paramhansa Yogananda|year=1946|work=|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental plane===
The '''mental plane''', also known as the '''causal plane''' is the third lowest plane according to Theosophy. The mental plane is divided into seven sub-planes.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the mental world one formulates a thought and it is instantly transmitted to the mind of another without any expression in the form of words. Therefore on that plane language does not matter in the least; but helpers working in the astral world, who have not yet the power to use the mental vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater, The Inner Life, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Annie Besant]] wrote that "The mental plane, as its name implies, is that which belongs to consciousness working as thought; not of the mind as it works through the brain, but as it works through its own world, unencumbered with physical spirit-matter.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant ''The Ancient Wisdom: An Outline of Theosophical Teachings'' 1939, Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of the mental plane, along with the mental body, is provided by [[Arthur E. Powell]], who has compiled information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

According to [[Hindu]] occultism the mental plane consists of two divisions, the lower division is known as heaven (''swarglok'') and the upper division is known as the causal plane (''maharlok'').&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar, Jytte Larsen ''The Kundalini book of living and dying: gateways to a higher consciousness'' 2004, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] wrote:

:''"The causal plane is the world of light and blessedness, the highest of heavenly regions, extolled in the scriptures of all faiths. It is the foundation of existence, the source of visions, the point of conception, the apex of creation. The causal plane is the abode of Lord Siva and His entourage of Mahadevas and other highly evolved souls who exist in their own self-effulgent form--radiant bodies of centillions of quantum light particles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], ''Dancing With Siva : Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism'', 1996, xxxv, 1008 p., ill., Sixth Edition, First Printing, 2003 Himalayan Academy [http://himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/dws/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;''

[[Sri Aurobindo]] developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and [[Max Théon]] ideas (which he received via [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], who was Theon's student in occultism for two years).  In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]], [[Vital (Sri Aurobindo)|Vital]], and [[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (''[[The Life Divine|Life Divine]]'' bk.1 ch.27)  The Aurobindonian Mind or Mental Plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the [[Overmind (Sri Aurobindo)|overmental]] divine region (''[[Letters on Yoga]]'', Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of sheer mind or thought.

===Buddhic plane (also known as unity plane)===
The ''buddhic plane'' is described as a realm of pure [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua David Stone, Janna Shelley ''A Beginner's Guide to the Path of Ascension'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophy the buddhic plane exists to develop buddhic consciousness which means to become unselfish and solve any problems with the ego.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater ''Inner Life'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Leadbeater]] wrote that in the buddhic plane man casts off the delusion of the self and enters a realization of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater ''The Masters and the Path'' 2007, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annie Besant]] defined the buddhic plane as

&lt;blockquote&gt;Persistent, conscious, spiritual awareness. This is the full consciousness of the buddhic or intuitional level. This is the perceptive consciousness which is the outstanding characteristic of the Hierarchy. The life focus of the man shifts to the buddhic plane. This is the fourth or middle state of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bailey ''The Rays and the Initiations'' 1971, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sri Aurobindo]] calls the level above the mental plane the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|supermind]].&lt;ref&gt;Madis Senner ''The Way Home: Making Heaven on Earth'' 2009, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual plane===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}
[[George Winslow Plummer]] wrote that the ''spiritual plane'' is split into many sub-planes and that on these planes live spiritual beings who are more advanced in development and status than ordinary man.&lt;ref&gt;George Winslow Plummer ''Mercury: An Official Organ of the Societas Rosicruciana in America 1916-1921'' Kessinger reprint edition, 1998, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] teachings the goal of the spiritual plane is to gain spiritual knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond T. Kranyak ''Metaphysical Secrets for Health and Success in Life'' 2009, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine plane===
According to some occult teachings, all [[souls]] are born on the ''divine plane'' and then descend down through the lower planes; however souls will work their way back to the divine plane.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Poinsot ''Complete Book of the Occult and Fortune Telling'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of occult sciences'', R. M. McBride and company, 1939, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; On the divine plane souls can be opened to conscious communication with the sphere of the divine known as the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] and receive knowledge about the nature of reality.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamlin Dewey ''New Testament of Occultism'' Kessinger reprint edition, 2003, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosicrucianism]] teaches that the divine plane is where [[Jesus]] dwelt in [[Christ consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;The Rosicrucian Digest September 1932, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logoic plane (also known as monadic plane)===
The ''logoic plane'' is the highest plane, it has been described as a plane of total oneness, the "I AM Presence". [[Joshua David Stone]] describes the plane as complete unity with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua David Stone, Janna Shelley Parker ''A Beginner's Guide to the Path of Ascension'' 1998, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''monadic plane (hyperplane)'' or continuum/universe, enclosing and interpenetrating grosser hyperplanes, respectively is the plane in which the monad or holy spirit or oversoul is said to exist.

==31 planes==
{{main|Buddhist cosmology}}
In Buddhism, the world is made up of 31 planes of existence that one can be reborn into, separated into 3 realms.

==The Summerland==
{{main|The Summerland}}
The Summerland is the name given by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]], [[Spiritualists]], [[Wicca]]ns, and some earth-based [[paganism (contemporary)|contemporary pagan]] religions to their conceptualization of existence on a plane in an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativespirit.net/spiritworld/ The Spirit World Descriptions by Early Spiritualists by Barbara N. Starr]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) inspired [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] (1826–1910), in his major work ''The Great Harmonia'' to say that Summerland is the pinnacle of spiritual achievement in the afterlife; that is, it is the highest level, or ''sphere'', of the afterlife we can hope to enter. The common portrayal of the Summerland is as a place of rest for souls after or between their earthly incarnations. Some believe [[spirits]] will stay in the Summerland for an eternal afterlife, though others believe after an amount of time some spirits will [[reincarnate]]. The Summerland is also envisioned as a place for recollection and reunion with deceased loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fst.org/sptwld1.htm Life in the Spirit World: Part One General Introduction By Rev. Simeon Stefanidakis]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name suggests, it is often imagined as a place of beauty and peace, where everything people hold close to their hearts is preserved in its fullest beauty for eternity. It is envisioned as containing wide (possibly eternal) fields  of rolling green hills and lush grass. In many ways, this ideology is similar to the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] view of [[Annwn]] as an afterlife realm. The Summerland is also viewed as the place where one goes in the afterlife in traditions of [[Spiritualism]] and Theosophy, which is where Wicca got the term.

In Theosophy, the term "Summerland" is used without the definite article "the". Summerland, also called the Astral plane Heaven, is depicted as where [[soul]]s who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. Those who have been bad go to [[Hell]], which is believed to be located below the surface of the Earth and is on the astral plane and is composed of the densest astral matter; the Spiritual Hierarchy functioning within Earth functions on the etheric plane below the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W ''A Textbook of Theosophy'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Theosophists that most people (those at high levels of initiation) go to a specific Summerland that is set up for people of each religion. For example, [[Christians]] go to a Christian heaven, [[Jews]] go to a Jewish heaven, [[Muslims]] go to a Muslim heaven, [[Hindus]] goes to a Hindu heaven, Theosophists go to a Theosophical heaven, and so forth, each heaven being like that described in the [[scripture]]s of that religion. There is also a generic Summerland for those who were [[atheist]]s or [[agnostic]]s in their previous lives. People who belong to religions that don't believe in [[reincarnation]] are surprised to find out when they get to heaven that they will have to reincarnate again within a few dozen to a few hundred years. Each heaven is believed to be an extensive structure composed of astral matter located on the astral plane about three or four miles (5–6&amp;nbsp;km) above the surface of Earth, above that part of the world where the particular religion that the heaven is meant for is most predominant.

Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called [[Devachan]], also called the Mental plane Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations—only those souls that are more highly developed [[spirituality|spiritually]] reach this level, those souls that are at the first, second, and third levels of initiation. Devachan is several miles (around 10&amp;nbsp;km) higher above the surface of Earth than Summerland.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The final permanent eternal afterlife heaven to which Theosophists believe most people will go millions or billions of years in the future, after our cycle of reincarnations in this Round is over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ez2.net/nick29/theosophy/lessons06.htm Various Levels of the Afterlife in Theosophy:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722101232/http://users.ez2.net/nick29/theosophy/lessons06.htm |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to go to Nirvana, it is necessary to have attained the fourth level of initiation or higher, meaning one is an ''[[arhat]]'' and thus no longer needs to reincarnate.

==Inhabitants of the various planes==
Occult writers such as [[Geoffrey Hodson]], Mellie Uyldert, and [[Dora van Gelder]] had attempted to classify different spiritual beings into a hierarchy based on their assumed place and function on the planes of existence.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] fundamentally described and incorporated his comprehension of intangible beings for Theosophy. Along with him there are various planes intertwined with the quotidian human world and are all inhabited by multitudes of entities. Each plane is purported as composed of discrete density of ''[[etheric plane|astral or ethereal matter]]'' and frequently the denizens of a plane have no discernment of other ones. Other Theosophical writers such as [[Alice Bailey]], a contemporary of Leadbeater, also gave continuousness to Theosophical concepts of ethereal beings and her works had a great impact over [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Laderman, Luis D. León; ''Religion and American cultures: an encyclopedia of traditions, diversity, and popular expressions'' - Volume 3, 2003; p. 236. {{ISBN|1-57607-238-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael York, ''The emerging network: a sociology of the New Age and neo-pagan movements'', 1995; p. 66. {{ISBN|0-8476-8001-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She puts the nature spirits and devas as ethereal beings immersed in macro divisions of an interwoven threefold universe, usually they belong to the etheric, astral, or mental planes. The ethereal entities of the four kingdoms, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, are forces of nature.

The Dutch writer [[Mellie Uyldert]], self-proclaimed clairvoyant, characterized the semblance and behavior of ethereal entities on the etheric plane, which, she said, hover above plants and transfer energy for vitalizing the plant, then nourishing themselves on rays of sunlight. She depicted them as asexual gender, and composed of [[etheric body|''etheric'' matter]].
They fly three meters over the ground, some have wings like butterflies while others only have a small face and an [[aura (paranormal)|aura]] waving graciously. Some are huge while others may have the size of one inch.&lt;ref&gt;Mellie Uyldert ''The psychic garden: Plants and their esoteric relationship with man'' Thorsons, 1980 {{ISBN|0-7225-0548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">In [[computer programming]], a '''postcondition''' is a condition or [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] that must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in a [[formal specification]]. Postconditions are sometimes tested using [[assertion (computing)|assertions]] within the code itself. Often, postconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code.

For example: The result of a [[factorial]] is always an integer and greater than or equal to 1. So a program that calculates the factorial of an input number would have postconditions that the result after the calculation be an integer and that it be greater than or equal to 1.  Another example: a program that calculates the [[square root]] of an input number might have the postconditions that the result be a number and that its [[square (algebra)|square]] be equal to the input.

==Postconditions in object-oriented programming==
In some software design approaches, postconditions, along with [[precondition]]s and class [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]], are components of the software construction method [[design by contract]].

The postcondition for any routine is a declaration of the properties which are guaranteed upon completion of the routine's execution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]], ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]], second edition,'' Prentice Hall, 1997, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; As it relates to the routine's contract, the postcondition offers assurance to potential callers that in cases in which the routine is called in a state in which its [[precondition]] holds, the properties declared by the postcondition are assured.

==Eiffel example==

The following example written in [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] sets the value of a class attribute &lt;code&gt;hour&lt;/code&gt; based on a caller-provided argument &lt;code&gt;a_hour&lt;/code&gt;. The postcondition follows the keyword &lt;code&gt;ensure&lt;/code&gt;. In this example, the postcondition guarantees, in cases in which the precondition holds (i.e., when &lt;code&gt;a_hour&lt;/code&gt; represents a valid hour of the day), that after the execution of &lt;code&gt;set_hour&lt;/code&gt;, the class attribute &lt;code&gt;hour&lt;/code&gt; will have the same value as &lt;code&gt;a_hour&lt;/code&gt;. The tag "&lt;code&gt;hour_set:&lt;/code&gt;" describes this postcondition clause and serves to identify it in case of a runtime postcondition violation.

&lt;source lang="eiffel"&gt;
    set_hour (a_hour: INTEGER)
            -- Set `hour' to `a_hour'
        require
            valid_argument: 0 &lt;= a_hour and a_hour &lt;= 23
        do
            hour := a_hour
        ensure
            hour_set: hour = a_hour
        end
&lt;/source&gt;

==Postconditions and inheritance==
In the presence of [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], the routines inherited by descendant classes (subclasses) do so with their contracts, that is their preconditions and postconditions, in force. This means that any implementations or redefinitions of inherited routines also have to be written to comply with their inherited contracts. Postconditions can be modified in redefined routines, but they may only be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 1997, pp. 570–573.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the redefined routine may increase the benefits it provides to the client, but may not decrease those benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60933">{{About|salience in the field of semiotics and communication||Salience (disambiguation)}}

'''Salience''' is the state or condition of being prominent. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines salience as "most noticeable or important." The concept is discussed in [[communication]], [[semiotics]], [[linguistics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[political science]]. It has been studied with respect to [[interpersonal communication]], [[persuasion]], [[politics]], and its influence on [[mass media]].

==Semiotics==

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]] (the study of signs or symbolism), ''salience'' refers to the relative importance or prominence of a part of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]. The salience of a particular sign when considered in the context of others helps an individual to quickly rank large amounts of information by importance and thus give attention to that which is the most important. This process keeps an individual from being overwhelmed with [[information overload]].

===Discussion===

Meaning can be described as the "system of mental representations of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] or [[phenomenon]], its properties and associations with other objects and/or phenomena. In the [[consciousness]] of an individual, meaning is reflected in the form of sensory information, [[image]]s and [[concept]]s."&lt;ref name="Bedny" /&gt; It is [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] or [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]], but the sign system for transmitting meanings can be uncertain in its operation or conditions may disrupt the communication and prevent accurate meanings from being decoded.

Further, meaning is socially constructed and dynamic as the [[culture]] evolves. That is problematic because an individual's frame of reference and experience may produce some divergence from some of the prevailing social [[norm (sociology)|norms]]. So the salience of data will be determined by both situational and emotional elements in a combination relatively unique to each individual. For example, a person with an interest in [[botany]] may allocate greater salience to visual data involving plants, and a person trained as an [[architect]] may scan buildings to identify features of interest. A person's [[world view]] or ''Weltanschauung'' may predispose salience to data matching those views. Because people live for many years, responses become [[convention (philosophy and social sciences)|conventional]]. At a group or community level, the conventional levels of significance or salience are slowly embedded in the sign systems and culture, and they cannot arbitrarily be changed.
For example, the first thing seen in a poster may be the title or picture of a face.

==Communication studies==
The noun “salience” derives from the Latin word ''saliens -'' ‘leaping, or bounding’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, Vol. XIV|last=|first=|publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford.|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Latin Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a human embryo, the heart tissue is beating and leaping.  A Native American may pay no attention to Columbus Day protests until after instruction in tribal and historical Indian traditions (priming).  After gaining new cultural insights, these protests may become “salient.”

Salience, as a component of Communication and Social Psychology studies, asks the question of why something captures and holds our attention and why it is more readily available as a cognition than other facts, feelings, and emotions?  When a person perceives and reacts, they use the information and emotions most readily accessible.  This information is understood to be the most salient information. 
 
Social Influence is an area of intense study for Social Psychologists and Communication theorists.  Social Influence asks how and why, are people influenced to weaken a strongly held position, adopt a new position, change an attitude, or persuade someone?  The extent that the communicator can understand and harness the power of Social Influence is the extent that they can succeed in their goal.

Salience has been identified as one of the key ideas that guides our understanding of how to make a point of view stand out from among others and draw the receivers attention to the salient points of the encoded message.  Salience is then an important concept in several theories relating to Social Influence. Some areas of Communication and Social Psychology research that include the concept of salience as a component of their theory are: Persuasion Theory, Vested Interest, Summation Theory of Attitude Change, Group Salience, and Social Presence Theory.  The use of salience in these theories is summarized below:

'''Persuasion theory:''' Salience is the critical concept, along with agenda and spin, for the Persuasion theory of Professor Richard E. Vatz of Towson University as articulated in his book, /The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion/, (Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013).  Salience, in his book and articles, is used as a measure of how reality is created for chosen audiences.  He claims (1973) (2013) that the struggle for salience (and agenda and meaning and spin) is the sine qua non of the persuasive process.&lt;ref name="Vatz" /&gt;

'''[[Vested interest (communication theory)]]''':  William Crano's states that, “Vested Interest refers to the extent to which an attitude object is hedonically relevant for the attitude holder” (Crano, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;131).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Article In:  Attitude strength: Antecedents and Consequences|last=Crano|first=William|publisher=Erlbaum|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=131–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for someone to have a vested interest in something, it must be perceived to affect their lives personally.  Things that in which we are highly vested also bear on our behavior (Crano, 1995), and it must be salient or leap out.  Vivid cues are more likely to grab our attention (McArthur &amp; Post, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McArthur|first=Leslie|last2=Post|first2=David|date=1976|title=Figural emphasis and person perception|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=13|pages=520–536|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If an attitude object is salient to us, our vested interest will be increased as well as the likelihood that our behavior and attitudes will be consistent (Sears &amp; Citrin, 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tax revolt: Something for nothing in California|last=Sears|first=David|last2=Citrin|first2=Jack|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crano states, “Apparently, making an attitude object more salient enhances the salience of attitude-relevant outcomes as well. Vividness, priming, and similar operations may all enhance the salience of the self-interest implications of a position.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Crano, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;131). The stronger the salience of our attitude, the stronger will be the connection between our attitude object and our behavior.

'''Attitude Summation Theory''':  Fishbein posited that we have many beliefs about an attitude object (characteristics, attributes, values, and etc.).  Each belief held is argued to have an affective (feeling) and evaluative (value determining) component.  An attitude is then a mediated evaluative response (Fishbein, 1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fishbein|first=Martin|date=1963|title=An Investigation of the Relationships between Beliefs about an Object and the Attitude toward that Object|url=|journal=Human Relations|volume=16|issue=3|pages=233–239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These attitudes sum together to form our overall view of the attitude object and comes to the forefront (made salient) when we engage the attitude object.

Fishbein indicates that we can hold six to nine salient beliefs at a time (Cronen, 1973).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cronen |first1=V. E. |title=Belief, Salience, Media Exposure and Summation Theory |journal=The Journal of  Communication |date=1973 |volume=23 |pages=86–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those manifested during the attitude object encounter determine the prevailing attitude. Fishbein believed that the strongest held beliefs would be the most salient and come to the fore.  Cronen argued that salience is not intrinsically tied to strength, but is an independent attribute of attitude change, as some strongly held beliefs are non-salient (Cronen, 1973).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Group Salience''':  Group salience is a person's cognizance of fellow group members similarities and differences within a group interaction (Harwood et al., 2006).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harwood |first1=J. |last2=Hewstone |first2=M. |title=The Family and Communication Dynamics of  Group Salience |journal=The Journal of Family Communication |date=2006 |volume=6 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a group, communication is the primary way that we determine salience of attitudes. Other things such as physical attributes can be observed, but deeper feelings will have to be communicated within the group to make them salient (Harwood et al., 2006).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Coupland et al., suggest that communication processes represent an individual's identity within the group (Coupland et al., 1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coupland |first1=J. |last2=Coupland |first2=N. |last3=Giles |first3=H. |last4=Henwood |first4=K. |title=Formulating age: Dimensions of  age identity in elderly talk |journal=Discourse Processes |date=1991 |volume=14 |issue=14 |pages=87–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Social presence theory]] (SPT)''': SPT can be defined as, “The degree to which a person is perceived to be a real person in mediated communication.” (Gunwadena, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gunawardena |first1=C. N. |title=Social presence theory and implications for interaction collaborative  learning in computer conferences |journal=International Journal of Educational Telecommunications |date=1995 |volume=1 |issue=2/3 |pages=147–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an update on the original definition, developed by Short, Williams and Christie (1976),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Short |first1=J. |last2=Wiliams |first2=E. |last3=Christy |first3=B. |title=The social psychology of telecommunications |date=1976 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stated, “The degree of salience of the other person in an interaction.”

'''What makes something salient?'''  How does the mind select, structure and impart meaning to stimuli?  People “develop and stabilize” cognitions about stimuli by an “examination of action, intention, ability and environment.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taytlor |first1=Shelly E. |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |title=Salience, Attention, and Attribution: Top of the Head  Phenomena |journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |date=1978 |volume=11 |issue=249–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978, citing Heider, 1934, as their source, p.&amp;nbsp;250).  Individuals have limited cognitive resources and abilities to process and comprehend information and situational complexity.  A person cannot grasp every nuance of a stimuli required to assign its full and complete meaning.  Salience is the way researchers understand what information will most likely capture one's attention in a given situation and have the greatest influence on one's cognitions about the stimuli. Research has shown that the most salient information is not always the most accurate or important, but a “Top of the Head Phenomenon” (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;   People are not fully conscious of the extent to which salience affects them.  In experimental studies, individuals generated strong cognitions with only slight manipulation of stimuli.  When shown this fact, the participant reacted strongly to the idea that they made choices based on “trivial” information (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

“Salience has generally been treated as a propriety [conforming to standard norms of morality and behavior] of a stimulus which allows it to stand out and be noticed” (Guido, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;114).&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guido |first1=Gianluigi |title=The Dichotic Theory of Salience: A Framework for Assessing  Attention and Memory |journal=European Advances in Consumer Research |date=1998 |volume=3 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guido developed the Theory of Dichotic Salience after a review of some 1,200 studies, which pointed to a “common origin among salience instances, by emphasizing the nature of prominence which is intrinsic to any salience construct” (Guido, 1998, Abstract, p.&amp;nbsp;114).&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;  According to this theory, a stimulus is “in-salient” if it is not in harmony with perceiver's worldview.  It is “re-salient” if it is in harmony with the perceiver's goals (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guido |first1=Gianluigi |title=The Dichotic Theory of Salience: A Framework for Assessing  Attention and Memory |journal=European Advances in Consumer Research |date=1998 |volume=3 |pages=114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salience is a construct that depends on the ability of the mind to access the feelings or emotions (affect) generated by the salient stimulus.  The activation in memory of cognitions that relate to and evaluate the stimulus.  And finally, the availability of these mental resources to engage the stimulus (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

A [[schema (psychology)]] is a cognitive framework or concept through which one organizes and interprets information. Schemas provide shortcuts in sorting and interpreting the enormous quantity of information generated in one's environment.  The limitation of such a construct, is that it may cause one to exclude pertinent facts and feelings about a situation.  Instead one may focus on only those that harmonize with one's biases, beliefs and ideations.

Schemas are very useful as they help one to decide about things with very little information.  This simplification filters how one allocates cognitive resources.  It also allows one to learn more readily and rapidly, if the learning fits within an already established schema.  A schema allows for quick access to stored cognitions and filtering through pre-established algorithms, which saves time in processing and retrieving information.  Because they are so useful and reliable in helping one make sense of the world, schemas can be hard to change.   Thomas Kuhn (1962), in his book, [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]], talks about how scientists, considered the most rationale and fact driven professionals, can be so committed to their schemas that they ignore or misinterpret relevant data gathered from experiments that is contrary to their notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kuhn |first1=Thomas S. |title=The structure of scientific revolutions |date=1962 |publisher=University of Chicago  Press |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One challenge for communicators is to find a way to break through these hardened perceptions in order to persuade.  Making an idea salient is one of the keys.

Guido's Principle one is [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure-ground]], which is the means the perceptual field from which people direct their attention towards something that stands out.  Figurality is the brightness, [[complexity]], and energy (movement) of a stimulus.  It is thought that these aspects trigger cognitions and thought processes in the brain that lead to salience.  Brightness includes the magnitude and the colors of the object.  Studies have shown that bright, vibrant colors more easily capture the attention and are easier to remember (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;
 
Complexity builds upon the contextual factors (the number of perceptible qualities about the stimulus object that one can distinguish) and learning (what we perceive as unfamiliar).  Complexity is the interaction of the familiarity, unfamiliarity, and the number of aspects of the stimulus object that we can resolve.  Complexity is the interaction of these stimuli interact to engage affect and cognitions developed about the object (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  Movement of an object engages sensory receptors, which when sparked, send stimuli to the body and brain.  Moving pictures, signs and eyes are used to capture our attention and make us pay attention (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

Novelty is the “isolation” of the stimulus from other stimuli (objects).  This isolation or uniqueness sets it apart from other objects in the background, so that it can be noticed (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  This can also be expressed as comparative distinctiveness (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Higgins |authorlink1=E. Tory Higgins |editor1-last=Higgins |editor1-first=E. Tory |editor2-last=Kruglanski |editor2-first=Arie W. |title=Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles |date=1996 |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |pages=133–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guido's Principle two is Unusuality, which can be broken down into statistical novelty (unique and unfamiliar), unexpectancy, out of role behaviors, negativity and extremity (emotional impact).  Novelty is the degree that one has no experience with the stimuli.  Unexpectancy is a result of learning.  We have developed an expectation that is violated (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  Negativity is our gut reaction.  Extremity is the emotional impact of the Negativity. Each of these contributes to making something salient.

'''Accessibility and Salience'''.  When we evaluate a situation, what comes first to our minds?  The things that come to mind are those that are most accessible (most readily recalled and those that are most salient (Kreech and Crutchfield, 1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kreech |first1=D. |last2=Crutchefield |first2=R. S. |title=Theory and Problems of Social Psychology |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Our beliefs and thoughts vary in salience. Salient beliefs are most easily activated in the cognitive processes and are more easily recalled, and are therefore more accessible (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;

Salience is determined by stimuli, such as brightness, contract, situational properties, schemas, expectations, arousal, and properties of the interpreter (e.g., need state, enduring beliefs, and motivations).   The interconnectedness of these stimuli causes the brain to be activated and information salient to the situation recalled and acted upon.

Information stored in memory, that is accessible, can be recalled either by a cue or free association.  Information that is not accessible, cannot be recalled and therefore is not available for use in interpreting a situation.  Higgins (1996) defines a memory's [[activation potential]] as having three properties: 1. the possibility that the knowledge can be recalled (not repressed or lost), 2. how easily accessible is it, and 3.the intensity or the energy of the memory.&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  To the extent that memories are available, accessible, and have sufficient effect is the extent that these memories will be activated and that knowledge is brought to bear on the situation at hand.

Cramer (1968, p.&amp;nbsp;82) defines [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] as "a change in antecedent conditions which is specifically designed to increase the probability of a particular response given to a particular stimulus".  The process of priming can activate a particular memory to bring it to the fore so that it can be engaged in a communication or social influence situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cramer |first1=P. |title=Word Association |date=1968 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Priming has been shown to increase accessibility of relevant knowledge (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  Priming is, then, any event that causes increased accessibility and availability of a framework of knowledge (schema) useful for that particular situation.

In journalism, priming is associated with framing.  When an author writes an article to persuade, he or she frames certain information so that it is more salient to the reader (Weaver, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weaver |first1=David H. |title=Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2007 |volume=57 |pages=142–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Framing including writing decisions about definitions of words and events, causal linkages, moral implications, and solution sets for the problem area (McCombs, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCombs |first1=M. |title=New frontiers in agenda setting: Agendas of attributes and frames |journal=Mass  Communication Review |date=1997 |volume=24 |issue=1–2 |pages=32–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Our minds sort information available using our agenda (framing) and stimulus (priming) for that situation and activate it to accomplish our purpose.

When one encounters a stimulus for the first time, the initial reaction is characterized as [[unconditioned response]].  An unconditioned response is one that “elicits a national, reflexive response.”  (Weseley &amp; McEntarffer, 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;136).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weseley |first1=Alison J. |title=Barron's AP Psychology |date=2014 |publisher=Barron’s  Educational Series, Inc |location=New York |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent encounters will elicit a [[conditioned response]] has been developed through the learning that occurred with the intervening encounters with the stimulus.  This learning is bedrock knowledge on which one draws when responding to a given situation.  (Weseley &amp; McEntarffer, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weseley |first1=Alison J. |title=Barron's AP Psychology |date=2014 |publisher=Barron’s  Educational Series, Inc |location=New York |pages=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the first time one ate ice cream the experience was pleasant, the second experience will be informed from the firs.  The second experience will generate salient pleasant cognitions, salivation, and other biological responses that will reinforce the pleasant salience of the experience.  If on the other hand, the first encounter was negative (disgust, pain or nausea), the second encounter will generate the feeling of pain in the stomach awful memories of the first encounter. which will reinforce the negative salience of the first and second experience.

Another key aspect of whether a particular memory or knowledge will be activated is whether it is applicable to the situation.  If it is not applicable, it will not be salient and is unlikely to be activated for that situation.  “According to the synapse model…, the process begins with the stimulus, which increases the excitation level of stored knowledge as a function of the features of the match between the attended features of the stimulus and the features of the stored knowledge.” (Higgins, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;137).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  The stimulus information creates a pathway to the knowledge, which is then evaluated for a salience match to the stimulus.  If there is a match, then the knowledge will be activated.

Our minds and bodies are bombarded by relevant and irrelevant knowledge and experiences every day.  We will tune into salient ones (crane the ears to more fully hear enjoyable music) and tune-out non-salient ones (cover our ears from jackhammer noise).  There is difference between seeing something and looking at it.  In seeing, the capacity of our retina to take in the light energy is engaged and the brain processes that information into an image.  When one looks at an object, not only are visual perceptive capacities engaged, but other mental processes for evaluation and ordering of the object are activated (Skinner, 1974).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1=B. F. |title=About Behaviorism |date=1974 |publisher=Vintage Books a Division of Random House |location=New York |pages=113–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have gatekeeper mental mechanisms that allow certain information in and keeps others out. This discrimination process can be viewed a defensive mechanism the protects and enhances our life experience.  Our processes of making cognitions “also involve contingencies of reinforcement.” (Skinner, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;117).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"/&gt;  Skinner implies that reinforcement as “a special kind of stimulus control.”  (Skinner, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;119).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"/&gt;  Salience can be thought of as a reinforcement mechanism that make certain thoughts, feelings and emotions available, accessible, applicable and actionable within the context of the situation.

Esber and Haselgrove (2011) looked at the use of predictiveness and uncertainty on stimulus salience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Esber |first1=G. |last2=Haselgrove |first2=M. |title=Reconciling the influence of predictiveness and uncertainty  on stimulus salience: A model of attention in associative learning |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=2011 |volume=278 |issue=1718 |pages=2553–2561}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They cite the example of a bird watching the water for the presence of fish.  Through learning, the bird associates the ripples with the closeness of the fish, but they must be careful of the uncertainty that ripple is not caused by a crocodile.  The ripples are very salient, if they are caused by fish suitable for use as food.  The likelihood increases that the ripples will catch the attention of the bird and improve its probability of eating the fish, if the ripple cue is a predictor of fish behavior and presence.  The predictiveness of ripples reinforces its salience.  The Esber–Haselgrove model argues that (1) “stimuli acquire added salience to the degree that they predict motivationally relevant consequences”, and  (2) “a predictor of multiple reinforcers should have more salience than a predictor of just one.” (Esber &amp; Haselgrove, 2011, 2555-25557).&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;  So, for example, if ripples predict both the presence of fish and the increased likelihood that the fish can be caught, they will be much more salient to the bird, than if the ripples only predict the presence of the fish, but tell the bird nothing about the probability of making a catch.

Salience is a broad concept in the social sciences, that can cause confusion.  Part of the confusion lies in that different researchers use the same term to posit different ideas of what makes a particular stimulus salient.  When we encounter an object or idea, we may be draw to it for a variety of reasons.  It may be its brightness or intensity, its predictive capacity, or other features such as uniqueness or enormity that catches one's attention.

Once the attention is engaged, our brain will begin to process this information and make assessments and judgements about the encounter.  Our minds and bodies will activate useful memories, biological responses and feelings that were generated from prior encounters with the object of similar objects.  These memory-evaluative-feeling-biology responses will determine if the object is salient.  If it is salient, we will devote more cognitive processing resources to the encounter and it will enhance or protect us in that moment.

===Axioms of salience===
[[Communication]] scholars have found that a number of different factors have a direct effect on the salience of attitude objects.

====Direct experience====
[[William Crano]] posits that one's direct experience with an issue or attitude object increases the salience and consequently the [[wikt:potency|potency]] of that [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], and the level of consistency between attitude and [[behavior]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

:For example: Consider two people: one with emphysema, one without. Both of whom share a negative attitude toward cigarette smoking. The person with emphysema would have a stronger attitude than his counterpart, and consequently would show greater consistency between his relevant attitude and behavior. It is posited by Crano that the attitude toward smoking of the person with emphysema may be more salient due to his direct experience with the consequence of smoking.

====Self-Interest====

The concept called ''[[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]]'' by Crano is called ''self-interest'' by Sears (1997). It seems that "self-interest" is the more widely recognized term. Self-interest involves either perceived or actual personal consequences. That is, Crano (1997) argues that vested interest involves perceived personal consequences (p.&amp;nbsp;490), while Sears (1997, a critique of Crano) counter-argues that Crano's survey experiments define it objectively. Crano argues that vested interest should have a moderating effect on attitudes. Sears argues that, actually, evidence for this is conflicting: The survey literature has rarely found significant effects of self-interest, while the experimental literature finds significant effects. The literature is concerned with salience only marginally; it is actually about strength of attitudes (i.e. how well they correlate with behavior). It is about salience inasmuch as anything "strong" is "salient".

====Needs and aspirations====
The salience (prominence) of an [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] can also be measured by the [[relevance]] of an [[idea]] to that person's [[needs]] or aspirations.&lt;ref name="Tacos" /&gt; As ideals become more salient they become more [[accessible]], the more [[accessible]] the attitude object is the stronger the attitude toward the object. As [[accessibility]] increases, so does the likelihood of self-interested [[voting]] (Young).

:For example: In times of elections, issue relevant events are the focus of attention. Therefore, candidates, due to their aspiration for a certain political position are interest driven toward the salient events since they are favorable to their party.

===Policy making===
{{Confusing|section|date=August 2008}}

Political scientists agree that salience is relatively important in examining political [[policy]], because policies are not only determined by what issues are important to people but also by how important they are. This involves examining what issues are ignored and which are made "important." One research agenda that political scientists are concerned with understanding is "when and how salience and changes in salience matter for political action."

There are three related understandings of salience.

#The first ("classical") interpretation considers salience to be independent of the "[[status quo]]" and politicians’ ideal policies and programs. Although it says salience is independent of ideals, it does not say that salience is independent of preferences. This means, where there is a change in salience there is also a change in preferences. Often a player or policymaker's ideals may not be known but their preferences are usually revealed in their party's manifestos. Often policymakers cannot achieve their ideals but rather must choose between the offers on the table. They may prefer one over the other and this is where salience affects a party or a politician's position on an issue.
#The second ("[[valence (psychology)|valence]]") interpretation proposes that for certain issues salience is a very important factor. In other words, when there is a general [[consensus]] of [[principle]]s, the relative salience of various issues amongst the public determines the policy position of policy makers. This is due to constraints in policy making, where ideals are often induced, which policy makers view as the tradeoff space. For example, although "ideally" they may like to see low [[unemployment]] and low [[inflation]], they are usually constrained to pick a position on the "tradeoff" line. Thus, their ideal has been induced due to constraints. In these situations salience and policy position are almost interchangeable, because their "induced ideal" is their "favored allocation."{{Clarify|date=August 2008}} In the classical interpretation, salience would be used to describe the different levels of preference between positions on [[policies]].
#The third ("price") interpretation assumes that salience is not separate from ideals, as the classical view states, but that it is also not the same as ideals, as the valence view claims. This interpretation assumes that although a group of players, sharing benevolent preferences, all dissatisfied with the [[status quo]], may still value different aspects differently when considering policy change. The price interpretation is favored over the other two for three reasons. First, it is more applicable. Unlike the classical view, the price interpretation can be applied to a more wide-ranging set of situations. Second, the price interpretation uses both the classical point of view and ideals in its evaluation of salience. Not only do you need to know a player's weighted preferences but also their connection to their ideal point and the [[status quo]]. Therefore, a change in salience can reflect a change in ideal point, [[status quo]], or their weighted preferences. Third, this interpretation can be used to determine the elements stand in importance or worth. For example, players may organize and focus their time and energy into options with the biggest pay off. "That is they may look to see where they get the greatest ‘bang for their buck.’"&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

==Public opinion==
McCombs and Shaw’s seminal “Chapel Hill study”, which researched salience and public opinion examined most of the agenda-setting research since the [[United States presidential election, 1968]] which has been concerned with how the public salience of the issue is related to [[mass media]]’s ranking of these issues in terms of frequency of coverage and news play. The main [[hypothesis]] examined in this study is the ranking of certain issues by the [[Mass media|media]], which, in time, becomes the public agenda. More importantly, the article searched whether the perceived public salience of the federal budget deficit is significantly related "to the amount of public knowledge about the issue, direction of public opinion regarding one possible solution to the issue, the strength of that opinion and political behavior such as writing letters, signing petitions, voting, etc." The result of this study concluded that "even though the federal deficit issue was one of the more salient to newspaper and voters during the 1988 [[election]], it (the federal budget deficit) was not as emotional or [[drama]]tic as some of the other highly salient issues such as [[drug abuse]] or [[environmental pollution]]. Thus it seemed likely that public opinion regarding a solution to the federal budget deficit might be rather evenly split and would likely be more stable during the month of interviewing than would opinion on some of the other more dramatic issues being emphasized in news media coverage and political advertisements." In other words, issues that directly involve subjects, in this study, would conclude to be more salient than issues that do not involve them directly.

==Marketing stimuli==

Although salience is a stimulus response, is it a stimulus quality or an absolute quality?&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt; Salience plays an important role in intergroup communication. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, "Group salience is a key variable both in influencing quality of intergroup contact and in moderating the effects of intergroup contact on prejudicial attitudes."

In their study of family communication and intergroup relationships, "Group salience is an individual’s awareness of group memberships and respective group differences in an intergroup encounter (e.g., the salience of race in an interracial conversation)."&lt;ref name="Harwood" /&gt; This study carefully examines the dynamics of intergroup relationships with respect to communication in a family context. Their study involved communicative aspects associated with age salience in the grandparent&amp;nbsp;– grandchild relationship, the extent to which various dimension of communication predicts measures of salience, relational or inter-family proximity, and attitudes towards aging. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, "Communication phenomena that were positively correlated with measures of age salience were negatively related to relational closeness. Only one communication measure (grandparents talking about the past) moderated the relationship between quality of contact with grandparent and attitudes toward older people. Specific communicative dimensions emerged that warrant further investigation in this and other intergroup contexts."&lt;ref name="Harwood" /&gt;

Salience also from an applied communicative perspective plays an important role in our [[Consumer]]- [[Marketing]] world. In Gianluigi Guido's book, ''The Salience of Marketing Stimuli: an incongruity&amp;nbsp;– salience hypothesis on consumer awareness'', "salience triggered by an external physical stimuli, like all marketing stimuli are before being internalized by consumers&amp;nbsp;– to explain and predict the conditions under which a marketing stimulus, is able to achieve its communication outcomes in term of processing and memory."&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt; The book clearly defines the history of the definition of salience and the ambiguities of arriving at an accurate definition. It also utilizes various theories to best define salience in our marketing world. Of the many theories, Guido uses aspects of Incongruity theory, [[Schema (psychology)|Schema]] theory and an information processing model referred to as the In-salience hypothesis emphasizes the nature of prominence of salience.

Marketing plans have become quite intricate and detailed in many ways.  Analysts and industry experts used a myriad of tools to collect information from would be customers, previous customers and others in order to fashion the sales message of a particular product.  This level of detailed work has evolved over time, but in many ways the same resources and information are gathered and used to achieve result of a sale.  The marketing strategy feeds into one of the final products most people get to experience: the commercial.  The commercial embodies the elements of the marketing strategy in language, affective response, and attitude change.  Marketing plans in the modern age also look at the international customer when creating plans and formulating strategy.  “An evolutionary perspective of internationalization of the firm has been adopted by a number of authors in the areas of international economics and international management. The theory of the international product lifecycle, propounded by Vernon and others, identifies a number of phases in the internationalization process based on the location of production. In the initial phase, a firm exports to overseas markets from a domestic production base. As market potential builds up, overseas production facilities are established. Low cost local competition then enters the market, and ultimately exports to the home market of the initial entrant, thus challenging its international market position.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Craig |first=C.Samuel |last2=Douglas |first2=Susan P. |date=December 1996 |title=Responding to the challenges of global markets: Change, complexity, competition and conscience |journal=The Columbia Journal of World Business |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=6–18 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5428(96)90028-9 |issn=0022-5428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"This model is part of wider Dichotic theory of salience, according to which a stimulus is salient either when it is incongruent in a certain context to a perceiver's schema, or when it is congruent in a certain context to a perceiver's goal. According to the four propositions of the model, in-salient stimuli are better recalled, affect both attention and interpretation, and are moderated by the degree of perceivers' comprehension (i.e., activation, accessibility, and availability of schemata), and involvement (i.e., personal relevance of the stimuli). Results of two empirical studies on print advertisements show that in-salient ad messages have the strongest impact in triggering ad processing which, in turn, leads to consumer awareness."&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt;

The field of marketing is continually being studied and researched.  Anshular &amp; Kumar, Williams &amp; Schmidt, Holden, Kuznetsov &amp; Whitelock, and Huang &amp; Chan have researched and published works regarding the language of marketing.  Although the research is ongoing and adaptive to the customer, the research has been able to study points of importance to the consumer.  Marketing requires an approach that carefully designs messages (commercials), utilizing  signs and symbols to resonate with a potential buyer or customer.  Nike's swoosh, Michael Jordan's jump-man image, Ford/GMC Cadillac logos are all signs that most people can quickly grab and discern the message being laid out.  In the world of marketing having this power and ability gives you a significant edge in comparison to the competition.  Van Der Lans, Pieters, and Wedel write based on their research “we estimate brand salience at the point of purchase, based on perceptual features (color, luminance, edges) and how these are influenced by consumers’ search goals. We show that the salience of brands has a pervasive effect on search performance, and is determined by two key components: The bottom-up component is due to in-store activity and package design. The top-down component is due to out-of-store marketing activities such as advertising.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Lans|first=Ralf|last2=Pieters|first2=Rik|last3=Wedel|first3=Michel|date=September 2008|title=Research Note—Competitive Brand Salience|journal=Marketing Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=922–931|doi=10.1287/mksc.1070.0327|issn=0732-2399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using computer based langue to design extraction tools as part of the user experiences.

In the IT world, coding language is very important and therefore errors must be monitored well throughout the process.

Internet Alcohol Vendors unlike traditional brick and mortar stores are established to reach a wider market.  With this intent state officials and competitors have both started cases in court as further regulating the practice of internet alcohol sales.  Internet sales give buyers reduced discounts in many forms while offering very little in security and accountability.  The case brought against the industry favored further regulation keying in on individuals underage age having access to and buying alcohol online.  The courts pushed back against the plaintiff lacking substantial information to make the case.  The marketing language used was focused on reduced taxes based on quantity purchased and reduced or zero fees for shipping.  Customers were connected to this message and therefore drawn to the product and made significant purchases.

Russian viewpoint of marketing focused on the battle against capitalism, the west and specifically USA.  Marketing language focused on the economics of each nation and how to improve it in an ever-changing world.  Marketing was studied in the west by Russian students and translated for Russians to understand. Bad language came from translators who took artistic leisure with the material.  Based on this context things were changed and missed when information was being relayed created huge shifts in understanding of the original material.

The difference between the English alphabet and Chinese logographical system offer a unique challenge in brand creation, marketing and language.  The article touches on how unique messages have to be crafted without simply translating.  The Chinese language and system of writing is over 35,000 years old and not as easily bent or flexed to make easily pronounced phrases both in sound and linguistic prowess.

Therefore, to define salience as appropriate as possible using the information, it would be apt to define it such that, salience is that [[intrinsic]] concept of the perceived or interpreted prominence of an attitude, and its manifestation on our choices.

Salience in marketing based on the research reviewed, can be categorized as a stimulus quality. What that means is the customers’ needs have to be calculated and adjusted towards through the entire planning and execution of the plan.  The overall goal of the messenger should be to create a message which adapts to the customer's affective responses, rewarding it with more info, then finally providing a product which would best arrive at the predetermined feel.  Most consumers when asked about a marketing campaign are able to identify it clearly from the point of view of a commercial. These commercials capture the essence of the message being sent to all recipients.  Products such as make up, cars, clothing, coffee, food, shoes etc. are all designed to create and provide an affective reaction from the recipient. The process of engaging with the customer seeks a cognitive connection.  Customers will have to be grouped based on the item in order to predict affective responses.  With this in mind, the focus is placed on imagery, affective responses from the consumer. How does this make you feel, do you empathize, how would you feel about using this product, etc.  Marketing messages that have a significant affective component are able to connect better with people and yield greater outcome.

Identity salience can affect the consumer.  This display can be explain using “Identity theory posits that identities are arranged hierarchically and that salient identities are more likely to affect behavior than those that are less important. We propose that identity salience may play an important role in relationships that are distinguished by a minimum of two characteristics. First, though most theoretical and empirical research in relation-ship marketing focuses on characteristics of successful business-to-business relationships, such as trust and commitment (Morgan and Hunt 1994), many exchange relationships involve individuals. It is not unusual for organizations to attempt to develop long-term relationships with consumers on an individual basis. We argue that in contexts in which one partner is an individual, for example, business-to consumer marketing, identity salience may be an important construct that mediates relationship-inducing factors, such as reciprocity and satisfaction, and relationship marketing success."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnett|first=Dennis B.|last2=German|first2=Steve D.|last3=Hunt|first3=Shelby D.|date=April 2003|title=The Identity Salience Model of Relationship Marketing Success: The Case of Nonprofit Marketing|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=67|issue=2|pages=89–105|doi=10.1509/jmkg.67.2.89.18614|issn=0022-2429|citeseerx=10.1.1.659.532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity gets tied to brands, products and places for some people.  There are generations of family sports team supporters, airline users, vacation goings and even restaurant patrons.  These key items become a foundation block of self-identification and perception.

The vehicle industry uses certain symbols as part of its marketing campaign. Most of these are touched on from different manufacturers in their efforts to win over customers.  These are also common messages points that are used to make the sale and acquire the vested interest of the customer.  For e.g. comfort (leather seating), roominess (cabin space), reliability, safety, performance, on/off-road handling, award winner by category, insurance companies or other entity.  The best part of all the campaign is the dealership experience.  This experience is the affective piece of the process.  The initial being cognitive and schema connection, followed by the affective which aims at nudging the customer towards affirming the purchase.  Customer attitudes can be influenced by a myriad of variables, therefore the marketing campaign is aimed at skewing enough of those variables towards to nearest dealer or once most capable of making the sale. “Specifically, research on behavioral synchrony suggests that people express greater feelings of attraction when they share their visual gazes, body postures (Chartrand &amp; Lakin,2013), and more recently, their language style in writing or speech (Ireland &amp; Pennebaker,2010)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Cathy R.|last2=Kersten|first2=Mike|date=2016-03-15|title=Mortality salience increases language style matching and well-being|journal=Self and Identity|volume=15|issue=4|pages=452–467|doi=10.1080/15298868.2016.1154888|issn=1529-8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salience as a stimulus quality is a significant piece of the marketing, sales and commercial strategy.  Manufacturers use celebrities, athletes, and other professionals as a way of drawing your attention to their product through stimulus.  When it comes to car buying, many people refer to a past memory, this stimuli is different with each person but overall the quality and richness of that response is what connects to the brand in a way nothing else does.  Care makers go through periods of recycling pieces of nostalgia to connect new drivers to those of yesteryear.  Granpa is able to drive his mustang next to a grandson who favors the new model with a few modifications.  A suit maker is able to dress members of the same family for 3 generations and just as many weddings and formal events.

The stimulus quality is the strongest connection between all these events and the company or product creator able to take advantage of this, is most likely to achieve success.  “Research concerning stimulus characteristics, which include information content and format, suggests that consumers utilize more nutrition information when it Is presented in an easily processed form (Levy et al. 1985; Muller 1985; Russo et al. 1986; Scammon 1977).(Moorman, 1990)”  Stimulus qualities continually change and therefore needs to be studied and adaptations made in order to attain the best marketing end results.  Cultural viewpoints of marketing and advertising is important across industries in many parts of the world.  In the US alcohol sales are restricted to individuals ages 21 and greater, that rule isn’t universal and some in nations around the world are trying to cope with the effects of marketing and ad campaigns (O’Brian &amp; Carr 2016).”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Kerry S.|last2=Carr|first2=Sherilene M.|date=2016-09-07|title=Commentary on de Bruijnet al.(2016): Effective alcohol marketing policymaking requires more than evidence on alcohol marketing effects-research on vested interest effects is needed|journal=Addiction|volume=111|issue=10|pages=1784–1785|doi=10.1111/add.13489|pmid=27605080|issn=0965-2140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marketing messages are important based on the roles of the recipient.  In the example of a mom she’s expected to judge the quality of goods and purchase based on the needs of children even though the good may not directly be marketed to and for her.  “Noting the incongruence between the self-interested, utility maximizing persona one is expected to portray in the workforce, and the selﬂess, nurturing persona widespread among mothers, Hays argues that the latter identity in fact reveals a deep-seated cultural ambivalence towards economistic principles and behaviours.”&lt;ref&gt;de Laat, K., &amp; Baumann, S. (2016). Caring consumption as marketing schema: representations of motherhood in an era of hyperconsumption. Journal Of Gender Studies, 25(2), 183-199. doi:10.1080/09589236.2014.927353&lt;/ref&gt;

le form schema based on social norms and roles.  These roles are enforced individual beliefs and boosts perceptions is supposed to be doing, sometimes those expectations hold true and in others it doesn’t.  Social identity theory has been used while creating marketing strategies regarding women. Marketing strategies with products aimed at women should have like minds as part of the planning and creative process. Women across cultures and backgrounds experience similar stimuli but not on the same wave.  Products like shoes, makeup, clothing and others geared specifically for women have messages focused on stimuli response of “feel good”.  Moms receive and are sent messages of safety and security of their children, a measure of style and the look and presentation of a strong woman.  Marketing towards men are designed to inspire the feel of strength, leadership, vision, connection to nature, and feeling of ruggedness.

The Language used in marketing is important because it is potentially the most important reason why someone makes a purchase/acquires a product.  Research has shown that analytics aren’t always the best predictor of sales or consumer connection with a product. Social identity theory can be used to evaluate the roles of individuals while creating the strategy.  Depending on this solely will lead one astray without the addition of other pieces of information.  Shema allows the consumer to receive each detail of a commercial/ad campaign in a way that energizes particular stimuli and therefore puts each person into the “driver seat” of an experience.

The cognitive perspective spells out information which must be received, processed and analyzed and solutions south.  Salience in marketing searches for the affective or stimulus response.  A combination of efforts which both harvests information and processes it carefully if very important.  Things such as age group, buying power, shopping frequency, socioeconomic status are all important.  Once a product is created and during its testing phase the response which users and customers alike will be its feel.  In the new age of tech data, appliances and complex machinery, marketing will still need to focus its efforts on such products and how consumer stimuli reacts to the product.  The best engineers can create something that's amazing with all its bells and whistles, but its up to the perception of the customer to evaluate its usefulness and fit into his/her lifestyle.

The growing tech industry with the power of achievement is quickly advancing virtual reality.  VR can be experienced in the home without leaving to try or test any product prior to purchase.  "The mural isn't just about aesthetics. Visitors will be instructed via signs to download an app to view the mural's augmented reality features. Downloading the app will also unlock a special coupon at The Elephant Room. It's a marketing tactic that Moody believes can drive foot traffic to the bar."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tschanz|first=Dirk Schart, Nathaly|title=Kapitel 6  Praxiswissen: Von der Idee zur App|date=2017|work=Augmented und Mixed Reality|pages=153–172|publisher=UVK Verlagsgesellschaft mbH|isbn=9783739803845|doi=10.24053/9783739803845-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this power marketing analysts and executives can craft messages and commercial aimed at each person with a unique and authentic feel.  Information and data points are being collected and tested now. Video games offer a chance into the virtual world medical training and some groups in government and the military are adopting the technology to better achieve results.  Crafting the message and spreading it out the masses will take less effort in the future, messages can be adapted to fit all manner of permutations each person may have.  There may finally be an era of error free messaging with a direct link into the internet, show rooms of fashion designers, engineers at car factories and all other sorts of products.  Testing in the virtual world would be far less tasking on legions of people.

Humans in general respond greatly to stimuli and we offer this through the reactions generated. Marketing lends help in this manner by studying the patterns of behavior and crafting products for sale.  The messaging is not always clear, succinct, and wide reaching.  Research is still ongoing regarding how best to reach the customer in order to pitch and complete a sale.  Those who are successful have crafted tools to help measure key things like salience in messaging and reaction to products.  In the new age, the data collected will be very important while outfitting each member of the consuming public.  Being able to craft a message or medium that can quickly adapt to each person virtually is of great importance.  Online markets are gaining followership daily as more money spending moves to the digital realm.  Perception and reception of the message is still the single most important part of any marketing strategy and should not be treated lightly.

[[File:Pionnier-legion.JPG|thumb|The sappers ("''sapeurs''") of the [[French Foreign Legion]] traditionally sport large beards, wear leather aprons and gloves in their [[ceremonial dress]], and carry axes.]]

A '''sapper''', also called [[pioneer (military)|pioneer]] or [[combat engineer]], is a [[combatant]] or [[soldier]] who performs a variety of [[military engineering]] duties such as breaching fortifications, demolitions, bridge-building, laying or clearing minefields, preparing field defenses, as well as working on road and airfield construction and repair. They are also trained to serve as infantry personnel in defensive and offensive operations. A sapper's duties are devoted to tasks involving facilitating movement, defence and survival of allied forces and impeding those of enemies. The term "sapper" is used in the British Army and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, Polish Army and the U.S. military.  The phrase "sapper" comes from the French ''saper'' (to undermine, to dig under a wall or building to cause its collapse).

==Historical origin==
=== Sapping ===
{{see also|Sapping}}
[[File:No.2 Company, Bombay Sappers and Miners, China 1900.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of No 2 Field Company, [[Bombay Sappers and Miners]] on duty in China in 1900. The mule carries the tools required for field engineering tasks.]]

A sapper, in the sense first used by the French military, was one who dug trenches to allow besieging forces to advance towards the enemy defensive works and forts, over ground that is under the defenders' musket or artillery fire. This digging was referred to as [[sapping]] the enemy fortifications. Saps were excavated by brigades of trained sappers or instructed troops. When an army was defending a fortress with cannons, they had an obvious height and therefore range advantage over the attacker's guns.  The attacking army's artillery had to be brought forward, under fire, so as to facilitate effective [[counter-battery fire]].

This was achieved by digging what the French termed a ''sappe''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Charles|title=An Universal Military Dictionary, in English and French: In which are Explained the Terms of the Principal Sciences that are Necessary for the Information of an Officer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrRCAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA781|year=1816|publisher=T.

As they pressed forward, a position was prepared from which cannon could suppress the defenders on the fort's bastions. The sappers would then change the course of their trench, [[Zigzag|zig-zag]]ging toward the fortress wall. Each leg brought the attacker's artillery closer until the besieged cannon would be sufficiently suppressed for the attackers to breach the walls. Broadly speaking, sappers were originally experts at demolishing or otherwise overcoming or bypassing fortification systems.

=== Miner ===
{{See also|Mining (military)}}
[[File:Ghuznee.jpg|thumb|The fort of [[Battle of Ghazni|Ghazni]] which fell as a result of mining by a mixed contingent of the [[Bombay Engineer Group|Bombay]]  and [[Bengal Engineer Group|Bengal Sappers]] during the [[First Afghan War]] on 23 July 1839.]]

An additional term applied to sappers of the British Indian Army was "miner". The native engineer corps were called "sappers and miners", as for example, the [[Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners]]. The term arose from a task done by sappers to further the battle after saps were dug. The saps permitted cannon to be brought into firing range of the besieged fort and its cannon, but often the cannon themselves were unable to breach the fort walls. The engineers would dig a tunnel from the forward-most sap up to and under the fort wall, then place a charge of gunpowder and ignite it, causing a tremendous explosion that would destroy the wall and permit attacking infantry to close with the enemy. This was dangerous work, often lethal to the sappers, and was fiercely resisted by the besieged enemy. Since the two tasks went hand in hand and were done by the same troops, native Indian engineer corps came to be called "sappers and miners".

== Specific usage ==
=== Commonwealth of Nations ===
Sapper (abbreviated Spr) is the [[Royal Engineers]]' equivalent of [[Private (rank)|private]].  This is also the case within the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers]], [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Royal Canadian Engineers]], [[Royal Australian Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;Jobson 2009, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[South African Army Engineer Formation]], Jamaica Defence Force Engineer Regiment, and [[Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers|Royal New Zealand Engineers]].  The term "sapper" was introduced in 1856 when the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners was amalgamated with the officer corps of the Royal Engineers to form the Corps of Royal Engineers.

=== Australia ===
{{Main|Royal Australian Engineers}}
[[File:Benat Yakub bridge.jpg|thumb|Jisr Benat Yakub repaired (September 1918)]]

During the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of World War I Australian sappers repaired a bridge at the [[Battle of Jacob's Ford|historic crossing]] of the [[Jordan River]] at Jisr Benat Yakub (also known as [[Jacob's Ford]]). Here the retreating Ottoman and German rearguard had blown up the bridge's central arch which was repaired in five hours by sappers attached to the [[Australian Mounted Division]]. While the light horse brigades forded the river, continuing the [[Desert Mounted Corps]]' advance to [[Damascus]], the sappers worked through the night of 27/28 September 1918, to repair the bridge to enable the division's wheeled vehicles and guns to follow on 28 September.&lt;ref&gt;Preston pp. 261–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carver 2003 p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Royal Canadian Engineers}}
In the Canadian Forces, sappers exist both in the regular force and reserve force.  The rank of sapper is used instead of private trained to signify completion of the Engineer DP1 course.  Canadian sappers have been deployed in many major conflicts in recent history including World War I, World War II, the [[Korean War]], and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]].  The roles of a sapper entail: Bridge building with the ACROW, [[Bailey bridge|Bailey]], or [[Medium Girder Bridge]] bridging systems; explosive ordnance disposal; operating the advanced reverse-osmosis water purification unit, used mainly in domestic operations; maintaining roadways and airfields; combat diving; tactical breaching; and erecting and tearing down friendly living spaces.  Ultimately, the objective of the sappers is to facilitate the living, moving, and fighting for friendly troops on the battlefield, and denying the same to enemy forces.  The motto of the Canadian Military Engineers is ''Ubique'' ({{lang-la|everywhere}}) a motto shared with the [[Royal Canadian Artillery]].  The patron saint of combat engineers is [[Saint Barbara]], and 4 December is the corps' day of celebration.

=== Indian Army ===
{{Main|Indian Army Corps of Engineers}}
The term "sappers", in addition to the connotation of rank of engineer private, is used collectively to informally refer to the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer Corps]] as a whole and also forms part of the informal names of the three combat engineer groups, viz. [[Madras Sappers]], [[Bengal Sappers]] and the [[Bombay Sappers]]. Each of these groups consist of about twenty battalion-sized engineer regiments and additional company-sized minor engineer units. The three sapper groups are descended from the sapper and miner groups of the [[East India Company]] and later the [[British Indian Army]] of the [[British Raj]].

=== Israel ===
{{Main|Israeli Combat Engineering Corps}}

In the [[Israel Defense Forces]] a sapper (in [[Hebrew]]: פלס, ''palas'') is the military profession of a combat soldier who went through basic [[combat engineering]] training. Most of the sappers are soldiers of the [[Combat Engineering Corps]], but there are also infantry sappers, who are part of the [[infantry]] [[brigade]]s and are organized in engineering [[Company (military unit)|companies]] called פלחה"ן (''palchan''). These companies are integral part of the infantry brigades. Combat engineering corps sappers are arranged in battalions.

Each sapper goes through high level infantry training, which qualifies him as [[Rifleman|rifleman 06]] (רובאי 06). Combat engineering sappers are qualified as "sapper 06" (פלס 06). They are skilled in [[infantry]] combat, basic [[sabotage]], [[landmine]] planting and [[demining]], use of [[explosives]], breaching and opening routes, [[trench warfare]], and operating the [[IDF Puma]] [[combat engineering vehicle]]. Combat engineering commanders are qualified as "sapper 08" while combat engineering [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s are qualified as "sapper 11". Both go through additional advance training to gain the skills needed for high level sapper profession.

The [[Israel Police]] also maintains a bomb disposal specialist unit. All police sappers must graduate from a 10-month training program at the bomb disposal training center in [[Beit Shemesh]], which includes operational exercises, theoretical studies, and fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Omri | last=Efraim | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4125018,00.html | title=Israel Police get 1st female sapper | newspaper=Israel News | date=20 September 2011 | access-date=12 March 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100347/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4125018,00.html | archive-date=2 April 2015 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, sapper (''sapeur'') is the title of military [[combat engineer]]s and [[firefighters]], both civil and military, (sapper-fireman or ''sapeur-pompier''). Military sappers fall under the umbrella of the [[Engineering Arm]] or ''Arme du Génie''. A related title is [[pioneer (military)|pioneer]] (''pionnier''), used only in the [[French Foreign Legion]].

* Sapper : title of combat engineers in most Engineer Regiments (3rd, 13th, 19th and 31st), except in the [[French Foreign Legion]] ([[1st Foreign Engineer Regiment]] and [[2nd Foreign Engineer Regiment]])
* Air Sapper (''sapeur de l'air'') : title of the privates of the 25th Air Engineering Regiment, an Army regiment seconded to the Air Force.
* Parachute Sapper (''sapeur parachutiste'') : title of the privates of the [[17th Parachute Engineer Regiment]], the combat engineering unit of the [[11th Parachute Brigade (France)|11th Parachute Brigade]]
* Marine Sapper (''sapeur de marine'') : since 2006, title of the privates of the [[6th Engineer Regiment (France)|6th Engineer Regiment]], the combat engineering unit of the [[9th Light Armoured Marine Brigade (France)|9th Light Armoured Marine Brigade]].
* Sapper firefighter (''sapeur-pompier'') : title of the firefighters in the civilian fire services and the Paris Fire Brigade. 
* Sapper-miner (''sapeur-mineur'') : since World War Two, combat engineers specialized in [[demining]].

====History====
[[File:Sapeurs du génie de la Garde impériale, 1810_crop.jpg|thumb|right|French Imperial Guard sappers, 1810]]
The French Corps of Engineers was created under the command of [[Marshall Vauban]] during the late 17th century. Its members were called sappers if their function was to destroy enemy fortifications by using [[trench]]es or ''sape'' and miners if they engaged in [[tunnel warfare]] or ''mine''. The Corps of the Engineers was suppressed during two short periods (1720-1729 and 1769-1793) and sappers and miners were part of the Artillery regiments. In 1793, the Corps was reorganized into companies of miners and battalions of sappers, each assigned to a particular division.

Eventually, as the missions of the Corps grew more diversified, additional titles were used by combat engineers, such as [[Conductor (military appointment)|Conductor]] (''sapeur-conducteur'') in 1810, entrusted with the logistics of the Corps, Firefighter (''sapeur-pompier'') in 1810 or [[telegraph]] sapper (''sapeur-télégraphiste''). In 1814, the companies of miners were integrated into the sapper battalions, themselves organized in Engineers Regiments (''régiments du génie''). In 1875, the distinction between miners and sappers was abolished and all members of the Corps of Engineers were titled sappers-miners, though only sapper was used in common usage. In 1894, the ''pontonniers'' or bridgemakers were transferred from the Artillery Corps to the Engineers, thus creating the title ''sapeurs-pontonniers''. In 1909, the Engineering Arm of the Army Staff was entrusted the burgeoning Air Service (''Aérostation militaire''), its personal was titled sapper-airman (''sapeur-aérostier''). The titled was disused in 1914 when the Air Service took its independence from the Engineering Arm.

====[[Fire services in France|Firefighters]]====
[[File:BSPP section Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|right|''Sapeurs-pompiers de Paris'' ([[Paris Fire Brigade]]) on parade]]
The first fire company created by [[Napoleon|Napoléon I]] was a military sapper company of the [[French Imperial Guard]], created in 1810. This company was tasked with the protection of the Imperial palaces after the tragic fire of the Austrian embassy in Paris on July 1, 1810. The Paris Fire Service (''gardes-pompes''), a civilian institution, was re-organized as a military unit in September 1811, becoming the Paris Sappers-Firefighters Battalion. Other cities kept or created civilian firefighters services but used the military ranks and organization of the Paris Battalion. In 1831, [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] engineers companies became the reserve components of the Fire Services and kept their military organization even after the disappearance of the National Guard in 1852. Sapper-firefighter is the common title of the civilian and Paris firefighters in France, but the other military firefighters units, such as the [[Marseille Naval Fire Battalion]], do not use the sapper title, as they had no military engineers lineage.

====[[Pioneer (military)|Pioneers]]====
{{main article|Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)}}
Since the 18th century, every [[grenadier]] battalion in the [[French Army]] had a small unit of pioneers, sometimes called sappers-pioneers (''sapeurs-pionniers''). They had the mission to advance under enemy fire in order to destroy the obstacles drawn by the enemy and to clear the way for the rest of the [[infantry]]. The danger of such missions resulted in pioneers having short life expectancies. Because of this, the army allowed them certain privileges such as the authorization to wear [[beards]]. In addition to their beards and axes, they traditionally wear leather aprons and gloves.

The pioneers units disappeared during the mid-20th c. century, their last appearance being the short-lived Pioneers Regiments of 1939-1944, a military public works service using the older draftees in the army. Only the Foreign Legion kept using a pioneer unit, mainly for representation duty. The current pioneer unit of the Legion reintroduced the symbols of the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic]] pioneers : the beard, the axe, the leather apron, the crossed-axes insignia and the leather gloves. If the parades of the Legion are opened by this unit, it is to commemorate the traditional role of the pioneers "opening the way" for the troops. The pioneer unit is made up for parades of selected men taken in both the Infantry and the Engineers regiments of the Legion.

=== Greece ===

In the [[Hellenic Army]], there is the "mechanic" or "Corps of Engineers" (μηχανικό; ''michaniko'').{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

===Italy===
The Italian Army uses the term "Guastatori" for its combat engineers, "Pionieri" for its construction engineers, "Pontieri" for its bridging engineers, and "Ferrovieri" for its railroad engineers.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, the term "sapper" is used both in the military and in the civilian environment.bIn the [[Portuguese Army]], a ''sapador de engenharia'' (engineering sapper) is a soldier of the engineer branch that has specialized combat engineer training. A ''sapador de infantaria'' (infantry sapper) is a soldier of the infantry branch that has a similar training and that usually serves in the combat support sapper platoon of an infantry battalion. A ''sapador NBQ'' (NBC sapper) is an engineer branch soldier specialized in [[nuclear, biological and chemical warfare]].

The ''bombeiros-sapadores'' ("sapper-firefighters") are the civil municipal professional firefighters that exist in the main cities of the country. The largest unit of this type is the ''Regimento de Bombeiros Sapadores'' ("sapper-firefighters regiment") maintained by the [[Lisbon]] municipal council. The ''sapadores florestais'' (forest sappers) are the professionals maintained by the [[Government of Portugal|government]], local authorities and large private forestry companies, who cleans and maintain forests and prevents and fights [[forest fire]]s.

===Pakistan Army===
In the [[Pakistan Army]], sapper officers perform combat and normal engineer duties. The Corps is led by [[Engineer-in-Chief]] who is a [[Lt Gen]]. The current [[Engineer-in-Chief]] is [[Lt Gen]] Khalid Asghar. The [[Frontier Works Organization]], [[Military Engineering Service]] and the [[Survey of Pakistan]] is part of the corps. Initially part of the [[Indian Corps of Engineers]], it dates back to 1780 but came to its modern form in 1947 following the Independence of [[Pakistan]]. Since then it has taken part in all wars including [[1965 War]], [[1971 War]] and [[Kargil War]]. It has completed the [[Pakistan]] portion of [[Karakoram Highway]]. The corps is taking part in [[Operation Zarb-e-Azb]]

=== United States Army ===
{{see also|Sapper Tab}}
[[File:COMBAT ENGINEER SETTING A CHARGE.jpg|thumb|upright|US combat engineer setting a charge in World War II]]

In the [[United States Army]], sappers are combat engineers who support the front-line [[infantry]], and they have fought in every war in U.S. history. For example, after the [[Siege of Yorktown|Battle of Yorktown]], General Washington cited [[Louis Lebègue Duportail]], the Chief of Engineers, for conduct which afforded "brilliant proofs of his military genius."

Designation as a sapper nowadays is earned as an additional proficiency.  The U.S. Army authorizes four skill tabs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apd.army.mil/jw2/xmldemo/r670_1/main.asp#p029-1 AR 670-1: Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716141913/http://www.apd.army.mil/jw2/xmldemo/r670_1/main.asp#p029-1 |date=16 July 2011 }} U.S. Army, revised: 11 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; for permanent wear above the unit patch on the left shoulder (Army Regulation 670-1 Chapter 29-13, Sub-Paragraph f).  Along with the [[Sapper Tab]], the [[Special Forces Tab]], the [[Ranger Tab]], and the [[President's Hundred Tab]] identify soldiers who have passed a demanding course of military instruction and demonstrated their competence in particular specialities and skills.

To wear the Sapper Tab, a soldier must graduate from the sapper leader course which is operated by the U.S. Army Engineer School at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]], [[Missouri]]. The sapper leader course is a 28-day course designed to train joint-service leaders in small unit tactics, leadership skills, and tactics required to perform as part of a combined arms team.  The course is open to enlisted soldiers in the grades of E-4 (P) (in the army, specialist on the list for promotion to sergeant) E-5, and above, cadets, and officers O-3 (army captain) and below. Students can come from any combat or combat support branch of the service, but priority is given to engineer, cavalry, and infantry soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.wood.army.mil/sapper/course.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909052300/http://www.wood.army.mil/sapper/course.htm |archivedate=9 September 2006 |title=Sapper Course |publisher=US Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PAVN and Viet Cong ===
[[File:sapperorg.jpg|thumb|right|Sapper formation- PAVN/Viet Cong]]

[[Vietnam People's Army|PAVN (People's Army of Vietnam)]] and [[Viet Cong]] sappers, as they were called by US forces, are better described as [[commando]] units. The Vietnamese term ''đặc công'' can be literally translated as "special task". Thousands of specially trained elite fighters served in the PAVN and Viet Cong commando–sapper units which were organized as independent formations. While not always successful due to lack of appropriate personal weapon types for combat and assault like other [[special forces]], at times they inflicted heavy damage against their enemies. They have been armed with various types of bombs, mines, explosive charges, grenades and even steel-pellet mines which were much more devastating than the U.S. [[M18 Claymore anti-personnel mine|M18 Claymore]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and are still the main weapons of the ''đặc công''.

These elite units served as raiders against American/[[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] troops, and infiltrated spearheads during the final [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]] in 1975, where they seized key road and bridge assets, destroyed installations, attacked command and control nodes located deep inside enemy territory, planted explosives on U.S. water craft, and otherwise helped the PAVN's rapid mobile forces advance. A typical PAVN/VC ''đặc công'' organization is shown in the diagram. The raiding force was usually grouped into assault teams, each broken down into several 3–5 man assault cells. Overall, there were generally four operational [[Echelon formation|echelons]].&lt;ref&gt;Ott 1975, pp.1–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

An instance of a successful sapper attack conducted by the Viet Cong was the during the Battle of [[Battle of FSB Mary Ann|Fire Base Mary Ann]]. A small number of sappers, through surprise, conducted a successful attack on a superior US force. The battle was described as a "rampage of VC who threw satchels at the command bunker, knifed Americans in their sleep and destroyed all communications equipment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Sappers_in_the_Wire.html?id=e9wUAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Sappers in the Wire: The Life and Death of Firebase Mary Ann|last=Nolan|first=Keith William|date=2007|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|isbn=9781585446438|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ottoman Empire ===
The [[Ottoman Empire]] had an infantry corp named ''Lağımcılar Ocağı'' (Tr: [https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C4%9F%C4%B1mc%C4%B1_Oca%C4%9F%C4%B1]) (literally: ''Sapper Corps''). These infantries were used in most of the Empire's sieges, demolishing enemy fortifications and defences.

== Honours ==
Sapper Island, St. Joseph Channel, [[Algoma District, Ontario]] was named in honour of sappers, especially those who graduated from the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ontariohistory1011ontauoft/ontariohistory1011ontauoft_djvu.txt Ontario History, Papers and Records, Vol. X], Ontario Historical Society, 1913. Retrieved 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
In the 1978 song by Australian rock band [[Cold Chisel]], "[[Khe Sanh (song)|Khe Sanh]]", the narrator (a fictional Australian army [[Vietnam War]] veteran) says "I left my heart to the sappers round Khe Sanh". However, the only sappers or combat engineers present at the historical [[Battle of Khe Sanh]] belonged to US, [[South Vietnam]]ese and (opposing) [[North Vietnam]]ese units.

A '''target tug''' is an [[aircraft]] which tows an unmanned [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], a fabric [[drogue]] or other kind of [[wiktionary:target|target]], for the purposes of [[gun]] or [[missile]] target practice. Target tugs are often conversions of transport and utility aircraft, as well as obsolescent combat types. Some, such as the [[Miles Martinet]], were specially designed for the role. It was, and is, a relatively hazardous job, as [[Live fire exercise|live fire]] is typically employed and the people doing the shooting are usually still in training.

==History==
===World War 2===
[[File:IWM ATP 12826D.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boulton Paul Defiant]] TT Mk III target tug, number ''N1697''; [[RAF Desford]], May 1944. Note the wind-driven generator that provided power for the target winch]]
Prior to and during [[World War II]] target tugs were typically operated by the [[Air Force|air arms]] on behalf of which they flew, and were usually conversions of aircraft that had failed in combat or that were otherwise unsuitable or obsolete in their design roles (see [[Fairey Battle]] and [[Short Sturgeon]]). These aircraft typically trailed a [[drogue]] fabric sleeve at the end of a several-thousand metre long cable. Student [[fighter pilot]]s or [[air gunner]]s would shoot at the target from other aircraft using painted bullets so that hits could be recorded and later analysed.

In the RAF, [[Miles Master]] IIs were used for this purpose as part of the Target Towing Flight at the Central Gunnery School whilst the School was based at [[RAF Sutton Bridge]] from April 1942 to March 1944. Other aircraft used in this role were the [[Hawker Henley]], the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]] and the [[Westland Lysander]], although the [[RAF]] was by no means the only air arm to use target tugs. They were used by most air forces. The USAAF used older aircraft such as the [[TBD Devastator]] as target tugs, and the Luftwaffe and the VVS (Red Army) also used them.

The chief modifications to the aircraft were a station for the [[drogue]] operator and a winch to reel in the cable prior to landing. The winch was typically powered by a small [[wind-turbine]] on the outside of the aircraft, driven by the airflow and attached to the winch via a [[clutch]]. Such devices are still used by some [[aerial refueling tanker]]s to retract the refueling hose after the operation is completed. The drogue would often be jettisoned at some location convenient for recovery prior to the aircraft's landing. The drogue itself caused a great deal of drag and could be dangerous, particularly to less-powerful aircraft. If the engine failed, the drag from the drogue could be enough to reduce the airspeed of the aircraft below [[stall speed]] before the drogue could be jettisoned (see [[Hawker Henley]]).

===Post-War===
[[File:Fairey Firefly TT.1 SE-CAW Svensk Flyg RWY 09.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Fairey Firefly TT.1 target tug, painted mustard yellow, of Svensk Flygtjanst at [[Manchester Airport|Manchester (Ringway Airport)]] in 1955]] 
The use of such aircraft continued post-war, although a trend developed whereby ex-military aircraft were purchased, modified and operated by civilian companies under contract. Deutsche-Luftfahrt Beratungsdienst of [[West Germany]] and Svensk Flygtjänst AB of [[Sweden]] were two notable companies in the field in the post-war years, operating such types as the [[Hawker Sea Fury]], [[Fairey Firefly]] and [[Douglas Skyraider]]. Many air arms however continued to operate target tugs on their own behalf.

In later years the use of civilian companies expanded significantly worldwide, with many companies forming or entering the field in the 1960s and 1970s. The trend was still to use ex-military aircraft, for example Fawcett Aviation in [[Australia]] used two ex-[[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[North American Mustang|CAC Mustangs]] from 1960 until the latter part of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Mustangs of the RAAF and RNZAF'' Peter N. Anderson. A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed. {{ISBN|0-589-07130-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Flight Systems Inc. commenced operations at [[Mojave, California]] with [[Canadair Sabre]]s converted as QF-86E missile targets, the first aircraft making its first unmanned flight in April 1975; this company later also operated Sabres as target tugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://f-86.tripod.com/fsi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2002-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020403005249/http://f-86.tripod.com/fsi.html |archivedate=2002-04-03 |df= }} Retrieved 2007-07-18&lt;/ref&gt; Flight Systems Inc was later purchased by [[Tracor]] and these operations are still performed by [[BAE Systems Inc.|BAE Systems Flight Systems]] with [[Douglas A-4|Douglas Skyhawks]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landings.com Online search of US civil aircraft register database performed July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of using ex-military aircraft as target tugs (and of air arms retaining older aircraft themselves for such use) resulted in them surviving into an era where such aircraft became desirable as [[Warbird]]s; many former target tugs are now to be found on the [[airshow]] circuit or under restoration to fly, and in aviation museums.

==Current usage==
[[File:Dassault.falcon20.g-frak.arp.jpg|thumb|FR Aviation Services Dassault Falcon 20 modified for target towing at the 2006 [[Royal International Air Tattoo]]]]
Today, more air arms have turned to civilian companies for provision of target towing services. Many companies operating in this field today do so using modified [[corporate jet]] aircraft instead of ex-military aircraft. Advantages of operating civil aircraft types include ease of registration (it being difficult in many countries to register ex-military jets as civil aircraft), ease of maintenance and lower operating costs when compared to ex-military aircraft. Companies active in 2007 providing target towing services include [[Cobham plc|FR Aviation Services Ltd.]] in the [[UK]] and associated companies AVdef (in [[France]]) and Falcon Special Air Services (in [[Malaysia]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fraviation.com/about.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528160229/http://www.fraviation.com/about.aspx |archivedate=2007-05-28 |df= }} Retrieved 2007-07-18&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Dassault Falcon 20|Falcon 20s]]; [[Pel-Air]] in [[Australia]] using [[Gates Learjet|Learjets]] and (in something of a reversal of recent trends) EIS Aircraft Gmbh in [[Germany]] using [[Pilatus PC-9]] aircraft.

'''Time Unit Box System''' ('''TUBS''') is a simple system for notating events that happen over a period. This system is mostly used for notating [[rhythm]]s in [[music]]. The notation consists of one or more rows of boxes; each box represents a fixed unit of time. Blank boxes indicate that nothing happens during that interval, while a mark in a box indicates that an event occurs at the start of that time interval.

TUBS is most useful for showing relationships between complex rhythms, such as [[polyrhythm]]s, that would be difficult to see in traditional [[musical notation]]. TUBS also has the advantage that non-musicians can interpret it much more easily than musical notation, because of its simplicity.

It was originally used by [[Musicology|musicologists]] Philip Harland and James Koetting to notate polyrhythms in [[African music]]. However, [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] composer Bak Yeon(박연)'s invention of similar but unrelated notation ''jeongganbo''(정간보, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060314223120/http://www.koreandb.net/KMusic/Pic/Klp011.jpg image]) to notate [[Korean court music]] dates back to middle of the 15th century.

TUBS notation has been adapted by several people; the most common adaptations use different symbols in the boxes to represent different sounds, for example different ways of hitting a drum or even different musical pitches. In fact, [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] notation is essentially TUBS rotated by 90 degrees.

== Examples ==
Below is an example in TUBS, followed by a similar representation in traditional music notation.

    { \voiceTwo r8 f, r f f f16 f f f r8 }
&gt;&gt; }
&lt;/score&gt;

Below is an example of an adapted TUBS score depicting a percussion pattern for multiple instruments. One benefit with the TUBS system is that it clearly relates WHICH drum is to be struck (as the symbol will be solid, hollow, etc. uniquely for each drum) as opposed to different drums being notated via a different line of the musical staff, which can be more difficult to see. More importantly, the symbol used inside of each Time Unit Box relates how the drum is to be struck (open tone, slap, bass, rim-shot, etc.) which is not as easily conveyed with the musical staff notation.

The '''University of Forestry and Environmental Science  (Yezin)''' ({{lang-my|သစ်တောနှင့်ပတ်ဝန်းကျင်ဆိုင်ရာ တက္ကသိုလ် (ရေဆင်း)}}, {{IPA-my|θɪʔtɔ́ tɛʔkəθò (jèzɪ́ɴ)|pron}}), in [[Yezin]] near [[Nay Pyi Taw]], is the only  [[university]] specialized in [[forestry]] in Myanmar. It mainly offers a five-year [[Bachelor of Science]] degree program in forestry as well as two-year master's and three-year doctoral programs. The university is administered by the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (Myanmar)|Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation]] and is affiliated with the Forest Research Institute (FRI), a government R&amp;D agency. Undergraduate students are required to take part in a field training program each winter. Graduates of the university typically become forestry officers at the Forestry Department, the Dry Zone Greening Department or the Myanmar Timber Enterprise.

==History==
Forestry education in Myanmar was first offered in [[Yangon University]] since 1920 and the first batch graduated in 1925. In 1982, the forestry study was moved to the Yezin campus, under the purview of the Department of Forestry at the [[Yezin Agricultural University|Yezin Institute of Agriculture]]. In 1992, the Forestry Department was carved out and founded as the '''Institute of Forestry (Yezin)'''. In 2002, it was renamed the '''University of Forestry (Yezin).''' The Bachelor of Science (Forestry) B.Sc. (Forestry) degree program used to take six years to complete; it has since been changed to five years program and recently rescheduled to be 6-year program starting 2014.

==Admissions==
The annual intake of students has always been low. Up to 2005, the intake was only 50.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes13-255/e003.htm | title=A Golden Land of golden opportunities | author=Minh Zaw | date=2005-02-21 | publisher=The Myanmar Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; No female students were admitted until 1995. Even now, female students make up just 5% to 10% of each incoming class; male candidates are given priority.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

'''Value engineering''' ('''VE''') is a systematic method to improve the "value" of goods or products and services by using an examination of function. Value, as defined, is the ratio of function to [[cost]]. Value can therefore be manipulated by either improving the function or reducing the [[cost]]. It is a primary tenet of value engineering that basic functions be preserved and not be reduced as a consequence of pursuing value improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.value-eng.org/pdf_docs/monographs/vmstd.pdf |title=Value Methodology Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319204415/http://www.value-eng.org/pdf_docs/monographs/vmstd.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning behind value engineering is as follows: if marketers expect a product to become practically or stylistically obsolete within a specific length of time, they can design it to only last for that specific lifetime. The products could be built with higher-grade components, but with value engineering they are not because this would impose an unnecessary cost on the manufacturer, and to a limited extent also an increased cost on the purchaser. Value engineering will reduce these costs. A company will typically use the least expensive components that satisfy the product's lifetime projections. 

Due to the very short life spans, however, which is often a result of this "value engineering technique", [[planned obsolescence]] has become associated with product deterioration and inferior quality. [[Vance Packard]] once claimed this practice gave engineering as a whole a bad name, as it directed creative engineering energies toward short-term market ends. Philosophers such as [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Jacque Fresco]] have also criticized the economic and societal implications of this model.
Value engineering is the structural and analytical process that seeks to achieve the value for money.For instance, [[Mousakhani]] and his friends state that the usage of VE (Value Engineering) in the project management of road construction definitely enhances the value of these types of projects&lt;ref&gt;https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JEDT-12-2015-0083?fullSc=1&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Value engineering began at [[General Electric Co.]] during [[World War II]]. Because of the war, there were shortages of skilled labour, raw materials, and component parts. [[Lawrence D. Miles|Lawrence Miles]], Jerry Leftow, and Harry Erlicher at G.E. looked for acceptable substitutes. They noticed that these substitutions often reduced costs, improved the product, or both. What started out as an accident of necessity was turned into a systematic process. They called their technique "value analysis".

==Description==
Value engineering is sometimes taught within the [[project management]] or [[industrial engineering]] body of knowledge as a technique in which the value of a system’s outputs is [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]] by crafting a mix of performance (function) and costs. In most cases this practice identifies and removes unnecessary expenditures, thereby increasing the value for the manufacturer and/or their customers.

VE follows a structured thought process that is based exclusively on "function", i.e. what something "does" not what it is. For example a screw driver that is being used to stir a can of paint has a "function" of mixing the contents of a paint can and not the original connotation of securing a screw into a screw-hole. In value engineering "functions" are always described in a two word abridgment consisting of an active verb and measurable noun (what is being done – the verb – and what it is being done to – the noun) and to do so in the most non-prescriptive way possible. In the screw driver and can of paint example, the most basic function would be "blend liquid" which is less prescriptive than "stir paint" which can be seen to limit the action (by stirring) and to limit the application (only considers paint). This is the basis of what value engineering refers to as "function analysis".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title= The Value Methodology Standard |date=August 2007|publisher= SAVE International| url = http://www.value-eng.org/catalog_monographs.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Value engineering uses rational logic (a unique "how" - "why" questioning technique) and the analysis of function to identify relationships that increase value.  It is considered a quantitative method similar to the scientific method, which focuses on hypothesis-conclusion approaches to test relationships, and operations research, which uses model building to identify predictive relationships.

==Legal terminology==
In the United States, value engineering is specifically mandated for federal agencies by section 4306 of the [[Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996#National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996|National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ106/pdf/PLAW-104publ106.pdf National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996], Public Law 104-106, accessed 4 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 et seq.):
:“Each [[executive agency]] shall establish and maintain cost-effective value engineering procedures and processes".
:"As used in this section, the term ‘value engineering’ means an analysis of the functions of a program, project, system, product, item of equipment, building, facility, service, or supply of an executive agency, performed by qualified agency or contractor personnel, directed at improving performance, reliability, quality, safety, and life cycle costs".

==Load transfer==
In wheeled [[vehicle]]s, '''load transfer''' is the measurable change of [[Structural load|load]] borne by different wheels during [[acceleration]] (both longitudinal and lateral).&lt;ref name=Pacejka/&gt; This includes [[Brake|braking]], and deceleration (which is an acceleration at a negative rate).&lt;ref name=Jazar&gt;{{cite book

No motion of the center of mass relative to the wheels is necessary, and so load transfer may be experienced by vehicles with no suspension at all. Load transfer is a crucial concept in understanding [[vehicle dynamics]]. The same is true in bikes, though only longitudinally.&lt;ref name=Cossalter/&gt;

==Cause==
The major [[force]]s that accelerate a vehicle occur at the [[tire]]s' [[contact patch]]es.  Since these forces are not directed through the vehicle's CoM, one or more [[Moment (physics)|moments]] are generated whose forces are the tires' traction forces at pavement level, the other one (equal but opposed) is the mass inertia located at the CoM and the moment arm is the distance from pavement surface to CoM. It is these moments that cause variation in the load distributed between the tires.  Often this is interpreted by the casual [[observation|observer]] as a pitching or rolling motion of the vehicles body.  A perfectly rigid vehicle without suspension that would not exhibit pitching or rolling of the body still undergoes load transfer. However, the pitching and rolling of the body of a non-rigid vehicle adds some (small) [[#Weight transfer|weight transfer]] due to the (small) CoM horizontal displacement with respect to the wheel's axis suspension vertical travel and also due to deformation of the tires i.e. contact patch displacement relative to wheel.

Lowering the CoM towards the ground is one method of reducing load transfer.  As a result load transfer is reduced in both the longitudinal and lateral directions.  Another method of reducing load transfer is by increasing the wheel spacings. Increasing the vehicle's [[wheelbase]] (length) reduces longitudinal load transfer while increasing the vehicle's [[Axle track|track]] (width) reduces lateral load transfer. Most high performance automobiles are designed to sit as low as possible and usually have an extended wheelbase and track.

One way to calculate the effect of load transfer, keeping in mind that this article uses "load transfer" to mean the phenomenon commonly referred to as "weight transfer" in the automotive world, is with the so-called "weight transfer equation":

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta Weight_{front} = a\frac{h}{b}m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Delta Weight_{front} = \frac{a}{g} \frac{h}{b}w&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta Weight_{front}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in load borne by the front wheels, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the longitudinal acceleration, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration of gravity]], &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass height, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the wheelbase, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the total vehicle mass, and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the total vehicle weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Weight transfer involves the ''actual'' (relatively small) movement of the vehicle CoM relative to the wheel axes due to displacement of the [[chassis]] as the suspension complies, or of cargo or liquids within the vehicle, which results in a redistribution of the total vehicle load between the individual tires.

==Center of mass==
Weight transfer occurs as the vehicle's CoM shifts during automotive maneuvers.  Acceleration causes the [[sprung mass]] to rotate about a geometric axis resulting in relocation of the CoM. Front-back weight transfer is proportional to the change in the longitudinal location of the CoM to the vehicle's wheelbase, and side-to-side weight transfer (summed over front and rear) is proportional to the ratio of the change in the CoM's lateral location to the vehicle's track.

Liquids, such as fuel, readily flow within their containers, causing changes in the vehicle's CoM. As fuel is consumed, not only does the position of the CoM change, but the total weight of the vehicle is also reduced.

By way of example, when a vehicle accelerates, a weight transfer toward the rear wheels can occur. An outside [[observation|observer]] might witness this as the vehicle visibly leans to the back, or [[Suspension (vehicle)#Anti-dive and anti-squat|squats]]. Conversely, under braking, weight transfer toward the front of the car can occur. Under hard braking it might be clearly visible even from inside the vehicle as the nose [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Brake dive|dives]] toward the ground (most of this will be due to load transfer). Similarly, during changes in direction (lateral acceleration), weight transfer to the outside of the direction of the turn can occur.

'''Weight transfer''' is generally of far less practical importance than [[load transfer]], for cars and SUVs at least. For instance in a 0.9g turn, a car with a track of 1650&amp;nbsp;mm and a CoM height of 550&amp;nbsp;mm will see a load transfer of 30% of the vehicle weight, that is the outer wheels will see 60% more load than before, and the inners 60% less. Total available grip will drop by around 6% as a result of this load transfer. At the same time, the CoM of the vehicle will typically move laterally and vertically, relative to the [[contact patch]] by no more than 30&amp;nbsp;mm, leading to a weight transfer of less than 2%, and a corresponding reduction in grip of 0.01%.

==Traction==
Load transfer causes the available [[traction (engineering)|traction]] at all four wheels to vary as the car brakes, accelerates, or turns. This bias to one pair of tires doing more "work" than the other pair results in a net loss of total available traction.  The net loss can be attributed to the phenomenon known as [[tire load sensitivity]].

An exception is during positive acceleration when the engine power is driving two or fewer wheels.  In this situation where all the tires are not being utilized load transfer can be advantageous.  As such, the most powerful cars are almost never [[front wheel drive]], as the acceleration itself causes the front wheels' traction to decrease. This is why sports cars usually have either [[rear wheel drive]] or [[all wheel drive]] (and in the all wheel drive case, the power tends to be biased toward the rear wheels under normal conditions).

==Rollover==
If (lateral) load transfer reaches the tire loading on one end of a vehicle, the inside wheel on that end will lift, causing a change in handling characteristic.  If it reaches half the weight of the vehicle it will start to roll over.  Some large trucks will roll over before skidding, while passenger vehicles and small trucks usually roll over only when they leave the road.  Fitting racing tires to a tall or narrow vehicle and then driving it hard may lead to rollover.
