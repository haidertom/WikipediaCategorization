[[File:Alice Springs Desrt Park Kangaroo.jpg|thumb|A kangaroo at the Alice Springs Desert Park]]
The '''Alice Springs Desert Park''' is an [[environmental education]] facility in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]].

It is sited on {{Convert|1300|ha|acre|0}}, with a core area of {{Convert|52|ha|acre|0}}. It is an institutional member of the [[Zoo and Aquarium Association]] (ZAA) and [[Botanic Gardens Conservation International]] (BGCI).

The park contains native animals and plants representative of [[central Australian]] [[desert]] environments, and contributes to their [[conservation ethic|conservation]] through research programs as well as through public education. It offers people the opportunity to experience the variety of the deserts of central Australia, exploring the inter-relationships between the plants, animals and people.

The area is culturally important to the local [[Arrernte people]]. Much of the work of the park is under the auspices of their ''apmereke-artweye'' (decision-makers) and ''kwertengerle'' (caretakers) - people once known as the park's traditional owners.&lt;ref name="park_values"/&gt;&lt;ref name="park_relationship_to_land"/&gt;

==Exhibits and facilities==

The park contains three separate walk-through desert habitat areas accessed through a {{Convert|1.6|km|0|sing=on}} trail: Desert Rivers, Sand Country, and Woodland. In addition, it has a Nocturnal House and a Nature theatre. The entrance area includes an exhibition center, rest rooms, and cafe.&lt;ref name="frommers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="park_map"/&gt;

;Desert Rivers

In this habitat, visitors walk through dry river beds,and areas that have been flooded, and past swamps and water holes. The plants here include river red gums, coolibah trees, aquatic plants, and reeds. Animals in this habitat include finches, cockatoos, water birds, frogs, and fish. Demonstrations here show how the aboriginal people use this habitat to harvest food and medicine.&lt;ref name="park_desert_rivers"/&gt;

;Sand Country

This exhibit is a re-creation of the sandy desert including clay, gypsum, and salt pans.&lt;ref name="park_map"/&gt;

;Nocturnal house
[[File:A232, Alice Springs Desert Park, Alice Springs, Australia, thorny devil, 2007.JPG|thumb|right|[[Thorny dragon]], also known as thorny devil (''Moloch horridus'')]]
The Nocturnal House is located between the Sand Country and Woodland habitats, and is home to many Central Australian reptiles, invertebrates, birds, and mammals that are active during the night. The collection includes some reptiles that may be active during the day but difficult to find in the desert.&lt;ref name="park_map"/&gt;&lt;ref name="park_nocturnal_house"/&gt;

;Woodland

The Woodland habitat includes enclosures for [[kangaroo]]s and [[emu]]s.&lt;ref name="park_map"/&gt; Visitors can walk among the kangaroos in their exhibit area.&lt;ref name="frommers"/&gt;

;Nature Theatre

Presentations at the Nature Theatre show visitors some of the animals that might be seen while walking through the park, including demonstrations with free-flying birds of prey.&lt;ref name="park_nature_theatre"/&gt;

;Aboriginal Survival

Presentations at the park, include information on Aboriginal Survival one focusing on water gathering and another on food gathering.  The food gathering presentation is particularly focused on the Arrernte People and includes information on sex roles, with the distinct jobs of men and women.  Information on kinship focuses on Arrernte Skin names and the rules for relations ships built around the skin name groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Relationships|url=http://www.alicespringsdesertpark.com.au/kids/culture/relationships.shtml|publisher=Alice Springs Desert Park

The AIAMC was formed in 1989 to provide a forum for those institutions whose governance and academic leadership were distinct from that of their associated medical schools.  Since that time, the organization’s prestige and influence have grown progressively.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Meetings. [http://meetingsnet.com/medicalmeetings/news/3-ways-aiamc-changed-up-its-annual-conference-0419/.] "3 Ways AIAMC Changed Up Its Annual Conference."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is considered a national resource, with Alliance members participating in leadership and governance roles in key groups as the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]], [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education|ACCME]], [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], [[American Hospital Association|AHA]], [[American Medical Association|AMA]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/history.php AIAMC History.] "AIAMC."&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Initiative to Improve Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education ==
===National Initiative I===
In early 2007, the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers (AIAMC) launched Improving Patient Care through Graduate Medical Education: A National Initiative of Independent Academic Medical Centers. Nineteen AIAMC-member institutions participated in this charter effort. The National Initiative (NI) featured five meetings over the course of 18 months which served as touchstones for ongoing quality improvement in AIAMC participating organizations. These meetings, as well as the monthly collaborative calls held in-between, provided structure, discussion and networking opportunities around specific quality improvement initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;ACGME. [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928070626/http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/bulletin/bulletin11_07.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} ''ACGME Bulletin.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This 18-month "NI-I" was supported by a grant from the foundation of [[HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education]], an AIAMC member institution located in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;AIAMC. [http://www.aiamc.org/ni-overview.php National Initiative Overview.] ''AIAMC.''&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by Carl Patow, MD, Executive Director of HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education. 

As a result of these efforts, AIAMC has initial findings that demonstrate the efficacy of integrating GME into patient safety and quality improvement initiatives. These findings have been organized into a series of articles that were published in the December 2009 issue of Academic Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1749–56 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181bf686f |title=Integrating Quality Improvement and Residency Education: Insights from the AIAMC National Initiative About the Roles of the Designated Institutional Official and Program Director |year=2009 |last1=Jenson |first1=Hal B. |last2=Dorner |first2=Douglas |last3=Hinchey |first3=Kevin |last4=Ankel |first4=Felix |last5=Goldman |first5=Stuart |last6=Patow |first6=Carl |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=84 |issue=12 |pmid=19940584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative II===
In 2009, AIAMC launched the second National Initiative and expanded participation to 35 AIAMC-member teaching hospitals from Seattle to Maine.  Each participating hospital developed a quality improvement team led by a resident or faculty member, and included their respective quality improvement leader. These teams met four times and participated in monthly conference calls over an 18-month period. Quality improvement projects focused on the following areas: Communication, Hand Offs, Infection Control, Readmissions and Transitions of Care. The objectives of this second phase were: 
* to align and integrate academic programs with quality initiatives to accelerate the efforts of quality and patient safety;
* assist residency program directors and house staff in the teaching, learning and assessment of the core competencies focused on Practice-Based Learning and Systems Based Practice;
* inform hospital and policy leaders about the contributions that can be made by faculty and house staff in expediting patient safety; and
* integrate house staff into multidisciplinary team-based safety initiatives as a national priority.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Harris. [https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb11/174758/residents_quality_improvement.html] "Residents Help Drive Quality Improvement". 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Initiative III===
National Initiative III launched in the fall of 2011, and will directly address the ACGME Common Program Requirements for Professionalism, Personal Responsibility and Patient Safety by educating program directors, faculty members and residents in a train-the-trainer approach. The structure and content of NI III will also meet directives for Teamwork by providing training in effective communication as part of inter-professional teams. The structure of the National Initiative III will resemble the previous two initiatives, with quarterly meetings for quality improvement didactics and leadership training, conference calls to assess progress, and local hospital team initiatives to improve patient care.

===National Initiative IV===
The fourth National Initiative recognized the importance of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education initiative entitled the "Clinical Learning Environment Review".  Teams from over 35 teaching hospitals across the United States participated in a two year learning collaborative to improve performance in six focus areas: patient safety, quality imrpvoement, transitions of care, supervision, fatigue management and professionalism. 

===National Initiative V===
National Initiative V began in 2015, and focused on the role of teaching hospitals' response to health care disparities. Findings from the National Initiatives are published in the Oschner Journal.

The '''''Benezit Dictionary of Artists''''' (in [[French language|French]], ''Bénézit: Dictionnaire des peintres, sculpteurs, dessinateurs et graveurs'') is an extensive publication of bibliographical information on [[painters]], [[sculptors]], [[designers]] and [[engraving|engravers]] created primarily for art museums, auction houses, historians and dealers. It was published by [[Éditions Gründ]] in [[Paris]] but has been sold to [[Oxford University Press]].

First published in the [[French language]] in three volumes between 1911 and 1923, the [[dictionary]] was put together by [[Emmanuel Bénézit]] (1854–1920) and a team of international specialists with assistance from his son the painter [[Emmanuel-Charles Bénézit]] (1887–1975), and daughter Marguerite Bénézit. After the elder Bénézit's death the editors were [[Edmond-Henri Zeiger-Viallet]] (1895–1994) and the painter [[Jacques Busse]] (1922–2004), the younger Bénézit having already left Paris and moved to Provence. The next edition was an eight-volume set published between 1948 and 1955, followed by a ten-volume set in 1976 and a 14-volume set in 1999. In 2006, an English-language edition was published for the first time. A 14-volume set, it has more than 20,000 pages, with over 170,000 entries. 

==Online biographies==
Since 2011, for a fee, the content of the ''Benezit'' can be accessed online at [[Oxford Art Online]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/ Oxford Art Online] {{small|{{Subscription or membership required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free access is available for members of some UK public libraries.

The '''[[biological monitoring]] working party''' ('''BMWP''') is a procedure for measuring [[water quality]] using families of [[macroinvertebrate]]s as [[biological indicator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawkes|first1=H.A|title=Origin and development of the biological monitoring working party score system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135497002753|journal=Water Research|accessdate=28 July 2016|doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(97)00275-3|volume=32|pages=964–968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method is based on the principle that different [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[invertebrate]]s have different tolerances to [[pollutant]]s. In the case of BMWP, this is based on the sensitivity/tolerance to [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollution]] (i.e. nutrient enrichment that can affect the availability of [[dissolved oxygen]]). It is important to recognise that the ranking of sensitivity/tolerance will vary for different kinds of pollution. In the case of BMWP/Organic pollution rankings, the presence of [[mayfly|mayflies]] or [[stonefly|stoneflies]] for instance indicate the cleanest waterways and are given a tolerance score of 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nethan-valley.co.uk/insectgroups.doc  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212185438/http://www.nethan-valley.co.uk/insectgroups.doc |date=December 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest scoring invertebrates are worms (''Oligochaeta'') which score 1. The number of different macroinvertebrates is also an important factor, because a better quality water  is assumed to contain fewer pollutants that would exclude "sensitive" species - resulting in a higher diversity.

[[Kick sampling]], where a net is placed downstream from the sampler and the river bed is agitated with the foot for a given period of time (the standard is 3 minutes), is employed. Any macroinvertebrates caught in the net are stored and preserved with an alcohol solution, and identified to the [[family (biology)|family]] level, this can be done with the live organisms as well.

The BMWP score equals the sum of the tolerance scores of all macroinvertebrate families in the sample. A higher BMWP score is considered to reflect a better water quality. Alternatively, also the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) score is calculated. The ASPT equals the average of the tolerance scores of all macroinvertebrate families found, and ranges from 0 to 10. The main difference between both indices is that ASPT does not depend on the family richness. Once BMWP and ASPT are calculated, the Lincoln Quality Index (LQI) is used to assess the water quality in the Anglian Water Authority area.

Other indices that can be used to assess water quality are the [[Chandler Score]], the [[Trent Biotic Index]] and the ''Rapid Bioassessment Protocols''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, M.T., J. Gerritsen, B.D. Snyder, and J.B. Stribling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24644">'''Body schema''' is a concept used in several disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[sports medicine]], and [[robotics]]. The neurologist [[Henry Head|Sir Henry Head]] originally defined it as a postural model of the body that actively organizes and modifies 'the impressions produced by incoming sensory impulses in such a way that the final sensation of [body] position, or of locality, rises into consciousness charged with a relation to something that has happened before'.&lt;ref name = "Head2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Head |first= H.|year= 1920|title=Studies in Neurology. Vol 2.|publisher= London: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a postural model that keeps track of limb position, it plays an important role in control of action. It involves aspects of both central (brain processes) and peripheral ([[Sensory system|sensory]], [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]]) systems.  Thus, a body schema can be considered the collection of processes that registers the posture of one's body parts in space. The schema is updated during body movement. This is typically a non-conscious process, and is used primarily for spatial organization of action. It is therefore a pragmatic representation of the body’s spatial properties, which includes the length of [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s and limb segments, their arrangement, the configuration of the segments in space, and the shape of the body surface.&lt;ref name = "Haggard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haggard |first= P.|author2=D.

A clear differentiation of body schema from [[Body image (medicine)|body image]] has [[#Confusion with body image|developed gradually]].

==History==
[[Henry Head]], an English neurologist who conducted pioneering work into the somatosensory system and sensory nerves, together with British neurologist [[Gordon Morgan Holmes]], first described the concept in 1911.&lt;ref name = "Head"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/brain/34.2-3.102|last=Head |first= H.|author2=G. Holmes|title=Sensory disturbances from cerebral lesions|journal= Brain|year= 1911|volume= 34|issue=2–3|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was first termed "postural schema" to describe the disordered spatial representation of patients following damage to the [[parietal lobe]] of the brain. Head and Holmes discussed two schemas (or schemata): one body schema for the registration of posture or movement and another body schema for the localization of stimulated locations on the body surface. "Body schema" became the term used for the "organized models of ourselves".&lt;ref name = "Head"/&gt; The term and definition first suggested by Head and Holmes has endured nearly a century of research with clarifications as more has become known about [[neuroscience]] and the brain.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;[[File:Henry Head.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Henry Head, the pioneering English neurologist who first defined and used the term "body schema".]]

==Properties==
Neuroscientists Patrick Haggard and [[Daniel Mark Wolpert|Daniel Wolpert]] have identified seven fundamental properties of the body schema. It is spatially coded, [[Modularity|modular]], [[Adaptability|adaptable]], supramodal, coherent, [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]], and updated with [[Motion (physics)|movement]].&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;

===Spatial encoding===
The body schema represents both position and configuration of the body as a 3-dimensional object in space. A combination of sensory information, primarily [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] and [[Visual system|visual]], contributes to the representation of the limbs in space.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Macaluso"/&gt; This integration allows for [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] to be localized in external space with respect to the body.&lt;ref name = "Berti"/&gt; An example by Haggard and Wolpert shows the combination of tactile sensation of the hand with information about the joint angles of the arm, which allow for rapid movements of said arm to swat a fly.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;

===Modular===
The body schema is not represented wholly in a single [[List of regions in the human brain|region of the brain]].&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt; Recent [[fMRI]] (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) studies confirm earlier results. For example, the schema for feet and hands are coded by different regions of the brain, while the fingers are represented by a separate part entirely.&lt;ref name="Chaminade"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.04.026|author1=Chaminade, T. |author2=A. Meltzoff |author3=J. Decety  |last-author-amp=yes |title=An fMRI study of imitation: action representation and body schema|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2005|volume=43|issue=1|pages=115–127|pmid=15488911|pmc=3648209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptable===
[[Neuroplasticity|Plastic]] changes to the body schema are active and continuous. For example, gradual changes to the body schema must occur over the lifetime of an individual as he or she grows and absolute and relative sizes of body parts change over his or her life span.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt; The development of the body schema has also been shown to occur in young [[child]]ren. One study showed that with these children (9-, 14-, and 19-month-olds), older children handled spoons so as to optimally and comfortably grip them for use, whereas younger children tended to reach with their [[handedness|dominant]] hand, regardless of the orientation of the spoon and eventual ease of use.&lt;ref name = "Johnson2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(99)00063-3|last=Johnson |first=S.|title= Thinking ahead: the case for motor imagery in prospective judgements of prehension|journal= Cognition|year= 2000|volume= 74|issue=1|pages=33–70|pmid=10594309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term plasticity has been shown with the integration of tools into the body schema.&lt;ref name = "Carlson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; The [[Multisensory integration#Rubber hand illusion|rubber hand illusion]] has also shown the rapid reorganization of the body schema on the timescale of seconds, showing the high level of plasticity and speed with which the body schema reorganizes.&lt;ref name = "Lewis"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11097-010-9154-2|last=Lewis |first= E. |author2=D. M. Lloyd|title= Embodied experience: A first-person investigation of the rubber hand illusion|journal= Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|year= 2010|volume= 9|issue=3|pages=317–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Illusion, participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while their own hand is stroked identically. Participants may feel that the touches on their hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand.

===Supramodal===
By its nature, body schema integrates [[proprioception|proprioceptive]], (the sense of the relative position of neighbouring parts of one's body), and tactile information to maintain a three-dimensional body representation. However, other sensory information, particularly visual, can be in the same representation of the body. This simultaneous participation means there are combined representations within the body schema, which suggests the involvement of a process to translate primary information (e.g. visual, tactile, etc.) into a single [[stimulus modality|sensory modality]] or an abstract, amodal form.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;

===Coherent===
The body schema, to function properly, must be able to maintain coherent organization continuously.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt; To do so, it must be able to resolve any differences between sensory inputs. Resolving these inter-sensory inconsistencies can result in interesting sensations, such as those experienced during the Rubber Hand Illusion.&lt;ref name = "Lewis"/&gt;

===Interpersonal===
It is thought that an individual's body schema is used to represent both one's own body and the bodies of others. [[Mirror neurons]] are thought to play a role in the interpersonal characteristics of body schema. Interpersonal projection of one's body schema plays an important role in successfully imitating motions such as hand gestures, especially while maintaining the handedness and location of the gesture, but not necessarily copying the exact motion itself.&lt;ref name = "Chaminade"/&gt;

===Updated with movement===
A working body schema must be able to interactively track the movements and positions of body parts in space.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt; Neurons in the premotor cortex may contribute to this function. A class of neuron in the premotor cortex is multisensory. Each of these multisensory neurons responds to tactile stimuli and also to visual stimuli. The neuron has a tactile receptive field (responsive region on the body surface) typically on the face, arms, or hands. The same neuron also responds to visual stimuli in the space near the tactile receptive field. For example, if a neuron's tactile receptive field covers the arm, the same neuron will respond to visual stimuli in the space near the arm. As shown by [[Michael Graziano|Graziano]] and colleagues, the visual receptive field will update with arm movement, translating through space as the arm moves.&lt;ref name="Graziano&amp;etal2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Graziano, M.S.A. |author2=Hu, X.T. |author3=Gross, C.G |last-author-amp=yes | year=1997 | title=Coding the locations of objects in the dark | journal=Science | volume=277 | pages=239–241 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5323.239 | PMID=9211852 | issue=5323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graziano&amp;etal&amp;1994"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Graziano, M.S.A. | author-link=Michael Graziano | author2=Yap, G.S. | author3=Gross, C.G | last-author-amp=yes | year=1994 | title=Coding of visual space by premotor neurons | journal=Science | volume=266 | pages=1054–1057|doi=10.1126/science.7973661 | pmid=7973661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar body-part-centered neuronal receptive fields relate to the face. These neurons apparently monitor the location of body parts and the location of nearby objects with respect to body parts. Similar neuronal properties may also be important for the ability to incorporate external objects into the body schema, such as in tool use.

==Extended Body Schema==
The idea of the extended body schema is that, aside from the proprioceptive, visual, and sensory components that contribute to making a mental conception of one's body, the same processes that contribute to a body schema are also able to incorporate external objects into the mental conception of one's body. &lt;ref&gt;Aglioti et al., 1996. Disownership of left hand and objects related to it in a patient with right brain damage. NeuroReport. 8:293-296.&lt;/ref&gt; Part philosophical and part neuroscience, this concept builds upon the ideas of plasticity and adaptation to attempt to answer the question of where the body schema ends. 

There is debate as to whether this concept truly exists, with one side arguing that the body schema does not extend past the body and the other side believing otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, C. L., &amp; Farah, M. J. (1995). The psychological reality of the body schema: A test with normal participants. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 21(2), 334-343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto and Kitazawa. 2011. Reversal of subjective temporal order due to arm crossing. Nature Neuroscience 4: 759-765&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting Arguments===
The perspective shared by those who agree with the theory of the extended body schema follow reasoning in line with such that supports theories on [[Body_schema#Tool_use|tool use]]. 

In some studies, attempts at understanding tool assimilation are used to argue for the existence of the extended body schema. In an experiment involving the use and interaction with wool objects, subjects were tested on their ability to perceive afterimages of wool objects in varying contexts. Subjects accustomed their eyes to a dark room and then were shown a brief (1 millisecond) flash of light, intending to produce an afterimage effect of their arms which they held out in front of them during the experiment. Moving an arm afterwards would make the afterimage "fade" or disappear as it moved, thus indicating that the feature (the arm) was being tracked and integrated into the person's body schema. To test integration of the meaningless wool objects, subjects experienced four different contexts. 

# Subjects held the wool objects in each hand and one hand (the active hand) would move, still holding the object (the active object). 
# Using the active hand, the active wool object would be dropped once an afterimage was perceived. 
# Using the active hand, one would grab the active wool object once an afterimage was perceived. 
# The subjects were to hold onto a mechanical device which held the wool object. Once an afterimage was perceived, a subject's active hand would cause the mechanical device to drop the wool object. 

In all situations but the fourth, the subjects experienced the same "fading" effect as they did with their arm alone. This would thus indicate that the wool objects had been integrated into their body schema and contributes support towards the idea of the body's using proprioceptive and visual elements to create an extended body schema. The mechanical device acted as an intermediate between the subject and the active object, and the subjects' failure to detect an afterimage in that context indicates that this concept of extension is limited to being sensitive to only what the body is directly in contact with.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson et al. 2010. Rapid Assimilation of External Objects Into the Body Schema. ''Psychological Science''. 21(7):1000-1005&lt;/ref&gt;



===Dissenting Arguments===

The alternate perspective is that the body is the limit of any sort of body schema. 

An example of this division is found in a study and discussion on personal and extrapersonal attention, where personal relates to the body's sense of itself (the body schema) and extrapersonal relates to all external of such. Some research supports the claim that these two categories are purely distinct and do not intermingle, contrary to what the extended body schema theory describes. Evidence for such is primarily found in subjects with unilateral neglect, such as in the case of E.D.S., who was a middle-aged man with right hemisphere brain damage. When he was tested for hemispatial neglect using traditional measures such as sentence reading and cancellation tests, E.D.S. showed few signs and upon later examination showed no signs whatsoever, leading doctors to believe he was normal. However, he constantly had issues with physical therapy because he would claim to not be able to see his left leg; upon further examination, E.D.S. was known to have a particular type of hemispatial neglect that only affected the perception of his body. The motor function of the left side of his body was negatively affected though not totally compromised, yet when attempting tasks such as shaving, he would invariably not shave the left side of his face. This led some researchers to believe that there is a distinction between personal and extrapersonal neglect, which would thus reflect a similar distinction with body schema itself.&lt;ref&gt;Guariglia and Antonucci. 1992. Personal and extrapersonal space: A case of neglect dissociation. Neuropsychologia, 30:1001-1009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated disorders==

===Deafferentation===
The most direct of related [[Disease#Disorder|disorders]], [[Silver Spring monkeys#Deafferentation experiments|deafferentation]] occurs when sensory input from the body is reduced or absent, without affecting [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]], or motor, neurons. The most famous case of this disorder is "IW", who lost all sensory input from below the neck, resulting in temporary paralysis. He was forced to learn to control his movement all over again using only his conscious body image and visual feedback. As a result, when constant visual input is lost during an activity, such as walking, it becomes impossible for him to complete the task, which may result in falling, or simply stopping. IW requires constant attention to tasks to be able to complete them accurately, demonstrating how automatic and [[subconscious]] the process of integrating touch and proprioception into the body schema actually is.&lt;ref name = "Gallagher"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallagher |first= S.|author2=J. Cole|title= Body schema and body image in a deafferented subject|journal= Journal of Mind and Behavior|year= 1995|volume= 16|issue=4|pages=369–390|url=http://www.umaine.edu/jmb/archives/volume16/16_4_1995autumn.html#abstract2 | accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotopagnosia===
[[Autotopagnosia]] typically occurs after left parietal lesions. Patients with this disorder make errors which result from confusion between adjacent body parts. For example, a patient may point to their knee when asked to point to their hip. Because the disorder involves the body schema, localization errors may be made both on the patient’s own body and that of others. The spatial unity of the body within the body schema has been damaged such that it has incorrectly been segmented in relation to its other modular parts.&lt;ref name = "Sirigu"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/brain/114.1.629|author=Sirigu, A.|title= Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing: Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia|journal= Brain|year= 1991|volume=114|issue=1|pages=629|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phantom limb===
[[Phantom limb]]s are a phenomenon which occurs following [[amputation]] of a limb from an individual. In 90–98% of cases, amputees report feeling all or part of the limb or body part still there, taking up space.&lt;ref name = "Ramachandran"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/brain/121.9.1603|last=Ramachandran |first=V.S.|author2=W. Hirstein|title= The perception of phantom limbs. The D. O. Hebb lecture|journal= Brain|year= 1998|volume= 121|issue=9|pages=1603–30|pmid=9762952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amputee may perceive a limb under full control, or [[Paralysis|paralyzed]]. A common side effect of phantom limbs is phantom limb pain. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which phantom limbs occur is still under debate.&lt;ref name = "Giummarra"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.01.009|author=Giummarra, M.|title= Central mechanisms in phantom limb perception: the past, present and future|journal= Brain Research Reviews|year= 2007|volume= 54|issue=1|pages=219–232|pmid=17500095|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common theory posits that the [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent neurons]], since deafferented due to amputation, typically remap to adjacent cortical regions within the brain. This can cause amputees to report feeling their missing limb being touched when a seemingly unrelated part of the body is stimulated (such as if the face is touched, but the amputee also feels their missing arm being stroked in a specific location). Another facet of phantom limbs is that the [[Efference copy|efferent copy]] (motor feedback) responsible for reporting on position to the body schema does not attenuate quickly. Thus the missing body part may be attributed by the amputee to still be in a fixed or movable position.&lt;ref name="Haggard" /&gt;



==Tool use==
[[File:Rhesus Macaques - cropped.jpg|thumb|Rhesus macaques are able to be trained to use rudimentary tools, but have never been proven to use tools spontaneously in the wild.&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt;]]
Not only is it necessary for the body schema to be able to integrate and form a three-dimensional representation of the body, but it also plays an important role in [[Tool use by animals|tool]] use.&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; Studies recording neuronal activity in the intraparietal cortex in [[macaque]]s have shown that, with training, the macaque body schema updates to include tools, such as those used for reaching, into the body schema.&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; In humans, body schema plays an important role in both simple and complex tool use, far beyond that of macaques.&lt;ref name = "Berti"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; Extensive training is also not necessary for this integration.&lt;ref name = "Chaminade"/&gt;

The mechanisms by which tools are integrated into the body schema are not fully understood. However, studies with long-term training have shown interesting [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]. When wielding tools in both hands in a crossed posture, behavioral effects reverse in a similar way to when only hands are crossed. Thus, sensory stimuli are delivered the same way be it to the hands directly or indirectly via the tools. These studies suggest the mind incorporates the tools into the same or similar areas as it does the adjacent hands.&lt;ref name = "Maravita2"/&gt; Recent research into the short term plasticity of the body schema used individuals without any prior training with tools. These results, derived from the relation between [[afterimage]]s and body schema, show that tools are incorporated into the body schema within seconds, regardless of length of training, though the results do not extend to other species besides humans.&lt;ref name = "Berti"/&gt;

==Confusion with body image==
Historically, body schema and [[Body image (medicine)|body image]] were generally lumped together, used interchangeably, or ill-defined. In science and elsewhere, the two terms are still commonly misattributed or confused.  Efforts have been made to distinguish the two and define them in clear and differentiable ways.&lt;ref name = "Gallagherbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher |first=S.|title= How the body shapes the mind|year= 2006|isbn=0-19-920416-0|publisher= Oxford University Press, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; A body image consists of perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs concerning one's body. In contrast, body schema consists of sensory-motor capacities that control movement and posture.

Body image may involve a person’s conscious perception of his or her own physical appearance. It is how individuals see themselves when picturing themselves in their mind, or when perceiving themselves in a mirror.  Body image differs from body schema as perception differs from movement.  Both may be involved in action, especially when learning new movements.

The '''conservation and restoration of paintings''' is carried out by professional [[Paintings conservator|painting conservators]]. Paintings cover a wide range of various mediums, materials, and their supports (i.e. the painted surface made from fabric, paper, wood panel, fabricated board, or other). Painting types include fine art to decorative and functional objects spanning from acrylics, frescoes, and oil paint on various surfaces, egg tempera on panels and canvas, lacquer painting, water color and more. Knowing the materials of any given painting and its support allows for the proper restoration and conservation practices. All components of a painting will react to its environment differently, and impact the artwork as a whole.&lt;ref name="Chin2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Institute|first1=Government of Canada; Canadian Heritage; Canadian Conservation|title=Know Your Paintings – Structure, Materials and Aspects of Deterioration – Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 10/17|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170601|website=canada.pch.gc.ca|accessdate=10 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These material components along with [[collections care]] (also known as preventive conservation) will determine the longevity of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|last=Bockrath|first=Mark F.|publisher=The Henry Francis Du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=0-912724-52-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first steps to conservation and restoration is preventive conservation followed by active restoration with the artist's intent in mind.

==Basic care==
Typical, traditional oil, acrylic, and many other types of paintings are made up of various different types of materials, from their paint layers to the materials that make up their supports. Each of these materials requires specific care in handling, displaying, storage, added protective measures, and general environmental conditions. Providing the proper care to each of these materials ensures that the overall condition of the painting is protected.&lt;ref name="Chin2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Institute|first1=Government of Canada; Canadian Heritage; Canadian Conservation|title=Basic care – Paintings|url=http://www.canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1454443139795|website=www.canada.pch.gc.ca|accessdate=10 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backing boards ===
Using good protective measures such as attaching a rigid backing to a painting on canvas provides several protections. It reduces the effects of rapid changes in relative humidity around the painting, provides some protection from pressure or direct contact against the canvas back, and protects from vibrations caused by handling or moving.&lt;ref name=Chin2016 /&gt; Backing boards also serve to protect from dust and dirt, cracks and deformations from handling, and insect activity. Some of the most commonly used types of backing boards include foam core, heritage board, matboard, cardboard/millboard, coroplast, corrugated plastic sheets, acrylic sheeting, mylar, and fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Paintings Specialty Group Listserv. (2014). Backing Boards (M. Gridley, Ed.). Retrieved March 27, 2017, from http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Backing_Boards&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Framing ===
The frames around paintings are not just for aesthetic appearances. Frames are also used to protect the more sensitive parts of a painting when handled by hand, and they reduce the potential for damage if the painting is dropped.&lt;ref name=Chin2016 /&gt; There are also specialists that work on the [[conservation and restoration of painting frames]].

=== Handling and moving ===
The movement of objects places an object at a much greater risk of damage than when it is on display or in storage. Certain techniques and equipment are used any time an art work needs to be transported. These techniques and equipment include using padding lifts and dollies, moving small, fragile objects on carts instead of carrying by hand; lifting objects from underneath by their sturdiest part; and taking extra time and care when on ladders or stairs.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, L. (2010). Museum registration methods 5th edition. Washington, DC: The AAM Press, pg. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases gloves are worn to protect the art work from any dirt or oil that may be on a conservator or object handlers hands. When handling canvas paintings specifically, never presume that the frame is stable and firmly attached. Do not lift or carry a painting by its stretcher bar, or insert your fingers between the stretcher bar and the canvas&lt;ref&gt;Neilson, D. (2010). Museum registration methods 5th edition. Washington, DC: The AAM Press, pg. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Display and storage ===
It is estimated that a lack of proper routine maintenance and care is responsible for 95 percent of conservation treatments; the remaining 5 percent results from mishandling objects&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, G. (2010). Museum registration methods 5th edition. Washington, DC: The AAM Press, pg. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; When developing display and storage methods for works of art, issues regarding relative humidity, temperature, light, pollutants, and pests need to be considered. Location and the types of storage units must be considered as well. Storage areas should be located in areas away from pipes and heating systems, as well as out of areas that are likely to flood and collect dust and dirt. Storage units should be sturdy, adjustable for collections growth so all collections sizes are safely stored, made of materials that will not cause any damage to the paintings (i.e. metal racks), and be free of any hardware or supports that stick out.&lt;ref name=Bachmann1992 /&gt;

==Causes of deterioration==
Moisture, heat, light, pollutants, and pests can slowly or suddenly cause damage to a painting. These agents of deterioration impact all of the components that make up a painting in various ways.

=== Relative humidity and temperature ===
Too low or too high [[relative humidity]] (RH) as well as rapid changes in relative humidity can be damaging to paintings. According to the Canadian Conservation Institute, there are four types of incorrect relative humidity: dampness over 75% RH, RH above or below a critical value for that object, RH above 0%, and RH fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, S. (2016, August 4). Agent of Deterioration: Incorrect Relative Humidity. Retrieved March 29, 2017, from http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1444925238726&lt;/ref&gt; "Generally accepted temperature and relative humidity standards for most museum objects and artifacts are 65°-70° F (18°-21° C) at 47%-55% RH." The best method of controlling the environment is by using a centralized climate control or [[HVAC]] system where incoming air is washed, cleaned, heated, or cooled, adjusted to specific conditions, and then injected into the storage space. An appropriate alternative is a localized climate control system where air conditioners cool the air and absorb some of its moisture while filtering out gross particles. They do not condition the air, nor do they filter air pollutants.&lt;ref name="Bachmann1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=K|title=Conservation Concerns: A guide for collectors and curators|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Press|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light ===
Both visible and [[ultraviolet]] light can cause damage to paintings. In particular, organic materials such as paper, fabric, wood, leather, and colored surfaces. "Fugitive dyes and colorants used in paints will eventually discolor under exposure to ultraviolet light. The fading of pigments and dyes in paintings will affect the color balance of the image."&lt;ref name="SMCI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|title=Caring for Your Paintings|url=https://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/care_painting.html|website=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage from natural and artificial light exposure can be mitigated by displaying paintings out of direct sunlight, use of blinds, shades, curtains, or shudders, filters on nearby windows, installing dimmers and appropriate wattage light bulbs, and displaying paintings a safe distance from a light source to limit heat exposure&lt;ref&gt;Landrey, G., &amp; Hoag, R. (2009). The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. University Press of New England.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollutants ===
Pollutants can be described as gasses, aerosols, liquids, or solids that have a chemical reaction with any part of a painting. There are three types of pollutants. Airborne pollutants, pollutants transferred by contact, and intrinsic pollutants.

[[Air pollution|Airborne pollutants]] which originate from atmospheric sources (ozone, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, soot, salts), or emissive products, objects, and people (sulfur-based gases, organic acids, lint, and dander). Their effects can include acidification of papers, corrosion of metals, discoloration of colorants, and efflorescence of calcium-based objects.

Pollutants transferred by contact include plasticizer from PVC, sulfur compounds from natural rubber, staining materials from wood, viscous compounds from old polyurethane foams, fatty acids from people or from greasy objects, and impregnation of residue of cleaning agents. The effects of these pollutants can include discoloration or corrosion of a paintings surface.

Intrinsic pollutants are composite objects that have compounds that are harmful to other parts of an object. The effects of these pollutants includes deterioration of the object, acidification, discoloration or staining on an object, speed up degradation processes caused by oxygen, water vapor, or other pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada; Canadian Heritage; Canadian Conservation Institute. (2016, July 22). Agent of Deterioration: Pollutants. Retrieved April 04, 2017, from http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1444924955238#pollu7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pests ===
[[Pest (organism)|Pests]] such as rodents and insects have the potential to cause considerable damage to works of art. Preventive measures that may be taken to protect paintings from pests include upgrading building structures to obstruct pest entry, installing better cabinetry with good seals, better control of temperature and humidity in collections and storage areas, keeping food and other organic materials from collection areas, and treatment of outbreaks.&lt;ref name=SMCI /&gt; Materials that are commonly damaged by pests include: natural fibers, wood, paper, starch adhesives, and egg tempera&lt;ref name=Bachmann1992 /&gt;

== Painting mediums and preventive conservation ==
=== Acrylic paintings ===
[[Acrylic paint|Acrylic Paintings]] were introduced in the 1950s and the material differs from oil paint in chemical and physical properties. There are two types of [[Acrylic paint|Acrylic]] paints used in acrylic paintings. There is solvent-based and water-based. Solvent-based acrylic paints are soluble in mineral spirits, and water-based acrylic paints are water-soluble. Acrylic paint differs from oil paint in both its quick drying time, and how the paint dries. Acrylic paint dries in as little as thirty minutes, and dries by the evaporation of solvent of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|title=Care of Acrylic Paintings|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/acrylic_paintings.html|website=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:"Il Mio Unicerso" X0385UNAT.png|thumb|"Il Mio Unicerso" X0385UNAT]]

==== Preventive conservation ====
Acrylic paintings require attentive preventive care. Due to the soft nature of the paint attracts and hold dirt and debris creating difficulty when cleaning resulting in darkening colors over time. Due to the characteristic of acrylic paint, varnishes will diminish top layers of the paint and effect the colors vibrancy. Storage of acrylic paintings should be clean and free of dust and heat- below room temperature is best as it will reduce further softening of the top layer of the paint. Exposing acrylic paintings to temperatures ranging near sub zero will case damaging cracking. Acrylic paint is highly susceptible to mold growth. This is a growing concern for artists and conservators as removal causes some degree of damage to the original paint.

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Preventive care seems to be the best method of conservation. However, after more than 10 years of investigation, conservators are now better able to understand the risks of swelling, extraction, and gloss changes that are associated with surface cleaning treatments. Wet cleaning systems are now being developed that help to minimize the risks associated with cleaning acrylic paints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ormsby|first1=Bronwyn|title=Artists' acrylic emulsion paints: materials, meaning and conservation treatment options|journal=AICCM Bulletin|date=2013|volume=34|issue=1|pages=57–65|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/bac.2013.34.1.007?journalCode=ybac20|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blacklight or fluorescent/luminous paintings ===
[[Blacklight paint|Black Light]] or [[Luminous paint|Luminous Paint]] is typically made up of fluorescent dyes mixed into paint. These dyes are not a typical dye, but rather a pigment that is suspended in a carrier or resin.  This pigment is what gives off a glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. This glow or light is created by the energy that is released from the pigment. While the fluorescent paint layers reflect light, the paint layer darkens over time and decreases in fluorescence.&lt;ref name="Winter2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winter|first1=Stefanie De|title=Conservation problems with paintings containing fluorescent layers of paint|url=http://ceroart.revues.org/1659#tocto1n9|website=CERO Art|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preventive conservation ====
The intensity of fluorescent paints can decline quite rapidly, making it difficult for conservators to care for. This is because the brightening agent that is mixed into the paint is not stable. Some fluorescent paintings can only be displayed in the dark with UV-lights. These requirements can make choosing appropriate lighting and exhibition and storage space for preventive conservation challenging. For fluorescent paintings that are displayed in dark rooms with UV lights, it is recommended to have an automatic lighting system.&lt;ref name=Winter2010 /&gt;

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Conserving fluorescent paintings is complicated because restoring the paintings colors can be difficult. The age of the fluorescent pigments must be determined in order to develop a close matching pigment use for retouching. A painting can lose its effect under UV-light if the retouches and fillings are not closely matched and are too light or too dark.&lt;ref name=Winter2010 /&gt;

=== Egg Tempera ===
Egg [[Tempera]] is made up of egg yolk water, and pigment. These ingredients are mixed together to create a thick paste that dries quickly, but can take six to twelve months before it completely cures. Egg Tempera's fast drying property makes it difficult to correct or revise.&lt;ref&gt;Art Conservation at the University of Delaware : Egg Tempera. (n.d.). Retrieved April 05, 2017, from http://artconsweb-002.art-sci.udel.edu/about/kress/historic-materials-technical-terms/egg-tempera&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited]]

==== Preventive conservation ====
Tempera paintings have many of the same problems of condition and conservation as other painting mediums. These include changes in the work due to unstable and fugitive pigments. The aging of a paintings supports and ground will also impact the paint layer. For example, cracks can form in a gesso ground due the embrittlement and movement of its support, then become visible in the paint film.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt; Tempera can develop cracks over time that are visible to the naked eye, and flaking caused by air bubbles. Tempera paintings are thought to be more resistant to materials typically used during cleanings. However, they are susceptible to abrasions from routine dusting, washings, and removal of old varnish layers.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt;

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
The paint surfaces of many tempera paintings have become abraded, most likely from routine dusting and cleanings. It is unclear how tempera paintings were originally varnished due to the need for sensitive methods of analysis. Modern tempera paintings are almost always unvarnished and more prone to mold attacks.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt;

=== Enamel ===
[[Enamel paint|Enamel]] paints, not to be confused with [[vitreous enamel]], are nitro-cellulose based paints originally designed for commercial use, but have also been used in artist's paintings such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. Enamel paints are oil, latex, alkyd, and water based. This paint dries rapidly and has a glossy finish once dry.&lt;ref&gt;Learner, T. J. (2005). Analysis of modern paints. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:R Bampton Coach Painting &amp; Carriage Lining enamel advert at the Louwman museum.JPG|thumb|R Bampton Coach Painting &amp; Carriage Lining enamel advert at the Louwman museum]]

==== Preventive conservation ====
Like all painting mediums, enamel is subject to damage from improper handling and environmental stressors. Jackson Pollock's ''Mural'' for example was subjected to several moves, likely having been rolled and unrolled each time. These moves may have taken a toll on its condition. The paint flaked, and the original stretcher weakened causing the painting to have a noticeable sag.&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abraham|first1=Melissa|title=Getty Completes Conservation of Jackson Pollock's Milestone Painting Mural|url=http://news.getty.edu/press-materials/press-releases/jackson-pollock-mural.print|website=Getty|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Jackson Pollock's paintings, ''Echo'', endured yellowing at the top of the canvas due to strong museum display lights.

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Conservation treatments can take the form of adhering a lining to the canvas with wax-resin to the reverse side, replacing the painting's original stretcher, and varnishing the painting. In Jackson Pollock's ''Echo'', solvents were used to remove a thin layer of the canvas to even out the work's coloring.&lt;ref name="Emily2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Domanico|first1=Emily|title=Treatment of Echo - Jackson Pollock Project|url=https://conservingart.wordpress.com/category/jackson-pollock-series/|website=Conserving Art - A look at art and object conservation|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encaustic ===
[[Encaustic painting|Encaustic]] is a method of painting that involves dry pigments mixed with hot beeswax, then applied to the surface of a support such as wood or canvas. A completed painting is then finished by taking a source of heat to reheat the surface and fuse it together. Encaustic paintings do not require a varnish, are resistant to moisture, and do not yellow.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt;[[File:Mummy portrait of a girl, AD 120-150, Roman Egypt, wax encaustic painting on sycamore wood, Liebieghaus, Frankfurt am Main (14304151412).jpg|thumb|Mummy portrait of a girl, AD 120-150, Roman Egypt, wax encaustic painting on sycamore wood, Liebieghaus, Frankfurt am Main (14304151412)]]

==== Preventive conservation ====
Encaustic paintings are considered very durable. However, the waxes used in encaustic paints can soften or melt above certain temperatures. This may cause the upper layers to slide or detach and cause irreversible damage.&lt;ref name="CCItemp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of Canada; Canadian Heritage; Canadian Conservation Institute|title=Agent of Deterioration: Incorrect temperature|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1444925073140|website=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlling the light, temperature, and humidity levels can prevent this type of damage from occurring.

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Surface cleaning on encaustic paintings can typically be done with distilled water and swabs is sufficient. For more challenging cleanings, solutions made of beeswax and carbon tetrachloride can be used. One of the biggest challenges in treating encaustic paintings is identifying the different waxes used to determine the appropriate treatments. Infra-red photography and gas chromotography can be used to identify the various types of waxes.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt;

===Frescos===
[[Frescos]] are types of mural paintings where the pigment is painted directly into a fresh lime mortar surface. These types of paintings are susceptible to damage from vandalism, time, environmental stressors, and climate changes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/art-conservation-and-restoration/Paintings|title=Art conservation and restoration|last=Larson|first=J.H.|date=2016|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannic, Inc.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frescos, like most works of cultural heritage, have specific climate parameters for preservation. Humidity and water damage cause mold to develop. The mold [[aspergillus versicolor]] can grow on frescos and consume nutrients effectively causing pigment discoloration and wall detachment from rot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Overview of the Genus Aspergillus (PDF).

==== Preventive conservation ====
Ideally, buildings with frescos would be outfitted with central air with humidity adjusting features to keep the paintings in a cool and dry environment with low humidity.  Frescos can be found typically in old churches and other ancient structures such as temples and tombs. These types of structures can be limited with additional means like environmental controls.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition|last=Buck, and Gilmore|first=|publisher=AMM Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|last=Appelbaum|first=Barbara|publisher=Appelbaum|year=2010|isbn=1453682112|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deterioration of frescos can be caused by environmental pollutants. These pollutants can be physical, chemical, or biological. The many layers can deteriorate from the materials chemical compositions reacting to pollutants or environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, light, and pH.

''Chemical Degradation''- Evident with pigment discoloration, stains, and the presence of biofilm.

''Physical Degradation''- Evident with cracking of layers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Frescos can be repaired by methods of detaching sections of the fresco. Surface repairs for frescos can be less invasive. Conservators can remedy cracks and minor detachments of frescos with injections of epoxy resin containing micronized silica and [[Lime mortar|lime putty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Fenice Reconstructed 1996-2003: A Building Site|last=Cacci., ed, Leonardo|first=|publisher=Venezia: Marsilio|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacquer===
There are a variety of lacquers that have been, and continue to be used such as Urushi (unprocessed lacquer), Guangqi (processed), Nitrocellulose, lacquers with acrylic resins, and water-based lacquers, but the most well known [[lacquer]]is Urushi lacquer.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt; This lacquer paint is made from raw lacquer or sap taken from trees. It is then heated, filtered, and applied in thin layers to supports such as wood or metal. The lacquer is left to cure before it is polished, and another layer is added. The number of layers may vary, and each can be left in its natural transparent state, or colored with pigments to create [[Lacquer painting]].&lt;ref name="Laurin2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laurin|first1=G|title=The Craft and Care of East Asian Lacquer|url=http://denverartmuseum.org/article/staff-blogs/craft-and-care-east-asian-lacquer|website=Denver Art Museum|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lacquer painting over wood, Northern Wei.jpg|thumb|Lacquer painting over wood, Northern Wei]]

==== Preventive conservation ====
While lacquer is a hard material, it is best to first prevent damage and loss by maintaining proper environmental conditions. Lacquer is susceptible to cracks and loose joins from fluctuating temperatures and relative humidity. Extended exposure to light can also cause lacquer to lose its durability.&lt;ref name=Laurin2013 /&gt; Over exposure can also cause discoloration and loss of lustre. Avoiding exposure to unfiltered daylight and fluorescent lamps can help to prevent this type of damamge. Temperatures should be kept as low and consistent as possible to avoid changes in relative humidity which can cause condensation. Condensation can cause shrinkage and swelling in the wood that he lacquer is applied to.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt;

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Treatments to lacquer paintings may include consolidation and repair work before or after cleaning. Consolidation can be used to repair cupping and flaking.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt;

=== Oil paintings ===
Oil paint is a medium made up of pigments and a drying oil binding agent. Various other ingredients can be mixed in to condition the paint in several ways and modify its various properties and drying.&lt;ref name=Chin2017 /&gt;[[Oil painting]]s are painted on various surface support types. Oil on canvas, oil on board, and oil on metal are only some examples of oil paintings on various surfaces. Oil paintings are susceptible to damage from vandalism, time, improper handling, environmental stressors and temperature changes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[File:Painting Art Conservation &amp; Restoration.jpg|thumb|Restored Painting- oil on canvas; by Bartolomeo Better; Italian. 17th-Century.]]They are also susceptible to damage in low relative humid conditions, and fluctuations can create stresses in the paint layers.&lt;ref name=Chin2017/&gt;

==== Preventive conservation ====
Preventive care for oil paintings is essential for preservation. Excessive light with heat can cause fading to pigments. Proper storage with climate and lighting controls are important especially depending on the support structure. The wooden stretcher behind an oil painting on canvas will expand and contract with moisture causing possible buckling of the canvas and cracking, flaking, or shattering of the paint. Paintings should be stored off the ground in case of flooding. Moisture and water damage can cause mold to develop along with various other issues depending on the materials involved: rot (natural materials), rusting (in metals), warping (of wooden supports), etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Treatment methods may include rejoining split wooden panels, mending torn fabric, or consolidating lifting paint flakes. Cleaning old and yellowing varnish, and revarnish the painting.&lt;ref name="Winterthur2restoration of paintings000"/&gt;

=== Pastels ===
There are two types of [[Pastel]]s. Pastels that are made of pigment particles bound together with a binding agent, and oil pastels that have pigments mixed with wax and non-drying oil. Pastels that are pigment particles bound together take on a more chalky and loose powdery characterization, and are secured to its supports using fixative or diluted resin in solution. Oil pastels never fully dry, and are sensitive to scrapes, dust and dirt.&lt;ref name=Chin2017 /&gt;[[File:Double Portrait by Francis Cotes, pastel, Speed Art Museum.jpg|thumb|Double Portrait by Francis Cotes, pastel, Speed Art Museum]]

==== Preventive conservation ====
In general, works of art on paper should be stored in a cool and relatively dry room with minimal exposure to light.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=Care, Handling, and Storage of Works on Paper|url=http://loc.gov/preservation/care/paper.html|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastel artworks should be matted and framed. Framing should be under ultraviolet filtering acrylic sheeting.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt; Using a glaze over the surface of the oil pastel works can help to protect the oil pastel from damage.&lt;ref name=Chin2017 /&gt; Limited exhibition time and low light intensity is recommended to limit light exposure. Excessive light exposure can cause pigment fading and discoloration in the paper.&lt;ref name=SouthEast /&gt;

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Preventive conservation is key. Some damage to works of art on paper is irreversible, but there are some methods of restoration that can be used to treat damages such as structural tension in the paper created by previous restoration treatments. This may include removal of the secondary and adhering a new support or even an internal cardboard support.&lt;ref name="Jimenez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reyes|first1=Jimenez|title=The Conservation and Restoration of Pastel|url=http://www.blogmuseupicassobcn.org/2013/03/the-conservation-and-restoration-of-pastel/?lang=en|website=El Blog del Museu Picasso de Barcelona|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watercolor and gouache ===
[[Watercolor painting|Water color]] and [[Gouache]] paintings are pigments mixed into water-soluble gums that are applied onto paper or rigid board supports. Due to its thin washes and light colors, watercolor paintings are very light sensitive. Also, due to their exposed support they are vulnerable to damage from dirt, dust, and pollutants.&lt;ref name=Chin2017 /&gt; Gouache paintings can form layers like acrylic and oil paint, but is still vulnerable to the same agents of deterioration as watercolors.[[File:Landscape with Herd of Buffalo on the Upper Missouri. Watercolor by Karl Bodmer 1833.jpg|thumb|Landscape with Herd of Buffalo on the Upper Missouri. Watercolor by Karl Bodmer 1833]]

==== Preventive conservation ====
Damage to Watercolor and Gouache paintings can be prevented and mitigated by maintaining temperature and relative humidity within acceptable ranges, and low light conditions. As with pastel works, watercolor and gouache paintings should be mounted and framed. Damage that may occur are disfiguring brown spots from mold growth, paper turning brown and brittle from cardboard supports, yellow stains from adhesive tapes, and cockling and undulations.&lt;ref name="NA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=The National Archives|title=Caring for your prints, drawings, and watercolors|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/caringforprints_leaft.pdf|website=National Archives|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Some treatments to watercolor works may include a washing treatment to remove discoloration from acidic mounts, tapes, and adhesives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=South Florida Art Conservation|title=Watercolor Conservation: Can a Discolored Watercolor be Rescued?|url=http://www.sflac.net/uncategorized/can-a-discolored-watercolor-be-rescued/|website=South Florida Art Conservation|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stains from these products can also be treated with solvents. Tears and losses can be repaired with products such as wheat starch paste or methyl cellulose, and weakened paper can be strengthened by attaching a lining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collector's Guide|title=Conserving Works of Art on Paper|url=http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa010.shtml|website=Collector's Guide|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scroll and screen paintings ===
Scroll Paintings, [[Hanging scroll|Hanging]] and [[Hand scroll|Hand]], and screen paintings are made of ink, color, pigment, silk and paper. Scroll paintings often are multiple layers of paper and silk attached to wooden bars called a stave and dowel. Screens are often single panels that are joined together by paper hinges that fold into each other like an accordion.[[File:Japanese Arhat Painting.jpg|thumb|Japanese Arhat Painting]]

==== Preventive conservation ====
Scrolls and Screens are vulnerable to damage from fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Exposure to light for extended periods of time can cause silk and pigments to fade, and paper to darken. Glazes and films that filter ultraviolet light can help to prevent damage from UV radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Melching, S. (2013, May 24). How to Care for Japanese Scrolls &amp; Screens. Retrieved April 8, 2017, from http://denverartmuseum.org/article/staff-blogs/how-care-japanese-scrolls-screens-part-1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Creases and abrasions may also form on scroll paintings from repeated rolling and unrolling, squeezing the scroll or tying the cord too tight. Screens can become distorted from uneven tension between the back and front side panels.&lt;ref name="Yoshiyuki"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nishio|first1=Yoshiyuki|title=Maintenance of East Asian Paintings|journal=The Book and Paper Group Annual|date=1993|volume=12|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v12/bp12-09.html|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conservation and restoration methods ====
Conservation treatments require significant research as the variations in technique and materials among Asian scroll and screen paintings is great. In general some types of conservation treatments that may be conducted on scroll paintings and screens include remounting, consolidation of pignments, removing old backings, and in-painting and retouching.&lt;ref name="Gu1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gu|first1=Xiangmei|last2=Hou|first2=Yuan-li|last3=Gouet|first3=Valerie|title=The Treatment of Chinese Portraits: An Introduction to Chinese Painting Conservation Technique|journal=The Book and Paper Group Annual|date=1999|volume=18|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v18/bp18-05.html|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In-painting and retouching materials for scrolls and screens is not reversible. In-painting and retouches should only be done on losses or fills. Inpainted areas can darken due to losses that have a heavy concentration of animal gelatin/alum for inpainting.&lt;ref name=Yoshiyuki /&gt;

== Painting supports and preventive conservation ==
The material that makes up the support can have a major impact on the overall deterioration of an artwork, it can also determine the best method for handling, storing, and displaying an object.&lt;ref name=Chin2017 /&gt;

=== Architectural structures (i.e. walls &amp; ceilings) ===
[[Architectural conservation|Architectural]] Structures such as walls and ceilings are typical supports for fresco and mural style paintings. Preserving the both the paint layer and the support (wall) is crucial. Regular maintenance of the building and structure is necessary to safeguarding wall paintings. Monitoring environmental conditions, limiting visitor access, and temporary closures to public access can be used to help preserve the paintings. Conservation treatments may take the form of reconstruction using traditional materials and techniques, and complete or partial coverings with protective layers.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Internatual Council on Monuments and Sites|title=ICOMOS Principles for the Preservation and Conservation/Restoration of Wall Paintings|url=http://www.icomos.org/en/what-we-do/focus/179-articles-en-francais/ressources/charters-and-standards/166-icomosprinciples-for-the-preservation-and-conservationrestoration-of-wall-paintings|website=Council on Monuments and Sites|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canvas ===
[[Canvas]], typically made from Linen, hemp, jute, burlap, and cotton,&lt;ref name=Ocon /&gt; is often stretched onto a wooden frame called a stretcher. Canvas can also come in the form of canvas board. As with all parts of a painting, deterioration is inevitable. Re-lining or lining treatments was used to added support to the original canvas until it was determined that it created more damage. Strip-lining is now used instead. Strip-lining involves reinforcing tacking that has weakened. Tears in the canvas are repaired with adhesive or sewing.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hackney|first1=Stephen|title=Paintings on Canvas: Lining and Alternatives|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/02/paintings-on-canvas-lining-and-alternatives|website=Tate Museum|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ceramics ===
[[Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects|Ceramics]] vary widely in their construction, style, and use. There are three types of ceramic objects. They are earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Each of these types of ceramic objects are fired at different degrees and come in different colors.&lt;ref name=Winterthur2000 /&gt;

The materials used in their construction are often a clay body, and some times mixed with sand, shell, chalk, mica, and ground-up fired ceramics. The surface of these ceramic objects are finished with glaze and fired in a number of ways. Decorations with gold, paint or enamel are applied over the glaze. These overglaze decorations are susceptible to abrasions or chemical damage from cleaning and handling. A ceramic object is also vulnerable to weeping and [[Glass disease|crizzling]] from fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature.&lt;ref name=CCI2017/&gt;

=== Cloth or textiles ===
[[Conservation and restoration of textiles|Cloth]] or textiles are typically made from natural fibers such as wool, silk, cotton, linen, and hemp. However, some textiles more recently have been created with modified natural fibers such as Rayon. Textiles can make up many different objects from cushions to dresses. All with varying degrees and types of degradation. Light typically causes dyes to fade, and some fibers (silk) are more sensitive to physical damage from light. Low light levels are recommended to prevent damage. Mold and mildew caused by high levels of humidity and improper storage can cause irreversible damage. Damage can be mitigated with proper relative humidity levels and storing of textiles in acid-free tissue or clean cotton sheets. Textiles are especially vulnerable to attacks from pests such as moths and silverfish.&lt;ref name=Winterthur2000 /&gt;

=== Glass ===
Paintings on [[Conservation and restoration of glass objects|Glass]] are particularly challenging for conservation because first the fragile nature of glass, and second the smooth surface of glass that makes it difficult for paint to adhere to the surface.&lt;ref name=Winterthur2000 /&gt; Glass objects are not subject to the same vulnerability to environmental conditions as other types of paintings, but are most susceptible to damage from improper handling and inappropriate cleaning methods.&lt;ref name=CCI2017 /&gt;

=== Ivory ===
Paintings on [[Conservation and restoration of ivory objects|Ivory]] are typically small, and the most commonly used paints were (watercolor, tempera, and gouache) directly on the surface of the ivory. The ivory was usually thin, translucent in appearance, and typically attached to a secondary support made of paper or card. Miniatures of these designs were frequently sealed in metal lockets or cases. The paint on the surface of ivory is very delicate and can be easily rubbed off, small amounts of water (breath, condensation or residues from cleaning) can affect the image. Ivory is also very sensitive to environmental changes. Ivory supports can be prone susceptible to warping and splitting from fluctuations in relative humidity.&lt;ref name=CCI2016 /&gt;

=== Metal ===
[[Conservation and restoration of metals|Metal]]
Various types of metal plates have been used as supports for paintings. These include: "silver, tin leaf, iron with tin on either side, copper, or copper coated with silver, tin, lead, or zinc. Enamel paint has been used on copper, but typically oil paint was used on metal supports. Metal does not respond to changes in relative humidity by expanding and contracting. However, metal can corrode over time staining paint or creating eruptions and flake in the paint.&lt;ref name=CCI2016 /&gt; It is also susceptible to physical deterioration such as dents, tears, and scratches.&lt;ref name=Winterthur2000 /&gt;

=== Outdoor murals ===
[[Conservation and restoration of outdoor murals|Outdoor Murals]] are typically painted on cementitious materials.&lt;ref name="Goden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golden|first1=Mark|title=Mural Paints: Current and Future Formulations|date=2003|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/golden.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the paintings are located outside, they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions. Some of the damages that murals are subjected to are graffiti, cracking, changes in color, and fading from UV radiation. Research is being conducted to determine reversibility, and UV barrier coatings.&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edelstein|first1=Beth|last2=Norbutus|first2=Amanda|title=AIC's 40th Annual Meeting - Architecture Session, May 10, Preservation of Outdoor Public Murals: Research and Public Outreach|url=http://www.conservators-converse.org/2012/05/40th-annual-meeting-architecture-session-may-10-preservation-of-outdoor-public-murals-research-and-public-outreach-by-amanda-norbutus/|website=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paper ===
Works of art on [[Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera|Paper]] range from watercolor paintings, prints, posters, and drawings using a variety of media from watercolor, charcoal, pastels, and colored inks. Due to the fibers in its construction, paper is vulnerable to various types of damage. Paper is easily torn, creased, or stained during handling. When exposed to light colors fade and the paper itself can discolor too. Works of art like watercolors and Japanese prints are especially vulnerable to fading. High relative humidity can cause paper to swell making it appear wavy or winkled. When exposed to long periods of high humidity, mold can form.&lt;ref name=CCI2016 /&gt;

=== Wood ===
([[Conservation and restoration of wooden furniture|Furniture]], [[Conservation and restoration of panel paintings|Panel]], [[Conservation and restoration of lacquerware|Lacquer Painting]], [[Stretcher bar|Stretcher Bar]], [[Conservation and restoration of woodblock prints|Wood Block Prints]])

Wooden supports depending on what kind of object they are used for are made from hard and soft woods. Some types of woods that artists use are poplar, beech, spruce, pine, chestnut, cherry, mahogany, and cypress. Wooden supports are susceptible to several kinds of deterioration. These include insect infestation, fluctuations in humidity/temperature causing warping and cracking, and structural damages. Cradling was previously used to correct warping by thinning the original structural support and then adhering the cradle to the reverse side of the support. However, it has become widely understood that cradling can be harmful to the paint and ground layers. Conservators today instead work to preserve what remains of the wood support rather than making corrections.&lt;ref&gt;Art Conservation at the University of Delaware : Wooden Supports. (n.d.).

==Conservation treatments and processes==
After determining an artworks condition, stability, history of previous restoration, and documenting and photographing the examination, future conservation treatments can be determined. The results of conservation treatments often yield a more "stable paint layer and support, more appropriate aesthetic presentation through cleaning, and a more unified paintings through the reintegration of the paint losses. It is not possible to restore a painting to its original form, but with careful preservation, documentation and restoration, conservators can help to extend the life expectancy of a painting." These treatments depend on the materials that make up an artwork. They can include:

=== Consolidation ===
 
Securing areas of loose paint with adhesive.

=== Cleaning ===
 
Removing or reducing "dirt, grime, discolored varnish, and retouching with solvent mixtures or mechanical means."

=== Facing ===
 
Securing the paint layer with tissue and adhesive before corrective structural procedures.

=== Transferring ===
 
Involves removing the original canvas or wood support, leaving the paint and/or ground layer, and re adhering the layers to a new support.

=== Cradling ===
 
[[Cradling (paintings)|Cradling]] involves applying a wood latticework on the backside of a panel painting to prevent warping. Before cradling, the wood support is typically thinned.

=== Lining ===
 
The [[lining of paintings]] involves adhering a new canvas to the reverse side of the original canvases for added support.

=== Lining Removal ===
 
Removing the old lining of a canvas because the adhesive has failed and resulted in delamination between the original canvas and the lining canvas.

=== Varnishing ===
 
Applying "saturating varnish of either a synthetic resin or a stabilized natural resin varnish."

=== Filling ===
 
Adding "putty-like material to areas of paint loss."

=== Inpainting ===
 
[[Inpainting]] is applying synthetic or natural resin medium restoration paints to areas of paint loss to restore the "visual unity" of the painting.&lt;ref name=Ocon&gt;{{Ocon, N. (n.d.). A Primer for the Materials, Methods and Techniques of Conservation [PDF]. North Carolina Museum of Art. http://ncartmuseum.org/pdf/conservation-primer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific tools used ==
Conservators need to analyze the inner layers of paintings and their support to identify pigments and unstable layers. They use various tools for types of imaging to disguise materials and damages.

=== Multispectral imaging ===
[[Multispectral image|Multispectral imaging]] is the capture of a single image viewed in different wavelengths. For imaging purposes of conservation, paintings are recorded in the wavelengths: ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS) and infrared (IR).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colourlex.com/project/multispectral-imaging/|title=Multispectral Imaging - ColourLex|website=ColourLex|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''VIS- Visible Light''-''' The photo image visible to the naked eye representing the actual colors of the painting.

'''''RAK-Raking Light'''''- Lighting the painting from the sides to show the small cracks and surface texture clearly.

'''''UVF- Ultraviolet Fluorescence'''''- Lighting the painting with ultraviolet radiation to resulting in fluorescent glowing from the varnishes and previous conservation.

'''''IRR-Infrared Reflectography-''''' when the painting is exposed to infrared radiation and its reflection is recorded. The underpainting or drawing of the painting will become visible with IR radiation.

'''''IRFC- Infrared False Color-''''' When the visible image and infrared image are overlapped to view the areas of different material usage and retouches.

'''''IRF-Infrared Fluorescence-''''' The painting is exposed to both visible light and infrared light causing particular pigments to fluoresce revealing the chemicals and types of paint used.

'''''IRTR- Infrared Transmitted-''''' The painting is flooded with infrared radiation and the verso of the painting transmits radiation. The image taken of the verso will show underdrawings and alterations made by the artist.

==== Instruments ====
* Digital Camera (high quality)- can capture visible light and UV and sometimes IR images with filters.
* Infrared Sensitive Camera- to capture longer wavelengths

=== X-Ray radiology ===
X-rays are often taken to detect areas of various heavy metals found in paint such as lead, tin, mercuric sulfide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== X-Ray fluorescence ===
[[X-ray fluorescence|X-Ray Fluorescence]] is a technique used to identify the chemical composition of the materials used to make the paint.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Scanning macro-XRF &amp; neutron activation autoradiography (NAAR) ===
Scanning techniques that images with element specific characters that are able to reveal underlying paint layers

=== Terahertz imaging ===

Terahertz imaging is able to show hidden layers and reveal defects like delamination and void, highlight previous restorations like relining and can be used before restoration. &lt;ref name="Guillet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guillet|first1=Jean-Paul|title=Art Painting Diagnostic Before Restoration with Terahertz and Millimeter Waves|journal=Journal of Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves|date=2017|volume=38|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312483321_Art_Painting_Diagnostic_Before_Restoration_with_Terahertz_and_Millimeter_Waves|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''defoliant''' is any [[Herbicide|herbicidal]] chemical sprayed or dusted on plants to cause their [[Leaf|leaves]] to fall off. Defoliants are widely used for the selective removal of weeds in managing croplands and lawns. Worldwide use of defoliants, along with the development of other herbicides and [[Pesticide|pesticides]], allowed for the [[Green Revolution]], an increase in agricultural production in mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invention of Ecocide|last=Zierler|first=David|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2011|isbn=9786613110404|location=Athens, Georgia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoliants have also been used in warfare as a means to deprive an enemy of food crops and/or hiding cover, most notably by the [[United States]] [[Agent Orange|in the Vietnam War]].

== Use and application ==
A primary application of defoliants is the selective killing of plants. Two of the oldest chemical [[Herbicide|herbicides]] used as defoliants are [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T). 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are absorbed by broad-leafed plants, killing them by causing excessive hormonal growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These [[Phenoxy herbicide|phenoxy herbicides]] were designed to selectively kill weeds and unwanted plants in croplands. They were first introduced at the beginning of [[World War II]] and became widespread in use in agriculture following the end of the War.

Defoliants have a practical use in the harvesting of certain crops, particularly [[cotton]], in the [[United States]] as well as a number of other cotton-producing countries. The use of defoliants aids in the effective harvesting of cotton and finer lint quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snipes|first=Charles E.|last2=Cathey|first2=George W.|date=1992|title=Evaluation of defoliant mixtures in cotton|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378429092900185|journal=Field Crops Research|volume=28|issue=4|pages=327–334|doi=10.1016/0378-4290(92)90018-5|issn=0378-4290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of defoliant use in cotton harvesting depends on the type of defoliant(s) used, the number of applications, the amount applied, and environmental variables. Common harvest-aiding chemical defoliants include tribufos, dimethipin, and [[thidiazuron]]. According to a 1998 report by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] (NASS), tribufos and thidiazuron accounted for 60% of crop area that was treated by defoliants during that crop year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Thomas L.|last2=Marti|first2=Luz|last3=Belflower|first3=Sally|last4=Truman|first4=Clint C.|date=2000|title=Multiresidue Analysis of Cotton Defoliant, Herbicide, and Insecticide Residues in Water by Solid-Phase Extraction and GC−NPD, GC−MS, and HPLC−Diode Array Detection|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf9909104|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=4103–4108|doi=10.1021/jf9909104|issn=0021-8561|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASS (1999). ''Agricultural Chemical Usage 1998 Field Crops Summary''. Washington, D.C.: U. S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics and Economic Research Service. pg 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health and environmental effects ==
In 1998, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (U.S. EPA) concluded that the use of agricultural defoliants led to increased risks of water contamination and dangers to freshwater and [[marine life]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; High doses of tribufos were labeled as a possible [[carcinogen]] and a toxin to freshwater and marine [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]]. Dimethipin has also been labeled as a possible human carcinogen.

A published study in the ''Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry'' reported that through successive [[surface runoff]] events in defoliated cotton fields, defoliant concentrations decreased exponentially within the test area and could negatively affect marine life in the runoff zones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Agent Orange]], a defoliant used by the U.S. Military during the [[Vietnam War]] to defoliate regions of Vietnam from 1961 to 1971,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3798581.stm|title=Vietnam's war against Agent Orange|author=Tow Fawthrop|date=June 14, 2004|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/agent_orange_linked_skin_cancer_risk-128602|title=Agent Orange Linked To Skin Cancer Risk|work=Science 2.0|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been linked to several long-term health issues. Agent Orange contains a mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T as well as [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]] contaminants. Members of the Air Force Ranch Hand and the [[Chemical Corps|Army Chemical Corps]] who served in the [[Vietnam War]] were occupationally exposed to [[Agent Orange]] have a higher incidence of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Han K.|last2=Dalager|first2=Nancy A.|last3=Needham|first3=Larry L.|last4=Patterson|first4=Donald G.|last5=Lees|first5=Peter S.J.|last6=Yates|first6=Katherine|last7=Matanoski|first7=Genevieve M.|date=2006|title=Health status of Army Chemical Corps Vietnam veterans who sprayed defoliant in Vietnam|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajim.20385|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|language=en|volume=49|issue=11|pages=875–884|doi=10.1002/ajim.20385|issn=0271-3586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double Dildo.jpg|right|thumb|An 18-inch latex double dildo]]

A '''double penetration [[dildo]]''' or '''double dildo''' is a [[sex toy]] that allows for the simultaneous penetration of two bodily orifices at the same time. It is designed in the form of two penetrative stimulators ([[penis]] shaped or non-[[phallic]]) that come separately or fixed on the single shaft. Some of them include a vibrating motor that turns them into [[List of sex positions#Multiple penetration|double penetration]] [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]].

==Use==
The following three sexual configurations can be performed with using double penetration dildos.
*'''Vagina-to-vagina'''. Some women use double-ended dildos as part of their sex play with a second woman. The double-ended nature of the dildo allows penetration in two [[vagina]]s simultaneously.
*'''Vagina-to-anus'''. The majority of double-penetration dildos are designed for simultaneous stimulation of [[anus|anal]] and vaginal [[erogenous zones]], but in the case of elongated "double-headed" devices it is possible for two partners to use the same device simultaneously. This can even be used for [[pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]], when a woman penetrates the anus of a man.
*'''Anus-to-anus'''. Most double-ended dildos can be used for [[anal sex|anal penetration]] of both partners.

Simulated [[oral sex]] can also be performed on the dildo.

==Classification==
[[Image:Double dildo overview 01.jpg|thumb|right|Double dildo with remote-controlled rotating vibrator on one side]]

* '''Double-ended dildo''' aka  ''DED''.  Associated with [[lesbian]] love making devices, double-ended dildos are also used by [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] women for anal and vaginal simultaneous penetration. This dildo is usually made out of the soft flexible material (such as plastic or some form of rubber) that allows changing the shape of the shaft like the user wishes: to bend in the C-shape or to straighten it. In the past, though, they were often made of wood: Haberlandt (1899), for example, illustrates a straight double-ended dildo of this kind from late 19th century [[Zanzibar]].
* '''Anal and vaginal stimulators on the single shaft'''. These types of dildos or vibrators are intended for stimulating the user anally and vaginally. One shaft of the smaller length and width is attached to the other one that are both inserted stimulating anal and vaginal erogenous zones in a woman. In a vibrating sex toy there can be two motors in both shafts controlled together or separately.
* '''Kits of two separate vibrators or dildos used simultaneously'''. This type is a kit of vibrators and dildos that are not connected with each other or connected by a wire attached to the single control panel. They are used simultaneously or separately stimulating the erogenous zones of both partners. This type is more mobile and one can offer much more possibilities for love plays with or without partner(s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/news/a17085/dildo-christmas-tree/?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1440_35414494 Christmas Tree Decorated With Sex Toys In Milan]&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bondagebunnies.co.uk/ |title= Penis Dildos|accessdate=March 24, 2016 | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6gFLHugbY6g61OVjAU |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News &amp; Commentary|work=Valley Advocate|location=Easthampton, Massachusetts|publisher=Accessed via [[NewsBank]]|date=4 November 2010|quote=The Hitachi Magic Wand , with a reputation for releasing even the most stubborn orgasm, brings a powerful buzz to all the right places (instead of uncomfortably rattling the handle).

* '''Double-ended/sided hands and strap free dildos'''. The latest technological achievement is totally new kind of strapless strap on. A special example of these are [[Feeldoe]], Sysil, Super Strapless Silicone Dildo, Share, Nexus Maximus and Transfer, which has an egg shaped bulb designed to be inserted into the vagina or anus of the wearer.

==Materials==
* Jelly rubber ("jelly"). The most popular sex toy material that is convenient for designing any shape and texture of the shaft. It features a variety of colors, though jelly tends to suffer discoloration, and physical deterioration over time. This material contains chemicals called [[phthalate]]s, which are thought to be harmful to gynecological and reproductive health. Unlike silicone (below) this material is porous, meaning that it can harbor bacteria.
* [[Silicone]]. Dildos and vibrators made of this material are durable and feature excellent non-porous properties, so they are easy to clean and maintain.
* [[Rubber]]. Many realistic dildos are made of rubber—a material that is both pliable and flexible enough for effective penetration. Like jelly, rubber is also porous.
* [[Glass]]. Glass double-ended dildos are usually created with special original designs. Glass is a smooth and firm material that delivers a cool feeling when used. It can also be used chilled and warmed for different feeling. Usually, glass dildos are made out of a special [[Borosilicate glass|borosilicate]] type of glass, of which [[Pyrex]], Schott-Duranglas and Simax are the most suited.
* [[Plastic]]. This non-porous and phthalate-free material is often used for creating double-ended dildos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10899">The '''Dwight H. Terry Lectureship''', also known as the '''Terry Lectures''', was established at [[Yale University]] in 1905&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/ Yale University - "Dwight H. Terry Lectureship"]&lt;/ref&gt; by a gift from Dwight H. Terry of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. Its purpose is to engage both scholars and the public in a consideration of religion from a [[humanitarian]] point of view, in the light of modern science and philosophy.  The subject matter has historically been similar to that of the [[Gifford Lectures]] in Scotland, and several lecturers have participated in both series.

==Establishment of the Lectureship==
The 1905 deed of gift establishing the lectureship states:

{{cquote|The object of this foundation is not the promotion of scientific investigation and discovery, but rather the assimilation and interpretation of that which has been or shall be hereafter discovered, and its application to human welfare, especially by the building of the truths of science and philosophy into the structure of a broadened and purified religion. The founder believes that such a religion will greatly stimulate intelligent effort for the improvement of human conditions and the advancement of the race in strength and excellence of character. To this end it is desired that a series of lectures be given by men eminent in their respective departments, on ethics, the history of civilization and religion, biblical research, all sciences and branches of knowledge which have an important bearing on the subject, all the great laws of nature, especially of evolution ... also such interpretations of literature and sociology as are in accord with the spirit of this foundation, to the end that the Christian spirit may be nurtured in the fullest light of the world’s knowledge and that mankind may be helped to attain its highest possible welfare and happiness upon this earth.&lt;ref name="yup"&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?Series=81 Yale University Press - "The Terry Lectures Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although commitment to the gift was made in 1905 it did not mature until 1923, which is when the first Terry lectures were held.

==Lecture format==
The lectures are free and open to the public.  A single installment generally consists of four lectures by the same visiting scholar, given over the course of a month or less.  Many of the lectures have been edited into books published by the [[Yale University Press]], and remain in print to this day (see below)  Since 1999, the lectures have been recorded and archived on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100411232503/http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/past_00-04.html Terry Lectures website] as audio and/or video streams.

[[Image:EDGE of Existence logo.png|right|200px]]
The '''''EDGE of Existence programme''''' is a research and conservation initiative that focuses on species deemed to be the world’s most ''Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered'' (EDGE). Developed by the [[Zoological Society of London]] (ZSL), the programme aims to raise awareness of the world’s [[EDGE Species|EDGE species]], implement targeted research and conservation actions to halt their decline, and to train in-country scientists (called EDGE Fellows) to protect them now and in the future.

== Goals ==
&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid #ccc; font-size:90%; text-align:center; padding:2px;"&gt;
{{IUCN_3.1_navmap/full}}
Summary of 2006 IUCN Red List categories.
&lt;/div&gt;
The EDGE programme seeks to:
* Identify the current status of poorly known, endangered, vulnerable and possibly extinct EDGE species.
* Develop and implement conservation measures for all EDGE species not currently protected.
* Support local scientists to research and conserve EDGE species worldwide.

== Conserving EDGE species ==
The EDGE of Existence programme is centred on an interactive website that features information on the top 100 EDGE [[mammals]] and [[amphibians]], detailing their specific [[Conservation biology|conservation]] requirements.  Ten focal species from each class are highlighted each year. Each of the top 100 species is given an EDGE-ometer rating according to the degree of conservation attention they are currently receiving, as well as its perceived rarity in its natural environment.  Recent research suggests that 70% of the world’s top 100 EDGE mammals are currently receiving little or no conservation attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Isaac NJB)), Turvey ST, Collen B, Waterman C, ((Baillie JEM)) | editor1-last = Reid | year = 2007 | editor1-first = Walt | title = Mammals on the EDGE: Conservation Priorities Based on Threat and Phylogeny | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = e296 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000296 | pmid = 17375184 | pmc = 1808424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of the EDGE of Existence programme is to ensure that appropriate research and/or conservation actions are implemented for each of these species by 2012.

== EDGE Fellows ==
EDGE research and conservation is carried out by ZSL researchers, a large network of partner organizations and in-country scientists. An integral part of the EDGE programme is the EDGE Fellows Scheme, which provides funding and support to in-country scientists for field research on the conservation status and threats facing a particular EDGE species.  EDGE Fellows participate in all phases of a research project, from study design to data collection, analysis and interpretation and receive guidance and training in monitoring techniques, community outreach and education.  Each project is focused on delivering a conservation action plan.

== Conservation catalyst ==
Once the action plan is completed, a meeting with local stakeholders is held to make additions and corrections to the document and to agree on a timeline and institutional responsibilities.

== Accomplishments ==

===2007===
*2007 - EDGE Fellows hired to do field research on the [[Bactrian camel]], [[long-eared jerboa]], and the [[pygmy hippopotamus]].
*May 2007 - Expedition to [[Haiti]] to research the [[Hispaniolan solenodon]].
*May 2007 - Expedition to [[Papua (province)|Papua]] uncovered evidence that [[Attenborough's long-beaked echidna]] still lives in the Cyclops Mountains.  Conservation plans are underway.
*August 2007 - Shortly after the [[baiji]] is declared extinct, a video appears that may show a living specimen, one of EDGE's selected mammals for this year.
*December 2007 - EDGE releases first footage of the long-eared jerboa ever captured in the wild from expedition to [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/edgeblog/?p=213 |title=First known footage of wild long-eared jerboas |publisher=ZSL EDGE website |date=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
*2008 - Three new EDGE Fellows hired to research the [[bumblebee bat]], the [[slender loris]] and the [[golden-rumped elephant shrew]].
*January 2008 - EDGE begins its amphibians program by releasing the top 100 EDGE amphibians and naming ten focal species.
*March 2008 - An EDGE expedition to [[Liberia]] captures rare images of the wild pygmy hippopotamus within three days of installing a network of camera traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7286860.stm |title=Rare pygmy hippos caught on film |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2008-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
*January 2009 - Rediscovery of Hispaniolan solenodon in Haiti, followed by the establishment of a new UK [[Darwin Initiative]] funded Hispaniolan Endemic Land Mammals Project. This project seeks to enable the long-term conservation of the Hispaniolan solenodon and hutia through participatory species action planning, field research and monitoring, and improved public awareness.  It is a collaborative project between Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Zoological Society of London, Sociedad Ornitologíca de la Hispaniola, Parque Zoológico Nacional, and the Oficina de Parques Nacionales de la Republica Dominicana.

===2010===
*July 2010 - EDGE conservationists in Sri Lanka rediscover the [[Horton Plains slender loris]] (Loris tardigradus nycticeboides). Originally documented in 1937, there have only been four known encounters in the past 72 years. The rediscovery and capture by the team has resulted in the first detailed physical examination of this sub-species.

== Future directions ==
The programme is initially focusing on mammals and has recently incorporated amphibians but will expand to cover other groups, including [[birds]], [[reptiles]], [[fish]] and [[plants]] as the infrastructure and methods develop.

An '''Exhibition Designer''' is a professional who creates fixtures and [[display stand]]s for events such as large public [[exhibition]]s, [[Academic conference|conferences]], [[trade show]]s and temporary displays for businesses, [[Museum|museums]], [[Library|libraries]] and [[Art Gallery|art galleries]].

==Duties==

An exhibition designer's work can include:

*presenting their ideas as sketches, scale plans, computer-generated visuals and models
*discussing their ideas with clients
*producing final specifications
*in smaller companies, overseeing the construction of the components (usually in workshops) and assembly and installation at the exhibition venue
*handling orders for supplies
*liaising with technical specialists such as lighting staff
*understanding and interpreting the correct materials and costs involved in constructing the design
*creating large format artwork for backdrops and stand components
*designing vector based artwork for portable displays such as popup stands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition designer {{!}} Job profiles {{!}} National Careers Service|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/exhibition-designer|website=nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
An exhibition designer might be employed as part of a team by an independent studio. Other employers include national and local government, and large organisations such as museums with their own design departments. There is a steady demand for the services of talented and experienced professionals. The work is studio or office based, but will usually also involve visiting clients or exhibition sites and in some cases may also involve being outside (i.e. outdoor zoos, parades).

==Education and Training==
Exhibition Designers may come from many different backgrounds such as [[industrial design]]/[[product design]], [[architecture]], [[interior design]] or [[graphic design]]. Exhibition Designers are responsible for an exhibit from conception to completion and will incorporate many of the following knowledge and skills:

* Conceptual design
* [[computer-aided design|Computer Aided Design]] (CAD) and [[3D visualisation]]
* Knowledge of safety, regulations and applicable standards
* Knowledge of current build methods
* Expertise in [[Mathematics]]
* [[Model making]] skills
* Programming of [[CNC router|CNC]] devices

Many different companies will have their own multi-purpose system that may be used for the construction of smaller Exhibition stands, there are several different systems available and training into the specifics of each is usually conducted on a case by case basis.
For larger stands such as double or triple deckers, a good knowledge of architectural build methods is useful. An exhibition designer will usually work in conjunction with a [structural engineer] to ensure the safe implementation of structural columns and beams. When designing larger stands the designer will take into account all local safety regulations, budget constraints, logistics, design aesthetics and any requirements for electrical and water supply.

'''Float glass''' is a sheet of [[glass]] made by floating molten glass on a bed of molten metal, typically [[tin]], although [[lead]] and various low [[melting point]] alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Step-by-step Manufacturing of Float Glass|url=http://www.pilkington.com/pilkington-information/about+pilkington/education/float+process/step+by+step.htm|publisher=Pilkington|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern [[window]]s are made from float glass. Most float glass is [[soda-lime glass]], but relatively minor quantities of specialty [[borosilicate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schott.com/hometech/english/products/borofloat/index.html|title=Borosilikatglas BOROFLOAT® {{!}} SCHOTT AG|website=www.schott.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flat panel display]] glass are also produced using the float glass process.&lt;ref&gt;Not all flat panel display glass is produced by the float glass process. The company [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] is using the [[Overflow downdraw method|overflow downdraw technique]], while [[Schott Glass|Schott]] uses the float glass technique (see [http://www.schott.com/fpd/english/lcd_glass/index.html Schott website]).&lt;/ref&gt; The float glass process is also known as the '''Pilkington process''', named after the British glass manufacturer [[Pilkington]], which pioneered the technique (invented by Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]]) in the 1950s at their production site in [[St Helens, Merseyside]].

== History ==
[[File:windowfloatnofloat.jpg|thumb|right|Old [[window]] containing a single sheet of float glass in the upper left section, [[Jena]], [[Germany]]. The remaining sections are possibly not float glass as indicated by the distorted reflections of a tree.]]
Until the 16th century, window glass or [[flat glass]] was generally cut from large discs (or rondels) of [[crown glass (window)|crown glass]]. Larger sheets of glass were made by [[glassblowing|blowing]] large [[Cylinder blown sheet|cylinders]] which were cut open and flattened, then cut into panes. Most window glass in the early 19th century was made using the [[cylinder method]]. The 'cylinders' were {{convert|6|to|8|ft|cm}} long and {{convert|10|to|14|in|cm}} in diameter, limiting the width that panes of glass could be cut, and resulting in windows divided by transoms into rectangular panels.

The first advances in automating glass manufacturing were patented in 1848 by [[Henry Bessemer]], an [[England|English]] [[engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;Bessemer, Henry ; British patent no. 12,101 (issued: Sept. 22, 1848).&lt;/ref&gt; His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing. If the glass could be set on a perfectly smooth, flat body, like the surface of an open pan of calm liquid, this would reduce costs considerably. Attempts were made to form flat glass on a bath of molten tin—one of the few liquids denser than glass that would be calm at the high temperatures needed to make glass—most notably in the US. Several patents were granted,&lt;ref&gt;See:

Heal, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00710357&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect2%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPALL%2526S1%3D0710357.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F710357%2526RS%3DPN%2F710357&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page "Manufacture of window and plate glass,"] U.S. patent no. 710,357 (filed:  January 25, 1902; issued: September 30, 1902).

Hitchcock, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00789911&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect2%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPALL%2526S1%3D0789911.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F789911%2526RS%3DPN%2F789911&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page "Apparatus for manufacturing glass sheets or plates,"] U.S. patent no. 789,911 (filed:  July 30, 1902; issued:  May 16, 1905).&lt;/ref&gt; but this process was unworkable at the time.

Before the development of float glass, larger sheets of plate glass were made by casting a large puddle of glass on an [[iron]] surface, and then polishing both sides, a costly process. From the early 1920s, a continuous ribbon of plate glass was passed through a lengthy series of inline grinders and polishers, reducing glass losses and cost.

Glass of lower quality, drawn glass, was made by drawing upwards from a pool of molten glass a thin sheet, held at the edges by rollers. As it cooled the rising sheet stiffened and could then be cut. The two surfaces were of lower quality i.e. not as smooth or uniform as those of float glass. This process continued in use for many years after the development of float glass.

Between 1953 and 1957, Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]] and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten [[tin]] bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1969.0212 | title = Review Lecture.

In 1964, CH3 Tank, the first purpose-built float line in the world, was built after the conversion of CH4 Tank. CH1 Tank closed down in 1977 as CH2 Float Line started up. The Pilkington's production line at Cowley Hill, St Helens, the birthplace of float glass, is no longer in operation as of 2014 although Pilkington continue to operate other float glass facilities within the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Pilkington boss on Cowley Hill : 'Float glass production losing tens of millions' |url=http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/10794410.Pilks_boss___Float_glass_production_losing_tens_of_millions_/?ref=rl |newspaper=St Helens Star |location=St Helens |date=7 November 2013 |access-date=8 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Floatglasanlage.jpg|thumb|Float glas line]]
Float glass uses common glass-making [[Glass#Glass ingredients|raw materials]], typically consisting of [[sand]], soda ash ([[sodium carbonate]]), [[dolomite]], [[limestone]], and salt cake ([[sodium sulfate]]) etc. Other materials may be used as colourants, [[refining (glass)|refining]] agents or to adjust the physical and chemical properties of the glass. The raw materials are mixed in a [[glass batch|batch]] process, then fed together with suitable [[cullet]] (waste glass), in a controlled ratio, into a furnace where it is heated to approximately 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. Common flat glass furnaces are 9&amp;nbsp;m wide, 45&amp;nbsp;m long, and contain more than 1200&amp;nbsp;tons of glass. Once molten, the temperature of the glass is stabilised to approximately 1200&amp;nbsp;°C to ensure a homogeneous [[specific gravity]].

The molten glass is fed into a "tin bath", a bath of molten [[tin]] (about 3–4&amp;nbsp;m wide, 50&amp;nbsp;m long, 6&amp;nbsp;cm deep), from a delivery canal and is poured into the tin bath by a ceramic lip known as the spout lip.&lt;ref name=ullmann&gt;B. H. W. S. de Jong, "Glass"; in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''; 5th edition, vol. A12, VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany, 1989, {{ISBN|3-527-20112-2}}, pp. 365–432.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of glass allowed to pour onto the molten tin is controlled by a gate called a ''tweel''.

Tin is suitable for the float glass process because it has a high specific gravity, is cohesive, and is [[immiscible]] with molten glass. Tin, however, [[Redox|oxidises]] in a natural atmosphere to form [[tin dioxide]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Known in the production process as dross, the tin dioxide adheres to the glass. To prevent oxidation, the tin bath is provided with a [[positive pressure]] protective atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]].

The glass flows onto the tin surface forming a floating ribbon with perfectly smooth surfaces on both sides and of even thickness. As the glass flows along the tin bath, the temperature is gradually reduced from 1100&amp;nbsp;°C until at approximately 600&amp;nbsp;°C the sheet can be lifted from the tin onto rollers. The glass ribbon is pulled off the bath by rollers at a controlled speed. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. Top rollers positioned above the molten tin may be used to control both the thickness and the width of the glass ribbon.

Once off the bath, the glass sheet passes through a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr kiln]] for approximately 100&amp;nbsp;m, where it is cooled gradually so that it [[Annealing (glass)|anneals]] without strain and does not crack from the temperature change. On exiting the "cold end" of the kiln, the glass is cut by machines.

==Uses==
[[File:Green color of float glass.jpg|thumb|A float glass light fitting. Ordinary float glass is green in thicker sheets due to [[Fe2+]] impurities.]]
Today, float glass is the most widely used form of glass in consumer products. Due to both its high quality with no additional polishing required and its structural flexibility during production, it can easily be shaped and bent into a variety of forms while in a heated, syrupy state. This makes it ideal for a variety of applications such as

* Automobile glass (e.g. windshields, windows, mirrors)
* Mirrors
* Furniture (e.g. in tables and shelves)
* Insulated glass
* Windows and doors

Most forms of specialized glass such as [[toughened glass]], [[frosted glass]], laminated safety glass and soundproof glass consist of standard float glass that has been further processed.

==Market==
As of 2009, the world float glass market, not including China and Russia, is dominated by the four companies: [[Asahi Glass]], [[Nippon Sheet Glass|NSG]]/[[Pilkington]], [[Saint-Gobain]], and [[Guardian Industries]]. Other companies include Sise Cam AS, [[PPG Industries|PPG]], Central Glass, Hankuk (HanGlas), Zeledyne, and Cardinal Glass Industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructiondigital.com/Flat-glass-market-be-39-million-tons-2010_811 "Flat glass market to be 39 million tons by 2010"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In English informal speech, a '''French kiss''', also known as a '''deep kiss''', is an amorous [[kiss]] in which the participants' [[tongue]]s extend to touch each other's lips or tongue. A "kiss with the tongue" stimulates the partner's lips, tongue and mouth, which are sensitive to the touch and induce physiological sexual arousal.  The oral zone is one of the principal [[erogenous zone]]s of the body. The implication is of a slow, passionate kiss which is considered intimate, [[Romance (love)|romantic]], [[erotic]] or [[Human sexuality|sexual]]. The sensation when two tongues touch, also known as "tongue touching", has been proven to stimulate endorphin release and reduce acute stress levels. French kissing is often described as ‘1st base’, and is used by many as an indicator of what stage a relationship has reached.

== Etymology ==
A French kiss is so called because at the beginning of the 20th century, in the English-speaking world, the [[French people|French]] had acquired a reputation for more adventurous and passionate sex practices. It originated in America and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Petit Robert 2014 French dictionary, released on May 30, 2013, added the French verb "se galocher" — slang for kissing with tongues — making it the first time a single word described the practice (except in Quebec, where the verb "frencher" means French kissing; Australia, where the term "pash" is used; the English verb ”shift” is used in casual conversation in [[Ireland]]; the German verb ''knutschen''; the Italian verbs ''limonare'' and ''pomiciare''; and the Hungarian verb ''megcsókol/csókolózik'').

== Disease risks ==
French kissing carries moderate risk of [[HPV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French kissing ups risk of oral HPV infection|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/12/-idUSTRE54B61920090512|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of contracting [[HIV]] from French kissing is extremely low as transmission would require an open wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV/AIDS 101|url=https://www.cdc.gov/CDCTV/HivAids101/Transcripts/HivAids101.pdf|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man with HIV may have infected partner with a kiss|url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9707/10/nfm.aids.kiss/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=10 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] considers transmission of [[Hepatitis B]] via French kissing to be an unlikely mode of infection.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web

'''Granule cell dispersion''' is one of the abnormal structural changes that has been shown in brains of patients with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]]. It has also been shown in different animal models, such as the [[kainic acid]] model,&lt;ref name="Murphy BL 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Brian L|author2=Rylon D.

It was first described by Houser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houser|first=Carolyn R|title=Granule cell dispersion in the dentate gyrus of humans with temporal lobe epilepsy.|journal=Brain Research|date=December 1990|volume=535|issue=2|pages=195–204|pmid=1705855|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)91601-c}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a normal situation, the granule cells in [[dentate gyrus]] should be tightly packed. But in granule cell dispersion, the compact formation was lost, and the axons need to extend longer to reach the neighboring granule cells.

==Mechanism of formation==
There are currently two hypotheses for the mechanism. It might be a consequence of a migration disorder, and the first hypothesis considers an initial injury that release toxin(s) that affect the normal [[migration of granule cells]].  The second hypothesis concerns the role of reelin (see below).

===Reelin role in temporal lobe epilepsy===
[[Reelin]] is required for normal neuronal lamination humans, and the lack of this expression can lead to migration defect associated with temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;ref name="Haas 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hass|first=Carola A|author2=Oliver Dudeck |author3=Matthias Kirsch |author4=Csaba Huszka |author5=Gunda Kann |author6=Stefan Pollak |author7=Josef Zentner |author8=Michael Frotscher |title=Role for Reelin in the Development of Granule Cell Dispersion in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 July 2002|volume=22|issue=14|pages=5797–5802|pmid=12122039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Assembly of the United Nations approved by consensus two resolutions presented by [[Bolivia]]. The first, entitled “Harmony with Nature,” asks to convene an interactive dialogue on [[International Mother Earth Day]] on April 22, 2011. Topics will include methods for promoting a holistic approach to harmony with nature, and an exchange of national experiences regarding criteria and indicators to measure sustainable development in harmony with nature.

This resolution recognizes that “human beings are an inseparable part of nature, and that they cannot damage it without severely damaging themselves.” It also seeks to contribute to the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?cat=136 |title=Rights of Mother Earth « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/president/65/initiatives/HarmonywithNature.html |title=Initiatives of the President of the 65th Session - General Assembly of the United Nations |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherearthrights.org/2009/12/22/the-united-nations-approved-the-resolution-%E2%80%9Charmony-with-nature%E2%80%9D-proposed-by-bolivia/ |title=The United Nations approved the resolution "Harmony with Nature" proposed by Bolivia « Mother Earth |publisher=Motherearthrights.org |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=1975 |title=UN Approves Two More Resolutions by Bolivia / ONU aprueba dos resoluciones más propuestas por Bolivia « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boliviaun.net/cms/?p=2016 |title=UN General Assembly Debates Harmony With Nature « Bolivia UN |publisher=Boliviaun.net |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/speech-by-bolivia-at-un-dialogue-on-harmony-with-nature/ |title=Speech by Bolivia at UN Dialogue on Harmony with Nature « World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the proposal==

The proposal in its entirety, verbatim, follows.

'''Preliminary Proposal of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)'''

The achievement of [[sustainable development]] in the 21st Century requires a Social and Ecological Contract among human beings and our Mother Earth that brings together and builds upon the progress made in the [[World Charter for Nature]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm |title=A/RES/37/7. World Charter for Nature |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rio Declaration]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_sids/sids_pdfs/BPOA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Earth Charter]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ECI Sec 3 |url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html |title=Read the Charter |publisher=Earthcharterinaction.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwccc.wordpress.com/ |title=World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth |publisher=Pwccc.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would include the following premises:

'''I. WE ARE BREAKING THE BALANCE OF THE EARTH SYSTEM'''

1. Twenty years after the “Rio Declaration,” it is necessary to update its First Principle such that it would state: “Human beings and nature are at the center of concerns for sustainable development.” It is essential to get beyond this [[anthropocentric]] vision. Not only do human beings “have the right to a healthy life,” but so too does nature, which is the basis of survival for all species including humans.

2. Nature is not just a set of resources that can be exploited, modified, altered, privatized, commercialized and transformed without any consequences. Earth is the only home we have. The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth.

3. The Earth is a living system. It is an indivisible, interdependent and interrelated community {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} human beings, nature, the atmosphere, the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[geosphere]]. Any substantive alteration of one of its components can affect other areas and the entire system. The Earth is the source of life. It is a system that coordinates physical, chemical, biological and ecological elements in a manner that makes life possible. Through the term ''[[wikt:Mother Earth|Mother Earth]]'', we express this relationship of belonging to a system and respect for our home.

4. Human activity is altering the dynamics and functioning of the Earth system to a degree never before seen. We have exceeded the limits of our system. We have broken harmony with nature. We are living through a series of rising crises that could cause the collapse of the system. It is essential to restore, affirm and guarantee the existence, integrity, interrelation, interaction and regeneration of the Earth system as a whole and of all of its components.

'''II. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY'''

5. In this century, the two central challenges of sustainable development are to overcome poverty and inequality, and to reestablish balance within the Earth system. Both objectives are intrinsically linked, and one cannot be achieved without the other.

6. It is essential to recognize and affirm that growth has limits. The pursuit of unending development on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. It is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to development is defined by the regenerative capacity of the Earth’s vital cycles. When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about permanent growth, but rather, balance among humans and with nature.

7. Sustainable development seeks to [[eradicate poverty]] in order to live well, not generate wealthy people who live at the expense of the poor. The goal is the satisfaction of basic human needs in order to allow for the development of human capabilities and human happiness, strengthening community among human beings and with Mother Earth. In a world in which 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth of the planet, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty or restore harmony with nature.

8. To end poverty and achieve an equitable distribution of well being, the basic resources and firms should be in the hands of the public sector and society. Only a society that controls its principal sources of income can aspire to a just distribution of the benefits needed to eliminate poverty.

9. The so-called “developed” countries must reduce their levels of over-consumption to reestablish harmony among human beings and with nature, allowing for the sustainable development of all developing countries. The ecological footprint of the developed countries is between 3 and 5 times larger than the average ecological footprint that the Earth system can sustain without an impact on its vital cycles.

10. The developing countries should follow new paradigms different from those used by developed countries in order to attend to the basic needs of their populations and reestablish harmony with nature. It is not sustainable or viable for all countries to follow the example of developed countries without causing our system to collapse.

11. Sustainable development cannot happen only at the national level. The well being of a country is only sustainable if it contributes to the well being of the entire system. The pillar of sustainable development can only be achieved from a global perspective. The so-called developed countries are still far from reaching sustainable development.

'''III. TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT'''

12. In an interdependent and interconnected system like that of Earth, we cannot recognize the rights of the human part of the system without affecting the rest of the system. To reestablish balance with nature, we must acknowledge its intrinsic value and clearly establish the obligations of humans toward nature, and also recognize that nature has rights that should be respected, promoted, and defended. Just as human beings have rights, the Mother Earth also has the right to exist, the right to maintain its vital cycles, the right to regeneration, the right to be free from structural alteration, and the right to relate to the other parts of the Earth system. Without respecting and guaranteeing the rights of nature, it is not possible to guarantee human rights and achieve sustainable development.

13. We have to end the system of consumption, waste and luxury. Millions of people are dying of hunger in the poorest parts of the globe, while in the richest areas, millions of dollars are spent to combat obesity. We must change the unsustainable patterns of consumption, production, and waste through public policy, regulations, and the conscious and active participation of society. This includes promoting ethics that value human beings for what they are, not what they have.

14. To guarantee the human right to water, education, health, communication, transportation, energy and sanitation, above all in the very poor and marginalized sectors, the provision of these services must be essentially public and based on efficient social management, not private business.

15. States should ensure the right of their populations to proper nutrition by strengthening food sovereignty policies that promote: a) food production by farmers, indigenous peoples and small agricultural producers; b) access to land, water, seeds, credit and other resources for family and community producers; c) the development of social and public enterprises for food production, distribution, and sale that prevent hoarding and contribute to the stability of food prices in domestic markets, thus halting speculative practices and the destruction of local production; d) the right of citizens to define what goods they wish to consume, the origins of those goods and how they are produced; e) consumption of what is necessary and the prioritization of local production; f) practices that contribute to reestablishing harmony with nature, avoiding greater desertification, deforestation, and destruction of biological diversity; g) the promotion of the use of indigenous seeds and traditional knowledge. Food production and commercialization must be socially regulated and cannot be left to free market forces.

16. Without water, there is no life. Humans and all living things have the [[right to water]], but water also has rights. All States and peoples worldwide should work together in solidarity to ensure that loss of vegetation, deforestation, the pollution of the atmosphere and contamination are prevented from continuing to alter the hydrological cycle. These cause [[desertification]], lack of food, temperature increase, [[sea level rise]], migrations, [[acid rain]], and physical-chemical changes that can cause ecosystems to die.

17. Forests are essential to the balance and integrity of planet Earth and a key element in the proper functioning of its ecosystems and the broader system of which we are a part. Thus we cannot consider them as simple providers of goods and services for human beings. The protection, preservation and recuperation of forests is required to reestablish the balance of the Earth system. Forests are not plantations that can be reduced to their capacity to capture carbon and provide environmental services. The maintenance of native forests and woodlands is essential for the water cycle, the atmosphere, biodiversity, the prevention of flooding, and the preservation of ecosystems. Forests are also home to indigenous peoples and communities. The preservation of forests should be pursued through integral and participatory management plans financed with public funding from developed countries.

18. It is essential to guarantee a real and effective reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], particularly on the part of the developed countries historically responsible for climate change, in order to stabilize the increase in temperature to 1&amp;nbsp;°C during this century. We must therefore strengthen the [[Kyoto Protocol]], not replace it with a more flexible voluntary agreement in which each country does what it chooses. It is necessary to eliminate carbon market mechanisms and offsets so that real domestic reductions are made within the countries with said obligations.

19. All forms of violence against women are incompatible with sustainable development, including violence done to women in militarily occupied territories and domestic or sexual violence that treats women as objects.

20. In order for sustainable development to exist, is essential to guarantee the full application of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].

21. Under the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical [[ecological debt]] for having contributed the most to the deterioration of the Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries.

22. The resources developed countries dedicate to their defense, security and war budgets should be used to address the effects of climate change and the imbalance with nature. It is inexcusable that 1.5 trillion dollars in public funding are used on these budgets, while, to address the impacts of climate change in developing countries, they want to dedicate just 100 billion dollars from public and private funds as well as market sources by 2020.

23. To address the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the so-called developing countries, a [[financial transaction tax]] should be created to help build a Sustainable Development Fund that would be managed by developing countries.

24. Sustainable development requires a new international financial architecture to replace the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]] with entities that are democratic and transparent, that refrain from imposing conditions or structural adjustments, are controlled by the developing countries, and are based on the principles of solidarity and complementarity rather than commercialization and privatization.

25. It is essential to promote the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge and to remove intellectual property barriers to allow a true transfer of environmentally friendly technologies from developed countries to developing countries. An effective Technology Transfer Mechanism should be created based on the need for socially, culturally, and ecologically appropriate technologies in the countries of the South. This mechanism should not be a showcase for the sale of technologies by rich countries.

26. [[Intellectual property rights]] over genes, microorganisms and other forms of life are a threat to [[food sovereignty]], [[biodiversity]], access to medicine and other basic elements of the survival of low-income populations. All forms of [[intellectual property over life]] should be abolished.

27. [[Gross Domestic Product]] is not an adequate means of measuring the development and well being of a society. Thus it is necessary to create indicators for measuring the environmental destruction caused by certain economic activities in order to advance toward sustainable development in harmony with nature, integrating social and environmental aspects that are not aimed at the commercialization of nature and its functions.

28. Respect for the [[sovereignty of States]] is essential in the management and protection of nature under the framework of cooperation among States.

29. There is no single solution for all peoples. Human beings are diverse. Our peoples have their own unique cultures and identities. To destroy a culture is to threaten the identity of an entire people. Capitalism attempts to homogenize us all to convert us into consumers. There has not been, nor will there ever be, a single model for life that can save the world. We live and act in a pluralistic world, and a pluralistic world should respect diversity, which is itself synonymous with life. Respect for peaceful and harmonious complementarity among the diverse cultures and economies, without exploitation or discrimination against any single one, is essential for saving the planet, humanity, and life.

30. Peace is essential for sustainable development. There is no worse aggression against humanity and Mother Earth than war and violence. War destroys life. Nobody and nothing is safe from war. Those that fight suffer, as do those that are forced to go without bread in order to feed the war. Wars squander life and natural resources.

31. An International Tribunal of [[Environmental justice|Environmental]] and [[Climate Justice]] must be established to judge and sanction crimes against nature that transcend national borders, violating the rights of nature and affecting humanity.

32. The problems affecting humanity and nature are global in nature, and to address them requires the exercise of global democracy through the development of mechanisms of consultation and decision-making such as referendums, plebiscites, or popular consultations so that the citizens of the world as a whole may speak.

33. Sustainable development is incompatible with all forms of imperialism and neocolonialism. It is essential to end the imposition of conditionalities, military interventions, coups and different forms of blackmail in order to stop imperialism and neocolonialism.

34. The collective global response needed to confront the crisis we face requires structural changes. We must change the system, not the climate or the Earth system. In the hands of capitalism, everything is converted into merchandise: water, earth genomes, ancestral cultures, justice, ethics, life. It is essential to develop a pluralistic system based on the culture of life and harmony among human beings and with nature; a system that promotes sustainable development in the framework of solidarity, complementarity, equity, social and economic justice, social participation, respect for diversity, and peace.

'''IV. DANGEROUS AND FALSE SOLUTIONS'''

35. Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that is labeled “green” is environmentally friendly. We must use the precautionary principle and deeply analyze the different “green” alternatives that are presented before proceeding with their experimentation and implementation.

36. Nature cannot be subject to manipulation by new technologies without consequences in the future. History shows us that many dangerous technologies have been released in the market before their environmental or health impacts are known, or before their social and economic impacts on poor people and developing countries are understood. This is currently the case with genetically modified organisms, agrochemicals, biofuels, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These technologies should be avoided.

37. [[Climate engineering|Geoengineering]] and all forms of artificial manipulation of the climate should be prohibited, for they bring the enormous risk of further destabilizing the climate, biodiversity and nature.

38. It is necessary to create public and multilateral mechanisms within the United Nations to evaluate in an independent manner and without conflict of interest the potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts of new technologies before they are spread. This mechanism must involve transparency and social participation by potentially affected groups.

39. The current ecological and climate crisis has put in jeopardy all of life on planet Earth, and thus it requires deep solutions based on the real causes of the climate crisis. It cannot be reduced to a simple market failure, which is a reductionist and narrow view.

40. The solution is not to put a price on nature. Nature is not a form of capital. The green economy should not distort the fundamental principles of sustainable development. It is wrong to say that we only value that which has a price, an owner, and brings profits. The market mechanisms that permit exchange among human beings and nations have proven incapable of contributing to an equitable distribution of wealth. To use an approach based on market principles and private appropriation to try to resolve the problem of inequality – itself a product of capitalism – is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.

41. It is wrong to fragment nature into “environmental services” with a monetary value for market exchange. It is wrong to put a price on the capacity of forests to act as [[carbon sinks]], and worse to promote their commercialization as does [[REDD]] (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The market for carbon credits based on forests will lead to: a) noncompliance with effective emission reduction commitments by developed countries; b) the bulk of resources being appropriated by intermediaries and financial entities and rarely benefiting countries, indigenous peoples and forests themselves; c) the generation of speculative bubbles based on the sale and purchase of said certificates; and d) the establishment of new property rights over the capacity of forests to capture carbon dioxide, which will clash with the sovereign rights of States and the indigenous peoples that live in forests. To promote market mechanisms based on the economic needs of developing countries is a new form of neocolonialism.

42. [[“Green” capitalism]] will bring about natural resource grabbing, displacing humanity and nature from the essential elements needed for their survival. The drive for profit, instead of reestablishing harmony within the system, will provoke even greater imbalances, [[wealth condensation|concentrations of wealth]], and speculative processes.

'''V. GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION'''

43. It is necessary to establish a United Nations organization to promote sustainable development in harmony with nature. This organization should articulate and unite the different authorities involved in order to avoid overlapping efforts and achieve effective coordination. Developing countries should have majority representation in said organization, and its functioning should be democratic, transparent, and accountable.

44. This organization should articulate all of the conventions regarding nature without leaving aside issues central to the United Nations, such as water.

45. Social participation is essential in this new organization. Workers, women, farmers, indigenous peoples, young people, scientists, and all sectors of society should be represented. The private sector cannot have the same amount of influence as the social sectors, given that, by definition, its goal is to create profit rather than social wellbeing. Effective mechanisms for interaction among all social actors are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402182458/http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=212&amp;type=12&amp;menu=23&amp;template=435 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-04-02 |title=Rio+20 - United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-10-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut français d'archéologie orientale''' (or '''IFAO'''), also known as the '''French Institute for Oriental Archaeology in Cairo''' is a French research institute based in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], dedicated to the study of the [[archaeology]], [[history]] and languages of the various periods of Egypt's civilisation.

The IFAO is under the authority of the [[Minister of National Education (France)|French Ministry for National Education, Advanced Instruction, and Research]].

The Institute conducts archaeological excavations and also publishes a number of books and journals.

==History==
The IFAO was created on 28 December 1880 by a signed decree of the [[List of Education Ministers of France|French Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts]] [[Jules Ferry]], which created a permanent Mission in [[Cairo]], intended as a counterpart in Egypt of the [[French School of Athens]] (Ecole française d'Athènes) and [[French School of Rome]] (Ecole française de Rome), under the name of French School of Cairo (École française du Caire).

The School adopted its current name of '''Institut Français d’Archéologie Orientale''' in 1898.

The '''Mathematics Institute of Jussieu–Paris Rive Gauche''' (''Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu–Paris Rive Gauche'', IMJ-PRG) is a French research institute in [[Pure mathematics|fundamental mathematics]]. It is a "mixed research unit", with three parent organizations: the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]], [[Sorbonne University]], and [[Paris Diderot University]]. It is located in [[Paris]], split between two campuses: [[Jussieu Campus|Jussieu]] and [[Paris Rive Gauche]].

It is the largest research center for fundamental mathematics in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hceres.fr/content/download/32603/497683/file/D2019-EV-0751723R-DER-PUR190015906-024200-RF.pdf|title=Évaluation de l'unité : Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche|last=Haut Conseil de l'évaluation de la recherche et de l'enseignement supérieur|first=|authorlink=|date=|website=hceres.fr|language=French|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 permanents researchers work at the institute, around 100 PhD students, as well as [[Emeritus|emeritus professors]], postdocs, invited researchers, and ATERs, and support staff. 

The IMJ-PRG is the largest research unit linked to the [[doctoral school]] of mathematical sciences of Paris center (''École doctorale de sciences mathématiques de Paris-Centre''). It has its own [[Academic journal|journal]], the ''Journal de l'institut de mathématiques de Jussieu'', published by [[Cambridge University Press]] and covering all areas of fundamental mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-institute-of-mathematics-of-jussieu|title=Journal of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu {{!}} Cambridge Core|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year since 2001, the institute organizes an international [[summer school]] dedicated to a hot topic in current mathematical research.

== History ==
The institute was created on January 1st, 1994, under the name ''Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu''. It moved in 1999 to the Chevaleret location in Paris. In 2010, half of the institute moved back to Jussieu; in 2013, the other half moved to Paris Rive Gauche and the institute changed its name to the current one.

The institute is one of the founding members of the [[Research Federation in Mathematics of Paris Center]] (''Fédération de recherche en mathématiques de Paris centre''). Since 2007, it has been affiliated with the [[Mathematical Sciences Foundation of Paris]] (''Fondation sciences mathématiques de Paris'').

=== Distinctions ===
Several members of the IMJ-PRG received national and international awards for their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imj-prg.fr/spip.php?rubrique91&amp;lang=fr|title=Prix et distinctions|last=IMJ-PRG|first=|date=|website=www.imj-prg.fr|language=fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most prominently, [[Artur Avila]] received the [[Fields Medal]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2014/aug/13/fields-medals-2014-maths-avila-bhargava-hairer-mirzakhani|title=Fields Medals 2014: the maths of Avila, Bhargava, Hairer and Mirzakhani explained|date=2014-08-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claire Voisin]] received the [[CNRS Gold medal]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.cnrs.fr/articles/claire-voisin-2016-cnrs-gold-medal|title=Claire Voisin, 2016 CNRS Gold Medal|website=CNRS News|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
The research at the IMJ-PRG covers most of fundamental mathematics. It is subdivided in twelve team-projects: [[Algebraic analysis|Algebraic Analysis]]; [[Complex Analysis]] and [[Complex geometry|Geometry]]; [[Functional Analysis]]; [[Operator algebra|Operator Algebra]]; [[Combinatorics]] and [[Optimization]]; [[Automorphic form|Automorphic Forms]]; [[History of mathematics|History of Mathematical Sciences]]; Geometry and [[Dynamical system|Dynamics]]; [[Group (mathematics)|Groups]], [[Representation theory|Representations]], and [[Geometric group theory|Geometry]]; [[Mathematical Logic]]; [[Number Theory]]; and [[Algebraic Topology]] and [[Algebraic geometry|(Algebraic) Geometry]].

The '''Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA)''', [[New Delhi]], is an Indian think tank for advanced research in [[international relations]], especially strategic and security issues, and providing training to civilian and military officers of the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. It is funded by the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Indian Ministry of Defence]] but operates as a non-partisan and autonomous body. It aims to promote national and international security by carrying out research on defence and security-related issues and disseminating the knowledge among the policy-makers and wider public.&lt;ref name=yearbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.idsa.in/aboutidsa|publisher=Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDSA has long been regarded as one of India's most influential think-tanks. 

The University of Pennsylvania's [[Global Go To Think Tank Index]] ranked IDSA 41st in the world in 2017. It received the top position among Indian think tanks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=think_tanks 2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report], University of Pennsylvania, 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IDSA was established on 11 November 1965 as a non-partisan and autonomous body. It is funded by the Indian Ministry of Defence and plays a key role in shaping India's foreign and security policies.&lt;ref name=yearbook&gt;{{citation |title=The Statesman's Yearbook: The Politics, Cultures and Economies of the World 2017 |year=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |location=London |p=80 |isbn=978-1-349-68398-7 |doi=10.1007/978-1-349-68398-7_149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James H. Austin''' is an American neurologist and author. He is the author of the book ''[[Zen and the Brain]]''. It establishes links between the neurophysiology of the [[human brain]] and the practice of [[meditation]], and won the Scientific and Medical Network Book Prize for 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Brain-Understanding-Meditation-Consciousness/dp/0262511096|title=Zen and the Brain: Toward an Understanding of Meditation and Consciousness [Paperback]|work=Amazon.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written five sequels: ''Zen-Brain Reflections'' (2006), ''Selfless Insight'' (2009), ''Meditating Selflessly'' (2011), ''Zen-Brain Horizons'' (2014) and ''Living Zen Remindfully'' (2016).

==Career==
Austin has been an academic neurologist for most of his career, first at the [[University of Oregon Medical School]], then as chairman of neurology at the [[University of Colorado School of Medicine]]. He is currently Emeritus  professor of neurology at the University of Colorado Medical School, Denver and visiting professor of neurology at the [[University of Florida School of Medicine]]. His publications number over 140 articles involving research in the areas of clinical neurology, neuropathology, neurochemistry and neuropharmacology.&lt;ref name="Upaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upaya.org/about/bio/james-austin-md |title=Guest teacher: James Austin, M.D. |work=Upaya Institute and Zen Center |accessdate=1 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409110602/http://www.upaya.org/about/bio/james-austin-md |archivedate= 9 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience with Zen==

Austin has been a practicing Zen Buddhist since 1974. He began in Kyoto at [[Daitoku-ji]] as a student of the [[Rinzai]] [[Rōshi|roshi]] [[Kobori Nanrei Sohaku]].&lt;ref name = "Upaya" /&gt;

After eight years of regular Zen meditation, Austin experienced the taste of what Zen practice calls ''[[kenshō]]''. The chief characteristic of this experience was a loss of the sense of "self" which is so central to human identity, plus a feeling that "Just This" is the way all things really are in the world. While he was on a sabbatical in England, he was waiting for an Underground train when he suddenly entered a state of enlightenment unlike anything he had ever experienced. In Austin's words, "It strikes unexpectedly at 9 am on the surface platform of the London subway system. [Due to a mistake] ... I wind up at a station where I have never been before...The view includes the dingy interior of the station, some grimy buildings, a bit of open sky above and beyond. Instantly the entire view acquires three qualities: Absolute Reality, Intrinsic Rightness, Ultimate Perfection."

"With no transition, it is all complete....Yes, there is the paradox of this extraordinary viewing. But there is no viewer. The scene is utterly empty, stripped of every last extension of an I-Me-Mine [his name for ego-self]. Vanished in one split second is the familiar sensation that this person is viewing an ordinary city scene. The new viewing proceeds impersonally, not pausing to register the paradox that there is no human subject "doing" it. Three insights penetrate the experient, each conveying Total Understanding at depths far beyond simple knowledge: This is the eternal state of affairs. There is nothing more to do. There is nothing whatsoever to fear."

Austin writes that when his former subjective self was no longer there to form biased interpretations this experience conveyed the impression of "objective reality." As a neurologist, he interpreted this experience not as proof of a reality beyond the comprehension of our senses but as arising from the brain itself.  This and other experiences and research led him to write ''Zen and the Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/neuro/neuronewswk.htm|title=Your Brain on Religion: Mystic visions or brain circuits at work?|last=Begley|first=Sharon|date=May 7, 2001|work=Newsweek, cited at Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kashinhou''' (化審法), short for {{nihongo|化学物質の審査及び製造等の規制に関する法律|Kagaku Busshitsu no Shinsa Oyobi Seizoutou no Kisei ni Kansuru Houritsu}}, ("Law Concerning the Examination and Regulation of Manufacture, etc. of Chemical Substances") (Showa Act No. 117, 昭和48年法律第117号) is the current Chemicals and dangerous substances regulation law in Japan.  The more concise abbreviated name is {{nihongo|化学物質審査規制法|Kagaku Busshitsu Shinsa Kiseihou}}, or "Chemical Substances Control Law". This law featured the world's first new chemical pre-examination system.

== Coverage ==
This law was established to provide a framework to examine the import, manufacture, and use of industrial chemicals and refractory organic substances for persistence and health consequences, as well as the necessary legal restrictions in order to achieve those aims.

== History ==
The law has its origins in 1968, with an illness related to [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] poisoning in the [[Kanemi Oil Incident]]. In 1973, this law was established, radically overturning a prevailing attitude that long term contaminants bioaccumulating in humans was not problematic. Refractory organic substances, highly enriched uranium, and substances that possess long term toxicity to humans were classified as Section 1 Chemical Substances. Section 1 items were banned from manufacture or importation.

In 1986, a Section 2 Chemical Substances was added, which included [[trichloroethylene]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]], which had contaminated groundwater. Questionable chemical substances that did not fall into above categories were introduced into a Section 2 Questionable Chemical substances category.

In 1999, the government ministries were reorganized, and the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] was added as an overseer to the precursor ministries of the current [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]], [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]].

In 2003, under pressure from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], a third Section was created to surveillance of chemical substances harmful to flora and fauna but not to humans.

Regulation, policing, and surveillance of other laws, namely the Poisonous and Deleterious Substance Control Law, Stimulant Control Law, and Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law were transferred to the current ministries as mentioned above.

[[Image:Phoenix lander illustration 2006.jpg|thumb|Conceptual image of the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)]]]]

The '''Lunar and Planetary Laboratory''' (LPL) is a [[research]] center for [[planetary science]] located in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]].  It is also a [[graduate school]], constituting the Department of Planetary Sciences at the [[University of Arizona]].  LPL is one of the world's largest programs dedicated exclusively to planetary science in a [[university]] setting.

==Background==

LPL was founded in 1960 by [[astronomer]] [[Gerard Kuiper]].  Kuiper had long been a pioneer in observing the [[solar system]], especially the [[Moon]], at a time when this was unfashionable among astronomers.  Among his contributions are the discovery of [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]] and [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], the detection of [[carbon dioxide]] on [[Mars]] and of [[methane]] on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and the prediction of the [[Kuiper Belt]].

Kuiper came to Tucson looking for greater independence than he had enjoyed at the [[University of Chicago]], the chance to build a community dedicated to solar system studies, and also to be closer to [[southern Arizona]]'s many potential sites for world-class [[observatories]], such as [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] (founded in 1958).  LPL was established under the auspices of the [[University of Arizona]], with Kuiper serving as director until his death.

LPL's endeavors are truly [[interdisciplinary]].  The accumulated knowledge and techniques of [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[geochemistry]], [[atmospheric science]], and [[engineering]] are all brought to bear upon the single goal of studying [[planetary system]]s.  Many students come to LPL having studied only one or two of these subjects in detail, so a broad-based curriculum is essential.

In 1973, the university established a graduate Department of Planetary Sciences, operating continuously with LPL.  This provided an administrative framework for LPL to admit [[graduate students]] and take a greater role in [[teaching]].  LPL's chief officer is simultaneously "head" of the department and "director" of the laboratory.  The current Head and Director is [[Timothy D. Swindle]].

==Spacecraft missions==

== Astronomical observations ==
The Lunar and Planetary Laboratory is involved with [[Spacewatch]], the program to identify [[near-Earth asteroid]]s, with the Planetary Atmosphere Project to measure the content of the atmospheres of various planets, with [[occultations]], the art of measuring the [[spectrography]] of a [[star]] when it passes behind a [[planet]], to see what a planet's [[atmosphere]] is composed of, with studies of the planet Mercury, with the [[Catalina Sky Survey]], related to the Spacewatch program, as well as interdisciplinary sciences such as Theoretical [[Astrophysics]] and Space Physics, helping to find the answers to such questions as: What is [[Dark matter]]?

==Annual Events== 
The Art of Planetary science is an annual art exhibition run by the LPL to celebrate the beauty and elegance of science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/art/&lt;/ref&gt; The art exhibit was founded by graduate students in 2013 as a public outreach program and as a means to bridge the gap between scientific and artistic communities. In 2017, The Art of Planetary Science displayed over 200 pieces of art from approximately 100 artists and scientists, drawing more than 700 guests. Says Geoff Notkin, "It is wonderful to see a real variety and innovative art both inspired by and for inspiring people interested in space, science, and exploration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rouch|first1=Michelle|title=Exploring the Solar System Through Art|url=http://www.thetanqueverdevoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TVV-01_02-2016-webmag.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=The Tanque Verde Voice|date=January–February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mata Kaulan'''(ਕੌਲਾਂ) is believed to be a spiritual woman who lived during time of [[Guru Hargobind Sahib]], the 6th [[Sikh gurus|Sikh Guru]]. Kaulan means the ''one who is Living in abode of Lotus''.&lt;ref&gt;ਕਉਲਾ - kaulā - कउलाਸੰ. ਕਮਲਾ. ਸੰਗ੍ਯਾ- ਲਕ੍ਸ਼੍‍ਮੀ, ਜਿਸ ਦਾ ਨਿਵਾਸ ਕਮਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੰਨਿਆ ਹੈ. "ਸੇਵੇ ਚਰਨ ਨਿਤ ਕਉਲਾ." (ਵਾਰ ਕਾਨ ਮਃ ੪), Mahankosh, Kahn Singh Nabha&lt;/ref&gt; There is dispute among historians regarding Mata Kaulan and her relation to Guru Hargobind. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Patishahi 6, Twarikh Guru Khalsa, Giani Gian Singh, Section:Kolan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mahankosh"&gt;ਕੌਲਾਂ, ਕੌਲਸਰ, Mahankosh, Kahn Singh Nabha&lt;/ref&gt; believed her to have been the wife of Guru Hargobind, where others believe that she was his servant. Scholars commonly hold the viewpoint that she was a true disciple of Guru Hargobind and spent her life under directions of the Guru. Another viewpoint is that Kaulan is a mythical woman and story that was created during [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s regime to annoy [[Muslims]].

'''Medical students' disease''' (also known as '''second year syndrome''' or '''intern's syndrome''') is a condition frequently reported in [[medical student]]s, who perceive themselves to be experiencing the symptoms of a disease that they are studying. 

The condition is associated with the fear of contracting the disease in question. Some authors suggested that the condition must be referred to as [[nosophobia]]&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;Hunter R.C.A, Lohrenz J.G., Schwartzman A.E. "Nosophobia and hypochondriasis in medical students". J Nerv Ment Dis 1964;130:147-52. {{PMID|14206454}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thakur-preunca&gt;Nikhil Thakur, Bogdan Preunca "Nosophobia presented as acute hypochondria". TMJ 56(2), 120&lt;/ref&gt; rather than "hypochondriasis", because the quoted studies show a very low percentage of [[hypochondria]]cal character of the condition, and hence the term "hypochondriasis" would have ominous therapeutic and prognostic indications. The reference&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; suggests that the condition is associated with immediate preoccupation with the symptoms in question, leading the student to become unduly aware of various casual psychological and physiological dysfunctions; cases show little correlation with the severity of [[psychopathology]], but rather with accidental factors related to learning and experience.

==Overview==
Baars (2001) writes that medical students who study "frightening diseases" for the first time routinely experience vivid delusions of having contracted such diseases, and describes it as a "temporary kind of hypochondria". Baars says that the experience is so common that it has become known as "medical student syndrome".

Hodges (2004), reviewing the literature, said that "the first descriptions of medical students' disease appeared in the 1960s." He may have been referring to the phrase, for the phenomenon itself was noted much earlier. George Lincoln Walton (1908) reported that

:Medical instructors are continually consulted by students who fear that they have the diseases they are studying. The knowledge that pneumonia produces pain in a certain spot leads to a concentration of attention upon that region which causes any sensation there to give alarm. The mere knowledge of the location of the appendix transforms the most harmless sensations in that region into symptoms of serious menace.

Hodges also said that it was suggested in the 1960s that:
:This phenomenon caused a significant amount of stress for students and was present in approximately 70 to 80 percent of students... papers written in the 1980s and 1990s conceptualised the condition as an illness in the psychiatric spectrum of hypochondriasis.... Marcus found that the dream content of year two medical students frequently involved a preoccupation with personal illness. Marcus's subjects reported many dreams in which they suffered illnesses of the heart, the eyes and the bowels, among others.

Hodges went on to describe work by Moss-Morris and Pétrie who saw medical students' disease as "a normal perceptual process, rather than a form of hypochondriasis." Learning about a disease "creates a mental schema or representation of the illness which includes the label of the illness and the symptoms associated with the condition. Once this representation is formed, symptoms or bodily sensations that the individual is currently experiencing which are consistent with the schema may be noticed, while inconsistent symptoms are ignored."

Howes and Salkovskis (1998) noted that "medical students frequently develop fears and symptoms of illness. This has been termed medical student's disease, nosophobia, hypochondriasis of medical students, and medicalstudentitis." They mentioned two studies, one concluding that about 70% of medical students have groundless medical fears during their studies, and one which found that 78.8% of a randomly chosen sample of medical students showed a history of "medical student disease." However, they cite a number of studies showing a similar incidence of hypochondria in law students and other non-medical students, which they said call into question "the widely held view that medical students are more likely than others to have excessive anxiety about their health."

==In popular culture==
An episode of the TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' called ''Our Driving Issues'' features a class of medical students who, despite having been warned about medical students' disease, nevertheless suffer from it.

In the Tamil Blockbuster Dharmadhurai one of the leads suffer from second year syndrome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14536">'''Metaphysical terms in René Guénon's works''' contains the definition of some [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms used in [[René Guénon]]'s writings.

In his metaphysical writings, René Guénon has stated precise definitions concerning key terms in [[metaphysics]]. This article summarizes some of them. Guénon's writings make use of words and terms, of fundamental signification, which receive a precise definition throughout his books. These terms and words, although receiving a usual meaning and being used in many branches of human sciences, have, according to René Guénon, lost substantially their original signification (e.g. words such as "metaphysics", "initiation", "mysticism", "personality", "form", "matter").&lt;ref&gt;c.f. for instance ''The Eastern Metaphysics'' and ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' w.r.t. the meaning of the word "metaphysics", the first chapter of ''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times'' on the meanings of the words "form" and "matter", the chapter "Kundalini-Yoga" in his ''Studies on Hinduism'' about the translation of Sanskrit word  ''samâdhi'' as "ecstasy", ''Man and his Becoming according to Vedânta" on the word "personality", ''Theosophism: History of a Pseudo-Religion" on the word "theosophy" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; This article provides the definition given by René Guénon to some of the words used extensively in his works.

{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="It may now be stated that metaphysics [...] is essentially the knowledge of the Universal, or, if preferred, the knowledge of the principles belonging to the universal order, which moreover alone can validly lay claim to the name of principles; but in making this statement, we are not really trying to propose a definition of metaphysics, for such a thing is a sheer impossibility by reason of that very universality which we look upon as the foremost of its characteristics, the one from which all the other are derived. In reality, only something that is limited is capable of definition, whereas by definition metaphysics is on the contrary by its very nature absolutely unlimited, and this plainly does not allow our enclosing it in a more or less narrow formula [...]."|source=''[[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'', part II, « The general characteristics of eastern thought », chapter V: « Essential characters of metaphysics », p. 70.

|'''[[Initiation]] and mysticism'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="Today the esoteric or initiatic domain and the mystical domain&amp;nbsp;– or, if one prefers, their respective points of view&amp;nbsp;– are often confused [...]. it is currently the fashion so to speak among those with limited horizons to construe all Eastern doctrines as 'mystical', including those that lack even a semblance of the outward aspects that could justify such an attribution [...]. [...] in everything pertaining to initiation there is really nothing vague or nebulous, for on the contrary it is as precise and 'positive' as can be, so that initiation by its very nature is in fact incompatible with mysticism."|source=''Perspectives on initiation'', chapter 1: « The initiatic and mystical paths », p. 8.
}}
|-
|'''[[Initiation]]'''
|
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] initiation is essentially the transmission of a spiritual influence, a transmission that can only take place through a regular, traditional organization, so that one cannot speak of initiation outside of an affiliation with an organization of this kind. We have explained that 'regularity' must be understood to exclude all pseudo-initiatic organizations, which, regardless of pretention and outward appearance, in no way possess any spiritual influence and thus are incapable of transmitting anything."|source=''Perspectives on initiation'', chapter 8: « Initiatic transmission », p. 48.
}}
|-
|The '''Self'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The 'Self' is the transcendent and permanent principle of which the manifested being, the human being, for example, is only a transient and contingent modification, a modification which, moreover, can in no way affect the principle [...] The 'Self', as such, is never individualized and cannot become so, for since it must always be considered under the aspect of the eternity and immutability which are the necessary attributes of pure Being, it is obviously not susceptible of any particularization, which would cause it to be 'other that itself'. Immutable in its own nature, it develops the indefinite possibilities which it contains within itself, by a relative passing from potency to act through an indefinite series of degrees. Its essential permanence is not thereby affected, precisely because this process is only relative, and because this development is, strictly speaking, not a development at all, except from the point of view of manifestation, outside of which there is no question of succession, but only of perfect simultaneity, so that even what is virtual under one aspect, is found nevertheless to be realized in the 'eternal present'."|source=''[[Man and his Becoming according to the Vedanta]]'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 23.
}}

|'''[[Paramatman|Paramâtmâ]], individuality, personality'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] Previously, on the contrary [i.e. prior to the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosphists]]], even in the West, whenever any distinction has been made between these two terms ['individuality' or 'ego' and 'personality'] the personality has always been regarded as superior to individuality [...] The 'Self' [...] considered in relation to a being, is properly speaking the personality; it is true that one might restrict the use of this latter word to the 'Self' as principle of the manifested states, just as the 'Divine Personality', '''[[Ishvara|Ishwara]]''', is the Principle of universal Manifestation; but one can also extend it analogically to the 'Self' as principle of all states of the being, both manifested and unmanifested. The personality is an immediate determination, primordial and non-particularized, of the principle which in Sanskrit is called '''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atmâ]]''' or '''[[Paramatman|Paramâtmâ]]''', and which, in default of a better term, we may call the 'Universal Spirit', on the clear understanding, however, that in this use of the word 'spirit', nothing is implied that might recall Western philosophical conceptions, and, in particular, that is not turned into a correlative of 'matter', as the modern mind is inclined to do, being subject in this respect, even though unconsciously, to the influence of Cartesian dualism."|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 24.

|'''Universal and individual'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The 'Self', in relation to any being whatsoever, is in reality identical with Atmâ, since it is essentially beyond all distinction and all particularization; and that is why, in Sanskrit, the same word âtman, in cases other than the nominative, replaces the reflexive pronoun 'itself'. The 'Self is not therefore really distinct from Atmâ, except when one considers it [...] in relation to a certain definite state of being, such as the human state [...]. In this case, moreover, the 'Self' does not really become distinct from Atmâ in any way, since [...] it [...] cannot be affected by the point of view from which we regard it [...]. What should be noted is that to the extent that we make this distinction, we are departing from the direct consideration of the 'Self' in order to consider its reflection in human individuality [...]. The reflection in question determines what may be called the center of this individuality; but if isolated from its principle, that is, from the 'Self', it can only enjoy a purely illusory existence, for it is from that principle that it derives all its reality, and it effectually possesses this reality only through participation in the nature of the 'Self', that is, insofar as it is identified therewith by universalization. &lt;br /&gt;
The personality [...] belongs essentially to the order of principles in the strictest sense of the word, that is, to the universal order [...]. [The] following table [...] sets forth the essential distinctions in this connection [...]:"&lt;br /&gt;

|'''Manifestation and non-manifestation'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] the Universal will [not only] consist solely of the unmanifested, but will also extend to the formless, comprising both the unmanifested and the supra-individual states of manifestation. As for the individual, it includes all degrees of formal manifestation, that is, all states in which beings are invested with forms, for what properly characterizes individuality and essentially constitutes it as such is precisely the presence of form among the limitative conditions which define and determine a given state of existence. We can now sum up these further considerations in the following table:"&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;Note: in another text, René Guénon will identify what is called here '''formless manifestation''', or '''formless states of being''', with certain ''angelic states'', as they are called in religious (exoteric) formulations.
|-
|'''The human state of being'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The "gross state" in fact is nothing else than the corporeal existence itself, to which [...] human individuality belongs by one of its modalities only, and not in its integral development. As to the "subtle state", it includes, in the first place, the extra-corporeal modalities of the human being, or of every other being situated in the same state of existence, and also, in the second place, all other individual states [...] It may be said, therefore, that the human being, considered in its integrality, comprises a certain sum of possibilities which constitute its corporeal or gross modality, and in addition, a multitude of other possibilities, which, extending in different directions beyond the corporeal modality, constitute its subtle modalities; but all these possibilities together represent, nonetheless, one and the same degree of universal Existence. It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] this that human individuality is at once much more and much less than Westerners generally suppose it to be: much more, because they recognize in it scarcely anything except the corporeal modality, which includes but the smallest fraction of its possibilities; much less, however, because this individuality, far from really constituting the whole being, is but one state of that being among an indefinite multitude of other states. Moreover the sum of all these states is still nothing at all in relation to the personality, which alone is the true being, because it alone represents its permanent and unconditioned state, and because there is nothing else which can be considered as absolutely real."|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 28.

|'''Samâdhi and ecstasy'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] let us also point out the impropriety of translating samâdhi as "ecstasy", this latter being all the more irksome as it is normally used in Western languages to designate mystical states, that is to say something of an altogether different order, with which it must not be confused; its etymological signification moreover is "to go out of oneself" (which suits very well the case of mystical states), whereas what the term samâdhi designates is quite to the contrary a "return" of the being into its own Self."|source=''Studies in Hinduism'', chapter 3: « Kundalinî Yoga », note 3, pp. 17-18.

|'''Form, matter, essence and substance'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="Understood [...] with reference to particular beings, essence and substance are in effect the same as the "form and "matter" of the scholastic philosophers; but it is better to avoid the use of these latter terms because, doubtless owing to an imperfection of the Latin language in this connection, they only convey rather inaccurately the ideas they ought to express [...]"|source=''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of Times'', chapter 1: « Quality and Quantity », p. 12.

|'''Matter and the principle of individuation'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] the individuals of any one species all participate in a common nature, which is that of the species itself, and is in all of them equally; how then does it come about that, in spite of this community of nature, these individuals are distinct beings, or even that they are in any way distinguishable one from another ? [...] the question could [...] be formulated in this way: of what order is the determination which is added to specific nature so that individuals may become separate beings while remaining within the species ?It is this determination that the scholastics relate to "matter", that is to say ultimately to quantity [...] and thus "matter" or quantity appears distinctly as a principle of "separativity"."|source=''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of Times'', chapter 6: « The Principle of Individuation », p. 47.

Some navel fetishists can be aroused by viewing a navel. In the case of a heterosexual man, women in [[bikini]] is one such example. Also women dressed in [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise]] clothing like [[jeans]], [[shorts]] etc., that reveals the navel is also considered sexually arousing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3kx5Z42GPYC&amp;dq=belly+button+lust&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=What Guys See That Girls Don't|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian journalist [[Bachi Karkaria]] once commented, "The navel is an erogenous zone.

===Literature===
Sometimes literary works focusing on navels or which sexually symbolize navels can also act as stimuli to navel fetishists. One such work is ''Navel Revue'' by author Jay Hahn-Lonne which is an autobiographical study of a man's obsession with navels.&lt;ref name="p"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGTZySRzeYC&amp;pg=PA404&amp;dq=belly+button+fetish&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x9_WTry8B6TX0QGy4LT0DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=navel&amp;f=false|title=Pornography and Sexual Representation|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Song of Songs]]'', a book in the [[Hebrew Bible]], there are allusions to exotic things in nature, with frequent interweaving of nature with erotic imagery.  In [[Solomon]]'s lavish praise of his love – the country girl, Sulaimi – the navel is mentioned as follows: "''thy [[navel]] is like a round [[goblet]], which [[wikt:wanteth|wanteth]] not liquor: thy [[Abdomen|belly]] is like a heap of [[wheat]] set about with [[lilies]].''"

==Prevalence on the Internet==

During the late nineties, there was a small but thriving online group of belly button fetish sites. These sites were maintained by individuals and usually hosted on third-party forum sites like ProBoards or InsideTheWeb. Each forum catered to a unique variation on the fetish, but were mostly the same in that they had individual boards for celebrity photos, candids, erotica, and personal stories. As the internet outgrew forums in favor of social networks and corporate porn sites, these sites began shutting down one by one. Subsequently, the site ''The Original Bellybutton Forum (OBF)'' became popular but got shut down due to admin-related problems. It reconvened with the name ''BellyLove'' but met the same as OBF.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49069">'''New Primitivism''' ([[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: Novi primitivizam, Нови примитивизам) was a [[subculture|subcultural]] movement established in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] in March 1983. It primarily used music, along with subversive comedy on radio and television as its form of expression. Its protagonists and followers called themselves the '''new primitives'''. 

Even though the movement initially encompassed several bands in the city of Sarajevo, including some such as [[Plavi orkestar]] that quickly distanced themselves from it, the movement predominantly functioned as a banner that summarizes and encompasses the work of two rock bands [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] as well as ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'' radio segment that eventually grew into a television sketch show, the discourse of New Primitivism was seen as primarily irreverent and humorous.

The movement officially disbanded sometime in 1987, although the bands and television show continued up until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

==Characteristics==
Basing itself on the spirit of the Bosnian ordinary populace outside of the cultural mainstream, the movement was credited for introducing the jargon of Sarajevo [[mahala]]s (brimming with slang and Turkish [[loanword]]s) into the official Yugoslav public scene. Many of the New Primitivism songs and sketches involve stories of small people — coalminers, petty criminals, street hoodlums, provincial girls, etc. — being placed in unusual and absurd situations. There are comparisons between ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and the New Primitives' methods, as they share the short sketch form and utilize [[Surreal humour|absurdity]] as means of eliciting laughs from an audience. The embodiment of New Primitivism is a youth who both reads challenging works such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', but also does not mind getting into fistfights. The movement got established as a Sarajevan reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements that were sweeping the alternative music scene in Yugoslavia. Some of the movement's most notable traits were promoting and popularizing Sarajevan street jargon and slang that was not well known outside of Sarajevo, extolling the mentality and culture of the Sarajevan [[Mahala]], depicting local fringe characters such as petty criminals, alcoholics, lesser-known pop cultural figures, blue-collar workers and local streets hoodlums. Because of this, the movement was concidered locally patriotic and an eclectic expression of Sarajevan urban culture.

The movement's protagonists had a specific view of New Primitivism. Perhaps the most prominent of them, [[Nele Karajlić]], explicated it as being "created within clearly defined historical coordinates, both spatially and temporally, at the precise midpoint between the spot where [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in June 1914 and the spot where the Olympic flame was [[1984 Winter Olympics|lit]] in February 1984 while temporally, it took place sometime during the period between [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s death in May 1980 and the beginning of the [[Agrokomerc Affair]] in 1987" and seeing it as "resistance to any form of establishment - cultural, social, and political - not just the rock'n'roll one that dominated Sarajevo at the time with so-called 'dinosaur' bands like [[Bijelo Dugme]] and [[Indexi]], which the new primitives held in contempt to a certain extent".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s1B5rt_1CU Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's dominant method of social and cultural critique was to fully localize the narrative to Sarajevo, and use local urban legends, cultural and social phenomena and living fringe characters as catalysts for painting a wider political picture. In doing so, the movement became both a rigidly local expressional form that gave a platform to the language, culture and myths of the Sarajevan streets, while also breaking out into the wider Yugoslav arena. A major characteristic of the movement was the adoption of pseudonyms by all its leading figures, which tended to be either comical in nature or based on the semantics of nicknames that have always been very prevelent in Sarajevo. The main reason for this was so that none of the members could be ethnically identified. The second reason was to give a platform to the stylization of nicknames that was prominent in Sarajevo - a form of local patriotism and self-mockery. 

The movement's "chief ideologue" [[:sr:Goran Marić (menadžer)|Malkolm Muharem]] referred to New Primitivism simply as "the first Sarajevan bullet to hit its target since Princip assassinated Ferdinand in 1914".

==Origin of the term==
The movement's name — New Primitivism — got introduced as a mock reaction to two early 1980s pop-culture movements: [[New Romanticism]] in the West and [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] in the Yugoslav constituent republic of [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]]. On one hand, the term New Primitivism was a clear anti-reference to New Romantic, as the Sarajevo lads sought to be anything but romantic and sugarsweet while on the other hand, they also wanted to emphasize the stereotypes encountered in many popular Yugoslav jokes about Bosnians and Slovenians — the former portrayed as raw, unsophisticated, dim-witted, and openhearted, and the latter presented as stiff, cold, serious, distant, and calculated. In the artistic and expressional sense, New Primitivism was a reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements.

==History==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a generation of kids from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]], all born in the early to mid-1960s, was coming up. Raised within upper-middle-class families inhabiting post-[[World War II]] apartment buildings typical of communist Yugoslavia, their interests included music, football, and movies. They soon converged on music as their main activity and simultaneous with entering high school started forming bands despite possessing very limited musical skills. Most of their musical influences were found in [[Western world|Western]] popular culture — from early ones such as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Lou Reed]], the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. to those found later on the emerging punk scene.

By early 1980, the kids were able to adapt a cellar at the 19 Fuada Midžića Street low-rise apartment building into a makeshift rehearsal space where they held band practices, [[chamber play]]s, even an odd [[fashion show]]. Initially very informal with irregular rehearsals and frequently changing lineups (often through swapping band members), by 1981 the bands — named [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] — took on a more serious note. Adopting garage/punk rock sensibility, they started devoting more attention to songwriting and began playing small clubs around town. In parallel, from May 1981, some of the kids from both bands got a chance to collaborate on ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'', a comedy segment on ''Primus'' radio show that aired weekly, Saturday mornings, on [[Radio Sarajevo]]'s channel two.

===Forming a movement===
The idea to create a movement as an umbrella entity encompassing their entire activity had been tossed about for months during the second part of 1982 and early 1983 between the individuals in and around Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors — the band's manager [[Malkolm Muharem]], its main lyricist and mascot [[Elvis J. Kurtović]], and its singer [[Rizo Kurtović]].

Additional notable members of the movement included [[Nele Karajlić|dr. Nele Karajlić]], [[Sejo Sexon|mr. Sejo Sexon]], [[Dražen Ričl]], [[Boris Šiber]], [[Zenit Đozić]], and others from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]]. Along the way, individuals outside of the Koševo milieu, most notably [[Branko Đurić|Branko "Đuro" Đurić]], joined in and also became prominent. Despite being a bit older and not from the same neighbourhood, film director [[Emir Kusturica]] (who was already well-established with his award-winning movie ''[[Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]'') was an associate and friend of the crew; although his movies can not be directly associated with the movement, their spirit certainly shares some sentiment with New Primitivism. With the bands playing small demo gigs around the city, they encountered other up and coming rock bands such as [[Plavi orkestar]] and [[Crvena jabuka]] that also cultivated similar thematic narratives focused on stories of local small time characters, but would eventually move away from the aesthetic and turn towards the mainstream.  

The movement's wider unofficial unveiling was said have taken place at an Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors gig in Sarajevo's CEDUS club venue during early March 1983. Also playing the gig was Zabranjeno Pušenje. Influenced by movies like 1979's ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'' that portray the youth scene of London with subcultures like [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]], and [[teddy boy]]s, the guys from Koševo tried to create their own local version of that.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iWhGnwGUT0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=121 Damar Show];Pink BH, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The formal introduction of the new entity changed nothing in the internal group dynamic as they all continued functioning like a neighbourhood gang of friends, but it gave the press something to latch onto and made it easier to market the bands outside of the city. By his own admission, Muharem used the movement "to create an impression to those in Belgrade and Zagreb that there's something more going on in Sarajevo than there actually is".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeGWqOo7uAI#t=484s Rockovnik - 24. episode Anarhija All over Bascarsija];RTS, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to music and comedy on radio, the lads decided to expand their modes of expression now that they functioned as a movement — attempting to come up with a clothing style to associate with New Primitivism. The movement's unofficial look was thus born with a démodé style consisting of waist tight [[bell-bottoms|bell-bottom pants]], plaid [[suit jacket]]s, thin golden necklace worn above the shirt, and pointy shoes (the so-called ''špicoke'') — similar to the 1970s [[leisure suit]] look — which the lads adopted from petty hoodlums and small-time smugglers and pickpockets seen around [[Baščaršija]] selling, though not wearing, clothing items such as [[Levi's]] 501 jeans that were either smuggled in from [[Italy]] or counterfeit locally in Yugoslavia. Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors especially embraced this throwback look, with young crowds soon showing up to their club gigs dressed this way. Meanwhile, Karajlić came up with the movement's unofficial creed: "Tuđe hoćemo, svoje nemamo" ("What's not ours, we want; because ours, we haven't got."), a parody on one of the often used political slogans of the communist period: "Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo." ("What's not ours, we don't want; ours, we won't give up on.").
{{quote box|quote=''During summer 1983, after getting back from an out-of-town gig somewhere, we went to our favourite [[kafana]] Dedan at [[Baščaršija]] where our friend [[Branko Đurić|Đuro]] told us about a journalist from [[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]] looking for us to do an interview. We were convinced Đuro's fucking with us, but he insisted, telling us the guy had already looked for us at [[Televizija Sarajevo|TV Sarajevo]] (where of course no one ever heard of us), at [[Diskoton]] (where they were also clueless as to who we are), before finally resorting to asking about us from kafana to kafana and eventually ending up at Dedan, leaving a phone number with Đuro. This confirmed to us once more what we had already picked up on during our out-of-town gigs — that people outside of the city are taking our braggadocios and bombastic proclamations in the youth print about being the 'kings of Sarajevo' quite literally and quite seriously. In reality we were complete unknowns. Media outlets in Sarajevo didn't give two shits about us, but we noticed that our embellished stories found a receptive audience in youth print media from other Yugoslav cities. They especially lapped up our tales of this 'great new movement in Sarajevo called New Primitivism'.''&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/meteorski-uspon-elvisa-j-kurtovica/228133|title=Meteorski uspon Elvisa J.

One of the very first activities on the movement's behalf was writing an [[open letter]] to Sarajevo's own [[Goran Bregović]], the best known and the most established rock musician in Yugoslavia, who was at the moment going through a well-documented creative and commercial crisis with his band [[Bijelo Dugme]]'s [[Uspavanka za Radmilu M.|latest studio effort]] getting poor reviews and selling underwhelmingly, not to mention constant reports of infighting and vocalist [[Željko Bebek]]'s imminent departure. Dripping with jovial sarcasm and backhanded compliments, the new primitives' letter invited Bregović to join them, offering him a fresh start along with a creative reset.

===Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors get the ball rolling===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Elvis.j.kurtovic.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] before a concert in [[Kulušić]], [[Zagreb]].]] --&gt;
[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] were the first to establish a bit of a buzz on the scene. Promoted by Muharem, who in addition to the band's business side also handled many of its creative aspects, EJK&amp;HM were not only gigging in clubs around Sarajevo, but in 1983 also started playing clubs nationwide, in Belgrade ([[Studentski kulturni centar (Belgrade)|SKC]]), Zagreb ([[Kulušić]] and Lapidarij), Rijeka (Palah), Pula, etc., getting enthusiastic reactions from young club crowds everywhere. Though their sound was hardly original with straight covers of the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. dominating the repertoire, EJK&amp;HM live shows were a unique mixture of rock'n'roll with elements of [[performance art]] and [[stand-up comedy]], full of youthful exuberance with Elvis J. Kurtović, the band's lyrics writer and mascot, constantly interacting with the crowd between songs. They mostly played student clubs with their promotional activities strictly limited to printed press.&lt;ref name="damar"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GnqP6kskh8 Elvis J. Kurtovic @ Damar]&lt;/ref&gt; Muharem would get them publicity by talking up New Primitivism and ensuring journalists from youth-oriented papers — ''[[Džuboks]]'' and ''Reporter'' from Belgrade, ''Polet'' from Zagreb, and ''[[Mladina]]'' from Ljubljana — have the 'right angle' for the story while the band members would contribute by providing colourful interviews and quotable sound bytes often delivered in form of a [[manifesto]].

In late July 1983, the fledgling band received a huge boost after ''[[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]]'', a Yugoslavia-wide high-circulation weekly newsmagazine in the vein of ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Lui]]'', deployed its journalist [[Goran Gajić]] to Sarajevo for a story on the unconventional group.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Published as a two-page spread headlined "Meteorski uspon Elvisa J. Kurtovića" (Elvis J. Kurtović's Meteoric Rise) in a magazine that's circulated in 200,000 copies, the story was by far the biggest media exposure the band had gotten up to that point. Building upon talking points already well established and developed by Muharem and Kurtović through the country's youth print media, the ''Start'' piece was extremely affirmative and flattering for the EJK&amp;HM youngsters — proclaiming them to be "the next important thing in Yugoslav rock".&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Along with a new batch of the band members' trademark off-the-wall soundbytes sprinkled throughout, the article also re-published — on Muharem's insistence despite Kurtović's apparent opposition&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; — their sarcastic open letter to Goran Bregović that thus got a much bigger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jergović|first=Miljenko|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/miljenko-jergovic/miljenko/255037|title=Iz vremena kada očevi nisu znali protiv koga to pjevaju njihova djeca|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=27 February 2017|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding the wave of publicity generated by the ''Start'' piece, Muharem acted quickly in the fall of 1983 by ambitiously booking Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors for a double bill concert with [[D' Boys]] at Sarajevo's Đuro Đaković Hall, an all-seater venue holding almost a thousand people.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; The show sold out quickly and was a smashing success, a remarkable triumph for a band that at the time hadn't been on television yet and still had no studio recordings.&lt;ref name="damar"/&gt;

Muharem soon arranged for the band to get some time in Akvarijus studio in Belgrade during December 1983 in order to record material for their debut album whose production was originally supposed to be handled by Peđa Vranešević of [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], but was eventually done by [[Goran Vejvoda]] as well as Elvis J. Kurtović and Muharem themselves. [[Margita Stefanović]] from [[Katarina II]] made a guest appearance on the synthesizer during the album recording sessions as her band was recording its own [[Katarina II (album)|debut album]] in the same studio at the same time.

EJK&amp;HM and Muharem soon agreed a record contract with [[Založba kaset in plošč RTV Ljubljana|ZKP RTLj]] and their debut album ''[[Mitovi i legende o Kralju Elvisu]]'' came out in February 1984 right in the middle of the Winter Olympics being held in the city. Figuring that promoting the album during the Olympics would get them extra attention due to all the press and other visitors gathered in the city, EJK&amp;HM held a press junket that largely turned shambolic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/30-godina-mitova-i-legendi/175242|title=30 godina 'Mitova i legendi...'|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a series of club gigs at the popular student club Trasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/olimpijada-jurek-burek/74103|title=Olimpijada, Jurek, burek|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made one of their first proper TV appearances, lip-synching "Baščaršy Hanumen" on ''Hit meseca'' (Yugoslav counterpart to ''[[Top of the Pops]]'') while hamming it up for the cameras. The album release was followed by a promotional club tour of bigger Yugoslav cities, but since the record was selling poorly with less than 15,000 copies sold, the tour ended quickly and the deflated band members returned to Sarajevo.

Malkolm Muharem soon quit working with the band.

===''Das ist Walter'' released and ''Top lista nadrealista'' starts on television===

A few months later, in April 1984, Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' came out for [[Jugoton]] in limited issue of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label's extremely low commercial expectations. Recorded in immensely modest circumstances and over an unreasonably long period of 7 months due to reasons beyond their control, the album features punk and garage rock sensibility with songs referencing local toponyms and social strata such as an obscure Sarajevo movie theater, Bosnian coal miners, local thugs from various city neighbourhoods, a local hoodlum being incarcerated in the [[Zenica prison]] etc. Its initial sales were nothing to speak of.

Simultaneously with the album release, ''Top lista nadrealista'' moved to television as a weekly sketch comedy programme. The shows started airing on 2 June 1984 on [[BHT 1|TV Sarajevo]]'s channel two as well as on [[Yugoslav Radio Television|JRT]] exchange for the rest of the country. Despite being placed in a milieu well removed from their natural setting — their comedy sketches were essentially fillers in-between [[Narodna muzika|folk music]] numbers — the show eventually proved a good vehicle for reaching a wider audience. After the opening few episodes that were largely met with indifference, the show started gaining a bit of an audience outside of its Sarajevo youth core with whom it had immediately struck a cord.

This gradually increased viewership of ''Top lista nadrealista'' had a positive effect on ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' sales. Riding the buzz created by the TV show as well as the growing popularity of the "Zenica Blues" track (cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "San Quentin"), Karajlić's and Sexon's blend of punk and local storytelling began finding an increasingly receptive audience months after its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.story.rs/intervju/3070-nele-karajlic-trudim-se-da-budem-dobar-tata-i-muz.html Karajlic interview];''Story'', 4 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; No one was more surprised at this turn of events than the label itself as it was forced to order multiple new batches of the album copies on records and cassettes.

New Primitivism as a term also started catching on as Yugoslav media began using it when referencing the band's style or when talking about the television show. Also, another of the more popular songs on the album, "Anarhija All Over Baščaršija" (Anarchy All Over [[Baščaršija]]), explicitly mentions New Primitives, bringing them up in the context of "violent locals from [[Vratnik, Sarajevo|Vratnik]] who listen to [[narodna muzika|Yugoslav folk music]], attack [[hippie]]s, and are repulsed by the [[Western world|West]]".

On 15 September 1984 as ''Top lista nadrealista'' episodes resumed broadcasting following the summer break, the band played Sarajevo's Dom mladih on a bill that also included [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] in front of a raucous crowd of 4,500. The band was officially out of the clubs and now playing larger halls. In October, Zabranjeno Pušenje went to Belgrade for a show at [[Studentski kulturni centar|SKC]] where they were surprised to discover their newly found popularity. In addition to having to add an extra show in the same venue the next day due to popular demand, they also started getting recognized by kids on the street. The two SKC shows launched the band on an extensive and successful Yugoslavia-wide tour; on 4 November 1984 they sold out [[Hala sportova]], a sports arena in Belgrade with 6,000 in attendance. They would end up playing over 60 concerts on that tour.

In parallel, the album sales ended up hitting the 100,000 mark while the term New Primitives also became well established in the process. However, the increased profile also meant increased scrutiny as Karajlić and the band were about to find out.

===The 'Marshall' affair...===
At a concert in [[Rijeka]]'s [[Dvorana Mladosti]] before a crowd of some two and a half thousand people on Tuesday, 27 November 1984, the band inadvertently set off a firestorm of controversy.
{{quote box|quote=''Following my lawyer's advice, the defense I presented at the 'Marshal has croaked' court hearings was continuously denying I ever said the remark they accused me of saying. My lawyer, being an intelligent man fully aware of the particular point in time, politically, in Yugoslavia, knew the extent to which this mad witch-hunt could've gone to had I admitted to actually uttering the remark. He also knew 'Marshal has croaked', which still sounded like blasphemy in 1984, would soon take on a whole different contextual meaning. And really, within a short few years, figuratively speaking, 'Marshal has croaked' became an official political programme for many of the newly founded political parties that were in the process of gaining strength and eventually winning power all over Yugoslavia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0qZHB6XIRs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=50s |title=Glavni tok |agency=RTV Pink |date=1990s}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Nele Karajlić on the 1985-86 verbal offence court case against him|width=20%|align=right}}
During [[soundcheck]] before the show, the band's amplifier went bust to which Karajlić jokingly exclaimed: "Crk'o maršal" (The "Marshall has croaked!"), followed by a pause before adding: "Mislim na pojačalo" ("The [[Marshall Amplification|amplifier]], that is") (a [[switcheroo]] remark about the 1980 death of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]), getting a chuckle from a small group of people within the earshot. Liking the reaction he got during soundcheck, he decided to start the actual concert by delivering the same joke as an explanation to why the show is starting late.

There was hardly any negative reactions during the concert or immediately after it, and the band continued its tour with a triumphant concert at Ledena dvorana in Zagreb in front of 12,000 fans on 10 December 1984. Though a few write-ups mentioning Karajlić's marshal quip appeared in neutral tone in Zagreb-based papers leading up to the concert, it would be the op-ed piece by journalist Veljko Vičević in Rijeka-based daily newspaper ''[[Novi list]]'' that started the avalanche with far-reaching consequences. Headlined "Opak dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Sinister Smoke), Vičević strongly denounces the band for lack of morals and stepping over the line, and additionally reproaches the group members for things they said in the past such as "Tuđe hoćemo/nećemo, svoje nemamo".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQXINde0GM#t=276s Opak dim Zabranjenog pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the initial stone and the signal for numerous bodies of the communist system to criticize the band (as well as, by proxy, new primitives and ''Top lista nadrealista'') on various grounds. The controversy also served to open another front in the row between two internal factions wrestling for the control of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]'s SSO, the provincial branch of the [[League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Socialist Youth League]] (SSOJ), itself a youth wing of the [[one-party state|country's one and only political party]] — [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist League]] (SKJ). Since the Rijeka concert was organized by the local pro-[[Stipe Šuvar|Šuvar]] SSO in Rijeka, the rival pro-[[Vladimir Bakarić|Bakarić]] faction within the organization used Karajlić's Marshal quip to smear the organizing group.

By January 1985, news of the Rijeka flap made it back to Sarajevo where more journalists, most notably Pavle Pavlović in the ''As'' newspaper, were ready to condemn the band further. In his piece headlined "Otrovni dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Poisonous Smoke), Pavlović labels Karajlić's words "an insensitive association and piece of sarcasm that insults right to the heart". The columnist then trails off to even take ideological issue with the humorous sound bytes in radio jingles promoting the December 1984 release of the ''Top lista nadrealista'' radio material on audio cassette by [[Diskoton]]. He continues by predicting that "the young band's life span will be little longer than that of a [[butterfly]]" before adding that "sadly even such short time is enough to indoctrinate the impressionable kids with new thoughts, including continuous ridicule of everything that we've created so far as well as banal, low-brow tampering with the basic tenet of the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War|People's Liberation War]] — Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo". Pavlović concludes by musing "whether the time has come to extinguish Zabranjeno Pušenje's poisonous smoke for good".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/mcsonline/files/shared/Pavle_P.pdf Otrovni dim Zabranjenog Pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://protest.ba/v2/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Otrovni-dim-Zabranjenog-pu%C5%A1enja.jpg Otrovni dim...]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a communist country where verbal offence was defined as a crime and as such punishable by law, Karajlić and other band members were summoned for dozens of police questionings. Communist Yugoslavia had its [[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]]s and public criticism or ridicule, either veiled or open, of Tito, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|party]], or the People's Liberation War was grounds for severe punishment. Karajlić ended up being taken to court with a criminal charge that was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor one in a legal process that stretched on for years.

===...and its consequences===
However, an even bigger problem was that Zabranjeno Pušenje became blacklisted as a result of the Marshal episode. While not banned outright, their songs were taken off radio playlists, their access to television was restricted, and more than 30 of their already booked concerts in early 1985 ended up getting cancelled due to pressure from above that manifested itself through sudden introduction of administrative obstacles such as denying permits for the venues on the day of the show and so on.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Throughout January 1985, the new primitives experienced multiple bizarre manifestations of this sudden anti-Zabranjeno Pušenje hysteria in Sarajevo.

Each January, during winter school break, TV Sarajevo's daytime schedule consisted of various kids' shows reruns, and one such show happened to feature the band's hit song "Zenica Blues". Not being aware of that, the technician running the [[control room]] that day let the show air by mistake. Since Zabranjeno Pušenje were essentially banned from the station, TV Sarajevo executives found it sufficiently necessary to apologize for the oversight later that day in the station's central daily newscast ''Dnevnik 2'' and also to issue temporary suspensions both to the technician as well as to the executive in charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reDtowLheLA#t=733s Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

By association, the hysteria also spread to ''Top lista nadrealista'' activities. While promoting the freshly released audio cassette in Sarajevo containing the best of compilation of 'Top lista nadrealista' radio segment, there was such a stigma attached to the group's activity in the city that not a single journalists was brave enough to show up at the promotional press event at Muzikalije record store in [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer|Štrosmajerova]] Street, fearing that being seen there would be interpreted as a public show of support for beleaguered Karajlić and the rest of his mates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/bs/magazin-etika/cenzura-na-radiju-80-ih Cenzura na radiju 80-ih], media.ba, 6 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to rectify and calm the situation, members of Zabranjeno Pušenje issued a letter to all socio-political organizations within Sarajevo and the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the print media outlets that had been criticizing the band. The gist of the letter was the claim that they never insulted the image and legacy of Comrade Tito thus denying media reports claiming otherwise and labeling them "monstrous lies".&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"&gt;{{cite news|first=Slavoljub|last=Marković|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/02/zabranjeno-pusenje-afera-crko-marsal.html|title=O društveno-političkoj odgovornosti rock-zvezda: Filter ili muštikla|agency=''Reporter''|date=February 1985|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the letter was generally ignored within Sarajevo and SR Bosnia-Herzegovina as the only press outlets to publish it were Zagreb's youth paper ''Polet'' and later Belgrade's ''[[Politika]]''.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Due to all the problems and hassle suddenly associated with organizing a Zabranjeno Pušenje gig, local promoters began avoiding the band despite clear demand for their concerts. Finding itself increasingly isolated in addition to seeing its commercial momentum slip away, the band decided to invest all its energy into organizing a single high-profile gig that would hopefully as much as anything serve as a statement of encouragement for all potential promoters not to shy away from the band. Still, despite selling out [[Hala Pionir]] in Belgrade on Saturday, 16 February 1985 with more than 7,000 people in attendance, the concert didn't have the desired media effect and the band's downward slide continued with gigs now completely dried up.

Facing insurmountable obstacles, the group gave in temporarily, deciding to lay low for some time while some of the members went back to making ''Top lista nadrealista'' on Radio Sarajevo. However, in March 1985, the authorities put an end to that too, removing the segment for good from the radio schedule.

Just as the career of one New Primitivism band, Zabranjeno Pušenje, was suddenly spiraling downhill, another band from the same milieu, [[Plavi Orkestar]], was getting big.

Other bands that at one time or another identified with New Primitives include: [[Bombaj Štampa]], [[Plavi Orkestar]], [[Dinar (band)|Dinar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]], although they quickly moved on to more commercial and communicative forms of expression.

===''Soldatski bal''  hits it big===
Though the torch of New Primitivsm had primarily been carried by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Zabranjeno Pušenje, other bands were also associated with the movement.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PlavOrkestar cover of Svijet June 1985.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Despite [[Plavi Orkestar]]'s fragmentary association with New Primitivism, the movement arguably got its biggest media promotion via the enormous commercial success of the band's debut album ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' in early 1985.]] --&gt;
After splitting with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors following the lacklustre reception of their debut album, crafty manager Malkolm Muharem switched over to another local Sarajevo outfit — [[Plavi Orkestar]] — a band that had also been gigging on the city's student club scene for some time already and was now looking to take the next step by recording and releasing a studio album. Though also starting out as a garage/punk rock group that often crossed paths with Pušenje and EJK (Orkestar's bassist Ćera I even played on Pušenje's demo recordings before joining Orkestar while the bands also often held club gigs together), over time, especially after achieving stable lineup of Loša, Pava, Ćera I, and Ćera II in early summer 1983, Plavi Orkestar moved to more conventional forms of expression within Yugoslav general cultural context. In practice, that meant pretty much abandoning punk in favour of pop and openly flirting with Yugoslav commercial folk in their sound. Though opening doors for them commercially, this practice somewhat placed them on the fringes of New Primitivism. Compared to the two main new primitive outfits, their stage appearance was far more orderly and their lyrics were less cerebral.

Nevertheless, Muharem saw a new opportunity with the four fresh-faced lads each of whom just turned 20 having recently returned to the city from their respective year-long mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army|army]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/o-marusi-razglednici-iz-nisa-i-prestanku-pusenja/100032|title=O Maruši, razglednici iz Niša i prestanku pušenja|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 1984 when Muharem took the youngsters under his wing, the band barely existed as its main creative duo — frontman [[Saša Lošić]] and guitarist Mladen "Pava" Pavičić — were not on speaking terms and Pava left the band. Not deterred, Muharem took the remaining three members to Zagreb and through personal connections got [[Parni Valjak]]'s Husein "Hus" Hasanefendić to record a few more demos with them, while also managing to secure a pre-contract with Jugoton.

The news of the pre-contract signing brought Pavičić back into the fold and by January 1985 all four were off to Zagreb to record in [[SIM studio]]. The album named ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' came out in February 1985 and instantly created a sensation all over Yugoslavia, placing the young band among the most successful Yugoslav rock acts like Bijelo Dugme and [[Riblja Čorba]]. Muharem essentially stayed true to the promotional techniques he previously implemented with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors — print media and soundbytes — though the sarcastic bravado of EJK&amp;HM was now replaced with Plavi Orkestar's dreamy boyish charm. However, this time it had a tremendous commercial effect as the band embarked on a Yugoslavia-wide tour in late summer 1985 with scenes of thousands of screaming and fainting teenage girls repeated in town after town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/11/pop-fenomeni-plavi-orkestar-djeca-su.html Pop fenomeni: Plavi orkestar - Djeca su čisto poludjela!];September 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Named 'Bolje biti pijan nego star' (Better Drunk than Old) after the band's hit track, the tour included 140 concerts in sports arenas and other large venues throughout the country. Muharem additionally hired journalist-turned-filmmaker Goran Gajić to shoot a tour documentary thus reuniting with him two years after Gajić wrote a glowing summer 1983 piece on Elvis J. Kurtović in ''Start''. Furthermore, Gajić directed a video for Plavi Orkestar's hit track "Kad mi kažeš, paša" featuring actresses [[Tanja Bošković]], [[Sonja Savić]], journalist Mirjana Bobić-Mojsilović, and TV personality [[Suzana Mančić]]. The album ended up selling 550,000 copies. Though with unexpected and sudden success the band's sensibility quickly transformed even more into folkish pop as they almost morphed into a sugary [[boy band]], many media outlets still presented them as a new primitive group, giving the movement unprecedented promotion in Yugoslavia during the first half of 1985.

==Reaction and reception==
Initial wider media reaction to the movement wasn't positive. During New Primitivism's nascent stage, following a summer 1983 double-bill concert by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar at Belgrade's SKC, a [[blurb]] appeared in the high-circulation ''[[Politika]]'' daily reviewing the show, but also discussing the movement in general. In his negative review, rock critic Ljuba Trifunović placed New Primitivsm in the same context with commercial [[narodna muzika|folk]] singer [[Lepa Brena]]'s then current flirtation with rock sound ("[[naïve art|naïve]] rock"), expressing disappointment that "both appeared precisely when we began to think [[Yugoslav rock]] finally became immune to such diseases due to [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|new wave]] effectively washing away the so-called '[[Bijelo Dugme#.22Shepherd rock.22 years: rise to fame and .22Dugmemania.22 .281974.E2.80.9379.29|shepherd's rock]]' and all of its derivatives". Seeing New Primitivsm in continuity with several past offerings from the Sarajevo musical scene such as composer [[Nikola Borota Radovan]]'s opus, [[Jutro]], early [[Bijelo Dugme]], and [[Milić Vukašinović]]'s collaboration with [[Hanka Paldum]], Trifunović felt that adjective "new" was entirely superfluous in the movement's name: "Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar are representatives of this renewed and stripped-down [[primitive culture|primitivsm]], and even if some inconsequential differences do exist when comparing the two bands' interpretative [[wikt:dilettante|dilettantism]] (with EJK&amp;HM coming out on top), what's really depressing is their absolute creative [[pathos]] embodied in the creed 'let's be ourselves' - primitive Balkanoids".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];''Politika'', summer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

As the movement got more profiled in late 1983 and especially throughout 1984 with the emergence of Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album and the start of ''Top lista nadrealista'' on television, it began getting better media notices.

In July 1984, rock critic Darko Glavan wrote a detailed opinion piece on New Primitivism in general as well as EJK&amp;HM and Zabranjeno Pušenje specifically. Expressing mild approval, he summarized his personal acceptance of the movement: "If someone likes them, I'm not going to dissuade them, however, if someone doesn't like them, I'm not going to attempt convincing them otherwise". Furthermore, while noting new primitives are deserving of the media attention they've been receiving, he wondered whether they're getting too much publicity because "they are terrific as an added flavourful spice to a developed and varied rock scene, but can hardly function as the dominant trend".&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glavan|first=Darko|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/06/muzicko-leto-1984-darko-glavan-o-novom.html|title=Muzicko leto 1984, Darko Glavan o novom primitivizmu: Imaju li Elvis i Nele pretjerani publicitet?|agency=''Studio''|date=July 1984|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on EJK&amp;HM, he labelled them "Bosnia's answer to [[Sha Na Na]]", before proclaiming them an acceptable form of entertainment for the general masses and a welcome break from incoherent [[art rock]] pretentiousness. Though further expressing skepticism whether this is still enough for a conventional rock career, citing EJK&amp;HM's unwillingness to freshen up their repetitive jokes and yucks as a concern for their long term career prospects.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt; Glavan was more upbeat about Pušenje, finding them to be "more musical, more talented, and in the context of an [[LP record|LP]], simply stronger than EJK&amp;HM". Comparing Pušenje to [[The Clash]] in addition to extolling their artistic ambition that "saves them from becoming one-dimensional caricatures and additionally invokes locally flavoured stylized [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Do You Remember Dolly Bell?|Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]''", Glavan felt that, despite occasionally failing to properly articulate their inventiveness, the band has a fresh voice and a couple of great tracks off their debut album.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt;

[[Goran Bregović]] once referred to New Primitivism as "''the only authentic Yugoslav answer to [[punk subculture|punk]]''".

Novelist [[Miljenko Jergović]] considered it "a general cultural emancipatory movement that was supposed to rid the Bosnians of their eternal [[inferiority complex]] towards Zagreb and Belgrade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];Ogledalo, early 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

In his scathing 1993 rebuke of the movement, Muhidin Džanko, a professor at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, labeled New Primitivism an "exceptionally [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] movement" that "thanks to the charisma of its protagonists, managed to directly obstruct and even eliminate the national feelings of the Bosnian Muslim youth, majority of whom are proud members of the 'new primitive nation'". He furthermore saw the [[poetics]] of New Primitivism to be rooted in its specific language containing "supposed speech patterns and parlance of the Sarajevo [[Baščaršija|čaršija]] and [[mahala]]s", before rejecting it as a "cheap trick meant to lampoon the traditional verbal expression of Sarajevo Muslims and degrade their [[Oriental]] [[lexicology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Džanko|first=Muhidin|url=http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190|title=Sarajevski novi primitivizam - Pokret za destrukciju muslimanskog nacionalnog bića|agency=|date=1993|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoran Kostić (musician)|Zoran "Cane" Kostić]], the [[Partibrejkers]] frontman, wasn't a fan of the movement; in 1997 he mentioned it in passing during an interview: "Bosnians ([[Plavi Orkestar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]]) took over Belgrade sometime around 1986 and it was because of these raucous new primitive guys that they were able to pull that off. They were their [[Trojan Horse]]s. I never got into that new primitive thing precisely because I saw something else in it. I mean, in the end, their schtick enabled all these dumb bands such as [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2436/3.html Ispovest: Zoran Kostic Cane, partibrejker: BEZ TRIKA I FOLIRANJA];''NIN'', 5 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zabranjeno.pusenje1.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] in 1987 during the ''[[Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari]]'' tour.]] --&gt;
New Primitivism as a sub-cultural movement retained prominence well after its demise.

To many it also gained added relevance in the context of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. Books like 2013's ''Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique'' written by Dalibor Mišina, assistant professor of sociology at [[Lakehead University]], devote a significant portion to the study of New Primitivism's overall significance in the last decade of SFR Yugoslavia's existence, arguing that the country could've survived had it adopted values propagated by New Primitivism and similar genres as its new cultural model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Shake-Rattle-Roll-Yugoslav-Critique/dp/1409445658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360563221&amp;sr=1-1 Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique]&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked in 2012 whether New Primitivism was a political or a cultural movement, Nele Karajlić said: {{cquote|''It was a fuckabout that got taken a little too seriously in the end. It was created as our answer to global musical trends that the Western music industry had been manufacturing and launching in regular intervals in order to sell more records. Whenever there's a lull in sales, the industry comes up with something called, say, [[New Romanticism]], for example. And then, a band appears and it's called [[Ultravox]], for example, so we all cut our hair like Ultravox and we buy that thing for a year or year and a half. And then it's time for New Something Else, and the same cycle is repeated over again..... As sensitive and receptive consumers of pop-culture we quickly realized the whole thing is a sham so we decided to "join" the musical industry by coming up with our own movement. New Primitivism would've been genius had it been taken over and fostered by a serious conceptual artist willing to invest at least as much energy in it as those Slovenian dudes did in their [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]]. However, speaking objectively, that was impossible because the guys in NSK took their thing seriously while we never got past the fucking around stage..... I should also add that the biggest difference between New Primitivism and NSK was the fact that "old primitivism" tangibly existed while the "Altslowenische Kunst", strictly speaking, never did''.&lt;ref&gt;"Smisao nadrealizma dr.

Discussing the interest New Primitivism has been getting from social scientific circles, Elvis J. Kurtović wrote in his online column in 2013: {{cquote|''Once in a blue moon, I'll get a call from someone saying they're a researcher working at some university and they want to ask me questions about New Primitivism. My immediate reaction is to fuck with them. However, when they later send me a nicely bound hardcover book, I must say I'm filled with pride. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than seeing 30-year-old crap I wrote purely out of spite, indolence, or malevolence, now translated into English and dissected by serious people for deeper meaning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/hoce-hoce-al/101470|title=Hoće, hoće, al'...|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10066">In applied mathematics – specifically in [[fuzzy logic]] – the '''ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators''' provide a [[parameter]]ized class of mean type aggregation operators. They were introduced by [[Ronald R. Yager]]. Many notable mean operators such as the max, [[arithmetic average]], median and min, are members of this class. They have been widely used in [[computational intelligence]] because of their ability to model linguistically expressed aggregation instructions.

== Definition ==

Formally an '''OWA''' operator of dimension &lt;math&gt; \ n &lt;/math&gt; is a mapping &lt;math&gt; F: R_n \rightarrow R &lt;/math&gt; that has an associated collection of weights &lt;math&gt; \  W = [w_1, \ldots, w_n] &lt;/math&gt; lying in the unit interval and summing to one and with 		

:&lt;math&gt; F(a_1, \ldots , a_n) =  \sum_{j=1}^n  w_j b_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; b_j &lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; largest of the &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt;.

By choosing different ''W'' one can implement different aggregation operators. The OWA operator is a non-linear operator as a result of the process of determining the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Properties ==

The OWA operator is a mean operator. It is [[Bounded operator|bounded]], [[monotonic]], [[symmetric operator|symmetric]], and [[idempotent]], as defined below.

{|class="wikitable"
|[[Bounded operator|Bounded]]
|&lt;math&gt;   \min(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \le F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \le \max(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[Monotonic]]
|&lt;math&gt;   F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \ge F(g_1, \ldots, g_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; a_i \ge g_i &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\ i = 1,2,\ldots,n &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[symmetric operator|Symmetric]]
|&lt;math&gt;   F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)  = F(a_\boldsymbol{\pi(1)}, \ldots, a_\boldsymbol{\pi(n)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\pi} &lt;/math&gt; is a permutation map
|-
|[[Idempotent]]
|&lt;math&gt;  \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)  =  a &lt;/math&gt; if all &lt;math&gt; \ a_i = a &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Notable OWA operators ==
:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \max(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_1 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j \ne 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \min(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; j \ne n &lt;/math&gt;
:
:&lt;math&gt; \ F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \mathrm{average}(a_1, \ldots, a_n) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \ w_j = \frac{1}{n} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; j \in [1, n] &lt;/math&gt;

== Characterizing features ==

Two features have been used to characterize the OWA operators. The first is the attitudinal character(orness).

This is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;A-C(W)= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j=1}^n (n - j) w_j. &lt;/math&gt;

It is known that &lt;math&gt; A-C(W) \in [0, 1] &lt;/math&gt;.

In addition ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''C''(max) = 1, A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(ave) = A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(med) = 0.5 and A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C(min) = 0. Thus the A&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;C goes from 1 to 0 as we go from Max to Min aggregation. The attitudinal character characterizes the similarity of aggregation to OR operation(OR is defined as the Max).

The second feature is the dispersion. This defined as

:&lt;math&gt;H(W) = -\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \ln (w_j).&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative definition is &lt;math&gt;E(W) = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 .&lt;/math&gt; The dispersion characterizes how uniformly the arguments are being used

== A literature survey: OWA (1988-2014)==
The historical reconstruction of scientific development of the OWA field, the identification of the dominant direction of knowledge accumulation that emerged since the publication of the first OWA paper, and to discover the most active lines of research has recently been published, (see: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21673/full). The results suggest, as expected, that Yager's paper[1] (IEEE Trans. Systems Man Cybernet, 18(1), 183–190, 1988) is the most influential paper and the starting point of all other research using OWA. Starting from his contribution, other lines of research developed and we describe them. Full list of papers published in OWA is also available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/int.21673/full)

== Type-1 OWA aggregation operators ==

The above Yager's OWA operators are used to aggregate the crisp values. Can we aggregate fuzzy sets in the OWA mechanism ? The
'''[[Type-1 OWA operators]]''' have been proposed for this purpose. So the '''[[type-1 OWA operators]]''' provides us with a new technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and data mining, where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

The '''[[Type-1 OWA operators|type-1 OWA operator]]''' is defined according to the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets as follows:

Given the ''n'' linguistic weights &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse &lt;math&gt;U = [0,\;\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, then for each &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,\;1]&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level type-1 OWA operator with &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-level sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {W_\alpha ^i } \right\}_{i = 1}^n &lt;/math&gt; to aggregate the &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;-cuts of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {A^i} \right\}_{i =1}^n &lt;/math&gt; is given as

: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi_\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right) =\left\{ {\frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} } }{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } }\left| {w_i \in W_\alpha ^i ,\;a_i } \right. \in A_\alpha ^i ,\;i = 1, \ldots ,n} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W_\alpha ^i= \{w| \mu_{W_i }(w) \geq \alpha \}, A_\alpha ^i=\{ x| \mu _{A_i }(x)\geq \alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma :\{\;1, \ldots ,n\;\} \to \{\;1, \ldots ,n\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation function such that &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} \ge a_{\sigma (i + 1)} ,\;\forall \;i = 1, \ldots ,n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_{\sigma (i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th largest
element in the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ {a_1 , \ldots ,a_n } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The computation of the '''[[Type-1 OWA operators|type-1 OWA]]''' output is implemented by computing the left end-points and right end-points of the intervals &lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \ldots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_ {+},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\alpha ^i=[A_{\alpha-}^i, A_{\alpha+}^i], W_\alpha ^i=[W_{\alpha-}^i, W_{\alpha+}^i]&lt;/math&gt;. Then membership function of resulting aggregation fuzzy set is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu _{G} (x) = \mathop \vee _{\alpha :x \in \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots
,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_\alpha } \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots ,A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{-} = \min\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi _\alpha \left( {A_\alpha ^1 , \cdots , A_\alpha ^n } \right)_{+} = \max\limits_{\begin{array}{l} W_{\alpha - }^i \le w_i \le W_{\alpha + }^i  A_{\alpha - }^i \le a_i \le A_{\alpha + }^i  \end{array}} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {w_i a_{\sigma (i)} / \sum\limits_{i =
1}^n {w_i } } &lt;/math&gt;

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.191 This paper] has presented a fast method to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently.

'''Papyrus''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ə|s}} is a material similar to thick [[paper]] that was used in ancient times as a [[writing surface]]. It was made from the [[pith]] of the papyrus plant, ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'', a wetland [[sedge]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Letter on Papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An official letter on a papyrus of the 3rd century BCE]]
Papyrus is first known to have been used in [[Egypt]] (at least as far back as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]]), as the papyrus plant was once abundant across the [[Nile Delta]]. It was also used [[History of the Mediterranean|throughout the Mediterranean]] region and in the [[Kingdom of Kush]]. Apart from a writing material, ancient Egyptians employed papyrus in the construction of other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], such as [[reed boats]], [[mat]]s, [[rope]], [[sandals]], and [[basket]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebers Papyrus|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177583/Ebers-papyrus|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paper and Books in Ancient Egypt: An Inaugural Lecture Delivered at University College London, 29 May 1947''. London: H. K. Lewis. (Reprinted Chicago: Ares Publishers Inc., 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Sheets of parchment were folded to form quires from which [[Codex|book-form codices]] were fashioned. [[List of early Christian writers|Early Christian writers]] soon adopted the codex form, and in the Græco-Roman world, it became common to cut sheets from papyrus rolls to form codices.

Codices were an improvement on the papyrus scroll, as the papyrus was not pliable enough to fold without cracking and a long roll, or scroll, was required to create large-volume texts. Papyrus had the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce, but it was fragile and susceptible to both moisture and excessive dryness. Unless the papyrus was of perfect quality, the writing surface was irregular, and the range of media that could be used was also limited.

Papyrus was replaced in Europe by the cheaper, locally produced products [[parchment]] and [[vellum]], of significantly higher durability in moist climates, though [[Henri Pirenne]]'s connection of its disappearance with the Muslim conquest of Egypt is contested.&lt;ref&gt;Pirenne, ''Mohammed and Charlemagne'', critiqued by R.S. Lopez, "Mohammed and Charlemagne: a revision", ''Speculum'' (1943:14–38.).&lt;/ref&gt; Its last appearance in the [[Merovingian]] chancery is with a document of 692, though it was known in [[Gaul]] until the middle of the following century. The latest certain dates for the use of papyrus are 1057 for a papal decree (typically conservative, all [[papal bull]]s were on papyrus until 1022), under [[Pope Victor II]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Diringer]], ''The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1087 for an Arabic document. Its use in Egypt continued until it was replaced by more inexpensive [[paper]] introduced by the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] who originally learned of it from the Chinese. By the 12th century, parchment and paper were in use in the [[Byzantine Empire]], but papyrus was still an option.&lt;ref name=Byzantine&gt;Bompaire, Jacques and Jean Irigoin. ''La paleographie grecque et byzantine'', Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1977, 389 n. 6, cited in Alice-Mary Talbot (ed.). ''Holy women of Byzantium'', Dumbarton Oaks, 1996, p. 227. {{ISBN|0-88402-248-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Papyrus was made in several qualities and prices. [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Isidore of Seville]] described six variations of papyrus which were sold in the Roman market of the day. These were graded by quality based on how fine, firm, white, and smooth the writing surface was. Grades ranged from the superfine Augustan, which was produced in sheets of 13 digits (10 inches) wide, to the least expensive and most coarse, measuring six digits (four inches) wide.

He wrote about the content of the [[Leyden papyrus X|Leyden papyrus]], published in 1830. The first publication has been credited to the British scholar [[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]] (1817–1878), who published for the [[Cambridge Antiquarian Society]], one of the [[Papyri Graecae Magicae]] V, translated into English with commentary in 1853.&lt;ref name="Betz" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[English language|English]] word "papyrus" derives, via [[Latin]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] πάπυρος (''papyros''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Fpuros πάπυρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; a loanword of unknown (perhaps [[Pre-Greek]]) origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1151.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek has a second word for it, βύβλος (''byblos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbu%2Fblos βύβλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; said to derive from the name of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Byblos]]). The Greek writer [[Theophrastus]], who flourished during the 4th century BCE, uses ''papyros'' when referring to the plant used as a foodstuff and ''byblos'' for the same plant when used for nonfood products, such as cordage, basketry, or writing surfaces. The more specific term βίβλος ''biblos'', which finds its way into English in such words as 'bibliography', 'bibliophile', and 'bible', refers to the inner bark of the papyrus plant. ''Papyrus'' is also the etymon of 'paper', a similar substance.

In the [[Egyptian language]], papyrus was called ''wadj'' (''w3ḏ''), ''tjufy'' (''ṯwfy''), or ''djet'' (''ḏt'').

== Documents written on papyrus ==
[[File:Papyrus bill of sale donkey.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bill of sale for a donkey, papyrus; 19.3 by 7.2&amp;nbsp;cm, MS Gr SM2223, Houghton Library, Harvard University]]

The word for the material papyrus is also used to designate documents written on sheets of it, often rolled up into scrolls. The plural for such documents is papyri. Historical papyri are given identifying names—generally the name of the discoverer, first owner or institution where they are kept—and numbered, such as "[[Papyrus Harris I]]". Often an abbreviated form is used, such as "pHarris I". These documents provide important information on ancient writings; they give us the only extant copy of [[Menander]], the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]], Egyptian treatises on medicine (the [[Ebers Papyrus]]) and on surgery (the [[Edwin Smith papyrus]]), Egyptian mathematical treatises (the [[Rhind papyrus]]), and Egyptian folk tales (the [[Westcar papyrus]]). When, in the 18th century, a library of ancient papyri was found in [[Herculaneum]], ripples of expectation spread among the learned men of the time. However, since these papyri were badly charred, their unscrolling and deciphering is still going on today.

== Manufacture and use ==
[[File:Papyrus sheet.svg|thumb|right|Different ways of cutting papyrus stem and making of papyrus sheet]]
[[File:kew.gardens.papyrus.plant.arp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Papyrus plant ''Cyperus papyrus'' at Kew Gardens, London]]
[[File:Cyperus papyrus-pjt3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Papyrus plants near [[Syracuse, Sicily]]]]

Papyrus is made from the stem of the papyrus plant, ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]''. The outer rind is first removed, and the sticky fibrous inner [[pith]] is cut lengthwise into thin strips of about {{convert|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. The strips are then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle. The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for [[decomposition]] to begin, perhaps increasing adhesion, but this is not certain. The two layers possibly were glued together.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Greek and Latin Palaeography'', Maunde Thompson. [https://archive.org/details/greeklatin00thomuoft archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; While still moist, the two layers are hammered together, mashing the layers into a single sheet. The sheet is then dried under pressure. After drying, the sheet is polished with some rounded object, possibly a stone or seashell or round hardwood.&lt;ref&gt;Bierbrier, Morris Leonard, ed. 1986. ''Papyrus: Structure and Usage''. British Museum Occasional Papers 60, ser. ed. Anne Marriott. London: British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheets could be cut to fit the obligatory size or glued together to create a longer roll. A wooden stick would be attached to the last sheet in a roll, making it easier to handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|year=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; To form the long strip scrolls required, a number of such sheets were united, placed so all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll's length were on one side and all the vertical fibres on the other. Normally, texts were first written on the ''[[recto]]'', the lines following the fibres, parallel to the long edges of the scroll. Secondarily, papyrus was often reused, writing across the fibres on the ''[[verso]]''.&lt;ref name = Skeat/&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] describes the methods of preparing papyrus in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.

In a dry [[climate]], like that of Egypt, papyrus is stable, formed as it is of highly rot-resistant [[cellulose]]; but storage in humid conditions can result in [[mold]]s attacking and destroying the material. Library papyrus rolls were stored in wooden boxes and chests made in the form of statues. Papyrus scrolls were organized according to subject or author, and identified with clay labels that specified their contents without having to unroll the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=Skyhorse|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European conditions, papyrus seems to have lasted only a matter of decades; a 200-year-old papyrus was considered extraordinary. Imported papyrus once commonplace in [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] has since deteriorated beyond repair, but papyri are still being found in Egypt; extraordinary examples include the [[Elephantine papyri]] and the famous finds at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Nag Hammadi]]. The [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], containing the library of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BCE)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], [[Julius Caesar]]'s father-in-law, was preserved by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]], but has only been partially excavated.

Sporadic attempts to revive the manufacture of papyrus have been made since the mid-18th century. [[Scotland|Scottish]] explorer [[James Bruce]] experimented in the late 18th century with papyrus plants from the [[Sudan]], for papyrus had become extinct in Egypt. Also in the 18th century, [[Sicily|Sicilian]] Saverio Landolina manufactured papyrus at [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], where papyrus plants had continued to grow in the wild.  During the 1920s, when Egyptologist [[Battiscombe Gunn]] lived in [[Maadi]], outside Cairo, he experimented with the manufacture of papyrus, growing the plant in his garden. He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen, and produced successful examples of papyrus, one of which was exhibited in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.&lt;ref name=Cerny&gt;{{cite book   | first = Jaroslav   | last = Cerny  | title = Paper and books in Ancient Egypt  | publisher = H. K. Lewis &amp; Co.

Both Sicily and Egypt have centres of limited papyrus production.

Papyrus is still used by communities living in the vicinity of swamps, to the extent that rural householders derive up to 75% of their income from swamp goods.&lt;ref&gt;(Maclean et al. 2003b; c).&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in East and Central Africa, people harvest papyrus, which is used to manufacture items that are sold or used locally. Examples include baskets, hats, fish traps, trays or winnowing mats, and floor mats.&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, S. 2000. ''Papyrus and its Uses in Modern Day Russia'', Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;56–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Papyrus is also used to make roofs, ceilings, rope and fences. Although alternatives, such as [[eucalyptus]], are increasingly available, papyrus is still used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, I.M.D., R. Tinch, M. Hassall and R.R. Boar. 2003c.

B.|title=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments (8)5|year=1999|pages=241–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptualization of presence borrows from multiple fields including [[communication]], [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[science]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]], and the arts. The concept of presence accounts for a variety of computer applications and Web-based entertainment today that are developed on the fundamentals of the phenomenon, in order to give people the sense of, as Sheridan called it, “being there." &lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;

==Evolution of 'presence' as a concept==

[[File:Typology of human experience in virtual.png|thumb|right|Typology of human experience in the study of presence]]
The specialist use of the word “presence” derives from the term “[[telepresence]]”, coined by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] professor [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=minsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minsky|first=M|title=Telepresence|journal=MIT Press Journals|date=June 1980|pages=45–51|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/pres}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=steuer&gt;{{cite web|last=Steuer|first=J.|title=Defining virtual reality: Dimensions determining telepresence.|url=http://www.presence-research.org/papers/steuer92defining.pdf|accessdate=April 29, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924185705/http://www.presence-research.org/papers/steuer92defining.pdf|archivedate=September 24, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minsky's research explained telepresence as the manipulation of objects in the real world through remote access technology.&lt;ref name=minsky /&gt; For example, a surgeon may use a computer to control robotic arms to perform minute procedures on a patient in another room. Or a NASA technician may use a computer to control a rover to collect rock samples on Mars. In either case, the operator is granted access to real, though remote, places via televisual tools.

As technologies progressed, the need for an expanded term arose. Sheridan extrapolated Minsky’s original definition.&lt;ref name=sheridan1&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheridan|first=T. B.|title=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments (1)|year=1992|pages=120–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the shorter “presence,” Sheridan explained that the term refers to the effect felt when controlling real world objects remotely as well as the effect people feel when they interact with and immerse themselves in virtual reality or virtual environments.&lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;

[[File:Lombard conceptulization of presence.png|thumb|left|Lombard's conceptualization of presence]]

Lombard and Ditton went a step further and enumerated six conceptualizations of presence:&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;

# presence can be a sense of social richness, the feeling one gets from social interaction
# presence can be a sense of realism, such as computer-generated environments looking, feeling, or otherwise seeming real
# presence can be a sense of transportation. This is a more complex concept than the traditional feeling of one being there. Transportation also includes users feeling as though something is “here” with them or feeling as though they are sharing common space with another person together
# presence can be a sense of immersion, either through the senses or through the mind
# presence can provide users with the sense they are social actors within the medium. No longer passive viewers, users, via presence, gain a sense of interactivity and control
# presence can be a sense of the medium as a social actor.

Lombard's work discusses the extent to which 'presence' is felt, and how strong the perception of presence is regarded without the media involved.&lt;ref name=lombard/&gt;  The article reviews the contextual characteristics that contribute to an individual's feeling presence.  The most important variables that are important in the determinants of presence are those that involve sensory richness or vividness - and the number and consistency of sensory outputs.&lt;ref name=steuer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steuer|first=Jonathan|title=Defining virtual realities: Dimensions determining telepresence|journal=Communication in the Age of Virtual Reality|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers believe that the greater the number of human senses for which a medium provides stimulation, the greater the capability of the medium to produce a sense of presence.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;&lt;ref name=steuer /&gt;  Additional important aspects of a medium are visual display characteristics (image quality, image size, viewing distance, motion and color, dimensionality, camera techniques) as well as aural presentation characteristics, stimuli for other senses (interactivity, obtrusiveness of medium, live versus recorded or constructed experience, number of people), content variables (social realism, use of media conventions, nature of task or activity), and media user variables (willingness to suspend disbelief, knowledge of and prior experience with the medium).&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;  Lombard also discusses the effects of presence, including both physiological and psychological consequences of "the perceptual illusion of nonmediation." &lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;
Physiological effects of presence may include arousal, or vection and simulation sickness, while psychological effects may include enjoyment, involvement, task performance, skills training, desensitization, persuasion, memory and social judgement, or [[parasocial interaction]] and relationships.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;

[[File:Lee typology of virtual experience.png|thumb|right|Lee's typology of virtual experience]]

Presence has been delineated into subtypes, such as physical-, social-, and self-presence.&lt;ref name=lee /&gt; Lombard's working definition was "a psychological state in which virtual objects are experienced as actual objects in either sensory or nonsensory ways." &lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;  Later extensions expanded the definition of "virtual objects" to specify that they may be either para-authentic or artificial.  Further development of the concept of "psychological state" has led to study of the mental mechanism that permits humans to feel presence when using media or simulation technologies.&lt;ref name=lee /&gt;  One approach is to conceptualize presence as a cognitive feeling, that is, to take spatial presence as feedback from unconscious cognitive processes that inform conscious thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Thomas W.|title=A New Conception of Spatial Presence: Once Again, with Feeling|journal=Communication Theory|year=2009|volume=19|issue=2|pages=161–187|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2009.01340.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

Several studies provide insight into the concept of media influencing behavior.

*Cheryl Bracken and Lombard suggested that people, especially children, interact with computers socially.&lt;ref name=bracken&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bracken|first=C|author2=Lombard, M|title=Social presence and children: Praise, intrinsic motivation, and learning with computers|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2004|volume=54|pages=22–37|doi=10.1093/joc/54.1.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found, via their study, that children who received positive encouragement from a computer were more confident in their ability, were more motivated, recalled more of a story and recognized more features of a story than those children who received only neutral comments from their computer.
*Nan, Anghelcev, Myers, Sar, and Faber found that the inclusion of anthropomorphic agents that relied on artificial intelligence on a Web site had positive effect on people’s attitudes toward the site.&lt;ref name=nan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nan|first=X|author2=Anghelcev, G. |author3=Myers, J. R. |author4=Sar, S. |author5=Faber, R. J. |title=What if a website can talk? Exploring the persuasive effects of web-based anthropomorphic agents.|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2006|volume=83|issue=3|pages=615–631|doi=10.1177/107769900608300309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research of Bracken and Lombard and Nan et al. also speak to the concept of presence as transportation.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;&lt;ref name=bracken /&gt;&lt;ref name=nan /&gt; The transportation in this case refers to the computer-generated identity. Users, through their interaction, have a sense that these fabricated personalities are really “there”.
*Communication has been a central pillar of presence since the term’s conception.&lt;ref name=presence-research.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Presence-Research.org|url=http://www.presence-research.org/|work=Welcome|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many applications of the Internet today largely depend on virtual presence since its conception.&lt;ref name=ISPR&gt;{{cite web|title=International Society for Presence Research|url=http://www.ispr.info/|work=About ISPR|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheingold and Turkle offered MUDs, or multi-user dungeons, as early examples of how communication developed a sense of [[web presence|presence on the Web]] prior to the graphics-heavy existence it has developed today.&lt;ref name=rheingold /&gt;  “MUDs...[are] imaginary worlds in computer databases where people use words and programming languages to improvise melodramas, build worlds and all the objects in them, solve puzzles, invent amusements and tools, compete for prestige and power, gain wisdom, seek revenge, indulge greed and lust and violent impulses."&lt;ref name=rheingold&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheingold|first=H|title=The virtual community: Homesteading on the electronic frontier.|year=1993|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Rheingold focused on the environmental sense of presence that communication provided, Turkle focused on the individual sense of presence that communication provided.  “MUDs are a new kind of virtual parlor game and a new form of community. In addition, text-based MUDs are a new form of collaboratively written literature. MUD players are MUD authors, the creators as well as consumers of media content. In this, participating in a MUD has much in common with script writing, performance art, street theater, improvisational theater – or even commedia dell’arte." &lt;ref name=rheingold /&gt;&lt;ref name=turkle&gt;{{cite book|last=Turkle|first=S|title=Life on the screen: Identity in the age of the Internet.|year=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Further blurring the lines of behavioral spheres, Gabriel Weimann wrote that media scholars have found that virtual experiences are very similar to real-life experiences, and people can confuse their own memories and have trouble remembering if those experiences were mediated or not.&lt;ref name=weimann&gt;{{cite book|last=Weimann|first=G|title=Communicating unreality: Modern media and the reconstruction of reality.|year=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philipp, Vanman, and Storrs demonstrated that unconscious feelings of social presence in a virtual environment can be invoked with relatively impoverished social representations.&lt;ref name=philipp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philipp|first=MC|author2=Storrs, K|author3=Vanman, E|title=Sociality of facial expressions in immersive virtual environments: A facial EMG study|journal=Biological Psychology|year=2012|volume=91|pages=17–21|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The esearchers found that the mere presence of virtual humans in an immersive environment caused people to be more emotionally expressive than when they were alone in the environment. The research suggests that even relatively impoverished social representations can lead to people to behave more socially in an immersive environment.

==Presence in popular culture==
*Sheridan's view of presence earned its first pop culture reference in 1984 with [[William Gibson]]’s pre-[[World Wide Web]] science fiction novel "[[Neuromancer]]", which tells the story of a cyberpunk cowboy of sorts who accesses a virtual world to hack into organizations.&lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;
*[[Joshua Meyrowitz]]'s 1986 "[[Joshua Meyrowitz#No Sense of Place|No Sense of Place]]" discusses the impact of electronic media on social behavior.&lt;ref name=meyrowitz&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyrowitz|first=Joshua|title=No sense of place : the impact of electronic media on social behavior|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-504231-3|edition=12. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel discusses how social situations are transformed by media.  Media, he claims, can change one's 'sense of place,'by mixing traditionally private versus public behaviors - or [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|back-stage and front-stage behaviors]], respectively, as coined by [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=goffman&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=The presentation of self in everyday life|year=1990|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=978-0140135718|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meyrowitz suggests that television alone will transform the practice of front-stage and back-stage behaviors, as television would provide increased information to different groups who may physically not have access to specific communities but through [[media consumption]] are able to determine a mental place within the program.  He references [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s concept that '[[the medium is the message]],' and that media provide individuals with access to information.&lt;ref name=mcluhan&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man|year=1964|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With new and changing media, Meyrowitz says that the patterns of information and shifting accesses to information change social settings, and help do determine a sense of place and behavior.  With the logic that behavior is connected to information flow, Meyrowitz states that front- and back-stage behaviors are blurred and may be impossible to untangle.

'''Revegetation''' is the process of replanting and rebuilding the [[soil]] of disturbed land. This may be a natural process produced by [[plant]] colonization and [[Ecological succession|succession]], manmade [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] projects, accelerated process designed to repair damage to a [[landscape]] due to [[wildfire]], [[mining]], [[flood]], or other cause. Originally the process was simply one of applying [[seed]] and [[fertilizer]] to disturbed lands, usually [[grass]]es or [[clover]]. The fibrous [[root]] network of grasses is useful for short-term erosion control, particularly on sloping ground. Establishing long-term plant communities requires forethought as to appropriate species for the climate, size of stock required, and impact of replanted vegetation on local fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Revegetating Riparian Areas in the Southwest “Lessons Learned” David R. Dreesen, Agronomist/Horticulturist Gregory A. Fenchel, Manager USDA–NRCS Los Lunas Plant Materials Center&lt;/ref&gt; The motivations behind revegetation are diverse, answering needs that are both technical and aesthetic, but it is usually [[erosion]] prevention that is the primary reason. Revegetation helps prevent [[soil erosion]], enhances the ability of the soil to absorb more water in significant rain events, and in conjunction reduces [[turbidity]] dramatically in adjoining bodies of water. Revegetation also aids protection of engineered grades and other earthworks.&lt;ref&gt;A Revegetation Manual For Alaska Stoney J. Wright 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==For conservation==
Revegetation is often used to join up patches of natural habitat that have been lost, and can be a very important tool in places where much of the natural vegetation has been cleared. It is therefore particularly important in urban environments, and research in [[Brisbane]] has shown that revegetation projects can significantly improve urban bird populations&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, D.F., Miller, C., Possingham, H.P. &amp; Fuller, R.A. 2011. The influence of patch area and connectivity on avian communities in urban revegetation. ''[http://www.fullerlab.org/reveg-shanaha/'' Biological Conservation, 144, 722–729].&lt;/ref&gt; The Brisbane study showed that connecting a revegetation patch with existing habitat improved bird species richness, while simply concentrating on making large patches of habitat was the best way to increase bird abundance. Revegetation plans therefore need to consider how the revegetated sites are connected with existing habitat patches. Revegetation in agricultural areas can support breeding bird populations, but often it supports more common species, rather than those that are in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00442-008-1221-9 | doi=10.1007/s00442-008-1221-9 | volume=159 | title=Native bird breeding in a chronosequence of revegetated sites | journal=Oecologia | pages=435–446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil replacement==
[[Mine reclamation]] may involve soil amendment, replacement, or creation, particularly for areas that have been [[strip mining|strip mined]] or suffered severe [[erosion]] or [[soil compaction]]. In some cases, the native soil may be removed prior to construction and replaced with fill for the duration of the work. After construction is completed, the fill is again removed and replaced with the reserved native soil for revegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Revegetation restoration for culvert replacement in a wetland Ashenhurst, Amber;Polzin, Mary Louise 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mycorrhizal communities==
[[Mycorrhizae]], [[symbiotic]] [[fungal]]-plant communities, are important to the success of revegetation efforts. Most woody plant species need these root-fungi communities to thrive, and nursery or [[greenhouse]] transplants may not have sufficient or correct mycorrhizae for good survival. Regional differences in ectomycorrhizal fungi may also affect the success of revegetation.

The '''rhetoric of technology''' is both an object and field of study. It refers to the ways in which makers and consumers of technology talk about and make decisions regarding technology and also the influence that technology has on discourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Studies of the rhetoric of technology are interdisciplinary. Scholars in communication, media ecology, and science studies research the rhetoric of technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Technical communication]] scholars are also concerned with the rhetoric of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durack|first=Katherine|date=1997|title=Gender, Technology, and the History of Technical Communication|url=|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=6:3|pages=249–260|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "rhetoric of technology" gained prominence with rhetoricians in the 1970s, and the study developed in conjunction with interest in the [[rhetoric of science]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/198203|title=The Prospect of rhetoric; report of the national developmental project, sponsored by Speech Communication Association.|date=1971|publisher=Prentice-Hall|others=Bitzer, Lloyd F.,, Black, Edwin, 1929-, Wallace, Karl Richards, 1905-1973., Speech Communication Association., National Conference on Rhetoric (1970 : St. Charles, Ill.)|isbn=0137313314|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.,|oclc=198203}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars have worked to maintain a distinction between the two fields. Rhetoric of technology criticism addresses several issues related to technology and employs many concepts, including several from the canon of classical rhetoric, for example ''[[ethos]]'', but the field has also adopted contemporary approaches, such as new materialism.

== Definition ==
While the definition and scope of [[rhetoric]] is contested, scholars in the discipline, or rhetoricians, study the capacity of symbols to create change and influence perspectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Often, rhetoricians study discourse and texts, but they also study objects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Technology]] is both techniques and objects that embody and enact techniques.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, rhetoric of technology scholars may look at texts and discourse associated with technology or techniques and technological objects. Concerns of rhetoric of technology include the influence of technology on public deliberation, conceptions of the self, and how new technologies come to be developed and adopted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42922325|title=The languages of Edison's light|last=Charles.|first=Bazerman,|date=1999|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262523264|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=42922325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Scholars who study rhetoric of technology have argued that it should be treated as distinct from the [[rhetoric of science]]. Charles Bazerman offers three distinctions between rhetoric of technology and rhetoric of science. First, unlike science, technology has always been intertwined with other clearly rhetorical endeavors, such as commerce and finance. Second, while the discourse of science often works towards specialization, the discourse of technology is pervasive. We may not all conduct experiments, but we all interact with and operate technology. Lastly, the products of technology are mostly material while the products of science are mostly symbols.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bazerman|first=Charles|date=1998|title=The Production of Technology and the Production of Human Meaning|url=|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|volume=12:3|pages=381–387|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Miller argues that rhetoric of science must be treated as distinct from rhetoric of technology because technology and science differ in motivation, criteria of judgment, and values.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Carolyn|date=1978|title=Technology as a Form of Consciousness: A Study of Contemporary Ethos|url=|journal=Central States Speech Journal|volume=29:4|pages=228–236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Scholars started to suggest the importance of studying rhetoric of technology in the 1970s alongside a growing interest in rhetoric of science.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thomas W. Benson and Gerard A. Hauser referred to the "rhetoric of technology" in a book review published in 1973 and noted the shared concern of rhetoric and technology with technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Thomas W.|last2=Hauser|first2=Gerard A.|date=1973|title=Ideals, superlatives, and the decline of hypocrisy|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=59:1|pages=99–105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Carolyn Miller wrote “Technology as a Form of Consciousness: A Study of Contemporary Ethos.” In addition to explaining why rhetoric of technology should be treated separately from science, Miller argues that technology gives rise to a particular ''ethos,'' or personal character, because it generates particular actions and a particular consciousness. She concludes that technological consciousness assumes an objective perspective that erodes ''ethos''. Within technological consciousness, actions are right or wrong regardless of cultural possibilities because assessments are assumed to be objective.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In a series of oral histories collected by the Association for the Rhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine, scholars familiar with both fields recognized that there has been more research addressing the rhetoric of science than comparable work on technology. Carolyn Miller suggested that one reason for the relative lack of rhetoric of technology scholarship is that it is harder to find relevant texts to analyze. Miller noted that many of the primary texts dealing with technology are private company documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ARSTonline|title=ARST Oral History Project--An Interview with Dr. Carolyn Miller|date=2013-06-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz_rN8g8WN0|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Materialism and New Materialism ===
In 1980 [[Langdon Winner]] wrote the article “Do Artifacts Have Politics?” Winner suggests that objects reflect and enact ideological perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|date=Winter 1980|title=Do Artifacts Have Politics?|url=|journal=Daedalus|volume=109| issue =  1, Modern Technology:  Problem or Opportunity?|pages=121–136|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winner's idea shares much in common with a materialist approach to rhetoric of technology. Materialist approaches to rhetoric of technology are related to [[materialism]] and treat technological objects the same as they may treat a text by critiquing how objects persuade and influence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Jeremy Packer and Stephen B. Wiley provide an overview of new materialist approaches to rhetoric in their book ''Communication Matters: Materialist Approaches to Media''. Packer and Wiley conceptualize materiality as a “corrective” to the concept of communication as intangible. They suggest that the corrective is in response to a “poststructuralist impasse” in the field of communication, rhetoric, and media studies. They outline two approaches to materiality: 1) to equate materiality with physicality and approach infrastructure, body, space, and technology as fields of communication and 2) to analyze the materiality of communication itself, the physiological, mechanical, or digital media of communication. Packer and Wiley also identify key themes that are explored in materialist approaches: economy, discourse, technology, space, and bodies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/694393761|title=Communication matters : materialist approaches to media, mobility and networks|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|others=Packer, Jeremy., Wiley, Stephen B. Crofts.|isbn=9780415782241|location=London|oclc=694393761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethos ===
In her 1978 article “Technology as a Form of Consciousness: A Study of Contemporary Ethos,” Carolyn Miller argued that technology was fundamentally changing how individuals judge personal character. She suggested that the ultimate result of a technological consciousness would be to erode a concern with ''ethos'' as technology would prevail in presenting actions and decision as objectively right or wrong. If all decisions are objective, then there is no longer a need for judgments of character.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In a 1992 article, Steven B. Katz employed Miller's "technological consciousness" to help explain the rhetoric used by members of the Nazi regime to enact the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Steven B.|date=1992|title=The Ethic of Expediency: Classical Rhetoric, Technology, and the Holocaust|url=|journal=College English|volume=54 |issue=3|pages=255–75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Miller revisited the relationship between ''ethos'' and technology in an exploration of the impact of human-computer interaction. She explores two modes of human-computer interaction: expert systems versus intelligent agents. She argues that in both modes of interaction subjectivity blurs between the human-user and the computer, creating a hybrid (borrowing from [[Bruno Latour]]) or cyborg (borrowing from [[Donna Haraway]]). Expert systems are designed to mimic human experts; they typically draw from a deep database of information. Intelligent agent computer systems, in contrast, learn from interacting with an environment. The merger between human and computer destabilizes ''ethos'' according to Miller. As the intelligent agent model of computing has grown in popularity, Miller suggests that there has been a shift from a logos-centric to a pathos-centric ''ethos''. Neither, she contends, provide ethics, or ''arete'', which is a gap that rhetoric should fill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethos of Rhetoric|last=Miller|first=Carolyn|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=2004|isbn=|editor-last=Hyde|editor-first=Michael J.|location=Columbia, S.C.|pages=197–218|chapter=Expertise and Agency: Transformations of Ethos in Human-Computer Interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invention ===
As invention is important to the development of new technology, invention is also important to rhetoric. Along with arrangement, delivery, style, and memory, invention is one of the five [[Rhetoric#Canons|canons of rhetoric]], or the five key elements of a competent speech according to classic rhetorical theory. Therefore, some rhetoricians argue that the development of new technology is fundamentally rhetorical. John A. Lynch and William J. Kinsella describe how both technology and rhetoric are both concerned with creating something new from available resources and know-how.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=John A|last2=Kinsella|first2=William J.|date=2013|title=The Rhetoric of Technology as a Rhetorical Technology|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/poroi/vol9/iss1/13|journal=Poroi|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.13008/2151-2957.1152|issn=2151-2957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kairos ===
[[Kairos]] is an ancient Greek word that captures the idea that there is a right time for action. Carolyn Miller has suggested that the "right time" is also a central concern for technology. She uses the Japanese "Fifth Generation" computer project as a case study. Miller contends that within technological discourse ''kairos'' is both a powerful theme and useful tool of analysis. She supports her claim with an analysis of technological forecasting, which was a central feature of the Japanese computer project, and concludes that technologists employ ''kairos'' to justify investment in particular technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Carolyn|date=1994|title=Opportunity, Opportunism, and Progress: Kairos in the Rhetoric of Technology|url=|journal=Argumentation|volume=8:1|pages=81–96|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''Rich Donovan''' is a global expert in business development issues surrounding disability and accessibility. He is best known for creating financial instruments that track the intersection of corporate profitability with corporate commitment to disability hiring and best practices. His Return On Disability Index is reported on Bloomberg and has been used as the basis of an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) by [[Barclay’s Bank]] on the [[NYSE Arca]] Stock Exchange.

==Accessibility and Finance Work==

===Development of the Return on Disability Index===

Rich Donovan is a founder of several research and advisory companies that have foregrounded the business case for companies and governments to act on the disability market. In 2008, he founded what is now called '''The Return on Disability Group''' to build metric and models that allow for analysis of corporate activity which help assess how well businesses engage customers and employees with disabilities. The organization’s "Return on Disability Reports" and other models helps companies understand their performance across disability factors that are linked directly to profitability. As well they produce the Return on Disability Indices for the U.S. and Canada markets. These financial tools "recognize public companies that are outperforming in the disability market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rod-group.com/rod-report/companies |title=The RoD Report |publisher=The Return on Disability Group |access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RoD US 100 and the RoD Canada 50, are published daily by Bloomberg LP. The indices track the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. The Economist notes that in the five years to 2012 the US index had outperformed the broader stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=September 8, 2012|title=Disability and business: The new green |publisher=[[The Economist]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LIME===
In 2006, Rich Donovan founded Lime Connect.   Lime Connect is an organization whose goal is to find employment for people with disabilities.   The idea with Lime Connect is: “to connect with the brightest people with disabilities from all disciplines. Results have been stellar, with the Lime Connect Fellowship Program placing 20 young stars in 2011 alone, six of whom were hired by Google.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essentialaccessibility.com/newsletter/march/feature.html |title=Disability: From Redheaded Stepchild to Golden Girl |publisher=Essential Accessibility |first1=Rich|last1=Donovan|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies Lime has partnered with include PepsiCo, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, IBM, and TD Bank.&lt;ref name =Carleton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=2014 |title=Rich Donovan |work=Accessibility Summit: Speaker List |publisher=[[Carleton University]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental Concepts===

As one of the early progenitors of the business case for accessibility, Donovan has focused on the following:

* Strategic road maps for companies to do accessibility well. What works within their strategic frameworks.
* What accessibility practices drive value at specific companies that, in turn, drive investor returns
* the notion of Shared value so that the next ten years of growth will come from non-traditional markets such as people with disabilities

==Personal Life and Professional Development==

===Education===

Donovan received his BBA in Finance from the Schulich School of Business at York University (1993 - 1997) and his MBA from Columbia Business School (2000 – 2002). He worked successfully as a trader for Merrill Lynch. Donovan is an avid sailor and father of a son, Maverick, along with his wife, Jenn. He has cerebral palsy.&lt;ref name=Carleton/&gt;

'''Sanchi Stupa''', also written '''Sanci''', is a Buddhist complex, famous for its Great Stupa, on a hilltop at [[Sanchi Town]] in [[Raisen District]] of the [[States and territories of India|State]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. It is located in {{convert|46|km}} north-east of [[Bhopal]], capital of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The Great [[Stupa]] at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an important monument of [[Indian Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art] Frontline Magazine May 13–26, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally commissioned by the emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. It was crowned by the ''chatra'', a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby [[Vidisha]]. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved [[torana]]s (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th century.

Sanchi is the center of a region with a number of stupas, all within a few miles of Sanchi, including [[Satdhara]] (9&amp;nbsp;km to the W of Sanchi, 40 stupas, the [[Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana]], now enshrined in the new Vihara, were unearthed there), [[Bhojpur Stupas|Bhojpur]] (also called Morel Khurd, a fortified hilltop with 60 stupas) and [[Andher Stupas|Andher]] (respectively 11&amp;nbsp;km and 17&amp;nbsp;km SE of Sanchi), as well as [[Sonari Stupa|Sonari]] (10&amp;nbsp;km SW of Sanchi).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IUbUDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=buddhist+landscape&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl2aqogdrSAhWHyoMKHYD9AoMQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20landscape&amp;f=false Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c.

[https://books.google.fr/books?id=TOrKExVXXpkC&amp;pg=PT3&amp; p31 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Further south, about 100&amp;nbsp;km away, is [[Saru Maru]]. [[Bharhut]] is 300&amp;nbsp;km to the northeast.

== Maurya Period==
[[File:Sanchi pillar of Ashoka.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Ashoka pillar at Sanchi.]]
The "Great Stupa" (or "Stupa No1") at Sanchi is the oldest structure and was originally commissioned by the emperor [[Ashoka]] the Great of the [[Maurya Empire]] in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref name="Alī Jāvīd p.50"&gt;World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Volume 1 p.50 by Alī Jāvīd, Tabassum Javeed, Algora Publishing, New York [https://books.google.com/books?id=fg-lGID3WpQC&amp;pg=PA50]&lt;/ref&gt; Its nucleus was a hemispherical brick structure built over the [[relics]] of the [[Buddha]],&lt;ref name="Alī Jāvīd p.50" /&gt; with a raised terrace encompassing its base, and a railing and stone umbrella on the summit, the [[Chatra (umbrella)|chatra]], a parasol-like structure symbolizing high rank.&lt;ref name="Marshall 31"&gt;Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Butkara Stupa]] is an example of such an hemispherical stupa structure from the Maurya period, that was extensively documented through archaeological work&lt;/ref&gt;  The original Stupa only had about half the diameter of today's stupa, which is the result of enlargement by the [[Sungas]]. It was covered in brick, in contrast to the stones that now cover it.&lt;ref name="Marshall 31" /&gt;

According to one version of the [[Mahavamsa]], the Buddhist chronicle of [[Sri Lanka]], Ashoka was closely connected to the region of Sanchi. When he was heir-apparent and was journeying as Viceroy to [[Ujjain]], he is said to have halted at [[Vidisha]] (10 kilometers from Sanchi), and there married the daughter of a local banker. She was called [[Devi (wife of Ashoka)|Devi]] and later gave Ashoka two sons, Ujjeniya and [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahendra]], and a daughter [[Sanghamitta]]. After Ashoka's accession, Mahendra headed a Buddhist mission, sent probably under the auspices of the Emperor, to Sri Lanka, and that before setting out to the island he visited his mother at Chetiyagiri near Vidisa, thought to be Sanchi. He was lodged there in a sumptuous vihdra or monastery, which she herself is said to have had erected.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.8ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ashoka pillar ===

{{see also|Pillars of Ashoka}}
A pillar of finely polished sandstone, one of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], was also erected on the side of the main [[Torana]] gateway. The bottom part of the pillar still stands. The upper parts of the pillar are at the nearby [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]]. The capital consists in four lions, which probably supported a [[Wheel of Law]],&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture
by Huu Phuoc Le [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA155 p.155]&lt;/ref&gt; as also suggested [[:File:Carving of Ashokan pillar at Sanchi.jpg|by later illustrations among the Sanchi reliefs]]. The pillar has an Ashokan inscription ([[List of Edicts of Ashoka|Schism Edict]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA155 Buddhist Architecture by Huu Phuoc Le, 2010,  p.155]&lt;/ref&gt; and an inscription in the ornamental [[Sankha Lipi]] from the Gupta period.&lt;ref name="Alī Jāvīd p.50" /&gt; The Ashokan inscription is engraved in early [[Brahmi]] characters. It is unfortunately much damaged, but the commands it contains appear to be the same as those recorded in the [[Sarnath]] and [[Kausambi]] edicts, which together form the three known instances of Ashoka's "Schism Edict". It relates to the penalties for schism in the Buddhist sangha:

{{quote|". . . path is prescribed both for the monks and for the nuns. As long as (my) sons and great-grandsons (shall reign ; and) as long as the Moon and the Sun (shall endure), the monk or nun who shall cause divisions in the [[Sangha]], shall be compelled to put on white robes and to reside apart. For what is my desire ? That the Sangha may be united and may long endure."|Edict of [[Ashoka]] on the Sanchi pillar.&lt;ref&gt;John Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.93] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The pillar, when intact, was about 42 feet in height and consisted of a round and slightly tapering monolithic shaft, with bell-shaped capital surmounted by an [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] and a crowning ornament of four lions, set back to back, the whole finely finished and polished to a remarkable luster from top to bottom. The abacus is adorned with four [[flame palmette]] designs separated one from the other by pairs of [[geese]], symbolical perhaps of the flock of the Buddha's disciples. The lions from the summit, though now quite disfigured, still testify to the skills of the sculptors.&lt;ref name="Marshall 90"&gt;Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.90ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sandstone]] out of which the pillar is carved came from the quarries of [[Chunar]] several hundred miles away, implying that the builders were able to transport a block of stone over forty feet in length and weighing almost as many tons over such a distance. They probably used water transport, using rafts during the rainy season up the Ganges, Jumna and Betwa rivers.&lt;ref name="Marshall 90" /&gt;

An inscription even suggests it might have been established by [[Bindusara]], the father of Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=The Idea of Ancient India: Essays on Religion, Politics, and Archaeology |date=2016 |publisher=SAGE Publications India |isbn=9789351506454 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmAlDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67 |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original 3rd century BCE temple was built on a high rectangular stone platform, 26.52x14x3.35 metres, with two flights of stairs to the east and the west. It was an [[apsidal]] hall, probably made of timber. It was burnt down sometime in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abram |first1=David |last2=(Firm) |first2=Rough Guides |title=The Rough Guide to India |date=2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=9781843530893 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAMik_6LbwUC&amp;pg=PA393 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide to Sanchi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=John |title=Guide to Sanchi |date=1955 |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.gov.ignca.4365/4365#page/n153/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, the platform was enlarged to 41.76x27.74 metres and re-used to erect a pillared hall with fifty columns (5x10) of which stumps remain. Some of these pillars have inscriptions of the 2nd century BCE. In the 7th or 8th century a small shrine was established in one corner of the platform, re-using some of the pillars and putting them in their present position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chakrabarty |first1=Dilip K. |title=India: An Archaeological History: Palaeolithic Beginnings to Early Historic Foundations |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199088140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPQtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT424 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide to Sanchi"/&gt;

== Shunga period ==
On the basis of [[Ashokavadana]], it is presumed that the stupa may have been vandalized at one point sometime in the 2nd century BCE, an event some have related to the rise of the Shunga emperor [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] who overtook the Mauryan Empire as an army general. It has been suggested that Pushyamitra may have destroyed the original stupa, and his son [[Agnimitra]] rebuilt it.&lt;ref&gt;"Who was responsible for the wanton destruction of the original brick stupa of [[Ashoka]] and when precisely the great work of reconstruction was carried out is not known, but it seems probable that the author of the former was [[Pushyamitra Shunga|Pushyamitra]], the first of the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] kings (184-148 BC), who was notorious for his hostility to Buddhism, and that the restoration was affected by [[Agnimitra]] or his immediate successor." in John Marshall, ''A Guide to Sanchi,'' p. 38. Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918).&lt;/ref&gt; The original brick stupa was covered with stone during the Shunga period.

Given the rather decentralized and fragmentary nature of the Shunga state, with many cities actually issuing their own coinage, as well as the relative dislike of the Shungas for Buddhism, some authors argue that the constructions of that period in Sanchi cannot really be called "Shunga". They were not the result of royal sponsorship, in contrast with what happened during the Mauryas, and most of the dedications at Sanchi were private or collective, rather than the result of royal patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD Julia Shaw, Routledge, 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUbUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR58 p.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the Shunga period decorations at Sanchi bear a close similarity to those of [[Bharhut]], as well as the peripheral balustrades at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]].

[[File:Sanchi Great Stupa under the Sungas.jpg|thumb|300px|The Great Stupa under the [[Sungas]]. The Sungas nearly doubled the diameter of the initial stupa, encasing it in stone, and built a [[balustrade]] and a [[guard rail|railing]] around it.]]

=== Great Stupa (No 1) ===

During the later rule of the Shunga, the stupa was expanded with stone slabs to almost twice its original size. The dome was flattened near the top and crowned by three superimposed parasols within a square railing. With its many tiers it was a symbol of the [[dharma]], the Wheel of the Law. The dome was set on a high circular drum meant for [[circumambulation]], which could be accessed via a double staircase. A second stone pathway at ground level was enclosed by a stone balustrade. The railings around Stupa 1 do not have artistic reliefs. These are only slabs, with some dedicatory inscriptions. These elements are dated to circa 150 BCE,&lt;ref name="Shaw 88" /&gt; or 175-125 BCE.&lt;ref name="HP 149" /&gt; Although the railings are made up of stone, they are copied from a wooden prototype, and as John Marshall has observed the joints between the coping stones have been cut at a slant, as wood is naturally cut, and not vertically as stone should be cut. Besides the short records of the donors written on the railings in Brahmi script, there are two later inscriptions on the railings added during the time of the Gupta Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=A guide to Sanchi|date=1936|publisher=Eastern Book House|location=Patna|isbn=81-85204-32-2|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reliefs are visible on the stairway balustrade, but they are probably slightly later than those at Stupa No2,&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt; and are dated to 125-100 BCE.&lt;ref name="HP 149"&gt;Buddhist Architecture Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA149 p.149]&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors consider that these reliefs, rather crude and without obvious Buddhist connotations, are the oldest reliefs of all Sanchi, slightly older even than the reliefs of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]].&lt;ref name="HP 149" /&gt;

The stupas which seem to have been commissioned during the rule of the Shungas are the Second and then the Third [[stupa]]s (but not the highly decorated gateways, which are from the following [[Satavahana]] period, as known from inscriptions), following the ground balustrade and stone casing of the Great Stupa (Stupa No 1).

[[Sanchi Stupa No.2|Stupa No2]] was established later than the Great Stupa, but it is probably displaying the earliest architectural ornaments.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Ornament in Indian Architecture Margaret Prosser Allen, University of Delaware Press, 1991 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vyXxEX5PQH8C&amp;pg=PA18 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, clearly Buddhist themes are represented, particularly the four events in the life of the Buddha that are: the Nativity, the Enlightenment, the First Sermon and the Decease.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA149 p.149]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stupa No. 3 ===

Stupa No.3 was built during the time of the Shungas, who also built the railing around it as well as the staircase. The [[Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana]], the disciples of the Buddha are said to have been placed in Stupa No 3, and relics boxes were excavated tending to confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.81]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliefs on the railings are said to be slightly later than those of Stupa No.2&lt;ref name="HP 149" /&gt;

The single torana gateway oriented to the south is not Shunga, and was built later under the [[Satavahanas]], probably circa 50 BCE.&lt;ref name="HP 149" /&gt;

=== Sunga Pillar ===
[[File:Sanchi pillar 25 with own capital.jpg|thumb|125px|Sunga pillar No25 with own capital on the side.]]
Pillar 25 at Sanchi is also attributed to the Sungas, in the 2nd-1st century BCE, and is considered as similar in design to the [[Heliodorus pillar]], locally called ''Kham Baba'' pillar, dedicated by [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]], the ambassador to the [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Antialkidas]], in nearby [[Vidisha]] circa 100 BCE.&lt;ref name="Marshall 95"&gt;Marhall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.95 Pillar 25]. Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt; That it belongs to about the period of the Sunga, is clear alike from its design and from the character of the surface dressing.

The height of the pillar, including the capital, is 15&amp;nbsp;ft, its diameter at the base 1&amp;nbsp;ft. 4 in. Up to a height of 4&amp;nbsp;ft. 6 in. the shaft is [[octagonal]]; above that, sixteen-sided. In the octagonal portion all the facets are flat, but in the upper section the alternate facets are fluted, the eight other sides being produced by a concave chamfering of the [[arris]]es of the [[octagon]]. This method of finishing off the arris at the point of transition between the two sections are features characteristic of the second and first centuries BCE. The west side of the shaft is split off, but the tenon at the top, to which the capital was mortised, is still preserved. The capital is of the usual bell-shaped [[Persepolitan]] type, with [[lotus flower|lotus]] leaves falling over the shoulder of the bell. Above this is a circular cable necking, then a second circular necking relieved by a [[bead]] and lozenge pattern, and, finally, a deep square [[abacus]] adorned with a [[Guard rail|railing]] in relief. The crowning feature, probably a lion, has disappeared.&lt;ref name="Marshall 95" /&gt;

== Satavahana period ==
[[File:North Gateway - Rear Side - Stupa 1 - Sanchi Hill 2013-02-21 4480-4481.JPG|thumb|right|Carved decoration of the Northern gateway to the Great Stupa of Sanchi.

From the 1st century BCE, the highly decorated gateways were built, the work being apparently commissioned by the [[Satavahana]]. The balustrade and the gateways were also colored.&lt;ref name="Alī Jāvīd p.50" /&gt; The gateways/toranas are generally dated to the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

The ''[[:File:Siri-Satakani inscription Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gateway Rear of top architrave.jpg|Siri-Satakani inscription]]'' in the [[Brahmi script]] records the gift of one of the top [[architrave]]s of the Southern Gateway by the artisans of the Satavahana king [[Satakarni]]:

There are some uncertainties about the date and the identity of the [[Satakarni]] in question, as a king Satakarni is mentioned in the [[Hathigumpha inscription]] which is sometimes dated to the 2nd century BCE. Also, several Satavahana kings used the name "Satakarni", which complicates the matter. Usual dates given for the gateways range from 50 BCE to the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt; Another early Satavahana monument is known, [[:File:Nasik cave 19.jpg|Cave No.19]] of king [[Kanha (Satavahana dynasty)|Kanha]] (100-70 BCE) at the [[Nasik caves]], which is much less developed artistically than the Sanchi toranas.

Although made of stone, the [[torana]] gateways were carved and constructed in the manner of wood and the gateways were covered with narrative sculptures. It has also been suggested that the stone reliefs were made by ivory carvers from nearby [[Vidisha]], and an inscription on the Southern Gateway of the Great Stupa ("''[[:File:Worship of the Bodhisattva's hair Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gateway.jpg|The Worship of the Bodhisattva's hair]]''") was dedicated by the Guild of Ivory Carvers of [[Vidisha]].&lt;ref name="p.51"&gt;World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Volume 1 by Alī Jāvīd, Tabassum Javeed, Algora Publishing, 2008 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fg-lGID3WpQC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Realm of Gods and Kings by Andrew Topsfield, Philip Wilson Publishers, 2014  [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEBcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250 p.250]&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription reads: ''"[[:File:Vidisha ivory carvers inscription in Sanchi.jpg|Vedisakehi damtakārehi rupakammam katam]]"'' meaning "The ivory-workers from Vidisha have done the carving".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Indian and Foreign Review – Volume 23 – Page 58, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vogel |first1=Jean Ph |title=India antiqua |date=1947 |publisher=Brill Archive |page=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GckUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[Begram ivories]] or the "[[Pompeii Lakshmi]]" give an indication of the kind of ivory works that could have influenced the carvings at Sanchi.

The reliefs show scenes from the life of the Buddha integrated with everyday events that would be familiar to the onlookers and so make it easier for them to understand the Buddhist creed as relevant to their lives. At Sanchi and most other stupas the local population donated money for the embellishment of the stupa to attain spiritual merit. There was no direct royal patronage. Devotees, both men and women, who donated money towards a sculpture would often choose their favourite scene from the life of the Buddha and then have their names inscribed on it. This accounts for the random repetition of particular episodes on the stupa (Dehejia 1992).

On these stone carvings the Buddha was never depicted as a human figure, due to [[aniconism in Buddhism]]. Instead the artists chose to represent him by certain attributes, such as the horse on which he left his father’s home, his footprints, or a canopy under the [[bodhi tree]] at the point of his enlightenment. The human body was thought to be too confining for the Buddha.

Similarites have been found in the designs of the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of various areas of northern India from the time of [[Ashoka]] to the time of the [[Satavahanas]] at Sanchi: particularly between the [[Pataliputra capital]] at the [[Mauryan Empire]] capital of [[Pataliputra]] (3rd century BCE), the pillar capitals at the [[Sunga Empire]] Buddhist complex of [[Bharhut]] (2nd century BCE), and the pillar capitals of the Satavahanas at Sanchi (1st centuries BCE/CE).&lt;ref name="Tadgell" /&gt;

The earliest known example in India, the [[Pataliputra capital]] (3rd century BCE) is decorated with rows of repeating [[rosette (design)|rosettes]], [[ovolo]]s and [[bead and reel]] mouldings, [[Meander (art)|wave-like]] [[Scroll (art)|scrolls]] and side [[volute]]s with central [[Rosette (decoration)|rosettes]], around a prominent central [[flame palmette]], which is the main motif. These are quite similar to [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] designs, and the capital has been described as quasi-[[Ionic order|Ionic]].&lt;ref&gt;A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture by Deborah S. Hutton, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015, p.438 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7DX-CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA438]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA44 "Buddhist Architecture" by Huu Phuoc Le Grafikol, 2010, p.44]&lt;/ref&gt; Greek influence,&lt;ref&gt;the "pilaster capitals with Greek florals and a form which is of Greek origin (though generally described as Persian) go back to [[Archaic Greece|Late Archaic]]."in "The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity" John Boardman, Princeton University Press, 1993, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid influence]] have been suggested.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;"The Archaeology of South Asia: From the Indus to Asoka, c.6500 BCE-200 CE" Robin Coningham, Ruth Young Cambridge University Press, 31 aout 2015,  p.414 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hB5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA414]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[:File:Lion pillar capital at Sanchi Joseph Beglar 1875.jpg|Sanchi Pillar of Ashoka]], of roughly the same period, also has a central [[flame palmette]] design on a square-section central pillar, but this time, surrounded by lions, in the same way as many of the other [[Pillars of Ashoka]].

The pillar capital in Bharhut, dated to the 2nd century BCE during the [[Sunga Empire]] period, also incorporates many of these characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;Early Buddhist Narrative Art by Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky [https://books.google.com/books?id=9LjmXHFXju4C&amp;pg=PR16 p.16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Early Byzantine Churches in Macedonia &amp; Southern Serbia by R.F. Hoddinott [https://books.google.com/books?id=WoSuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 p.17]&lt;/ref&gt; with a central [[anta capital]] with many [[rosette (design)|rosettes]], [[bead and reel|beads-and-reels]], as well as a central [[palmette]] design.&lt;ref name="Tadgell"&gt;The East: Buddhists, Hindus and the Sons of Heaven, Architecture in context II, Routledge, 2015, by Christopher Tadgell [https://books.google.com/books?id=DaTbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 p.24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;India Archaeological Report, Cunningham, p185-196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Age of the Nandas and Mauryas by Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta Sastri [https://books.google.com/books?id=YoAwor58utYC&amp;pg=PA376 p.376 sq]&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, recumbent animals (lions, symbols of Buddhism) were added, in the style of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]].

The Sanchi pillar capital is keeping the general design, seen at Bharhut a century earlier, of recumbent lions grouped around a central square-section post, with the central design of a [[flame palmette]], which started with the Pataliputra capital. However the design of the central post is now simpler, with the flame palmette taking all the available room.&lt;ref&gt;A Comprehensive History Of Ancient India (3 Vol. Set), Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd, 2003 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gE7udqBkACwC&amp;pg=PA87 p.87]&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were later used to adorn the pillar capitals (still with the central palmette design), and lastly, [[Yakshas]] (here the palmette design disappears).

Various Jatakas are illustrated. These are Buddhist moral tales relating edifying events of the former lives of the Buddha as he was still a [[Bodhisattva]]. Among the Jatakas being depicted are the [[Syama Jataka]] and the [[Mahakapi Jataka]].

==== Miracles ====
Numerous miracles made by the Buddha are recorded. Among them:
* [[:File:Miracle of the Buddha walking on a River - East Face - South Pillar - East Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi.jpg|The miracle of the Buddha walking on water]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.65]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[:File:Miracle of fire and wood Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|The miracle of fire and wood]]

==== Temptation of the Buddha ====
Numerous scene refer to the temptation of the Buddha, when he was confronted with the seductive daughters of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] and with his army of demons. Having resisted the temptations of Mara, the Buddha finds enlightenement.

==== War over the Buddha's Relics ====
{{See also|Śarīra|Relics associated with Buddha}}
The southern gate of Stupa No1, thought to be oldest and main entrance to the stupa,&lt;ref&gt;[A Guide To Sanchi, Marshall, John, 1918 https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.35740 p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; has several depictions of the story of the Buddha's relics, starting with the War over the Relics.

After the death of the Buddha, the [[Mallas]] of [[Kushinagar]] wanted to keep his ashes, but the other kingdoms also wanting their part went to war and besieged the city of Kushinagar. Finally, an agreement was reached, and the Buddha's cremation relics were divided among 8 royal families and his disciples.&lt;ref name="Lopez Jr"&gt;{{cite web | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83105/Buddha/230773/The-Buddhas-relics | first =Donald S | last = Lopez Jr.| title = The Buddha's relics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Strong|2007|pp= 136–37}} This famous view shows warfare techniques at the time of the Satavahanas, as well as a view of the city of [[Kushinagar]] of the [[Mallas]], which has been relied on for the understanding of ancient Indian cities.

Other narrative panels related to the War over the Buddha's Relics at Sanchi are:
* "''[[:File:King of the Mallas bringing the relics of the Buddha to Kushinagara.jpg|The King of the Mallas bringing the relics of the Buddha to Kushinagara]]''", right after the death of the Buddha, before the War itself. In this relief, the king is seen seated on an elephant, holds the relics on his head.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.68-69]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Removal of the relics by Ashoka ====
According to Buddhist legend, a few centuries later, the relics would be removed from the eight guardian kingdoms by [[King Ashoka]], and enshrined into 84,000 stupas.&lt;ref name="Lopez Jr"/&gt;{{sfn |Strong|2007|pp= 136–37}}&lt;ref&gt;Asoka and the Buddha-Relics, T.W. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, pp. 397-410 [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/rhy1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka obtained the ashes from seven of the guardian kingdoms, but failed to take the ashes from the [[Nāga|Nagas]] at [[Ramagrama]] who were too powerful, and were able to keep them. This scene is depicted in one of the transversal portions of the southern gateway of Stupa No1 at Sanchi. Ashoka is shown on the right in his charriot and his army, the stupa with the relics is in the center, and the Naga kings with their serpent hoods at the extreme left under the trees.&lt;ref&gt;Asiatic Mythology by J.

[[File:Bodhi tree temple depicted in Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern gateway.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Bodhi tree temple depicted in Sanchi, Stupa 1, Southern gateway.]]
Ashoka went to [[Bodh Gaya]] to visit the [[Bodhi Tree]] under which the Buddha had his enlightenment, as described his [[Major Rock Edict|Major Rock Edict No.8]]. However Ashoka was profoundly grieved when he discovered that the sacred [[pipal tree]] was not properly being taken care of and dying out due to the neglect of Queen Tiṣyarakṣitā.&lt;ref name="Lahiri"&gt;Ashoka in Ancient India Nayanjot Lahiri, Harvard University Press, 2015 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bJ_XCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296 p.296]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, Ashoka endeavoured to take care of the Bodhi Tree, and built a temple around it. This temple became the center of [[Bodh Gaya]]. A sculpture at Sanchi, southern gateway of Stupa No1, shows Ashoka in grief being supported by his two Queens. Then the relief above shows the Bodhi Tree prospering inside its new temple. Numerous other sculptures at Sanchi show scenes of devotion towards the Bodhi Tree, and the Bodhi Tree inside its temple at Bodh Gaya.&lt;ref name="Lahiri" /&gt;

Other versions of the relief depicting the temple for the Bodhi Tree are visible at Sanchi, such as the [[:File:Pipal tree temple of Bodh Gaya depicted in Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|Temple for the Bodhi Tree (Eastern Gateway).]]

==== Foreign devotees ====
[[File:Foreigners at Sanchi Stupa I North Gateway.jpg|thumb|350px|Foreign devotees and musicians on the Northern Gateway of Stupa I.]]
Some of the friezes of Sanchi also show devotees in Greek attire.&lt;ref&gt;"Sculptures showing Greeks or the Greek type of human figures are not lacking in ancient India. Apart from the proverbial Gandhara, Sanchi and Mathura have also yielded many sculptures that betray a close observation of the Greeks." in Graeco-Indica, India's cultural contacts, by [[Udai Prakash Arora]], published by Ramanand Vidya Bhawan, 1991, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These "Greek-looking foreigners" are also described in Susan Huntington, "The art of ancient India", p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The official notice at Sanchi describes "[[:File:Scene Index - North Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi Hill 2013-02-21 4272.JPG|Foreigners worshiping Stupa]]". The men are depicted with short curly hair, often held together with a [[headband]] of the type commonly seen on [[Greek coins]]. The clothing too is Greek, complete with [[tunic]]s, capes and sandals, typical of the [[:File:Greek travelling costume.jpg|Greek travelling costume]].&lt;ref name="Manjari Ukil Originals 2006, p.162"&gt;"The Greeks evidently introduced the himation and the chiton seen in the terracottas from Taxila and the short kilt worn by the soldier on the Sanchi relief." in Foreign influence on Indian culture: from c. 600 B.C. to 320 A.D., Manjari Ukil Originals, 2006, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; The musical instruments are also quite characteristic, such as the double flute called [[aulos]]. Also visible are [[carnyx]]-like [[Cornu (horn)|horns]].&lt;ref&gt;"The scene shows musicians playing a variety of instruments, some of them quite extraordinary such as the Greek double flute and wind instruments with dragon head from West Asia" in The Archaeology of Seafaring in Ancient South Asia, Himanshu Prabha Ray, Cambridge University Press, 2003 [https://books.google.com/books?id=iHHzP4uVpn4C&amp;pg=PA255 p.255]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual participation of [[Yavanas]]/[[Yonas]] (Greek donors)&lt;ref name="IAS"&gt;{{cite book|title=Purātattva, Number 8|date=1975|publisher=Indian Archaeological Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MW9DAAAAYAAJ|p=188|quote=A reference to a Yona in the Sanchi inscriptions is also of immense value.(...) One of the inscriptions announces the gift of a Setapathia Yona, "Setapathiyasa Yonasa danam" i.e the gift of a Yona, inhabitant of Setapatha. '''The word Yona can't be here anything, but a Greek donor'''}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the construction of Sanchi is known from three inscriptions made by self-declared Yavana donors:
* The clearest of these reads "''Setapathiyasa Yonasa danam''" ("Gift of the [[Yona]] of Setapatha"),&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica Vol.2 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.100320/2015.100320.Archaeological-Survey-Of-India-Epigraphia-Indica-Vol-2 p.395 inscription 364]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Mashall, The Monuments of Sanchi [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.532798 p.348 inscription No.475]&lt;/ref&gt; Setapatha being an uncertain city, possibly a location near [[Nasik]],&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;The Idea of Ancient India: Essays on Religion, Politics, and Archaeology, [[Sage Publications]] India, Upinder Singh, 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KIWTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; a place where other dedications by Yavanas are known, in cave No.17 of the [[Nasik caves]] complex, and on the pillars of the [[Karla caves]] not far away.
* A second similar inscription on a pillar reads: ''"[Sv]etapathasa (Yona?)sa danam"'', with probably the same meaning, ("Gift of the [[Yona]] of Setapatha").&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Mashall, The Monuments of Sanchi [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.532798 p.308 inscription No.89]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The third inscription, on two adjacent pavement slabs reads ''"Cuda yo[vana]kasa bo silayo"'' ("Two slabs of Cuda, the Yonaka").&lt;ref&gt;John Mashall, The Monuments of Sanchi [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.532798 p.345 inscription No.433]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;

Around 113 BCE, [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]], an ambassador of the [[Indo-Greek]] ruler [[Antialcidas]], is known to have dedicated a pillar, the [[Heliodorus pillar]], around 5 miles from Sanchi, in the village of [[Vidisha]].

Another rather similar foreigner is also depicted in [[Bharhut]], the [[Bharhut Yavana]] (circa 100 BCE),  also wearing a tunic and a royal headband in the manner of a Greek king, and displaying a Buddhist [[triratna]] on his sword.&lt;ref name="p.180"&gt;Faces of Power: Alexander's Image and Hellenistic Politics by Andrew Stewart [https://books.google.com/books?id=1SUw29Q_SeMC&amp;pg=PA180 p.180]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antiquity, John Boardman 1993, p.112"&gt;"The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity, John Boardman, 1993, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; [[:File:Udayagiri Yavana warrior.jpg|Another one]] can be seen in the region of [[Odisha]], in the [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves]].

{{see also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
In all these scenes, the Buddha is never represented, being absent altogether even from scenes of his life where he is playing a central role: in the ''[[:File:Miracle of the Buddha walking on a River - East Face - South Pillar - East Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi.jpg|Miracle of the Buddha walking on the river Nairanjana]]'' he is just represented by his path on the water;&lt;ref name="p.64"&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.64]&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[:File:Procession of king Suddhodana from Kapilavastu in full Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|Procession of king Suddhodana from Kapilavastu]]'', he walks in the air at the end of the procession, but his presence is only suggested by people turning their heads upward toward the symbol of his path.&lt;ref name="p.64"/&gt;

[[File:Chankrama.jpg|thumb|left|"The promenade of the Buddha", or [[Chankrama]], used to depict the Buddha in motion in [[Aniconism in Buddhism|Buddhist aniconism]].]]
In one of the reliefs of the ''[[:File:Miracle at Kapilavastu Suddhodana praying as his son the Buddha rises in the air with only path visible Sanchi Stupa 1 Northern Gateway.jpg|Miracle at Kapilavastu]]'', King [[Suddhodana]] is seen praying as his son the [[Buddha]] rises in the air. The Buddha praised is praised by celestial beings, but only his path is visible in the form of a slab hanging in middle air, called a ''chankrama'' or "promenade".&lt;ref name="p.58 Third Panel"/&gt;

Otherwise, the presence of the Buddha is symbolized by an empty throne, as in the scene of ''[[:File:Bimbisara with his royal cortege issuing from the city of Rajagriha to visit the Buddha.jpg|Bimbisara with his royal cortege issuing from the city of Rajagriha to visit the Buddha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Sanchi, Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.65]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar scenes would later appear in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], but this time with representations of the Buddha. [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] detailed every panel in his seminal work "A Guide to Sanchi".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 A Guide to Sanchi, John Marshall]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gateways or Toranas ===
The gateways depict various scenes of the life of the Buddha, as well as events after his death, in particular the War of the Relics and the efforts of emperor [[Ashoka]] to spread the Buddhist faith.

==== Stupa 1 Southern Gateway ====
The Southern Gateway of Stupa No1 is thought to be oldest and main entrance to the stupa.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide To Sanchi, Marshall, John, 1918 [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.35740 p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative friezes of this gateway put great emphasis on the relics of the Buddha, and on the role of [[Ashoka]] in spreading the Buddhist faith. This gateway is one of the two which were reconstructed by Major Cole in 1882–83. The whole of the right jamb and half of the left are new and blank, as well as the west end of the lowest architrave, the cast end of the middle architrave, and the box vertical uprights between the architraves.&lt;ref name="Marshall 46" /&gt;

|'''The Southern Gateway of Stupa 1'''. The Southern Gateway of Stupa 1 is one of the four richly carved gateways or [[torana]]s, surrounding Stupa 1, the "Great Stupa". It is the main one as it was erected in front of the steps by which the terrace was ascended. The Southern Gateway was also the first to be erected. Then followed, in chronological order, the Northern, the Eastern and the Western, their succession in each case being demonstrated by the style of their carvings. It is probable, however, that not more than three or four decades intervened between the building of the Southern and Western gateways.

A few of the surfaces of the Southern Gateway are undecorated or lost. Like the other gateways, the Southern Gateway is composed of two square pillars surmounted by capitals, which in their turn support a superstructure of three architraves with volute ends.&lt;ref name="Marshall 37"&gt;John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, 1918 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.37ff] (Public Domain text)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of the [[Buddha]], his relics were originally divided into eight portions, and shared between eight princes. Each of the princes constructed a [[stupa]] at or near his capital city, within which the respective portion of the ashes was enshrined.&lt;ref name=Shrestha1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrestha|first=SS|title=Ramagrama excavation|journal=Ancient Nepal: Journal of the Department of Archaeology|volume=142|pages=1–12|year=1999|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ancientnepal/pdf/ancient_nepal_142_01.pdf|accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These eight stupas were erected at [[Rajagriha]], [[Vaisali]], [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]], [[Allakappa]], [[Ramagrama]], [[Vothadvipa]], [[Pava]] and [[Kusinara]].&lt;ref name="Marshall 50" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
About two centuries later, in order to spread the Buddhist faith, [[Asoka]] endeavored to gather the eight shares of the relics to divide them up, and distribute them among 84,000 stupas, which he himself erected. He only obtained seven of these portions: he failed to secure the relics of Ramagrama in the [[Nepal]] [[Tarai]], in face of the resolute opposition of their devoted guardians, the [[Nāga|Nagas]].&lt;ref name="Marshall 46" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here, in the centre of the architrave, is depicted the stupa of Ramagrama. Above the stupa are heavenly figures bearing garlands in their hands. To the right, the Emperor Asoka is approaching in his chariot, accompanied by a retinue of elephants, horsemen and footmen; and to the left, the Nagas and Nagis, in human form with serpent hoods, worshiping at the stupa, bringing offerings, or emerging from the waters of a lotus-pond.&lt;ref name="Marshall 46"&gt;John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, 1918 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.46ff] (Public Domain text)&lt;/ref&gt;

To what particular incident this relief refers, is not known.&lt;ref name="Marshall 46" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An inscription on the dome of the stupa records that the architrave was the gift of one Balamitra, pupil of "Ayachuda (Arya-Kshudra), the preacher of the Law".

Six Buddhas of the past and Gautama Buddha, with his [[Bodhi Tree]] at the extreme right.In the central section are three stupas alternating with four trees with thrones in front of them, adored by figures both human and divine. These represent the six Buddhas of the past (namely : [[Vipassī Buddha|Vipassi]], [[Sikhī Buddha|Sikhi]], [[Vessabhū Buddha|Vessabhu]], [[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]], [[Koṇāgamana Buddha|Konagamana]] and [[Kassapa Buddha|Kaasapa]]) and [[Gautama Buddha]]. Three are symbolized by their stupas, and four by the trees under which each respectively attained enlightenment. The tree on the extreme right is the [[pipal tree]] of Gautama Buddha and the one next to it is the [[banyan tree]] of [[Kasyapa]] Buddha. The identification of the others is less certain.
[[File:Siri-Satakani inscription Sanchi Stupa 1 Southern Gateway Rear of top architrave.jpg|thumb|120px|The [[Satakarni|Siri-Satakani]] inscription]]

|'''The Northern Gateway of Stupa 1'''. The Northern Gateway of Stupa 1 is one of the four richly carved gateways or [[torana]]s, surrounding Stupa 1, the "Great Stupa". The Northern Gateway was the second to be erected.

The best preserved of all four gateways is the Northern one, which still retains most of its ornamental figures and gives a good idea of the original appearance of all the gateways. Like the other gateways, the Northern Gateway is composed of two square pillars surmounted by capitals, which in their turn support a superstructure of three architraves with volute ends.&lt;ref name="Marshall 37"/&gt;

'''Temptation of the Buddha with [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] and his daughters, and the demons of Mara fleeing'''. Towards the left end of the panel is the [[pipal tree]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] with an umbrella and streamers above, and, in front, the [[diamond throne]] (Vajrasana) of the Buddha, whereon he sat when he withstood the temptations and threats of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], the Satan of Buddhism, and when he attained to Buddhahood. Human and celestial beings are adoring it. The figure to the left of it is perhaps [[Gautama Buddha#Awakening|Sujata]], bringing the meal which she prepared for Gautama before he began his last meditation prior to his enlightenment. Near the middle of the panel is Mara, seated on a throne with attendants around, and advancing from him towards the throne are his daughters, who sought by their blandishments to seduce Gautama from his purpose. On his other side, i.e., in the right half of the panel, are the hosts of Mara's demons, personifying the vices, the passions and the fears of mankind. The vigor and humor with which these fantastic beings are portrayed is very striking, and far more forceful than anything of the kind produced by the artists of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.55ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This panel is to be interpreted in conjunction with the corresponding panel adjoining it on the front face of the same pillar. When Buddha returned to his native city of Kapilavastu, his father Suddhodana came forth with a royal retinue to meet him, and a question of etiquette arose as to which should salute the other first: the father, who was king, or the son, who had become the Buddha. Thereupon the Buddha solved the difficulty by walking miraculously in mid-air. Here, in the panel on the inner face, we see a [[banyan tree]], and, in front of it, the throne symbolizing the Buddha; while suspended in the air above it is the chahkrama or promenade on which the Buddha used to take his exercise and which here symbolises that he is walking in the air. Above it are celestial beings ([[gandharva]]s) with garlands in their hands. To the right of the tree is King [[Suddhodana]] with attendants, one of whom is holding the royal umbrella. The reason for the banyan tree ([[Ficus Indica]], Skr : nyagrodha) is that King Suddhodana presented a park of banyan trees to his son on his return, and the tree, therefore, helps to localize the incident. In the corresponding scene on the front face the Buddha is probably represented in this park with disciples (but invisible due to [[aniconism]]) and followers around him.&lt;ref name="Marshall 57" /&gt;

|'''The Eastern Gateway of Stupa 1'''. The Eastern Gateway of Stupa 1 is one of the four richly carved gateways or [[torana]]s, surrounding Stupa 1, the "Great Stupa". It is the third gateway to have been constructed. Like the other gateways, the Southern Gateway is composed of two square pillars surmounted by capitals, which in their turn support a superstructure of three architraves with volute ends.&lt;ref name="Marshall 37"/&gt;

|'''The Great Departure'''. During the night, Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta]] leaves the Palace of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] (far left) while his wife [[Yasodhara]], his baby [[Rahula]] and the dancers are sleeping. Siddharta rides his horse Kanthaka, who is being lifted above the ground by [[Yaksha]]s in order not to make noise and to avoid awakening the guards. The horse is seen progressing from left to right, away from the city, and progressively higher in the air. Siddharta is not visible, but a chatra royal parasol is held by [[Chandaka]] in order to signify the fact that Siddharta is riding on the horse. After his arrival in the forest on the right, Siddharta discards his robes, cuts off his hair and returns the horse to Chandaka. The horse is seen returning without a rider, walking on the ground this time, and, of course, devoid of the [[chatra]] parasol over it this time. When Siddharta stays in the forest, he is symbolized by the two soles of his feet (extreme right). Siddharta has renounced the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA4 p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumination of the Buddha occurred here under the [[Bodhi Tree]] at [[Bodh Gaya]], and Asoka built a [[Diamond throne]] at the location, as well as a temple to protect the Bodhi Tree within. Spreading through its upper windows, the branches of the sacred tree can be seen. To right and left of the temple are four figures in an attitude of adoration, perhaps the Guardian Kings of the Four Quarters ([[Lokapalas]]).&lt;ref name="Marshall 60" /&gt;

The throne was discovered after excavations near the location of the Bodhi tree in the 19th century, and is now revered at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]].

|'''Buddha tames the [[Nāga|Naga]] at [[Uruvilva]]''' This panel is about the victory of the Buddha over the serpent in the fire chapel at Uruvilva. The Buddha obtained the permission of Kasyapa to pass the night in a fire chapel at his hermitage, which was inhabited by a fearsome [[Nāga|Naga]]. The Naga attacked him with smoke and fire but was met with the same weapons, and being overcome crept into the Buddha's begging bowl. In the middle of the panel is the fire temple with a fire altar in front and a throne indicating the presence of the Buddha within, while behind the throne is the five-headed Naga. Flames are issuing from the windows in the roof. On either side of the temple are the Brahmanical ascetics standing in an attitude of respect and veneration.&lt;br /&gt;
In the foreground, to the right, is a leaf-hut (parna-sala) and an ascetic at its threshold seated on a mat, with his knees bound up by a band and his hair (jafa) twisted turban-wise about his head. Evidently he is a Brahman doing penance. Before him is another Brahman standing and apparently reporting to him the miracle; and near by is a small fire altar and the instruments of [[Vedic]] sacrifice. To the left is the Nairanjana river, in which another ascetic is bathing and from which three young novices are drawing water.&lt;ref name="Marshall 60" /&gt;

|align="center"|[[File:Miracle of fire and wood Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|120px]]
|'''The miracle of fire and wood'''. This is a depicting of the miracles of the wood, the fire and the offering. In the story of [[Kasyapa]]'s conversion it is related that, after the miracle of the fire temple, a sacrifice was prepared by the Brahmans, but the wood for the fire could not be split, the fire could not be made to burn, and the oblation could not be offered, until in each case the Buddha gave his consent.&lt;br /&gt;
In the relief, this triple miracle is dramatically represented. In the foreground, to the right, a [[Brahman]] ascetic has his axe raised to split the wood, but the axe will not descend until Buddha gives the word; then we see the axe driven home into the log. Similarly, a Brahman is engaged fanning the fire on an altar, but the fire will not burn until the Buddha permits it. Then we see the altar repeated and flames blazing upon it. The third phase of the miracle, that of the oblation, is indicated by the single figure of a Brahman holding an oblation spoon over a flaming altar.&lt;br /&gt;
The other figures in this panel, of two novices bringing wood and provisions, are mere accessories, while the [[stupa]] in the back ground, decorated with shell designs and surrounded by a square railing, serves to give local color to the scene.&lt;ref name="Marshall 60" /&gt;

At the top is portrayed the dream of [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]], the mother of the Buddha, otherwise called the conception of the [[Bodhisattva]]. Maya, the queen, is
seen lying in a pavilion of the palace, and on her is descending the Bodhisattva in the form of a white elephant. This scene, which was well known to all Buddhists, serves to identify the city here represented as [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].&lt;br /&gt;
Below it is a royal procession threading its way through the streets of the city and issuing forth from the gate. This is the procession of King Suddhodana, when he went forth to meet his son on his return to Kapilavastu. Then, at the bottom of the panel, is portrayed the miracle which Buddha performed on this occasion by walking in mid-air; and, in the extreme
left hand bottom corner, is a [[banyan tree]] (nyagrodha) to signify the park of banyans which Suddhodana presented to his son. The Buddha walking in mid-air is represented, as on the Northern Gateway, by his promenade (chankrama); and suggested by the upturned faces of the king and his retinue as they gaze wonderingly on the miracle.&lt;ref name="Marshall 60" /&gt;

|'''The six inferior heavens of the Gods'''. The six inferior heavens of the gods ([[Devaloka]]s ) or "Kamavachara heavens", in which the passions are still unsubdued, an integral part of [[Buddhist cosmology]]. Starting from the base they are as follows: (1) The heaven of the Four Great Kings: the Regents of the Four Quarters ([[Lokapala]]; [[Chaturmaharajika]]); (2) The heaven of the Thirty-three gods ([[Trayastrimisa]]) over whom [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakra]] presides; (3) The heaven over which [[Yama]], the God of Death, reigns, where there is no change of day or night; (4) The Tushita heaven, where the [[Bodhisattvas]] are born before they appear on earth as the saviors of mankind, and where Maitreya now resides; (5) The heaven of the [[Nirmanarati]], who create their own pleasures; (6) The heaven of the [[Parinirmita]]-[[Vasavartin]] gods, who indulge in pleasures created for them by others and over whom [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] is king.&lt;br /&gt;
Each of these six heavens or devalokas is represented by a storey of a palace, the front of which is divided by pillars into three bays, the pillars in the alternate storeys being
either plain or provided with elaborate Persepolitan capitals. In the central bay there sits a god, like an Indian king, holding a thunderbolt ([[vajra]]) in his right hand and a flask containing nectar ([[amrita]]) in his left. Behind him are his women attendants holding the royal umbrella ([[Muttra]]) and flywhisk ([[chauri]]). In the bay to his right, seated on a slightly lower seat, is his viceroy (uparaja); and to his left are the court musicians and dancers. With slight variations the same figures are repeated in each of the six heavens.
Nothing, perhaps, could give a better idea of the monotony of pleasure in the Buddhist heavens than the sameness of these reiterations.&lt;br /&gt;
The topmost panel of all, with two figures seated on a terrace and attendants behind, is treated quite differently from the Devalokas below and appears to represent the lowest of the Brahmaloka, which according to the Buddhist ideas rise above the inferior heavens.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Sanchi, Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.62ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

So, here, these three figures, which are strikingly similar to the three sorrowing Yakshas in the Mahdbhinishkramana scene and were probably executed by the same hand, may be a reminder of the Great Renunciation which led to the attainment of Buddhahood, the gateway behind being also a reminder of the gateway of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].&lt;ref name="Marshall 68"&gt;Marshall "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.68ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See also: [[s:The Life of Buddha/Part One/20.

|'''[[Mahakapi Jataka]]'''. The story runs that the [[Bodhisattva]] was born as a monkey, ruler over 80,000 monkeys. They lived at a spot near the [[Ganges]] and ate of the fruit of a great [[mango tree]]. King [[Brahmadatta]] of [[Benares]], desiring to possess the mangoes, surrounded the tree with his soldiers, in order to kill the animals, but the Bodhisattva formed a bridge over the stream with his own body and by this means enabled the whole tribe to escape into safety.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Mahakapi Jataka in Bharhut.jpg|120px|thumb|The Mahakapi Jataka in [[Bharhut]].]]
[[Devadatta]], the jealous and wicked cousin of the Buddha, was in that life one of the monkeys and, thinking it a good chance to destroy his enemy, jumped on the Bodhisattva's back and broke his heart. The king, seeing the good deed of the Bodhisattva and repenting of his own attempt to kill him, tended him with great care when he was dying and
afterwards gave him royal obsequies.&lt;br /&gt;
Down the panel of the relief flows, from top to bottom, the river Ganges. To the left, at the top, is the great mango tree to which two monkeys are clinging, while the king of the monkeys is stretched across the river from the mango tree to the opposite bank, and over his body some monkeys have already escaped to the rocks and jungles beyond. In
the lower part of the panel, to the left, is king Brahmadatta on horseback with his soldiers, one of whom with bow and arrow is aiming upwards at the Bodhisattva. Higher up the panel the figure of the king is repeated, sitting beneath the mango tree and conversing with the dying Bodhisattva, who, according to the Jataka story, gave the king good advice on the duties of a chief.&lt;ref name="Marshall 68" /&gt;

==== Stupa 3 Southern Gateway ====
The gateway of Stupa No 3, is the last of all the [[Satavahana]] gateways that were built at Sanchi. It is located to the immediate south of Stupa No 3, is smaller than the four gateways encircling the Great Stupa. It is also slightly older, and generally dated to the 1st century CE.

[[File:Sanchi map.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Sanchi monuments.]]
Further stupas and other religious Buddhist structures were added over the centuries until the 12th century CE.

===Western Satraps===
The rule of the Satavahanas in the area Sanchi during the 1st centuries BCE/CE is well attested by the finds of Satavahana copper coins in [[Vidisha]], [[Ujjain]] and [[Eran]] in the name of [[Satakarni]], as well as the Satakarni inscription on the Southern Gateway of Stupa No.1.&lt;ref name="Shaw 58" /&gt;

Soon after, however, the region fell to the [[Indo-Scythians|Scythian]] [[Western Satraps]], possibly under [[Nahapana]] (120 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Indian Numismatic Studies by K. D. Bajpai [https://books.google.com/books?id=chGrJUMarHoC&amp;pg=PA100 p.100]&lt;/ref&gt; and then certainly under [[Rudradaman I]] (130-150 CE), as shown by his inscriptions in [[Junagadh]].&lt;ref name="Shaw 58" /&gt; The Satavahanas probably regained the region for some time, but were again replaced by the Western Satraps in the mid-3rd century CE, during the rule of [[Rudrasena II (Western Satrap)|Rudrasena II]] (255-278 CE). The Western Satraps remained well into the 4th century as shown by the nearby [[Kanakerha inscription]] mentioning the construction of a well by the Saka chief and "righteous conqueror" Sridharavarman.&lt;ref name="Shaw 58"&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD, Julia Shaw, Routledge, 2016 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=IUbUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR58 p58-59]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it seems that the [[Kushan Empire]] did not extend to the Sanchi area, and the few Kushan works of art found in Sanchi appear to have come from [[Mathura]].&lt;ref name="Shaw 58" /&gt;

===Guptas===
The next rulers of the area were the Guptas.&lt;ref name="Shaw 58" /&gt; Inscriptions of a victorious [[Chandragupta II]] in the year 412-423 CE can be found on the railing near the Eastern Gateway of the Great Stupa.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, The Monuments of India [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.532798 p.388]&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple 17 is an early Buddhist stand-alone [[temple]] (following the great cave temples of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]), as it dates to the early [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (5th century CE). It consists of a flat roofed square sanctum with a portico and four pillars. The interior and three sides of the exterior are plain and undecorated but the front and the pillars are elegantly carved, giving the temple an almost ‘classical’ appearance,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; not unlike the 2nd century rock-cut cave temples of the [[Nasik caves]].

Near the Northwern Gateway also used to stand a [[Vajrapani]] pillar. Another pillar of [[Padmapani]] used to stand, and [[:File:WLA vanda The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.jpg|the statue]] is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[London]].

=== Lion pillar No 26 ===
[[File:Sanchi Gupta lion capital.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pillar 26: one the two four-lions [[stambha]] capitals at Sanchi, with lions, central [[flame palmette]] and [[Wheel of Law]] (axis, stubs of the spokes and part of the circumference only), initially located at the Northern Gateway of the Great Stupa. [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]].]]
Pillar No26 stands a little to the north of the Sunga pillar No25. It belongs to the early Gupta age. Apart from its design, it is distinguished
from the other pillars on the site by the unusual quality and colour of its stone, which is harder than that ordinarily quarried in the [[Udayagiri Caves|Udayagiri hill]], and of a pale
buff hue splashed and streaked with amethyst. At Sanchi this particular variety of stone was used only in monuments of the Gupta period. This pillar was approximately 22&amp;nbsp;ft. 6 in. in height and was composed of two pieces only, one comprising the circular shaft and square base, the other the bell-capital, necking, lions and crowning [[chakra]]. On the northwest side of the lowest section, which is still in situ, is a short mutilated inscription in Gupta characters recording the gift of the pillar by a ''viharasvamin'' (master of a monastery), the son of Gotaisimhabala.&lt;ref name="Marshall 96" /&gt;

[[File:Sanchi pillar capital wheel reconstitution.jpg|thumb|upright|Pillar 26: lion pillar capital at time of discovery, with [[Dharmachakra]] wheel (reconstitution). Northern Gateway.]]
As was usual with pillars of the Gupta age, the square base projected above the ground level, the projection in this case being 1&amp;nbsp;ft. 2 in., and was enclosed by a small square platform. The lion capital of this pillar is a feeble imitation of the one which surmounted the pillar of Asoka, with the addition of a wheel at the summit and with certain other variations of detail. For example, the cable necking above the bell-capital, is composed of a series of strands bound together with a riband. Also, the reliefs on the circular [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]], consist of birds and lotuses of unequal sizes disposed in irregular fashion, not with the symmetrical precision of earlier Indian art. Finally, these lions, like those on the pillars of the Southern Gateway, are provided with five claws on each foot, and their modelling exhibits little regard for truth and little artistry.&lt;ref name="Marshall 96"&gt;Marshall "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.96 Pillar 26]. Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much confusion about the dating of this pillars, since it was often presented from the beginning as a pillar of Ashoka. Marshall himself describes the pillar as early [[Gupta Empire]] in convincing terms, either from the points of view of material, technique or artistry.&lt;ref name="Marshall 96" /&gt; The Government of India Photo Division describes it in [[:File:Sanchi Ashoka pillar and capital cropped.jpg|this image]] as "An Asoka pillar and its broken lion capital near the south gateway of the Great Stupa." [http://photodivision.gov.in/IntroPhotodetails.asp?thisPage=972]. The British Library Online also describes it as 3rd century BCE Mauryan, although probably pasting the original text from the 19th century [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/p/019pho000001003u01359000.html].

=== Pillar 35 ===

[[File:Sanchi Pillar 35 Vajrapani statue.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vajrapani]] statue of pillar 35, 5th c. CE. [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]].]]
The massive pillar near the North Gateway, numbered 35 in the plan, was erected during the Gupta period. Every feature, whether structural, stylistic or technical, is typical of
Gupta workmanship. Most of the shaft has been destroyed, but the stump still remains in situ, and the foundations are intact. The form, too, of the platform around its base is sufficiently clear, and the capital and statue which it is said to have supported, are both relatively well-preserved. What remains of the shaft is 9&amp;nbsp;ft. in length, 3&amp;nbsp;ft. 10 in. of which, measured from the top, are circular and smooth, and the remainder, constituting the base, square and rough-dressed. In the Gupta age, it was the common practice to keep the
bases of such monolithic columns square, whereas those of the Maurya age were invariably circular. The columns of the Maurya period are distinguished by its exquisite dressing and highly polished surface; but in this case the dressing of the stone is characterized by no such lustrous finish.&lt;ref name="Marshall 97"&gt;Marshall "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.97 Pillar 35]. Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Persepolitan]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]] and square [[abacus]] ornamented with a balustrade in relief are cut entire from a single block of stone. So, too, is the statue
which was found lying alongside the capital and which is believed to have belonged to the same pillar. This statue represents a man clad in a [[dhoti]] and adorned with bracelets, earrings, bejewelled necklace and headdress. The hair falls in curls over the shoulders and back, and beneath it at the back fall the ends of two ribbons.&lt;ref name="Marshall 97" /&gt; It is thought that the statue represents [[Vajrapani]]. The attribution to Vajrapani is indicated by the stub of a [[vajra]] thunderbold in the right hand and a halo of 24 rays.&lt;ref&gt;Great Monuments of India, DK [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXa60HtlNOYC&amp;pg=PA41 p.41]&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication of the Vajrapani pillar is also mentioned in a 5th-century inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Malwa Through The Ages, by Kailash Chand Jain [https://books.google.com/books?id=_3O7q7cU7k0C&amp;pg=PA277 p.277]&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting feature of the image is the halo which is pierced with twelve small holes evenly disposed around its edge. Manifestly the halo, is too small in proportion to the size of the statue, and these holes were no doubt intended for the attachment of the outer rays, which were probably fashioned out of copper gilt, the rest of the statue itself being possibly painted or gilded. This statue stood on the summit of the pillar, and is a work of the Gupta period.&lt;ref name="Marshall 97" /&gt; The statue is currently in the [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]] and is attributed to the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;"Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c.

Following the destruction of the Guptas by the [[Alchon Huns]], and with the [[decline of Buddhism in India]], Buddhist artistic creation at Sanchi slowed down.

[[File:Temple 18, Sanchi.jpg|thumb|Temple 18 at Sanchi, an [[apsidal]] hall with [[Maurya]] foundations, rebuilt at the time of [[Harsha]] (7th century CE).]]

With the decline of [[Buddhism]] in India, the monuments of Sanchi went out of use and fell into a state of disrepair. In 1818, General Taylor of the Bengal Cavalry recorded a visit to Sanchi. At that time the monuments were left in a relatively good condition. Although the jungle had overgrown the complex, several of the Gateways were still standing, and Sanchi, being situated on a hill, had escaped the onslaught of the [[Muslim]] conquerors who had destroyed the nearby city of [[Vidisha]] ([[Bhilsa]]) only 5 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Ornament in Indian Architecture, Margaret Prosser Allen, University of Delaware Press, 1991 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vyXxEX5PQH8C&amp;pg=PA18 p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sanchi and the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara ==
Although the initial craftsmen for stone reliefs in Sanchi seem to have come from [[Gandhara]], with the first reliefs being carved at [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] circa 115 BCE,&lt;ref name="AG" /&gt; the art of Sanchi thereafter developed considerably in the 1st century BCE/CE and is thought to predate the blooming of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], which went on to flourish until around the 4th century CE. The art of Sanchi is thus considered as the ancestor of the didactic forms of [[Buddhist art]] that would follow, such as the art of Gandhara.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Didactic Narration: Jataka Iconography in Dunhuang with a Catalogue of Jataka Representations in China, Alexander Peter Bell, LIT Verlag Münster, 2000 [https://books.google.com/books?id=77hHrXX4COgC&amp;pg=PA31 p.31ff]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also, with [[Bharhut]], the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;Asoka, Mookerji Radhakumud, Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1962 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uXyftdtE1ygC&amp;pg=PA204 p.204]&lt;/ref&gt;

As didactic Buddhist reliefs were adopted by Gandhara, the content evolved somewhat together with the emergence of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], a more theistic understanding of Buddhism. First, although many of the artistic themes remained the same (such as Maya's dream, The Great Departure, Mara's attacks...), many of the stories of the previous lives of the Buddha were replaced by the even more numerous stories about the [[Bodhisattvas]] of the Mahayana [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]].&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt; Second, another important difference is the treatment of the image of the Buddha: whereas the art of Sanchi, however detailed and sophisticated, is [[aniconic]],&lt;ref&gt;The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA26 p.26]&lt;/ref&gt; the art of Gandhara added illustrations of the Buddha as a man wearing Greek-style clothing to play a central role in its didactic reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA1 p.1ff]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Grandeur of Gandhara: The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys Rafi-us Samad, Algora Publishing, 2011 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMEd8Cqh-YQC&amp;pg=PA23 p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Greeks at or near Sanchi at the time is known ([[Indo-Greek]] ambassador [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]] at [[Vidisha]] circa 100 BCE, the Greek-like [[:File:Foreigners at Sanchi Stupa I North Gateway.jpg|foreigners illustrated at Sanchi worshiping the Great Stupa]], or the Greek "Yavana" devotees who had dedicatory inscriptions made at Sanchi&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt;), but more precise details about exchanges or possible routes of transmission are elusive.

== Western rediscovery ==
[[File:Ruins at Stupa 1 Sanchi Joseph Beglar 1875.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of the Southern Gateway, Sanchi in 1875.]]
[[File:A Gate to the Stupa of Sanchi 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|A Gate to the Stupa of Sanchi 1932]]
General Henry Taylor (1784–1876) who was a British officer in 1818 in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War|Third Maratha War]] of 1817–1819, was the first known Western historian to document (in English) the existence of Sanchi Stupa. The site was in a total state of abandon. Amateur [[archaeologists]] and treasure hunters ravaged the site until 1881, when proper restoration work was initiated. Between 1912 and 1919 the structures were restored to their present condition under the supervision of [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/docs/archaeology/primarydocs/Sanchi/HistArt.htm John Marshall, "An Historical and Artistic Description of Sanchi", from ''A Guide to Sanchi,'' Calcutta: Superintendent, Government Printing (1918). Pp. 7-29 on line, Project South Asia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210033559/http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/docs/archaeology/primarydocs/Sanchi/HistArt.htm |date=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Sanchi remained mostly intact however, only few artifacts of Sanchi can be found in Western Museum: for example, [[:File:WLA vanda The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.jpg|the Gupta statue of Padmapani]] is at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], and [[:File:SanchiBracketFigure.jpg|one of the Yashinis]] can be seen at the [[British Museum]].

Today, around fifty monuments remain on the hill of Sanchi, including three main stupas and several temples. The monuments have been listed among other famous monuments in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] since 1989.

The reliefs of Sanchi, especially those depicting Indian cities, have been important in trying to imagine what ancient Indian cities look like. Many modern simulations are based on the urban illustrations of Sanchi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.54756 Percy Brown, Indian Architecture, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chetiyagiri Vihara and the Sacred Relics ==
[[File:Chetiyagiri Vihar 02.jpg|thumb|Chetiyagiri Vihara]]
The bone relics (asthi avashesh) of Buddhist Masters along with the reliquaries, obtained by Maisey and Cunningham were divided and taken by them to England as personal trophies.&lt;ref&gt;Brekke, Torkel, Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology, Numen, Volume 54, Number 3, 2007, pp. 270-303(34)&lt;/ref&gt; Maisey's family sold the objects to [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] where they stayed for a long time. The Buddhists in England, Sri Lanka and India, led by the [[Mahabodhi Society]] demanded that they be returned. Some of the relics of [[Sariputta]] and [[Moggallana]] were sent back to Sri Lanka, where they were publicly displayed in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Ceylon Allowed To Keep Sanchi Relics Till May 8, Indian Express – Apr 28, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; It was such a grand event where the entire population of Sri Lanka came to visit them. However, they were later returned to India. But a new temple Chetiyagiri Vihara was constructed to house the relics, in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;BUDDHA DISCIPLES WILL BE REBURIED; Relics of Followers of Ancient Leader to Be Reinterred at Rites in India Saturday, THE NEW YORK TIMES, November 25, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; In a nationalistic sense, this marked the formal reestablishment of the Buddhist tradition in India. Some of the relics were obtained by Burma.&lt;ref&gt;Sariputta and Moggallana in the Golden Land: The Relics of the Buddha's Chief Disciples at the Kaba Aye Pagoda, [[James (Jack) Daulton|Jack Daulton]], Journal of Burma Studies, Volume 4, 1999 pp. 101-128&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inscriptions ==
[[File:Danam letters on Sanchi inscription.jpg|thumb|The last two letters to the right of this inscription in [[Brahmi]] form the word "dǎnam" (donation). This hypothesis permitted the decipherment of the [[Brahmi]] script by [[James Prinsep]] in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salomon |first1=Richard |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195356663 |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA206 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Sanchi, especially Stupa 1, has a large number of [[Brahmi]] inscriptions. Although most of them are small and mention donations, they are of great historical significance. [[James Prinsep]] in 1837, noted that most of them ended with the same two Brahmi characters. Princep took them as "danam" (donation), which permitted the decipherment of the Brahmi script,.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Epigraphy : A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages, Richard Salomon, [[Oxford University Press]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ashoka: The Search for India's Lost Emperor'', [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], Little, Brown Book Group Limited, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the donation records&lt;ref&gt;A study of inscribed reliefs within the context of donative inscriptions at Sanchi, Author: Milligan, Matthew David, Thesis, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; shows that while a large fraction of the donors were local (with no town specified), a number of them were from [[Ujjain]], [[Vidisha]], Kurara, Nadinagar, Mahisati, Kurghara, Bhogavadhan and Kamdagigam. Three inscriptions are known from [[Yavana]] ([[Indo-Greek]])&lt;ref name="IAS"/&gt; donors at Sanchi, the clearest of which reads "''Setapathiyasa Yonasa danam''" ("Gift of the [[Yona]] of Setapatha"), Setapatha being an uncertain city.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;

'''''Scolica enchiriadis''''' is an [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] ninth-century [[music theory]] treatise and commentary on its companion work, the ''[[Musica enchiriadis]]''. These treatises were once attributed to [[Hucbald]], but this is no longer accepted.&lt;ref name=hoppin&gt;Hoppin, Richard H. ''Medieval Music''. Norton, 1978, pp.188-193. {{ISBN|978-0-393-09090-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Scolica enchiriadis'' is written as a tripartite dialogue, and despite being a commentary on the ''Musica enchiriadis'', it is nearly three times as long. &lt;ref name=grove&gt;Erickson, Raymond. "Musica enchiriadis, Scholia enchiriadis". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''. London: Macmillan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the theory discussed by the treatise is indebted to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] conceptions of music, especially its affirmations of the importance of [[mathematics]] to music as kindred disciplines of the ''[[quadrivium]]''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Later sections draw heavily on the music theory of [[Boethius]] and [[Cassiodorus]], two early medieval authors whose works on music were widely read and circulated hundreds of years after their death. The treatise makes use of the [[monochord]] to explain [[interval (music)|interval]] relations. The treatise also discusses singing technique, [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]] of plainchant, and [[polyphony]] in the style of [[organum]]. 

The [[scale (music)|scale]] used in the work, which is based on a system of [[tetrachord]]s,  appears to have been created solely for use in the work itself rather than taken from actual musical practice.&lt;ref name=hoppin/&gt; The treatise also uses a very rare system of notation, known as [[Daseian]] notation. This notation has a number of figures which are rotated ninety degrees to represent different pitches.

A critical edition of the treatises was published in 1981, and an English translation by Raymond Erickson in 1995.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

'''Sex education''' is the instruction of issues relating to [[human sexuality]], including emotional relations and responsibilities, [[human sexual anatomy]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[age of consent]], [[reproductive health]], [[reproductive rights]], [[safe sex]], [[birth control]] and [[sexual abstinence]]. Sex education that covers all of these aspects is known as [[comprehensive sex education]].  Common avenues for sex education are parents or caregivers, formal school programs, and public health campaigns.

Traditionally, [[adolescent]]s in many cultures were not given any information on sexual matters, with the discussion of these issues being considered [[taboo]]. Such instruction, as was given, was traditionally left to a child's parents, and often this was put off until just before a child's marriage. The [[progressive education]] movement of the late 19th century, however, led to the introduction of "[[social hygiene]]" in North American school curricula and the advent of school-based sex education.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health|year=2013|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite early inroads of school-based sex education, most of the information on sexual matters in the mid-20th century was obtained informally from friends and the media, and much of this information was deficient or of dubious value, especially during the period following [[puberty]], when curiosity about sexual matters was the most acute. This deficiency was heightened by the increasing incidence of [[teenage pregnancies]], particularly in Western countries after the 1960s. As part of each country's efforts to reduce such pregnancies, programs of sex education were introduced, initially over strong opposition from parent and religious groups.

The outbreak of [[AIDS]] has given a new sense of urgency to sex education. In many [[Africa]]n countries, where AIDS is at epidemic levels (see [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]]), sex education is seen by most scientists as a vital [[public health]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia National Policy on HIV/AIDS for the Education Sector|url=http://www.youth-policy.com//Policies/NBANatl_Pol_HIV_AIDS_Education_Sector.pdf|publisher=USAID Health Policy Initiative|accessdate=November 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108060907/http://www.youth-policy.com//Policies/NBANatl_Pol_HIV_AIDS_Education_Sector.pdf|archivedate=November 8, 2013|year=2003|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some international organizations such as [[Planned Parenthood]] consider that broad sex education programs have global benefits, such as controlling the risk of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the advancement of [[women's rights]] (see also reproductive rights). The use of mass media campaigns has sometimes resulted in high levels of "awareness" coupled with essentially superficial knowledge of HIV transmission.&lt;ref name=newapproach&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Approach to Global HIV/AIDS Education|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-piya-sorcar/a-new-approach-to-global-_b_790420.html|author=[[Piya Sorcar]]|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, 93% of adults they surveyed support sexuality education in high school and 84% support it in junior high school.&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS Report of Public Support of Sexuality Education (2009){{cite web|url=http://www.siecus.org/school/sex_ed/sex_ed0002.html |title=SIECUS Report Online |accessdate=2007-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509064706/http://www.siecus.org/school/sex_ed/sex_ed0002.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, 88% of parents of junior high school students and 80% of parents of secondary school students believe that sex education in school makes it easier for them to talk to their adolescents about sex.&lt;ref&gt;Sex Education in America. (Washington, DC: National Public Radio, Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and [[Harvard Kennedy School of Government]], 2004), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 92% of adolescents report that they want both to talk to their parents about sex and to have comprehensive in-school sex education.&lt;ref&gt;Sari Locker, (2001) Sari Says: The real dirt on everything from sex to school. HarperCollins: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a "study, conducted by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that abstinence-only-until-marriage programs are ineffective."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100616150557/http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf SIECUS Fact Sheet] (includes research citations).&lt;/ref&gt;

Burt defined sex education as the study of the characteristics of beings: a male and female. Such characteristics make up the person's sexuality. Sexuality is an important aspect of the life of a human being and almost all people, including children, want to know about it. Sex education includes all the educational measures which - regardless of the particular method used - may center on sex. He further said that sex education stands for protection, presentation extension, improvement and development of the family based on accepted ethical ideas.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare&gt;Referred in [http://www.educationalleaders.govt.nz/Leadership-development/Professional-information/Principals-sabbatical-reports/Report-archives-for-2007-2011/Primary-award-recipients-2011/De-La-Mare-Jeanette paper by Jeanette De La Mare. October 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leepson sees sex education as instruction in various physiological, psychological and sociological aspects of sexual response and reproduction.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare /&gt; Kearney (2008) also defined sex education as "involving a comprehensive course of action by the school, calculated to bring about the socially desirable attitudes, practices and personal conduct on the part of children and adults, that will best protect the individual as a human and the family as a social institution." Thus, sex education may also be described as "sexuality education", which means that it encompasses education about all aspects of sexuality, including information about [[family planning]], [[reproduction]] ([[Human fertilization|fertilization]], [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and development of the [[embryo]] and [[fetus]], through to childbirth), plus information about all aspects of one's sexuality including: [[body image]], [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual pleasure]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], decision making, communication, [[dating]], [[Intimate relationship|relationships]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and how to avoid them, and [[birth control]] methods.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare /&gt; Various aspects of sex education are considered appropriate in school depending on the age of the students or what the children can comprehend at a particular point in time. Rubin and Kindendall expressed that sex education is not merely the topics of reproduction and teaching how babies are conceived and born. Instead, it has a far richer scope and goal of helping children incorporate sex more meaningfully into their present and future life and to provide them with some basic understanding of virtually every aspect of sex by the time they reach full maturity.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin and Kindendall (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Evidence shows that a combination of comprehensive sex education and access to birth control appears to decrease the rates of unintended pregnancies among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oringanje|first=Chioma|last2=Meremikwu|first2=Martin M.|last3=Eko|first3=Hokehe|last4=Esu|first4=Ekpereonne|last5=Meremikwu|first5=Anne|last6=Ehiri|first6=John E.|date=2016-02-03|title=Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD005215|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005215.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26839116}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis that compared comprehensive sex education programs with abstinence-only programs found that abstinence-only programs did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, but rather may have increased it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiCenso|first1=A|last2=Guyatt|first2=G|last3=Willan|first3=A|last4=Griffith|first4=L|title=Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: systematic review of randomized controlled trials.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Jun 15, 2002|volume=324|issue=7351|pages=1426|pmid=12065267|pmc=115855|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the [[risky sexual behavior|risky behaviors]] reported by young people as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

According to UNFPA, "A 2010 review found that 'gender-focused' curricula – meaning curricula that integrate gender equality into the learning material – were substantially more effective in reducing risky behaviors than programmes that did not consider gender."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; Research has also shown that delay in sexual initiation, use of condoms and practice contraception has been a result of young people adopting egalitarian attitudes about gender roles. These individuals were also found to be less likely engaged in violent relationships and have a lower rate of STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancy.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

By emphasizing rights and gender issues, these programs help reduce gender-based violence and bullying, promote safe schools, empower young people to advocate for their own rights, and advance gender equality.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

"Few sexual health interventions are designed with input from adolescents. Adolescents have suggested that sex education should be more positive with less emphasis on [[anatomy]] and scare tactics; it should focus on negotiation skills in sexual relationships and [[communication]]; and details of sexual health clinics should be advertised in areas that adolescents frequent (for example, school toilets, shopping centres)."&lt;ref name=" DiCenso"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiCenso |first1=A.|year=2002 |title=Interventions to Reduce Unintended Pregnancies Among Adolescents: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/324/7351/1426|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=324 |issue=7351|page=1426 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426 |pmid=12065267 |pmc=115855|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the report showed "Comprehensive programs worked for both genders, for all major ethnic groups, for sexually inexperienced and experienced teens, in different settings, and in different communities."&lt;ref name="Kirby2007" /&gt;

[[The United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) recommends comprehensive sexuality education, as it enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality. According to UNFPA,&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNFPA Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A Focus on Human Rights and Gender|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/UNFPA_OperationalGuidance_WEB3.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is taught over several years, introducing age-appropriate information consistent with the evolving capacities of young people. It includes scientifically accurate, curriculum-based information about human development, anatomy and pregnancy. It also includes information about contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. And it goes beyond information, to encourage confidence and improved communication skills. Curricula should also address the social issues surrounding sexuality and reproduction, including cultural norms, family life and interpersonal relationships."

Human rights issues, gender equality and gender roles should be integrated into every aspect of these discussions. This includes human rights protection, fulfilment and empowerment; the impact of gender discrimination; the importance of equality and gender-sensitivity; and the ideas underlying gender roles. Sexual abuse, gender-based violence and harmful practices should also be discussed. Taken together, all this information teaches young people the life skills necessary to assume responsibility for their own behavior and to respect the rights of others."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

[[Comprehensive sex education|Comprehensive sexuality education]] "enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality and health. These programmes build life skills and increase responsible behaviors, and because they are based on human rights principles, they help advance human rights, gender equality and the empowerment of young people."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

Sex education may be taught informally, such as when someone receives information from a conversation with a parent, friend, religious leader, or through the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref&gt;Philliber, SG and ML Tatum. "Sex Education and the Double Standard in High School." ''Adolescence'', vol. 17, no. 66, Summer, pp. 273-283. EBSCO''host'', search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=flh&amp;AN=MRB-FSD0218233&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be delivered through sex [[self-help]] authors, magazine [[advice columnist]]s, [[sex columnist]]s, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when [[school]]s or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person what he or she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others.&lt;ref&gt;Slyer (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Gruenberg (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes formal sex education is taught as a full course as part of the [[curriculum]] in [[junior high school]] or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad [[biology]], [[health]], [[home economics]], or [[physical education]] class. Some schools offer no sex education, since it remains a [[controversy|controversial]] issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including [[LGBT sex education]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and topics dealing with [[human sexual behavior]], e.g. [[safe sex]] practices, [[masturbation]], [[premarital sex]], and [[sexual ethics]]).

Wilhelm Reich commented that sex education of his time was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing [[sexual arousal|excitement-arousal]], which is what a [[pubescent]] individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he believed to be a basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Reich (2006) ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf]]''. Part one "the failure.." 6. The puberty problem - (3°) "A reflection.." - c. sexual relationships of pubescents - paragraph 4.a (pp. 198-99 of Italian edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare /&gt;
The problem of pregnancy in adolescents is delicate and difficult to assess using sex education.&lt;ref&gt;Deschamps, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; But Calderone{{Who|date=June 2011}} believed otherwise, stating that the answer to adolescents' sexual woes and pregnancy can not lie primarily in school programmes which at best can only be remedial; what is needed is prevention education and as such parents should be involved.

When sex education is contentiously debated, the chief controversial points are whether covering [[child sexuality]] is valuable or detrimental; whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into the curriculum;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;  the use of [[birth control]] such as [[condom]]s and [[hormonal contraception]]; and the impact of such use on pregnancy outside marriage, [[teenage pregnancy]], and the transmission of STIs. Increasing support for [[abstinence-only sex education]] by conservative groups has been one of the primary causes of this controversy. Countries with conservative attitudes towards sex education (including the UK and the U.S.) have a higher incidence of STIs and teenage pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Joy of sex education"&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/comment/story/0,,1214047,00.html "Joy of sex education" by George Monbiot], ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
A survey conducted in Britain, Canada and the United States by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in November 2011 asked adult respondents to look back to the time when they were teenagers, and describe how useful several sources were in enabling them to learn more about sex. By far, the largest proportion of respondents in the three countries (74% in Canada, 67% in Britain and 63% in the United States) said that conversations with friends were "very useful" or "moderately useful." The next reputable source was the media (television, books, movies, magazines), mentioned by three-in-five British (65%) and Canadians (62%) and more than half of Americans (54%) as useful.

There are some striking differences on two other sources. While half of Canadians (54%) and Americans (52%) found their sex education courses at school to be useful, only 43% of British share the same view. And while more than half of Americans (57%) say conversations with family were useful, only 49% of Canadians and 35 percent of British had the same experience.&lt;ref name=opinion&gt;{{cite news|title=Americans, Britons and Canadians Disagree on Sex Education|url=http://angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011.11.30_SexEd.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215345/http://angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011.11.30_SexEd.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 18, 2016|author=Mario Canseco|work=[[Angus Reid Public Opinion]]|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By area==

=== Africa ===
Sex education in Africa has focused on stemming the growing [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS epidemic]]. Most governments in the region have established AIDS education programs in partnership with the [[World Health Organization]] and international [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s. These programs were undercut significantly by the [[Global Gag Rule]], an initiative put in place by President [[Ronald Reagan]], suspended by President [[Bill Clinton]], and re-instated by President [[George W. Bush]]. The Global Gag Rule "...required nongovernmental organizations to agree as a condition of their receipt of Federal funds that such organizations would neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010123-5.html |title=Restoration of the Mexico City Policy |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110203940/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010123-5.html |archivedate=January 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Global Gag Rule was again suspended as one of the first official acts by United States President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/23/AR2009012302814.html |title=Funding Restored to Groups That Perform Abortions, Other Care |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidences of new HIV transmissions in Uganda decreased dramatically when Clinton supported a comprehensive sex education approach (including information about contraception and abortion).&lt;ref name="uganda"&gt;[http://www.who.int/inf-new/aids2.htm Uganda reverses the tide of HIV/AIDS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010005614/http://www.who.int/inf-new/aids2.htm |date=October 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ugandan AIDS activists, the Global Gag Rule undermined community efforts to reduce HIV prevalence and HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="PEPFAR"&gt;[http://www.stdcheck.com/aids-relief.php Health Gap: Pepfar Policies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140226191956/http://www.stdcheck.com/aids-relief.php |date=February 26, 2014 }} Retrieved February 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
The state of sex education programs in Asia is at various stages of development.

====Thailand====
In [[Thailand]] there has been progress on sex education, with the boundaries being pushed forward with each revision of the curriculum. The first national policy on sexuality education in schools was announced in 1938, but sex education was not taught in schools until 1978. It was then called "Life and Family Studies", and its content consisted of issues related to the reproductive system and personal hygiene. The education curriculum has been revised several times, involving efforts from both government and non-government sectors, and sex education has been accepted as a problem solving tool for adolescent sexual reproduction and health issues. This has been a consequence of educational reform following the National Education Act B.E. 2542, increasing awareness of problems related to adolescents’ sexual practices, and the emergence of women’s sexuality and queer movements. Another new approach in sexuality education curricula in Thailand has been the Teenpath Project developed by [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], Thailand. PATH has also succeeded in institutionalizing sexuality education curricula in schools since 2003.

====India====
{{Main|Sex education in India}}In [[India]], there are many programs promoting sex education including information on AIDS in schools as well public education and advertising. AIDS clinics however are not universally available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV and AIDS in India|url=http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/india|website=www.avert.org|accessdate=20 May 2016|quote=Indeed, many people living with HIV have difficulty accessing the clinics - See more at: http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/india#sthash.o26djboX.dpuf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|India has a strong prevention program which goes hand in hand with care, support and treatment.

==== China ====
In 2000, a new five-year project was introduced by the China Family Planning Association to "promote reproductive health education among Chinese teenagers and unmarried youth" in twelve urban districts and three counties. This included discussion about sex within human relationships as well as pregnancy and HIV prevention.&lt;ref name="chinasexed2"&gt;[http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/node/57 Sex education begins to break taboos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928064000/http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/node/57|date=September 28, 2007}} China Development Brief, June 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; More recently,{{When?|date=September 2018}} there has a been a great increase in books about sex education for children and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Minjie Chen, "Let's talk to the kids about sex... in Chinese too", https://blogs.princeton.edu/cotsen/2018/08/sex-education-china/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other countries ====
[[Indonesia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[South Korea]] have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools. [[Malaysia]] and [[Thailand]] have assessed adolescent reproductive health needs with a view to developing adolescent-specific training, messages and materials.

[[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], and [[Pakistan]] have no coordinated sex education programs.&lt;ref name="escap"&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/icpd/sec7.asp Adolescents In Changing Times: Issues And Perspectives For Adolescent Reproductive Health In The ESCAP Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119084911/http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/icpd/sec7.asp |date=January 19, 2014 }} United Nations Social and Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], sex education is mandatory from age 10 or 11, mainly covering biological topics such as [[menstruation]] and [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="swedsexed"/&gt;

In [[Sri Lanka]], sex education traditionally consisted of reading the reproduction section of biology textbooks. In Sri Lanka young people are taught when they are 17–18 years old. 

The [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] and the [[BBC World Service]] ran a 12-part series known as ''Sexwise'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sci_tech/features/health/sexwise/ ''Sexwise'']&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed sex education, family life education, contraception and parenting. It was first launched in South Asia and then extended worldwide.&lt;ref name="sexwise"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend3.htm Involve The Young!] Interview with Dr Pramilla Senanayake, assistant director-general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[World Health Organization]] and the German [[Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung|Federal Office of Health Education]] recommend sex education for children of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bzga-whocc.de/pdf.php?id=061a863a0fdf28218e4fe9e1b3f463b3 WHO Regional Office for Europe and BZgA Standards for Sexuality Education in Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509062320/http://www.bzga-whocc.de/pdf.php?id=061a863a0fdf28218e4fe9e1b3f463b3 |date=May 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
In [[Finland]], sexual education is usually incorporated into various compulsory courses, mainly as part of biology lessons (in lower grades) and later in a course related to general health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kontula|first=Osmo|title=The Evolution of Sex Education and Students' Sexual Knowledge in Finland in the 2000s|date=Nov 2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=373–386|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ901096|accessdate=January 28, 2014|issn=1468-1811|doi=10.1080/14681811.2010.515095|journal=Sex Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In [[France]], sex education has been part of school curricula since 1973. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms, to students in grades 8 and 9 (aged 15–16). In January 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students.&lt;ref name=" britsexed"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] ''UNESCO Courier'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222184211/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm |date=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2013, the government launched a new program called "les ABCD de l’égalité" (the ABCD of equality) whose main aim is to "fight gender stereotypes at school". The ultimate goal is to foster mutual respect between boys and girls early on so that it impacts their conception of the world later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vincent Peillon |url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/les-abcd-de-l-egalite-un-outil-pour-lutter-des-l-ecole-contre-les-inegalites-filles-gar |title=Les ABCD de l’égalité : un outil pour lutter dès l’école contre les inégalités filles-garçons &amp;#124; Portail du Gouvernement |publisher=Gouvernement.fr |date=January 13, 2014 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
The first state-sponsored courses on sex education were introduced in Breslau, Prussia c. 1900 by Dr. Martin Chotzen.&lt;ref name="hammill"&gt;{{cite web
|title=Hammill Post
|url=http://www.hammillpost.com/2013/02/the-first-sex-ed-course/
|accessdate=11 October 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], sex education has been part of school curricula since 1970. Since 1992 sex education is a governmental duty by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bildungsklick.de/pm/35091/sexualaufklaerung-in-europa/ Sexualaufklärung in Europa] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

It normally covers all subjects concerning the process of growing up, bodily changes during puberty, emotions involved, the biological process of reproduction, sexual activity, partnership, homosexuality, unwanted pregnancies and the complications of abortion, the dangers of [[sexual violence]], [[child abuse]], and sex-transmitted diseases. It is comprehensive enough that it sometimes also includes things in its curricula such as sex positions. Most schools offer courses on the correct usage of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2003/03/Schmutzige_Gedanken Sexualkunde-Schmutzige Gedanken] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

A sex survey by the [[World Health Organization]] concerning the habits of European teenagers in 2006 revealed that German teenagers care about contraception. The birth rate among 15- to 19-year-olds was very low—only 11.7 per 1000 people, compared to 27.8 births per 1,000 people in the UK, and 39.0 births per 1,000 people in Bulgaria (which, incidentally, has the highest birth rate in Europe).&lt;ref name="EUROPEAN SEX SURVEY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,454492,00.html |title=European Sex Survey |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=December 14, 2006 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German Constitutional Court and later, in 2011, the [[European Court of Human Rights]], rejected complaints from several [[Baptists]] against Germany concerning mandatory sex education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-3681421-4188471&amp;filename=003-3681421-4188471.pdf Complaints against Germany about mandatory sex education classes declared inadmissible] ECtHR press release 153 (2011), September 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
From a Western point of view, sex education in Poland has never actually developed. At the time of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], since 1973, it was one of the school subjects; however, it was relatively poor and did not achieve any actual success. After 1989, it practically vanished from the school life—it is currently a subject called "Family Life Education" (''wychowanie do życia w rodzinie'') rather than "Sex Education" (''edukacja seksualna'')—and schools explicitly require parental consent for their children to attend sex ed classes. This policy is largely due to the strong objection against sex education raised by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,6168 |title=Edukacja seksualna w polityce władz centralnych po transformacji ustrojowej |publisher=Racjonalista.pl |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/gender-sexuality-english-language-education-focus-poland Pakuła Ł, Pawelczyk J., Sunderland, J. 2015 Gender and Sexuality in English Language Education: Focus on Poland.

====Portugal====
Some sex education is taught as part of biology-related curricula. There is also an official program intended to provide sex education for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dgidc.min-edu.pt/educacaosaude/index.php?s=directorio&amp;pid=107 |title=DGE - Educação Sexual em Meio Escolar - Educação para a Saúde |publisher=Dgidc.min-edu.pt |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810152902/http://www.dgidc.min-edu.pt/educacaosaude/index.php?s=directorio&amp;pid=107 |archivedate=August 10, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
Subsidized by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, the "Long Live Love" package (''Lang leve de liefde''), developed in the late 1980s, aims to give teenagers the skills to make their own decisions regarding health and sexuality. Nearly all secondary schools provide sex education, as part of biology classes and over half of primary schools discuss sexuality and contraception. Starting the 2012 school year, age-appropriate sex education—including education about [[sexual diversity]] —will be compulsory in all secondary and primary schools. The curriculum focuses on biological aspects of reproduction as well as on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills. Dutch sex education encourages the idea that topics like masturbation, homosexuality, and sexual pleasure are normal or natural and that there are larger emotional, relational, and societal forces that shape the experiences of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schalet|first1=Amy|title=Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex.|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to Amy Schalet, Dutch parents tend to form close relationships with their children, openly discussing [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sexuality]]. Dutch parents try to accept their children's romantic relationships and even allow sleepovers, expecting them to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;[Schalet, Amy T. Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex. Chicago: U of Chicago, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach. The Netherlands has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries.&lt;ref name="dutchmodel"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf The Dutch model] ''UNESCO Courier''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slovakia====
In the [[Slovak republic]] the content of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to "Nature science" in English (this course covers both biology and [[petrology]]). Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and is dependent on the teacher's knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue between student and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====Sweden====
In [[Sweden]], sex education was established in 1921 for secondary education and in 1942 for all grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Education: Political Issues in Britain and Europe|last=Meredith|first=Philip|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=100–104|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is usually started in kindergarten and continues cumulatively throughout the student's entire schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boethius|first=Carl|year=1986|title=Sex Education in Swedish Schools: The Facts and the Fiction|url=|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|volume=17|issue=6|pages=276–279|via=|doi=10.2307/2135318|jstor=2135318}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sexual education is incorporated into different subjects such as biology and history.&lt;ref name="swedsexed"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978575-2,00.html Sex Has Many Accents] ''TIME''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swedish Association for Sexuality Education]] (RFSU) has a sex education that emphasizes "sexual diversity, freedom and enjoyment,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thanem|first=Torkild|year=2010|title=Free At Last? Assembling, Producing and Organizing Sexual Spaces in Swedish Sex Education|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2009.00440.x|journal=Gender, Work and Organization|volume=17|pages=91–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the RFSU collaborate frequently with government organizations such as the National Institute of Public Health. Alongside this emphasis of sexual diversity, Swedish sex education has equal incorporations of lesbian and gay sexuality as well as heterosexual sexuality. They provide knowledge about masturbation, oral and anal sex as well as heterosexual, genital intercourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Switzerland====
In [[Switzerland]], the content and amount of sex education is decided at the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] level. In [[Geneva]], courses have been given at the secondary level first for girls since 1926 and compulsory programs have been implemented at secondary level for all classes since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Gentiane Burgermeister, Education sexuelle en milieu scolaire, l’expérience genevoise; '' Int. J. Pub. Health, (1972) 17; 1; 53-57''.&lt;/ref&gt; In most French-speaking cantons since the '70s, generalized courses have been implemented by states with duly formed and trained specialists working within school health services at the secondary level.

Interventions in primary schools were started during the '80s, with the basic objective of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told that they can have their own feelings about themselves, and informed on who to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.

Finally, the objectives include an enforcement of their capacity to decide for themselves and their ability to express their feeling about a situation and say "No". In secondary schools, there are programs at ages 13–14 and 16-17 with the basic objective to give students a secure moment with caring, well informed adults. With confidentiality and mutual respect, students can talk to an adult who understands youth needs and what they should know about sexual life in conformity with age and maturity.

In the German part of the country, the situation is somewhat different. Sex education as a school implemented program is a fairly recent subject, the responsibility given to school teachers. Though federal structures give authority to each State to decide, there are efforts, notably under the auspices of ''Santé sexuelle Suisse'' - the Swiss branch of IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation) - to look for and propose possible models of application which take into account all factors of sex education according to their different levels of concern, parents, teachers, and external experts.

=====England and Wales=====
[[Cecil Reddie]] ran the first sex education course at a British school in October 1889 at [[Abbotsholme School]].&lt;ref name="hammill"/&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], Sex and relationship education (&lt;abbr&gt;[[Sex and Relationships Education|SRE]]&lt;/abbr&gt;) is currently compulsory, in part, from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. It doesn’t promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. The compulsory parts of sex and relationship education are the elements contained within the national curriculum for science. Parents can currently withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects|title=The national curriculum: Other compulsory subjects - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Scotland=====
The main sex education programme in [[Scotland]] is ''Healthy Respect'', which focuses not only on the biological aspects of reproduction but also on relationships and emotions. Education about [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]] are included in the programme as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the programme, however, a separate sex education programme has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the [[Scottish Government]], the programme ''Called to Love'' focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |title=Cardinal praises "dedication and commitment" of Catholic teachers |publisher=Scmo.org |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620082038/http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Sex education in the United States}}

Almost all U.S. students receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics in grades 5 or 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David J.

Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes and contain provisions to allow parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Sex%20Education%20in%20the%20US%20%20%20%20Policy%20and%20Politics.pdf |title=Sex Education in the U.S.: Policy and Politics |accessdate=May 23, 2007 |date=October 2002 |format=PDF |work=Issue Update |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NPrePzCz?url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Sex%20Education%20in%20the%20US%20%20%20%20Policy%20and%20Politics.pdf |archivedate=February 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a 1999 study by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, [[HIV]], [[Sexually Transmitted Infection|STI]]s, [[abstinence]], implications of [[teenage pregnancy]], and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of [[birth control]] and infection prevention, [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual abuse]], and factual and ethical information about [[abortion]], varied more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author2=Jacqueline E.

Only two forms of sex education are taught in American schools: "abstinence plus" and "[[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|author2=David W.

A 2002 study conducted by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] found that 58% of secondary school principals describe their sex education curriculum as "abstinence plus".&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"/&gt;

Abstinence-only sex education tells teenagers that they should be sexually abstinent until marriage and does not provide information about contraception. In the Kaiser study, 34% of high-school principals said their school's main message was abstinence-only.

Among 48 of the 50 U.S. states (the exceptions were [[North Dakota]] and [[Wyoming]]) in their 2005 state laws and policies, 21 stressed abstinence-only sexual education and 7 emphasized that abstinence should be taught in their state's sexual education programs. Only 11 states require that students receive both comprehensive and abstinence education and 9 states did not mention any sort of sexual education in their laws and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|journal=PLOS One|volume=6|issue=10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|pmc=3194801|pmid=22022362|pages=e24658|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject. In the U.S., teenage birth rates had been dropping since 1991, but a 2007 report showed a 3% increase from 2005 to 2006.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Teen Birth Rate Rises for First Time in 14 Years |publisher=CDC National Center for Health Statistics |date=December 5, 2007 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/2007/r071205.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2007 |quote=The report shows that between 2005 and 2006, the birth rate for teenagers aged 15-19 rose 3 percent, from 40.5 live births per 1,000 females aged 15-19 in 2005 to 41.9 births per 1,000 in 2006.

On the other hand, proponents of abstinence-only sex education object to curricula that fail to teach their standard of moral behavior; they maintain that a morality which is based on sex only within the bounds of marriage is "healthy and constructive" and that value-free knowledge of the body may lead to immoral, unhealthy, and harmful practices. Within the last decade, the federal government has encouraged abstinence-only education by steering over a billion dollars to such programs.&lt;ref&gt;

According to Anna Mulrine of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', records show that professionals still do not know which method of sex education works best to keep teens from engaging in sexual activity, but they are still working to find out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna|title=Risky Business|accessdate=|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=May 27, 2002|pages=42–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Virginia=====
[[Virginia]] uses the sex education program called The National Campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/|title=Sitemap|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Campaign was created in 1996 and focuses on preventing teen and unplanned pregnancies of young adults. The National Campaign set a goal to reduce teen pregnancy rate by 1/3 in 10 years. The Virginia Department of Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/|title=Virginia Department of Health|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranked Virginia 19th in teen pregnancy birth rates in 1996. Virginia was also rated 35.2 teen births per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 in 2006. The Healthy people 2010 goal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/|title=Healthy People 2020|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a teen pregnancy rate at or below 43 pregnancies per 1,000 females age 15–17.

=====Texas=====
Sex education in [[Texas]] has recently become a policy of much focus in the state. With the rise of recent protests and proposed bills in the Texas House, the current policy has been the focus of much scrutiny. As of 1997, when Senate Bill 1 was enacted, Texas has left the decision of inclusion of sex education classes within schools up to the individual districts. The school board members are entitled to approve all curricula that are taught; however the bill has certain criteria that a school must abide by when choosing to teach Sex Ed. These include:
* present abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relationship to all sexual activity for unmarried persons of school age;
* devote more attention to abstinence from sexual activity than to any other behavior;
* emphasize that abstinence from sexual activity, if used consistently and correctly, is the only method that is 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and the emotional trauma associated with adolescent sexual activity;
* direct adolescents to a standard of behavior in which abstinence from sexual activity before marriage is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and infection with HIV or AIDS;  and
* teach contraception and condom use in terms of real-world failure rates, not statistics based on laboratory rates, if instruction on contraception and condoms is included in curriculum content.

Additionally, school districts are not authorized to distribute condoms in connection with instruction relating to human sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.28.htm#28.004 |title=EDUCATION CODE CHAPTER 28. COURSES OF STUDY; ADVANCEMENT |publisher=Statutes.legis.state.tx.us |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the enactment of this policy, several research studies have been done to evaluate the Sex Ed Policy, namely the ''abstinence-only'' aspect of the teaching. Drs. David Wiley and Kelly Wilson published the ''Just Say Don't Know: Sexuality Education in Texas Public Schools''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/SexEdRort09_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401062410/http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/SexEdRort09_web.pdf |archivedate=April 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; report where they found that:
*Shaming and fear-based instruction are commonly used for teaching sex ed
*Gender stereotypes are promoted
*A majority of students receive no information about human sexuality except abstinence
*The materials used regularly contain factual errors and distort the truth about condoms and STDs

According to Texas State Representative Mike Villarreal, "We have a responsibility to ensure that our children receive accurate information in the classroom, particularly when students' health is at stake," Villarreal said. "We're dealing with a myriad of problems in Texas as a result of our sky high teen pregnancy rates. We cannot allow our schools to provide erroneous information—the stakes are far too high."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=123 |title=Texas House of Representatives : Representative Villarreal, Mike |publisher=House.state.tx.us |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, many state legislators have proposed bills to improve sex education in Texas Schools.
*SB 852/HB 1624&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Texas Senate Media Services |url=http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/members/dist13/pr11/p022311a.htm |title=The Texas State Senate – Rodney Ellis Press Releases |publisher=Senate.state.tx.us |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008224026/http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/members/dist13/pr11/p022311a.htm |archivedate=October 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; – In Feb 2011, Senator Ellis proposed The Education Works bill. This bill would require schools that teach sex education to provide evidence-based, age-appropriate information that emphasizes the importance of abstinence as the only 100% effective method of avoiding sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy, while also teaching about contraceptive methods to avoid STIs and pregnancy.
*HB 741/SB 515&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/pdf/HB00741I.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; – In 2011, Representatives Joaquin Castro and Mike Villarreal introduced a bill calling for abstinence-plus sexual health education bill. The bill would have medically accurate information, including: abstinence, contraception, and what it really takes to be a parent. The bill received a hearing but was left in committee.
*HB 1567/ SB 1076&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=81R&amp;Bill=HB1567 |title=Texas Legislature Online – 81(R) Text for HB 1567 |publisher=Capitol.state.tx.us |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Introduced in 2009 by Villarreal, this bill would have required instruction on contraceptive use to be scientifically accurate when it is taught as part of a school's sexual health curriculum. It did not receive a hearing.
Scientific evidence accumulated over many decades clearly demonstrates that the abstinence-only-until-married (AOUM) curriculum taught in Texas schools is harmful and ineffective in reducing the adolescent pregnancy rate in Texas. Despite these facts, recently published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, AOUM programs continue to be funded by the U.S. government. In fact, the U.S. government has spent more than $2 billion over the last 20 years to prohibit much-needed sex education in public schools, choosing instead to fund the AOUM curriculum while the adolescent pregnancy rates continue to rise.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abstinence-only-until-marriage-programs-are-ineffective-and-harmful-young-people&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic schools in Texas follow Catholic Church teachings in regard to Sex Education. Some opponents of sex education in Catholic schools believe sex ed programs are doing more harm to the young than good. Opponents of sex education contend that children are not mentally and emotionally ready for this type of instruction, and believe that exposing the young to sex ed programs may foster the students with the preoccupation of sex.

The Catholic Church believes that parents are the first educators and should rightfully fight for their duty as such in regard to sex education:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMESCHL/SECATHSC.HTM |title=Sex Education And Catholic Schools |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keenan | first1 = J.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
The [[Government of Victoria]] (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State's primary and secondary schools during 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Health and Human Relations Education |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable [[Norman Lacy]] MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979-1982.

A ''Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education'' was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame [[Margaret Blackwood]]; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.

The Council had three major functions:
# to advise and to be consulted on all aspects of Health and Human Relations' Education in schools;
# to develop, for consideration of the Government, appropriate curriculum for schools;
# to advise and recommend the standards for in-service courses for teachers and relevant members of the school community.

Support services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the Special Services Division of the Education Department of Victoria and was responsible for the implementation of the Government's policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of ''Health and Human Relations Education''.

In 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as Government policy.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, sexuality education is part of the Health and Physical Education curriculum, which is compulsory for the first ten years of schooling (Years 1 to 10) but optional beyond that. Sexual and reproductive health education begins at Year 7 (approx. age 11), although broader issues such as physical, emotional and social development, personal and interpersonal skills, and (non-sexual) relationships begin as early as Year 1 (approx. age 5).&lt;ref name="NZMoE"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sexuality Education: Revised Guide for Principals, Boards of Trustees, and Teachers |author= Ministry of Education |year= 2002 |location= Wellington |publisher= Learning Media |isbn= 0478267274 |url= http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |accessdate= June 26, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150121051529/http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |archive-date= January 21, 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health / ''Hauora'' curriculum, including the sexuality education component, is the only part of the New Zealand Curriculum / ''Te Matauranga o Aotearoa'' (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and [[state-integrated school]]s must legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM179262.html |title= Section 60B: Consultation about treatment of health curriculum -- Education Act 1989 -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate= June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can ask for their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM178247.html |title= Section 25AA: Release from tuition in specified parts of health curriculum -- Education Act 1989 -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate= June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.&lt;ref name="NZMoE" /&gt;

==Morality==
There are two opposing sides of the sex education argument amongst parents. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexuality, and they are in favor of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals to be included in the conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views on Sex- And Sex Education- Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristen|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint on sex education, historically inspired by sexologists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[James W. Prescott]], holds that what is at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual [[mores]]. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized [[sexual oppression]] and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of "Reid About Sex"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reidaboutsex.com/|title=ReidAboutSex — Sex and Relationship Expert Reid Mihalko's official site|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihalko|first=Reid|title=About Reid|url=http://reidaboutsex.com/about-reid/|work=Reid About Sex|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that certain sex education curricula break down pre-existing notions of [[modesty]] or encourage acceptance of what they consider immoral practices, such as [[homosexuality]] or [[premarital sex]]. A website which supports that view is the [[Coalition for Positive Sexuality]]. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and premarital sex are a normal part of the range of human sexuality disagree with them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Sociologist Amitai Etzioni argues sex education provides an opportunity to teach students facts about health within the context of values that responsible and moral persons seek to affirm and embody in their lives. Instead of teaching sex as a purely scientific biological process, sex education should promote discussions about human nature, intimacy, and how social commitments improve health and happiness. Programs should discuss responsibilities to better equip students with communication skills and conflict resolution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3128388|title=Education for Intimacy|journal=Tikkun|volume=12|issue=2|date=1997|pages=38-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions teach that sexual behavior outside of marriage is immoral and/or psychologically damaging, and many adherents desire this morality to be taught as a part of sex education. They may believe that sexual knowledge is necessary, or simply unavoidable, hence their preference for curricula based on [[abstinence]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] Accessed December 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT sex education==
{{Main|LGBT sex education}}
One major source of controversy in the realm of sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; LGBT sex education includes safe sex practices for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] individuals and general instruction in topics related to [[homosexuality]]. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today.&lt;ref name="Formby"/&gt; Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]] (GLSEN) report that they were more likely to hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosciw|first=J.G.|year=2012|title=The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth in our nation's schools|url=|journal=Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-LGBT ===

Proponents of LGBT sex education argue that encompassing homosexuality into the curricula would provide LGBT students with the sexual health information they need,&lt;ref name="CSW"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez |first=Marisol |title=Providing inclusive sex education in schools will address the health needs of LGBT Youth |url=http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |publisher=Center for the Study of Women UCLA |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102525/https://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and help to ameliorate problems such as low self-esteem and depression that research has shown can be present in LGBT individuals.&lt;ref name="CAP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Hannah|title=LGBT-Inclusive Sex Education Means Healthier Youth and Safer Schools|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2013/06/21/67411/lgbt-inclusive-sex-education-means-healthier-youth-and-safer-schools/|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that it could reduce homophobic bullying.&lt;ref name="CAP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Josh|title=5 Reasons Schools Should Adopt LGBTQ-inclusive Sex Ed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-a-goodman/lgbtq-inclusive-sex-ed_b_3834914.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of LGBT-inclusive curriculum is introduced by the National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics that must be addressed in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGarry|first=Robert|year=2013|title=Build a curriculum that includes everyone: ensuring that schools are more accepting of LGBT students and issues requires more than passing mentions of diversity in sex education classes|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&amp;u=lom_umichanna&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A320848233&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=lom_umichanna&amp;authCount=1#|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=94|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, BigTalk Education's Growing Up  Safe programme includes LGBT relationship education from [[Primary school|Primary School]] age, was awarded the 2017 Pamela Sheridan award for innovation and good practice in relationships and sex education (RSE), services and projects for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fpa.org.uk/awards/pamela-sheridan-award|title=Pamela Sheridan Award|date=2013-04-24|work=FPA|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-LGBT ===

Opponents often argue that teaching LGBT sex education would be disrespectful to some religions&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Janofsky|first=Michael|title=Gay Rights Battlefields Spread to Public Schools|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/education/09clash.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expose students to inappropriate topics.&lt;ref name="Formby"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Formby|first=Eleanor|title=Sex and relationships education, sexual health, and lesbian, gay and bisexual sexual cultures: views from young people|journal=Sex Education|date=August 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=255–266|doi=10.1080/14681811.2011.590078}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that including homosexuality in the curriculum would violate parents’ rights to control what their children are exposed to and that schools should not inflict a particular political view on students.&lt;ref name="Christian Post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Villalva|first=Brittney|title=Sex Education in Schools Should Include a Gay Agenda, Report Claims|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/sex-education-in-schools-should-include-a-gay-agenda-report-claims-66976/|work=The Christian Post|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, many sex education curricula do not include LGBT topics, and research has reported that students often feel that they do not receive adequate instruction in LGBT sex topics.&lt;ref name="Formby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Viv|author2=High |title=Something More to Tell You: Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Young Peoples|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=April 2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=213–225|doi=10.1080/0141192042000195281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexology''' is the scientific study of [[human sexuality]], including human sexual interests, [[Human sexual activity|behavior]]s and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexology|title=Sexology|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sexology'' does not generally refer to the non-scientific study of sexuality, such as [[political science]] or [[social criticism]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt;

Sexologists apply tools from several academic fields, such as [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[sociology]], and [[criminology]]. Topics of study include [[sexual development]] (puberty), [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual relationship]]s, sexual activities, [[paraphilia]]s, atypical sexual interests.  It also includes the study of sexuality across the lifespan, including [[child sexuality]], [[puberty]], [[adolescent sexuality]], and [[geriatric sexology|sexuality among the elderly]]. Sexology also spans sexuality among the mentally and/or physically disabled. The sexological study of [[sexual dysfunction]]s and disorders, including [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anorgasmia]], and [[pedophilia]], are also mainstays.

==History==
===Early===
[[sex manual|Sexual manuals]] have existed since antiquity, such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], the ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'' and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]''.  {{lang|fr|De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris}} (''Prostitution in the City of Paris''), an early 1830s study on 3,558 registered prostitutes in [[Paris]], published by Alexander Jean Baptiste Parent-Duchatelet (and published in 1837, a year after he died), has been called the first work of modern sex research.&lt;ref name=Bullough1989&gt;Bullough, V. L. (1989). ''The society for the scientific study of sex: A brief history.'' Mt. Vernon, Iowa: The Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of sexual behavior in human beings began in the 19th century. Shifts in [[Europe]]'s national borders at that time brought into conflict laws that were sexually liberal and laws that criminalized behaviors such as homosexual activity.

===Victorian Era to WWII===
[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|thumb|[[Havelock Ellis]], a pioneering figure in the movement towards sexual emancipation in the late 19th century.]]

Despite the prevailing social attitude of sexual repression in [[Victorian morality|the Victorian era]], the movement towards sexual emancipation began towards the end of the nineteenth century in England and Germany. In 1886, [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]] published ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]].'' That work is considered as having established sexology as a scientific discipline.&lt;ref name = Hoenig1977&gt;Hoenig, J. (1977). Dramatis personae: Selected biographical sketches of 19th century pioneers in sexology. In J. Money and H. Musaph (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexology,'' (pp. 21-43). Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the founding father of sexology was the doctor and sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]] who challenged the sexual taboos of his era regarding [[masturbation]] and [[homosexuality]] and revolutionized the conception of sex in his time. His seminal work was the 1897 ''Sexual Inversion'', which describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, (the term was coined by Kertbeny) as he did not characterize it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age [[taboo]]s as well as gender taboos. Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of inter-generational relationships. He also developed other important psychological concepts, such as [[autoerotism]] and [[narcissism]], both of which were later developed further by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|author1=Laplanche, J.|author2=Pontalis, J.B.|date=1988|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9780946439492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA45|page=45|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis pioneered [[transgender]] phenomena alongside the German [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. He established it as new category that was separate and distinct from homosexuality.&lt;ref name=ttp&gt;Ekins, Richard and King, Dave (2006) ''The transgender phenomenon'', SAGE, {{ISBN|0-7619-7163-7}}, pp. 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of Hirschfeld's studies of [[transvestism]], but disagreeing with his terminology, in 1913 Ellis proposed the term ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ellis1933&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Psychology of Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSLybrnLVeIC&amp;pg=PA209year=1933|isbn=9781443735322|publisher=Read Books|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5dNnT3GuF_gC&amp;dq=father+of+sexology+ellis|title=The Real Facts Of Life: Feminism And The Politics Of Sexuality C1850-1940|author=Jackson, Margaret|year=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203992395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the first scholarly journal of the field, ''Journal of Sexology'' (Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft), began publication and was published monthly for one year. Those issues contained articles by Freud, [[Alfred Adler]], and [[Wilhelm Stekel]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle&gt;Haeberle, E. J. (1983). ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents.'' World Association for Sexology.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the first academic association was founded: the ''Society for Sexology''.&lt;ref&gt;Kewenig, W. A. (1983). Foreword. In E. J. Haeberle, ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents''. World Association for Sexology. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud developed a theory of sexuality. These stages of development include: Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latency and Genital. These stages run from infancy to puberty and onwards.&lt;ref name="gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14969 |title=Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex by Sigmund Freud - Free Ebook |publisher=gutenberg.org|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his studies of his clients, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Otto Gross]], were disciples of Freud, but rejected by his theories{{vague|date=November 2013}} because of their emphasis on the role of sexuality in the revolutionary struggle for the emancipation of mankind.

[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|left|thumb|Hirschfeld's books were burned by the Nazis in Berlin for being "un-German".]]
Pre-Nazi Germany, under the sexually liberal [[Napoleonic code]], organized and resisted the anti-sexual, Victorian cultural influences. The momentum from those groups led them to coordinate sex research across traditional [[academic discipline]]s, bringing Germany to the leadership of sexology. Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was an outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, founding the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, Dustin (2008). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer movements. In A. Lind &amp; S. Brzuzy (Eds.), ''Battleground: Women, gender, and sexuality, 2,'' 291. Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld also set up the first [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in Berlin in 1919. Its library housed over 20,000 volumes, 35,000 photographs, a large collection of art and other objects. People from around [[Europe]] visited the Institute to gain a clearer understanding of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and to be treated for their sexual concerns and dysfunctions.

Hirschfeld developed a system which identified numerous actual or hypothetical types of sexual intermediary between heterosexual male and female to represent the potential diversity of human sexuality, and is credited with identifying a group of people that today are referred to as [[transsexual]] or [[transgender]] as separate from the categories of homosexuality, he referred to these people as 'transvestiten' (transvestites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Die Transvestiten.

Other sexologists in the early [[gay rights]] movement included [[Ernst Burchard]], [[Hans Blüher]], and [[Benedict Friedlaender]]. [[Ernst Gräfenberg]], after whom the [[G-spot]] is named, published the initial research developing the [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).

===Post WWII===
After World War II, sexology experienced a renaissance, both in the United States and Europe. Large scale studies of sexual behavior, sexual function, and [[sexual dysfunction]] gave rise to the development of [[sex therapy]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt; Post-WWII sexology in the U.S. was influenced by the influx of European refugees escaping the Nazi regime and the popularity of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey studies]]. Until that time, American sexology consisted primarily of groups working to end [[prostitution]] and to educate youth about [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] founded the [[Institute for Sex Research]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] at [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] in 1947. This is now called the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]]. He wrote in his 1948 book that more was scientifically known about the sexual behavior of farm animals than of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred C. | last2 = Martin | first2 = Clyde E. | last3 = Pomeroy | first3 = Wardell B. | author-link1 = Alfred Kinsey | author-link2 = Clyde Martin | author-link3 = Wardell Pomeroy | title = Sexual behavior in the human male | page = 3 | publisher = W.B. Saunders | location = New York and Philadelphia | year = 1948 | oclc = 705195970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and sexologist [[John Money]] developed theories on sexual identity and [[gender identity]] in the 1950s. His work, notably on the [[David Reimer]] case has since been regarded as controversial, even while the case was key to the development of treatment protocols for [[intersex]] infants and children.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Milton | last2 = Sigmundson | first2 = H.

[[Kurt Freund]] developed the [[penile plethysmograph]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in the 1950s. The device was designed to provide an objective measurement of [[sexual arousal]] in males and is currently used in the assessment of [[pedophilia]] and [[hebephilia]]. This tool has since been used with [[sex offenders]].&lt;ref name="apobit"&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | title = Kurt Freund, 82, notable sexologist | url = http://www.s-t.com/daily/10-96/10-29-96/c06wn888.htm | date = October 26, 1996 }} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kubanobit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kuban | first = Michael | title = Sexual Science Mentor: Dr. Kurt Freund | journal = Sexual Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | url = http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215801/http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-12-22 | date = Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 and 1970, [[Masters and Johnson]] released their works ''Human Sexual Response'' and ''Human Sexual Inadequacy,'' respectively. Those volumes sold well, and they were founders of what became known as the [[Masters &amp; Johnson Institute]] in 1978.

[[Vern Bullough]] was a historian of sexology during this era, as well as being a researcher in the field.&lt;ref name="vernbullough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727172744/http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archivedate=July 27, 2004 |dead-url=yes |title=Dr. Vern L.

The emergence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s caused a dramatic shift in sexological research efforts towards understanding and controlling the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gagnon | first = John H. | title = Sex research and sexual conduct in the era of AIDS | journal = [[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 593–601 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] | pmid = 3225745 | date = December 1988 | url = http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/1988/12000/Sex_Research_and_Sexual_Conduct_in_the_Era_of.11.aspx | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Oriel | first = Jennifer | title = Sexual pleasure as a human right: Harmful or helpful to women in the context of HIV/AIDS? | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 392–404 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/248654/original/sexual+pleasure+as+a+HR.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute''' or SWF Institute, or SWFI, is a global corporation analyzing public asset owners such as [[sovereign wealth fund]]s and other long-term governmental investors.  Initially, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute focused solely on sovereign wealth funds.  It has branched out to cover all types of public institutional investors.  The institute is a [[financial data vendor]] but provides information to the media as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Susanna|title=Why Norwegians Are Millionaires and Americans Are Paupers |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/norwegians-millionaires-norways-sovereign-wealth-fund/story?id=21488085|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blas|first=Javier|title=Protecting Nigeria oil SWF is no easy task |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/69325c28-2440-11e3-a8f7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2qJ6YUFpy|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedine|first=Saad|title=Body of Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund chief found |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/30/uae.body/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Michael Maduell]] and Carl Linaburg in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Brad|title=Is there an SWF in your future? |url=http://www.irmagazine.com/articles/shareholder-targeting-id/20204/there-swf-your-future/|publisher=IR Magazine|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI sells data subscriptions to asset managers, banks, researchers, universities, governments, institutional investors, asset owners, corporations, law firms and other entities.

==Transparency Ratings==
The SWFI came out with the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index in 2008.  It is a 10-point scale based on ten principles of transparency, each adding one point to the index rating. The index is used by sovereign wealth funds in their annual reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan ranks among the highest in Transparency Index |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/news/558/100/The-State-Oil-Fund-of-the-Republic-of-Azerbaijan-ranks-among-the-highest-in-Transparency-Index.asp|publisher=SOFAZ|accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSIA Rated Transparent by Sovereign Wealth Institute |url=http://nsia.com.ng/nsia-rated-transparent-sovereign-wealth-institute/|publisher=Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==
The SWFI tracks direct deals in sovereign wealth funds.  The value of global direct deals by sovereign-wealth funds hit $50.02 billion in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkley|first=Dan |title=Sovereign-Wealth Funds Pump Near Record Amount of Cash in Deals |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/07/sovereign-wealth-funds-pump-near-record-amount-of-cash-in-deals/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI tracks the assets of sovereign wealth funds, pensions, endowments and other asset owners.  Norway's sovereign wealth fund crossed $1 trillion in assets in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norway’s sovereign-wealth fund passes the $1trn mark |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21729458-5m-odd-norwegians-own-more-1-all-shares-world-norways/|publisher=The Economist|date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship''' was founded by the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] painter [[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] on September 2004, as the first, and currently the only, Greek group of [[Stuckism|Stuckism International]]. It has an international membership.

==History==
[[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] discovered Stuckism in July, 2004, while surfing the net, and saw in it an antidote to what he deems "the ailments of the contemporary Greek 'artscape'".&lt;ref&gt;This issue is taken up in Yakoumis' article, "The Academic Provincialism of contemporary Greek Art and its proposed Stuckist remedy", to be presented by him at the first Stuckist international symposium [http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html ''The Triumph of Stuckism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414172054/http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html |date=2006-04-14 }} in Liverpool, England&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], the London founder of Stuckism, and a few days later founded The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship. He conceived this as a "Greek version of Stuckism, an antidote to contemporary Greek art's [[Parochialism|provincialism]], [[sectarianism]] and servile importation of [[post-modernism]]". He developed the concept of "Romantic Stuckism", that is of "Stuckism with a good injection of [[Eleatic]] and [[Platonic philosophy]], oriented rather towards encouraging each artist to pursue his/her genuinely personal artistic vision rather, than towards pointless polemics against the reactionary official art-establishment". He published the first two Romantic Stuckist theoretical texts on the Fellowship's website.

At that stage he was the Fellowship's only fellow and, as far as he knew, the only artist in Greece aware of the Stuckist movement. He contacted other fine artists in Athens, but described the reactions he got as "ranging from a tepid 'academic curiosity' to a sheer lack of interest or even, occasionally, to a politely concealed hostility."  He was however contacted by artists from overseas and accepted them into the Fellowship. The first to apply was [http://www.ianjburkett.co.uk/ Ian J. Burkett], a painter living in London and founder of the Ealing Stuckists group. Shortly after, followed the painter and etcher [http://www.ilaniaabileah.com/ Ilania Abileah] from Canada, and the painter and etcher [http://www.artworksbyanthe.com/ Anthe] (who is of Greek descent) from the US.

==Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity==
Yakoumakis determined that Stuckism should, nevertheless, be brought "in the flesh" before the eyes of the Greek fine arts community, and organised the first Stuckist event in Greece, titled ''Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity'', announced for May 14 of 2010 at the Ash-In-Art Gallery, Athens, Greece.

In parallel with the show, the new book by Odysseus Yakoumakis will be featured, titled "Leaflets from the Wilderness (a case study about the artscape in nouveau-Greece and many other lands)" (Ash-In-Art Publications).

Stuckist artists taking part include:

The '''US-China Education Trust''' ('''USCET''', {{zh|s=中美教育基金|t=中美教育基金|p=Zhōng-Měi Jiàoyù Jījīn}} ) is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Washington D.C.]] Founded in 1998 by Ambassador [[Julia Chang Bloch]], the first [[Chinese-American]] U.S. Ambassador, USCET seeks to promote [[China–United States relations]] through a series of education and exchange programs. The organization sponsors a variety of fellowships, conferences, workshops and exchanges, focused primarily on strengthening Chinese academic institutions related to the fields of [[American Studies]], Media and [[Journalism]], American Governance, and [[International Relations]]. 

The organization's expressed mission is "to promote US-China relations through education and exchange for next-generation leaders."

== Programs ==

USCET's activities currently fall within eight main program areas:

=== The American Studies Network ===
Conceived to strengthen American Studies programs in China, this consortium of academic institutions, now numbering more than 50, provides opportunities for members to collaborate, share resources, and develop their capacity to teach about American society and culture. One of the primary goals of the ASN is to promote a more comprehensive understanding of the United States in China by sponsoring academic research in fields that go beyond politics and US-China relations, which tend to dominate Chinese research about America. As such, the ASN encourages scholarly collaboration and research on topics such as American culture and religion. ASN activities include an annual conference for all member universities; an American Studies Fellows program which places young Chinese scholars at American universities for a mentored semester-long fellowship; and delegations of American Studies scholars from China to the annual meeting of the American Studies Association in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6762112.html|title=The 6th American Studies Network Annual Conference opens in Beijing today|publisher=''People's Daily Online,'' September 19, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=193|title=American Studies |publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media Education Consortium ===
Similar to the ASN, the Media Education Consortium (MEC) is a network of schools of journalism and communication at over 30  Chinese universities. Through annual conferences and short-term workshops, USCET seeks to use the MEC to expand the capacity of Chinese universities to train professionally skilled journalists and broadcasters. MEC programs work to build practical investigative and reporting skills for Chinese journalism students, and to strengthen the role of professionalism and media ethics within Chinese media and communication curricula.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=195|title=Media Education Consortium |publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual MEC Programs Include: 

*'''Financial Media Institute '''
:A 5-day certificate program in financial and business journalism for Chinese fourth-year and graduate journalism and communications students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=176|title=Financial Media Institute|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Journalist in Residence'''
:An exchange program which brings prominent American journalists to Chinese journalism and communications colleges for lectures and workshops. Past fellows have included Deborah Nelson, who received the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her investigation of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and other abuses by the American military during the [[Vietnam War]], and who is now a professor of journalism at the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=161|title=Journalist In Residence|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Media Education Consortium Annual Conference '''
:An annual conference at one of the MEC partner schools allows scholars from different Consortium members to meet and share resources, ideas, and curriculum development strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=161|title=MEC Annual Conferences|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Governance ===
USCET's earliest initiative in China, the Congressional Practicum, has expanded to include elections seminars, training sessions, and annual lectures that build knowledge among Chinese professionals, officials, and students about the workings of the US legislative and political process. Past programs have included case studies, hands-on training, and interactive exchanges among US and Chinese experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=194|title=American Governance|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This program was the first in the United States to be launched under President [[Barack Obama]]'s "100,000 Strong" Initiative to increase the number of American students studying in China. The program provides grants to American universities to encourage students to study abroad in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eap/regional/100000_strong/index.htm|title=100,000 Strong Initiative|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities will use the funds to award travel grants to students enrolled in summer, semester, and academic year study abroad programs. Current partner universities include [[Boston University]], [[San Francisco State University]], the [[University of Arkansas]], and the [[University of North Alabama]].

===Summer Institutes ===
Summer Institutes are short term academic sessions for Asian students and scholars in the United States. The 2010 Summer Institute, entitled "U.S. Foreign Policy for East Asian Student Leaders," brought 20 undergraduate students from China, Korea, and Japan to Washington, DC for a four-week academic program about American politics and society. The 2010 Institute combined classroom discussions, guest lectures, field trips, and a study tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?menu_id=219|title=Summer Institute 2010|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenberg/Starr Scholarships ===
Named in honor of American businessman and philanthropist [[Maurice Greenberg]], this program supports the studies of 10 Chinese students from low-income families each year, covering the cost of their full tuition at [[Yunnan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=196|title=GSS Scholarships|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121121614/http://www.uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=196|archivedate=2011-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== USCET-TFAS Fellowships ===
USCET sponsors the participation of several Chinese university students at summer institutes organized each year by [[The Fund for American Studies]] (TFAS) at [[Georgetown University]]. Summer institutes cover a variety of topics including political journalism, [[philanthropy]] and voluntary service, business and government affairs, and comparative political and economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=147|title=USCET-TFAS Fellowships|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law programs ===
USCET is the programs arm of the FY Chang Foundation, a fund endowed by Ambassador Julia Chang Bloch and her husband Stuart Marshall Bloch at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1988.   The foundation was established in memory of Bloch's father, Chang Fuyun, the first Chinese national to graduate from Harvard Law School, and offers scholarships to Chinese students to study at Harvard Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2006/summer/feature_1.php|title=Why China|publisher=''Harvard Law Bulletin,'' Summer 2006|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the fund sponsors an annual FY Chang Lecture, which brings together eminent legal scholars and jurists from China, the US, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] to speak at the [[Peking University]] Law School. The 2010 FY Chang Lecture was given by former US Trade Representative [[Charlene Barshefsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscet.net/template/page.cfm?id=8|title=F.Y. Chang Foundation|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ambassador Bloch first laid initial groundwork for the US-China Education Trust while serving as a Visiting Professor at the Institute for International Relations at Peking University during the 1998-1999 academic year. That year she lectured on American politics and US-China relations at the university and organized an international conference on the Asian financial crisis. She established a survey course at the university in American Civilization, a class which remains very popular on the campus today. 

In 2001, USCET launched its first official project, a Congressional Studies program held at [[Fudan University]]'s Center for American Studies. The organization formed a longstanding partnership with The Fund for American Studies (TFAS) in 2001, launching its first American Studies Summer Institute for Chinese undergraduate and graduate students at Georgetown University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscet.net/template/page.cfm?menu_id=103|title=USCET: A History|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the organization pioneered the foundation of the American Studies Network (ASN), a network of Chinese universities with American studies programs which currently includes more than 50 members. USCET's inaugural Financial Media Institute opened at Fudan University's School of Journalism in 2006. Directed by Terry Smith of [[PBS]] and Al Kamen of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the program brought together 22 journalism students from across China to complete an intensive certificate program. 2006 also saw USCET cooperating with the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] in delivering its first legislative training program with the People's Congresses of [[Shanghai]] and [[Chongqing]] on Mine Safety. The program, designed to help China develop and implement laws to prevent mine accidents and deaths, addressed a high priority area of Chinese policymaking. Subsequent  FMI's have been held alternately at Fudan University and [[Hong Kong Baptist University]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.hkbu.edu.hk/comd-www/english/news/m_press_200904_fmi_e.htm|title=HKBU School of Communication to Launch "Financial Media Institute" in May|publisher=''Hong Kong Baptist University School of Communication''|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the Financial Media Institute led USCET to expand its activities within media education. In 2008 the organization successfully co-sponsored a Symposium on Global Journalism Education Reform with [[UNESCO]] at [[Tsinghua University]].  This predated the formal launch of the Media Education Consortium in 2009. In its two years of operation the MEC has become a vehicle to expose Chinese media educators to Western journalism philosophy and practices and improve the quality of training to China's next-generation broadcasters and journalists. MEC activities now include an annual conference, short-term academic workshops for Chinese graduate students, and a Journalist-In-Residence Program.

In 2010, USCET became the first organization to launch a program under President Barack Obama's  100,000 Strong Initiative  to increase American academic exchange with China. The program, called the USCET Student Leader Exchange Program, will offer competitive travel grants to sponsor universities who demonstrate considerable effort to expand the number of undergraduates they send to study abroad in China. USCET first unveiled the program in a joint announcement at USCET's 7th American Studies Network (ASN) conference with Carola McGiffert, [[US State Department]] Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific.

== Additional activities ==
'''Resources:''' USCET's website includes a comprehensive database of online resources related to American Studies, US-China relations, and academic exchange institutions between the US and China.  A 2010 article by Terry Lautz in The Chronicle of Higher Education applauded this database as a good model for expanding American academic presence in China.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Lautz, {{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Chinas-Deficit-in-American/123884/|title=China's Deficit in American Studies|publisher=''The Chronicle of Higher Education,'' August 12, 2010|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Awards programs: '''In 2010 USCET held the first annual Congressional Visionary Award, presented to honor "courage, foresight, and pioneering leadership in advancing US-China relations." The first annual awards luncheon honored Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] who, as the mayor of [[San Francisco]], launched the first ever "[[sister cities]]" relationship between an American city and a Chinese city, with the city of [[Shanghai]]. At the organization's 20th anniversary gala in 2009, it honored former Treasury Secretary [[Hank Paulson]] with an Executive Leadership Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscet.net/template/page.cfm?menu_id=210|title=USCET honors Senator Dianne Feinstein with the Congressional Visionary Award|publisher=US-China Education Trust|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
