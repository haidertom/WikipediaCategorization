'''''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchist Theory of Knowledge''''' is a 1975 book about the philosophy of science by [[Paul Feyerabend]], in which the author argues that science is an anarchic enterprise, not a nomic (customary) one.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, Paul. Against Method. 4th ed., New York, NY: Verso Books, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of this work, the term anarchy refers to [[epistemological anarchism|epistemological anarchy]].

== Content ==
Feyerabend divides his argument into an abstract critique followed by a number of historical case studies.&lt;ref name="feyer7"&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstract critique is a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of methodological monism (the belief that only a single methodology can produce [[scientific progress]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Elisabeth. "Feyerabend, Mill, and Pluralism", ''Philosophy of Science'' 64, p. S397.&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend goes on to identify four features of methodological monism: the principle of [[Falsifiability|falsification]],&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; a demand for increased empirical content,&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; the forbidding of [[ad hoc]] hypotheses&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[consistency]] condition.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He then demonstrates that these features imply that science could not progress, hence an absurdity for proponents of the [[scientific method]].

The historical case studies also act as a [[reductio ad absurdum|reductio]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, "Feyerabend, Mill, and Pluralism", p. S397.&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend takes the premise that [[Galileo|Galileo's]] advancing of a [[heliocentric]] cosmology was an example of scientific progress. He then demonstrates that Galileo did not adhere to the conditions of methodological monism. Feyerabend also argues that, if Galileo had adhered to the conditions of methodological monism, then he could not have advanced a heliocentric cosmology. This implies that scientific progress would have been impaired by methodological monism. Again, an absurdity for proponents of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 4th ed., p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend summarises his [[reductio ad absurdum|reductios]] with the phrase "anything goes". This is his sarcastic imitation of "the terrified reaction of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history".&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 3rd ed., p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly reception ==

Some have seen the publication of ''Against Method'' as leading to Feyerabend's isolation from the community of philosophers of science, who objected to his view that there is no such thing as the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, John, ''Feyerabend: Philosophy, Science and Society'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions and translations ==
The first edition of ''Against Method'' went through several reprintings until the revised (second) edition came out in 1988. A further revision produced a third edition in 1993. The most recent edition, the fourth, was published by [[Verso Books]], in 2010, with a new introduction by [[Ian Hacking]].

A French translation by Baudouin Jurdant and Agnes Schlumberger was published by [[Éditions du Seuil]] in 1979, as ''Contre la méthode : esquisse d'une théorie anarchiste de la connaissance''. {{ISBN|2-02-005370-5}}

The German translation by [[Hermann Vetter]] was abridged and reworked by Feyerabend, whose native language was German. It was published by [[Suhrkamp Verlag]] in 1983 as ''Wider den Methodenzwang. Skizzen einer anarchistischen Erkenntnistheorie''. This translation went into a paperback edition in 1986, as part of the ''suhrkamp taschenbuch wissenschaft'' series, and has been reprinted several times.

A Dutch translation by Hein Kray was published by Boom in 1977, with the title ''In strijd met de methode''. In 2008 a new translation by Marjolijn Stoltenkamp was published, as ''Tegen de methode''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3093">Energy and nutrients derived from aquatic ecosystems and transferred to terrestrial ecosystems are termed '''aquatic-terrestrial''' subsidies or, more simply, aquatic subsidies. The most common examples of aquatic subsidies involve [[organism]]s that move across habitat boundaries and deposit their nutrients as they decompose in terrestrial habitats or are consumed by terrestrial predators, such as spiders, lizards, birds, and bats.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, D.E. &amp; Smits, A.P. (2017). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-016-0050-7 Subsidies of aquatic resources in terrestrial ecosystems]. Ecosystems, 20(1),78-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, C. V., Fausch, K. D., &amp; Carl Saunders, W. (2005)[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01328.x/abstract Tangled webs: reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey link streams and riparian zones]. Freshwater Biology, 50(2), 201-220.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is exemplified by aquatic insects that develop within streams and lakes before emerging as winged adults and moving to terrestrial habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Nakano, S., &amp; Murakami, M. (2001). [http://www.pnas.org/content/98/1/166.full Reciprocal subsidies: dynamic interdependence between terrestrial and aquatic food webs]. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(1), 166-170.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish removed from aquatic ecosystems by terrestrial predators are another important example. Conversely, the flow of energy and nutrients from [[terrestrial ecosystems]] to [[aquatic ecosystems]] are considered terrestrial subsidies; both aquatic subsidies and terrestrial subsidies are types of [[cross-boundary subsidies]]. 

==Ecological importance of aquatic subsidies==
While the magnitude of aquatic subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems is low compared to those moving in the reverse direction (from terrestrial to aquatic habitats), aquatic subsidies are generally of higher nutritional quality because they come from animal, rather than plant-based or detrital, sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bartels et al. (2012). [https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/11-1210.1 Reciprocal subsidies between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems structure consumer resource dynamics]. Ecology, 93(5), 1173-1182.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their nutritional value, however, aquatic subsidies are increasingly recognized as important sources of environmental contaminants to terrestrial food webs.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, D.M., Fritz, K.M., Otter, R.R. (2008).[https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/08-0354.1 The dark side of subsidies: adult stream insects export organic contaminants to riparian predators.]. Ecological Applications, 18(8), 1835-1841.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, aquatic animals can accumulate pollutants in their tissues and exoskeletons (such as metals and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]]) and move them to riparian and terrestrial systems as they emerge or are consumed by terrestrial predators.

The '''Board of Architectural Education''' is no longer appointed.  It had been a [[statutory body]] in the [[United Kingdom]] constituted under section 5 of the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931.

The Act was citable with two amending Acts as the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]]. Further amendments and changes enacted by the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]] included abolition of the statutory '''Board of Architectural Education'''.

==Nomination and appointment to the Board==

Subsection 5(1) of the 1931 Act had required the Board of Architecturaql Education to be appointed annually by the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK) ("the Council").  The Board was to be constituted in accordance with the Second Schedule of the Act.  This included:

* one person nominated by the [[Liverpool University|Liverpool School of Architecture]] and the nine other [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]] named in the Schedule;
* four persons nominated jointly by the Department of Architecture in the [[University of Cambridge]] and the eight other Schools of Architecture named in the Schedule;
* the Director of Education of the School of Architecture of the [[Architectural Association]] in [[London]];
* a total of 14 persons nominated by various other educational bodies, and
* 24 registered persons nominated by the Council.

==The Board's duty==

Subsection 5(2) of the 1931 Act had made it the duty of the Board (of Architectural Education) to recommend to the Council:

* the recognition of any examinations in architecture the passing of which ought, in the opinion of the Board (of Architectural Education), to qualify persons for registration in the Register of Registered Architects, and
* the holding of any examinations in architecture which ought, in the opinion of the Board (of Architectural Education), to be passed by applicants for registration.

==Statutory nomenclature==

The amendments to the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]] which were made by the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 included the abolition of the statutory Board of Architectural Education and renaming the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] as the [[Architects Registration Board]].  The Board of Architectural Education is not mentioned in the [[Architects Act 1997]], which consolidated and replaced the Acts of 1931 to 1938, as amended by the Act of 1996.

By section 26, "the Board" in the Architects Act 1997 was henceforth to mean the registration body renamed as the [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB), which had previously been named the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1043">[[Image:Music-breath.svg|thumb|A breath mark]]

A '''breath mark''' or '''luftpause''' is a [[symbol]] used in [[musical notation]].  It directs the performer of the music passage to take a breath (for [[wind instrument]]s and [[vocalist]]s) or to make a slight pause (for non-wind [[musical instrument|instrument]]s). This pause is normally intended to shorten the duration of the preceding [[Musical note|note]] and not to alter the [[tempo]]; in this function it can be thought of as a [[grace note|grace]] [[rest (music)|rest]].  It is usually placed above the [[staff (music)|staff]] and at the ends of [[phrase (music)|phrase]]s.  Its function is analogous to the [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] in several [[written language]]s.  Indeed, the two symbols look identical.

'''Codarts University for the Arts''' ({{lang-nl|Codarts hogeschool voor de kunsten}}) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[vocational university]] in [[Rotterdam]] that teaches music, dance and circus. It was established in its present location in 2000.

==History==

Codarts can trace its origins to the  Rotterdam Conservatorium voor Muziek (Rotterdam Conservatory of Music), popularly known as the Conservatorium Holthaus after its director, Jos Holthaus (1879-1943).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1930 the alternative Rotterdamsch Toonkunst Conservatorium (Rotterdam Musical Arts Conservatory) was founded with the composer [[Willem Pijper]] as director.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;
The Rotterdamse Dansschool (Rotterdam Dance School) was established in 1931 by [[Corrie Hartong]] as director and the German dancer [[Gertrud Leistikow]] as a teacher.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;  
At first the dance school was part of the Conservatorium Holthaus.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1935 the dance school transferred to Pijper's conservatory.  
Hartong remained as director. She was to stay in this position until 1961, and continued to teach until 1967.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;

[[World War II]] broke out in 1939 and the Netherlands were invaded in May 1940. On 14 May 1940 the buildings of the dance school and the main building of Pijper's conservatory were destroyed by bombs.  It was decided to merge Pijper's and Holthaus's conservatories into one building on Mathenesserlaan, where Holthaus had a branch.
Soon they moved again to a big old house that had somehow been spared, totally surrounded by rubble, and managed to continue day classes and early evening classes before curfew throughout the remainder of the war.
Until Holthaus died in 1943 the combined conservatory had two directors.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;

The Rotterdamse Dansschool was renamed the Rotterdamse Dansacademie (Rotterdam Dance Academy) in 1954.  In 1986 the Conservatory and Dance Academy became the Hogeschool voor Muziek en Theater Rotterdam (Rotterdam University of Music and Theatre).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
The school moved into its present modern building next to the [[De Doelen|Doelen]] concert hall in 2000 under the name Codarts - hogeschool voor de kunsten (Codarts - University of the Arts).&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;
The Circus arts program was launched in September 2006.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

==Schools==
[[File:Codarts Big Band, conducted by Ilja Reijngoud.jpg|thumb|Codarts Big Band, conducted by [[Ilja Reijngoud]], at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], July 2008]]
Codarts has three divisions: the Rotterdam Conservatory, Rotterdam Dance Academy, and Rotterdam Circus Arts.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

The Rotterdam Conservatory is one of the largest conservatories in the Netherlands, with over 900 pupils.
It offers courses through which students may obtain a bachelor's degree in any of several disciplines: Music Theater, Pop, Jazz, Composition/arranging, Music Production, Argentinean tango, Indian music, Flamenco, Latin/Latin jazz/Brazilian, Turkish music, Classical music, and Music in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The school puts on public performances, at times using the adjacent [[De Doelen]] concert hall.
Thus in April 2011 guest conductor [[Arie van Beek]] led the Codarts Orchestra and Codarts Chamber Choir in a performance in the Jurriaanse Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 2011 the Codarts Ensemble performed a program that explored the boundary between classical music and jazz, 
with works by Stravinsky, Gershwin, Shostakovich, Antheil and Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Codarts Ensemble played again at De Doelen in March 2012 with the Codarts Chamber Choir, performing a major work by [[Arthur Honegger]].
They were conducted by [[Wiecher Mandemaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dance Academy teaches dancers and arranges for students to appear in performances and tours.
Codarts helps students gain practical experience with internships with noted dance companies, and participates in student exchange programs with other European and American dance schools.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
In May 2011 the Rotterdam Dance Academy performed at the [[Venice Biennale]] with a show called ''Talent on the Move''.
The program included works by established choreographers such as  [[Jiří Kylián]], [[Nacho Duato]] and [[Mauro Bigonzetti]] and by younger artists including graduates of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Circus Arts school began offering a bachelor's course in September 2006, training students for careers in [[Contemporary circus|contemporary]] and traditional circus, in [[variety show]]s and in local or street theater.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
Circus students learn dance and drama as well as a wide range of circus techniques to prepare for a professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Havo voor Muziek en Dans]] (High School for Music and Dance) provides a secondary school education in which music and dance are part of the daily curriculum. It is co-located in the Codarts building and Codarts teachers teach the music and dance classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The high school was the subject of the 2007 documentary ''[[De Droomfabriek]]'' (The Dream Factory) directed by [[Netty van Hoorn]]''.&lt;ref name=Nfilmfest&gt;{{cite web

==Building==
[[File:CodartsRotterdam2017.jpg|thumb|Codarts Rotterdam]]
The building abuts the 1966 [[De Doelen]] concert and conference building, home of the [[Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra
 |title=Concertgebouw de Doelen |language=Dutch
 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was built as part of an overall plan for an extension to De Doelen defined in 1993 by Jan Hoogstad.
A new building site beside the Kruisplein was created by reducing the size of Karel Doormanstraat, and this was used for the Doelen extension and the Codarts building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.mimoa.eu/projects/Netherlands/Rotterdam/De%20Doelen
 |title=DE DOELEN |work=Mimoa
 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The building was developed by the architectural firm of [[Jan Hoogstad|Ector Hoogstad]], and was completed in 2000.
The plinth is mainly used for commercial purposes.
The building is relatively high to accommodate all the demands of the school, and has a total floor space of {{convert|10500|m2}}.
Visually, the Codarts building appears to reach over the end of the conference center.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

The building's steel skeleton supports a "box in box" design for the interior spaces, including several tall spaces with variable lighting.
A long escalator connects the entrance lobby to the fifth floor.
This is the main floor for Codarts, holding the restaurant, library and several performance rooms, and opening onto a terrace on the roof of the Doelen extension.
Codarts occupies classrooms and offices below this floor.  
The conservatory is above it and the large dance studios are at the top of the building.
The building is clad in brick to give an appearance consistent with nearby apartment buildings.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

==Notable alumni==
* [[Henk van der Vliet]] (1950), Dutch composer and flautist
* [[Willemijn Verkaik#cite note-Nieuws-1|Willemijn Verkaik]], Dutch theatre actress, best known for playing Elphaba from the musical [[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]] in the Netherlands, Germany, New York and London.
* [[San Holo]], Dutch record producer and DJ.

==History==

Comparative genomics has a root in the comparison of [[virus]] genomes in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=koonin/&gt; For example, small [[RNA viruses]] infecting animals ([[picornaviruses]]) and those infecting plants ([[cowpea mosaic virus]]) were compared and turned out to share significant sequence similarity and, in part, the order of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 12| issue = 18| pages = 7251–7267| authors = Argos, P.; Kamer, G.; Nicklin, M.J.; Wimmer, E.| title = Similarity in gene organization and homology between proteins of animal picornaviruses and a plant comovirus suggest common ancestry of these virus families| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| year = 1984| doi = 10.1093/nar/12.18.7251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the first comparative genomic study at a larger scale was published, comparing the genomes of [[varicella-zoster virus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] that contained more than 100 genes each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 14| issue = 10| pages = 4281–4292| first1 = D.J.|last1= McGeoch

The first high-resolution whole genome comparison system was developed in 1998 by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to the comparison of entire highly related microbial organisms with their collaborators at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The system is called  [[MUMmer|MUMMER]] and was described in a publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 1999. The system helps researchers to identify large rearrangements, single base mutations, reversals, tandem repeat expansions and other polymorphisms.  In bacteria, MUMMER enables the identification of polymorphisms that are responsible for virulence, pathogenicity, and anti-biotic resistance. The system was also applied to the Minimal Organism Project at TIGR and subsequently to many other comparative genomics projects.

With the publication of the large genomes of vertebrates in the 2000s, including [[Human Genome Project|human]], the [[Japanese pufferfish]] ''[[Takifugu rubripes]]'', and [[House mouse|mouse]], precomputed results of large genome comparisons have been released for downloading or for visualization in a [[genome browser]].

[[Next-generation sequencing]] methods, which were first introduced in 2007, have produced an enormous amount of genomic data and have allowed researchers to generate multiple (prokaryotic) draft genome sequences at once. These methods can also quickly uncover [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] by mapping [[Sequence assembly|unassembled reads]] against a well [[Genome annotation|annotated]] reference genome, and thus provide a list of possible gene differences that may be the basis for any functional variation among strains.&lt;ref name=hu/&gt;

==Evolutionary principles==
One character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function.

Similarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors’ genome. The closer the relationship between two organisms, the higher the similarities between their genomes. If there is close relationship between them, then their genome will display a linear behaviour ([[synteny]]), namely some or all of the genetic sequences are conserved. Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function.

Orthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for  collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.

[[File:BrowserFoxp2.jpg| Human [[FOXP2]] gene and evolutionary conservation is shown in and multiple alignment (at bottom of figure) in this image from the [[UCSC Genome Browser]].  Note that conservation tends to cluster around coding regions (exons). |thumb|right]]
Comparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the [[proteins]], [[RNA]], and [[regulatory regions]] of different organisms to infer how [[Selection (biology)|selection]] has acted upon these elements.  Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different [[species]] should be conserved through time ([[stabilizing selection]]), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent ([[Directional selection|positive selection]]).  Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral).

One of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. For this reason comparative genomics studies of small [[model organisms]] (for example the model [[Caenorhabditis elegans]] and closely related [[Caenorhabditis briggsae]]) are of great importance to advance our understanding of general mechanisms of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, L.D. |year=2003 |title=The genome sequence of Caenorhabditis briggsae: a platform for comparative genomics |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=E45 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000045 |pmid=14624247 |pmc=261899|display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Newly Sequenced Worm a Boon for Worm Biologists | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = e4–e4 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000044}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymorphisms==
===Single nucleotide polymorphisms===

SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) refers to the genome level by single nucleotide position, such as transformation or transversion mutation caused the DNA sequence polymorphism. According to the SNP in gene location, it can be divided into 3 classes: the genes code area SNP (coding - region SNPS, cSNP), gene surrounding SNP (perigenic SNPS, pSNP) and gene SNP (intergenic SNPS, iSNP). Published on February 17, 2005, the first human gene polymorphisms mapping is based on gene "linkage disequilibrium theory", using gene chip in 71 European Americans (white), African Americans (black) and the han Chinese Americans (yellow race), this research identified 1.58 million single nucleotide mutation of DNA locus, the map will help to predict the likelihood of certain diseases and make the best treatment plan, make an important step in the journey which based on gene of individualized health goals.

===Copy number polymorphism===
Before the invention of whole genome sequencing and gene chip technology, limited by high-throughput DNA genome copy number detection means, within the scope of the whole genome copy number polymorphism (copy number polymorphism, CNP), people know very little about the number and distribution. In 2004, a number of "human genome project" research bases in the world accidentally found that in the phenotypes of normal population, there are some differences in some gene copy numbers between different individuals, some people lost a lot of gene copy, while others have extra, extend the copies of the gene, the researchers call this phenomenon of “polymorphic gene copy number". It was because the CNP that caused the different between individuals such as disease, appetite and efficacy. Research shows that it has average 11 differences between 2 individuals, the average length of CNP is 465 KB, of which more than half of the CNP are repeated in more than one individual, and often in other types of chromosome rearrangement nearby.

==Classification==
===Interspecific comparative genomics===
Through the comparison of different related species genome sequence, can identify coding sequences, regulation and control of non-coding sequences and unique sequence of a given species. And within the scope of genome sequence alignment, can understand the similarities and differences in gene sequence, nucleotide composition, linear relationship of different objects, and then get the aspects of information about forecasts and positioning of genetic analysis, evolutionary relationship between biological systems.

===Intraspecific comparative genomics===
With same population in genome，there are a lot of mutation and polymorphism, because of these differences in the genome sequence constitutes the different disease susceptibility and genetic basis of different reactions to drugs and environmental factors in individuals and groups.

==Tools==

Computational tools for analyzing sequences and complete genomes are developing quickly due to the availability of large amount of genomic data. At the same time, comparative analysis tools are progressed and improved. In the challenges about these analyses, it is very important to visualize the comparative results.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Bergman, N.H. |title=Comparative Genomics: Volumes 1 and 2 |location=Totowa, New Jersey |publisher=Humana Press |year=2007 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1732/ |isbn=978-193411-537-4 |pmid=21250292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visualization of sequence conservation is a tough task of comparative sequence analysis. As we know, it is highly inefficient to examine the alignment of long genomic regions manually. Internet-based genome browsers provide many useful tools for investigating genomic sequences due to integrating all sequence-based biological information on genomic regions. When we extract large amount of relevant biological data, they can be very easy to use and less time-consuming.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is a field that reaps the benefits of comparative genomics. Identifying the [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice [[landrace]]s revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of agronomic performance, such as grain weight, [[amylose]] content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang, X.H.  |year=2010 |title=Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces  |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=11 |page=961-U76 |doi=10.1038/ng.695 |display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with agronomic performance required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Morrell, P.L., Buckler, E.S., Ross-Ibara, J. |year=2012 |title=Crop genomics: advances and applications |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=85–96 |doi=10.1038/nrg3097}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The medical field also benefits from the study of comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as [[reverse vaccinology]], researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seib, K.L., Zhao, X., Rappuoli, R. |year=2012 |title=Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=18 |issue=SI |pages=109–116 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03939.x}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can lead to the development of vaccines that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for [[Streptococcus agalactiae|Group B Streptococcus]], a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maione, D.  |year=2005 |title=Identification of a Universal Group B Streptococcus Vaccine by Multiple Genome Screen |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5731 |pages=148–150 |doi=10.1126/science.1109869 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..148M |pmid=15994562 |pmc=1351092}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genomics can also be used to generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rasco, D.A.  |year=2008 |title=The pangenome structure of Escherichia coli: Comparative genomic analysis of E-coli commensal and pathogenic isolates  |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=190 |issue=20 |pages=6881–6893 |doi=10.1128/JB.00619-08|display-authors=etal |pmid=18676672 |pmc=2566221}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Comparative genomics also opens up new avenues in other areas of research. As DNA sequencing technology has become more accessible, the number of sequenced genomes has grown. With the increasing reservoir of available genomic data, the potency of comparative genomic inference has grown as well. A notable case of this increased potency is found in recent primate research. Comparative genomic methods have allowed researchers to gather information about genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics in primates that were indiscernible using previous data and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rodgers J.; Gibbs R.A. |year=2014 |title=Applications of Next-Generation Sequencing Comparative primate genomics: emerging patterns of genome content and dynamics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1038/nrg3707|pmc=4113315 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Ape Genome Project used comparative genomic methods to investigate genetic variation with reference to the six [[Hominidae|great ape]] species, finding healthy levels of variation in their gene pool despite shrinking population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prado-Martinez, J.  |year=2013 |title=Great ape genetic diversity and population history |journal=Nature |volume=499 |issue=7459 |pages=471–475 |doi=10.1038/nature12228 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2013Natur.499..471P }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that patterns of DNA methylation, which are a known regulation mechanism for gene expression, differ in the prefrontal cortex of humans versus chimps, and implicated this difference in the evolutionary divergence of the two species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zeng, J.; Konopa, G.; Hunt, B.G.; Preuss, T.M.; Geschwind, D.; Yi, S.V. |year=2012 |title=Divergent Whole-Genome Methylation Maps of Human and Chimpanzee Brains Reveal Epigenetic Basis of Human Regulatory Evolution |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.07.024 |pmid=22922032 |pmc=3511995}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural materialism''' in [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]] traces its origin to the work of the [[left-wing]] literary critic [[Raymond Williams]]. Cultural materialism makes analysis based in [[critical theory]], in the tradition of the [[Frankfurt School]]. 

==Overview==
Cultural materialism emerged as a theoretical movement in the early 1980s along with [[new historicism]], an American approach to [[early modern]] literature, with which it shares much common ground. The term was coined by Williams, who used it to describe a theoretical blending of leftist culturalism and [[Marxist]] analysis. Cultural materialists deal with specific historical documents and attempt to analyze and recreate the zeitgeist of a particular moment in history. 

Williams viewed culture as a "productive process", part of the [[means of production]], and cultural materialism often identifies what he called "residual", "emergent" and "oppositional" cultural elements. Following in the tradition of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Antonio Gramsci]] and others, cultural materialists extend the [[Social class|class]]-based analysis of traditional [[Marxism]] ([[Neo-Marxism]]) by means of an additional focus on the [[marginalized]].

Cultural materialists analyze the processes by which [[hegemony|hegemonic]] forces in society appropriate canonical and historically important texts, such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Jane Austen|Austen]], and utilize them in an attempt to validate or inscribe certain values on the cultural [[Imaginary (sociology)|imaginary]]. [[Jonathan Dollimore]] and [[Alan Sinfield]], authors of ''[[Political Shakespeare]]'', have had considerable influence in the development of this movement and their book is considered to be a seminal text. They have identified four defining characteristics of cultural materialism as a theoretical device:
* Historical context
* Close textual analysis
* Political commitment
* Theoretical method

Cultural materialists seek to draw attention to the processes being employed by contemporary power structures, such as the church, the state or the academy, to disseminate [[ideology]]. To do this they explore a text’s historical context and its political implications, and then through close textual analysis note the dominant hegemonic position. They identify possibilities for the rejection and/or subversion of that position. British critic [[Graham Holderness]] defines cultural materialism as a "politicized form of historiography".

Through its insistence on the importance of an engagement with issues of [[gender]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]], cultural materialism has had a significant impact on the field of literary studies, especially in Britain. Cultural materialists have found the area of Renaissance studies particularly receptive to this type of analysis. Traditional [[Humanism|humanist]] readings often eschewed consideration of the oppressed and marginalized in textual readings, whereas cultural materialists routinely consider such groups in their engagement with literary texts, thus opening new avenues of approach to issues of [[Representation (arts)|representation]] in the field of literary criticism.

== Previous Cross-Cultural Research ==
While the field of cultural neuroscience may still be growing, there are studies conducted by various researchers that have looked at cross-cultural similarities and differences in human attention, visual perception, and the understanding of others and the self &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ames |first1=D. L. |last2=Fiske |first2=S. T. |journal=Cultural Neuroscience |date=May 20, 2010 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3714113/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Previous behavioral research has focused on the cultural differences in perception, particularly between people from East Asian and Western regions. The results from these studies have suggested that East Asians focus their visual perception more on the backgrounds and contexts of their environment, while Westerners focus on individual stimuli/objects. To further explore these findings, more research was done to specifically look at the neurological similarities and differences in attention and visual perception of people in East Asian and Western cultures.

Results from a 2008 study by Hedden et al. support the previous findings by showing how East Asians require more attention than Americans for individually processing objects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hedden |first1=T. |last2=Ketay |first2=S. |last3=Aron |first3=A. |last4=Markus |first4=H. R. |last5=Gabrieli |first5=J. D. |title=Cultural Influences on Neural Substrates of Attentional Control |journal=Psychological Science |date=2008 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=12-17 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Brain regions more focused on attention, such as areas in the parietal and prefrontal lobes as well as the inferior parietal lobule and precentral gyrus, were found to be highly active in East Asian subjects compared to American subjects, during individual object processing. A visual perception study conducted by Gutchess et al. in 2006, also found neurological differences between Chinese and American subjects as they completed tasks of encoding images of individual objects, backgrounds, and objects with backgrounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gutchess |first1=A. H. |last2=Welsh |first2=R. C. |last3=Boduroglu |first3=A. |last4=Park |first4=D. C. |title=Cultural differences in neural function associated with object processing |journal=Cognitive, Affective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience |date=2006 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=102-109 |doi=10.3758/cabn.6.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fMRI results from the study presented that during visual processing of objects, there was greater neural activity in the middle temporal gyri, right superior temporal gyri, and superior parietal lobules of the American subjects than that of the Chinese subjects. Such results indicate a focus on object processing among Westerners compared to East Asians. Insignificant differences in neural activity between subjects were found during the visual processing of images with backgrounds.

People from East Asian and Western cultures were also studied to learn more about cross-cultural differences in understanding both the self and other people. Findings from a 1991 study by Markus and Kitayama presented that people from Eastern cultures view the self in relation to others in their community, while people from Western cultures have a more independent perspective of the self &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Markus |first1=H. R. |last2=Kitayama |first2=S. |title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation |journal=Psychological Review |date=1991 |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=224-253 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A 2007 fMRI study observed differences in activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region highly active during self perception, when Western and Chinese subjects were thinking about themselves versus when they were thinking about their mothers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhu |first1=Y. |last2=Zhang |first2=L. |last3=Fan |first3=J. |last4=Han |first4=S. |title=Neural basis of cultural influence on self-representation |journal=NeuroImage |date=2007 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=1310-1316 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.047}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results interestingly showed that there was still activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortices of Chinese subjects even when they thought about their mothers, while activity was only detected in American subjects when they thought about themselves.

A different study conducted by psychologist Joan Chiao found that due to cultural differences, East Asians are more likely to suffer from depression than Americans. She found that East Asians are more likely to carry the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (STG) which leads to depression while Americans carry the long allele which doesn't lead to depression. Yet due to difference in cultural structure they found that collectivist societies are more likely to find happiness than individual societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2009/10/chiao.html|title='Culture of We' Buffers Genetic Tendency to Depression: Northwestern University News|website=www.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study done by psychologists Nalini Ambady and Jonathan Freeman showed a difference in brain activity between Japanese and Americans when shown different body posture. They found that the [[Reward system|reward circuitry]] in the [[limbic system]] would light up when Japanese participants saw submissive body posture while the reward circuitry would activate when Americans saw dominant body posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/11/neuroscience.aspx|title=Your brain on culture|website=www.apa.org|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture differences in visual stimuli ==
Cultural differences exist in the ventral visual cortex and many studies have shown this. In a study conducted in 2005 they found that East Asians were more likely to keep their eyes focused on background scenes than westerners who would instead focus more on the central object such as a giraffe in a savanna. In a similar 2006 study it showed that in congruence to the difference in society structure westerners showed more activation in object processing regions, including the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus, although no activation differences were observed in context-processing regions such as the [[hippocampus]]. However, there has been some research contradicting cultural bias in the [[Oculomotor nerve|oculomotor]] control such as one conducted in 2007 by Rayner, Li, Williams, Cave, and well who failed to find evidence that East Asians focus more on context although they did find evidence that they are more likely to focus less on central objects. In a different study they focused more on difference in attention towards faces. They proved that Americans focus more broadly on the entire face such as both the eyes and mouth while Asians focus more on a single part, such as the mouth. The authors point out that this happens due to gaze avoidance in east Asian culture as a way of politeness. In 2008, another study focusing on context showed that East Asians were more likely to include greater details and background when taking photographs of a model when they were free to set the zoom function of the camera as they saw fit. In 2003, a group of researchers used the Frame-Line Test and asked the participants to draw a line of either exactly the same length as the one showed or one that was proportional in size. Americans were more accurate in the absolute task, suggesting better memory for the exact or absolute size of the focal object, but East Asians were more accurate in the relative (proportional) task, suggesting better memory for contextual relationships. In a later study conducted by the same group they found a pattern within the cultures when processing emotions. East Asians were less likely to know the difference between fear and disgust than Americans when sampling faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Denise C.|last2=Huang|first2=Chih-Mao|date=2010-07-01|title=Culture Wires the Brain: A Cognitive Neuroscience Perspective|journal=Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science|volume=5|issue=4|pages=391–400|doi=10.1177/1745691610374591|issn=1745-6916|pmc=3409833|pmid=22866061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies conducted proves that constant repetition in a certain skill has an effect on brain activity. For example, in a 2000 study they showed that taxi drivers in London showed larger gray matter in the [[Hippocampus|posterior hippocampi]] than the average civilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maguire|first=Eleanor A.|last2=Woollett|first2=Katherine|last3=Spiers|first3=Hugo J.|date=2006-01-01|title=London taxi drivers and bus drivers: a structural MRI and neuropsychological analysis|journal=Hippocampus|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1091–1101|doi=10.1002/hipo.20233|issn=1050-9631|pmid=17024677}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study in 2004 showed that those who know how to juggle have an increase in volume of the cortical tissue in the bilateral midtemporal area and left posterior [[intraparietal sulcus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driemeyer|first=Joenna|last2=Boyke|first2=Janina|last3=Gaser|first3=Christian|last4=Büchel|first4=Christian|last5=May|first5=Arne|date=2008-07-23|title=Changes in Gray Matter Induced by Learning—Revisited|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=3|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002669|issn=1932-6203|pmc=2447176|pmid=18648501|pages=e2669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings from many neuroimaging studies reflect the behavioral patterns observed in previous anthropological and cultural research. Such comparisons that were made between particular behavioral and neural activity across different cultures, have already provided the scientific community with more insight into the cultural influences on human behavior.

'''DNA demethylation''' is the process of removal of a methyl group from nucleotides in [[DNA]]. Both DNA demethylation and methylation play important roles in mammalian development and differentiation, as well as in [[cognition]] and [[neuroregeneration]] (after injury to [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]] in mammals). [[DNA methylation]] on [[cytosine]] at [[CpG site]]s on a gene [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] leads to the silencing of [[Downregulation and upregulation|gene expression]], while DNA demethylation of a gene promoter is linked to transcriptional activation and gene expression. These are called [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes. The [[DNA methylation]] status that controls gene expression is copied during DNA replication and is transmitted to daughter cells along with the DNA sequence. This area is currently being investigated for its role in disease progression and for potential treatments, such as cancer therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DNA demethylation |url=https://www.epigentek.com/catalog/dna-demethylation.php |website=Epigentek |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Passive and active demethylation==
DNA [[demethylation]] can occur through passive or active mechanisms. The passive process takes place in the absence of methylation of newly [[Chemical synthesis|synthesised]] DNA strands by [[DNMT1]] during several replication rounds (for example, upon [[5-Azacytidine]] treatment), leading to dilution of the methylation signal. Active DNA demethylation is mediated by multiple enzymes and can occur independent of DNA replication.

==Examples DNA Demethylation==
All the cases of DNA demethylation can be classified as global ([[genome]] wide) or locus-specific (when just specific sequences are demethylated).
The genome-wide DNA demethylation occurs:

# In mammals:
## In the male [[pronucleus]] of [[zygote]] immediately after [[fertilization]];
## In mouse [[primordial germ cells]] (PGCs) between E8.5-11.5 day old embryos;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hackett|first=JA|author2=Sengupta, R |author3=Zylicz, JJ |author4=Murakami, K |author5=Lee, C |author6=Down, T |author7=Surani, MA |title=Germline DNA demethylation dynamics and imprint erasure through 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.|journal=Science|date=2012-12-06|pmid=23223451|doi=10.1126/science.1229277|volume=339|issue=6118|pages=448–52|pmc=3847602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible mechanisms of active DNA demethylation==
There are several proposed hypothetical mechanisms of active DNA demethylation:

'''A''' Direct removal of 5-methylcytosine
# Direct removal of methyl group. This process has quite low [[thermodynamic]] probability.
# Removal of methylated bases (either by direct removal of [[methylcytosine]], or through cytosine deamination followed by removal of thymine from thymine/guanosine mismatch), followed by insertion of unmethylated one using [[base excision repair]] machinery (BER).
# Removal of entire DNA patch and following filling it with new nucleotides by [[nucleotide excision repair]] (NER) or [[DNA mismatch repair|mismatch repair]] (MMR).&lt;ref name=Grin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grin|first=I|author2=Ishchenko, AA|title=An interplay of the base excision repair and mismatch repair pathways in active DNA demethylation|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|date=May 2016|volume=44|issue=8|pages=3713–27|doi=10.1093/nar/gkw059|pmid=26843430|pmc=4856981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''B''' Removal of 5-methylcytosine via further modified cytosine bases

Oxidation of the methyl group generates [[5-Hydroxymethylcytosine]].

==DNA hydroxymethylation==

DNA hydroxymethylation has been proposed to act as a specific epigenetic mark opposing DNA methylation, rather than a passive intermediate in the de-methylation pathway. DNA hydroxymethylation ''in vivo'' is sometimes associated with labile nucleosomes, which are more easy to disassemble and to be out-competed by transcription factors during cell development.&lt;ref name=Teif&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teif|first=Vladimir|author2=Beshnova, Daria A. |author3=Vainshtein, Yevhen |author4=Marth, Caroline |author5=Mallm, Jan-Philipp |author6=Höfer, Thomas |author7= Rippe, Karsten |title=Nucleosome repositioning links DNA (de)methylation and differential CTCF binding during stem cell development|journal=Genome Research|date=8 May 2014|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1285–1295|doi= 10.1101/gr.164418.113|pmid=24812327 |pmc=4120082}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydroxymethylation has been associated with pluripotency of stem cells. Furthermore, changes in hydroxymethylation have been associated with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/methylation/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognition==
[[File:Demethylation of 5-methylcytosine.svg|thumb|400 px|Demethylation of [[5-Methylcytosine]] (5mC) in neuron DNA.  As reviewed in 2018,&lt;ref name="pmid29875631"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bayraktar G, Kreutz MR |title=The Role of Activity-Dependent DNA Demethylation in the Adult Brain and in Neurological Disorders |journal=Front Mol Neurosci |volume=11 |issue= |pages=169 |date=2018 |pmid=29875631 |pmc=5975432 |doi=10.3389/fnmol.2018.00169 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in brain neurons, 5mC is oxidized by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases ([[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1|TET1]], [[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2|TET2]], [[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3|TET3]]) to generate [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]] (5hmC).  In successive steps TET enzymes further hydroxylate 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC).  [[Thymine-DNA glycosylase]] (TDG) recognizes the intermediate bases 5fC and 5caC and excises the [[glycosidic bond]] resulting in an apyrimidinic site ([[AP site]]).  In an alternative oxidative deamination pathway, 5hmC can be oxidatively deaminated by activity-induced cytidine deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex [[APOBEC3G|(AID/APOBEC)]] deaminases to form 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5mC can be converted to [[thymine]] (Thy).  5hmU can be cleaved by TDG, single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 ([[SMUG1]]), Nei-Like DNA Glycosylase 1 ([[NEIL1]]), or methyl-CpG binding protein 4 ([[MBD4]]).  AP sites and T:G mismatches are then repaired by base excision repair (BER) enzymes to yield [[cytosine]] (Cyt).]]

Active [[DNA methylation]] and demethylation is required for the [[cognition]] process of [[memory]] formation and maintenance.&lt;ref name=DukeSweatt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duke CG, Kennedy AJ, Gavin CF, Day JJ, Sweatt JD |title=Experience-dependent epigenomic reorganization in the hippocampus |journal=Learn.

'''Development geography''' is a branch of [[geography]] which refers to the [[standard of living]] and its [[quality of life]] of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi.com.au/geogglobal1/pdf/global1_2_3.pdf Geography of global interactions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528032624/http://www.hi.com.au/geogglobal1/pdf/global1_2_3.pdf |date=2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, development is not always a positive process. [[Gunder Frank]] commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his [[dependency theory]].

In development geography, geographers study spatial patterns in development. They try to find by what characteristics they can measure development by looking at [[economic]], [[political]] and [[social]] factors. They seek to understand both the geographical ''causes'' and ''consequences'' of varying development. Studies compare [[MEDCs|More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs)]] with [[LEDC|Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs)]]. Additionally variations within countries are looked at such as the differences between [[Italy|northern]] and southern Italy, the [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]].

==Quantitative indicators==
Quantitative indicators are numerical indications of development.
*Economic include [[GNP]] (Gross National Product) per capita, [[unemployment]] rates, [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]] and percentage of GNP in primary industries. Of these, GNP per capita is the most used as it measures the value of all the goods and services produced in a country, excluding those produced by foreign companies, hence measuring the economic and industrial development of the country. However, using GNP per capita also has many problems. 
**It does not take into account the distribution of the money which can often be extremely unequal as in the [[UAE]] where oil money has been collected by a rich elite and has not flowed to the bulk of the country. 
**GNP does not measure whether the money produced is actually improving people's lives and this is important because in many MEDCs there are large increases in wealth over time but only small increases in happiness. 
**The figure rarely takes into account the unofficial economy, which includes subsistence agriculture and cash-in-hand or unpaid work, which is often substantial in LEDCs. In LEDCs it is often too expensive to accurately collect this data and some governments intentionally or unintentionally release inaccurate figures{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. 
** The figure is usually given in US dollars which due to changing currency exchange rates can distort the money's true street value so it is often converted using [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) in which the actual comparative purchasing power of the money in the country is calculated.
* Social indications include access to clean water and [[sanitation]] (which indicate the level of infrastructure developed in the country) and adult [[literacy]] rate, measuring the resources the government has to meet the needs of the people.
*Demographic indicators include the [[birth rate]], [[death rate]] and [[fertility rate]], which indicate the level of [[industrialization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/devindicatorsrev2.shtml BBC bitesize]&lt;/ref&gt;
**Health indicators (a sub-factor of demographic indicators) include [[nutrition]] (calories per day, calories from protein, percentage of population with malnutrition), [[infant mortality]] and population per doctor, which indicate the availability of [[healthcare]] and [[sanitation]] facilities in a country.
*Environmental indications include how much a country does for the environment.

===Composite indicators===
*In the table below [[GDP]] stands for gross domestic product, which is generally taken to be equal to GNP.
*Other composite measures include the [[PQLI]] (Physical Quality of Life Index) which was a precursor to the HDI which used infant mortality rate instead of GNP per capita and rated countries from 0 to 100. It was calculated by assigning each country a score of 0 to 100 for each indicator compared with other countries in the world. The average of these three numbers makes the PQLI of a country.
*The [[Human Poverty Index|HPI]] (Human Poverty Index) is used to calculate the percentage of people in a country who live in relative poverty. In order to better differentiate the number of people in abnormally poor living conditions the HPI-1 is used in developing countries, and the HPI-2 is used in developed countries. The HPI-1 is calculated based on the percentage of people not expected to survive to 40, the adult illiteracy rate, the percentage of people without access to safe water, health services and the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight. The HPI-2 is calculated based on the percentage of people who do not survive to 60, the adult [[functional illiteracy]] rate and the percentage of people living below 50% of median personal disposable income.
*The [[Gender-related Development Index|GDI]] (Gender-related Development Index) measures gender equality in a country in terms of life expectancy, literacy rates, school attendance and income.

==Qualitative indicators==
Qualitative indicators include descriptions of living conditions and people's quality of life. They are useful in analyzing features that are not easily calculated or measured in numbers such as freedom, corruption, or security, which are largely non-material benefits.

==Geographic variations in development==
[[Image:North South divide.svg|The updated view of the [[north-south divide]]. Blue includes G8 nations, developed / first world nations, and Europe|right|thumb|350px]]
There is a considerable spatial variation in development rates.

{{quote|Global wealth also increased in material terms, and during the period 1947 to 2000, average per capita incomes tripled as global GDP increased almost tenfold (from $US3 trillion to $US30 trillion)... Over 25% of the 4.5 billion people in LEDCs still have life expectancies below 40 years. More than 80 countries have a lower annual per capita income in 2000 than they did in 1990. The average income in the world's five richest countries is 74 times the level in the world's poorest five, the widest it has ever been. Nearly 1.3 billion people have no access to clean water. About 840 million people are malnourished.|Stephen Codrington&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetgeography.com Codrington, Stephen ''Planet Geography 3rd Edition'' (2005) Page 97]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most famous pattern in development is the [[North-South divide]]. The North-South divide separates the rich North or the developed world, from the poor South. This line of division is not as straightforward as it sounds and splits the globe into two main parts. It is also known as the Brandt Line.

The "North" in this divide is regarded as being North America, Europe, Russia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the like. The countries within this area are generally the more economically developed. The "South" therefore encompasses the remainder of the Southern Hemisphere, mostly consisting of KFCs. Another possible dividing line is the Tropic of Cancer with the exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. It is critical to understand that the status of countries is far from static and the pattern is likely to become distorted with the fast development of certain southern countries, many of them [[Newly industrialized countries|NICs]] (Newly Industrialised Countries) including India, Thailand, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico and others. These countries are experiencing sustained fast development on the back of growing manufacturing industries and exports.

Most countries are experiencing significant increases in wealth and standard of living. However, there are unfortunate exceptions to this rule. Noticeably some of the former [[Soviet Union]] countries has experienced major disruption of industry in the transition to a market economy. Many African nations have recently experienced reduced GNPs due to wars and the AIDS epidemic, including Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone and others. Arab oil producers rely very heavily on oil exports to support their GDPs so any reduction in oil's market price can lead to rapid decreases in GNP. Countries which rely on only a few exports for much of their income are very vulnerable to changes in the market value of those commodities and are often derogatively called [[banana republics]]. Many developing countries do rely on exports of a few primary goods for a large amount of their income (coffee and timber for example), and this can create havoc when the value of these commodities drops, leaving these countries with no way to pay off their debts.

Within countries the pattern is that wealth is more concentrated around urban areas than rural areas. Wealth also tends towards areas with natural resources or in areas that are involved in tertiary (service) industries and trade. This leads to a gathering of wealth around mines and monetary centres such as New York, London and Tokyo.

==Barriers to international development==

Geographers along with other social scientists have recognized that certain factors present in a given society may impede the social and economic development of that society. Factors, which have been identified as obstructing the economic and social welfare of developing societies, include:

*Lack of education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gyimah-Brempong | first1 = K | year = 2011 | title = Education and Economic Development in Africa | url = | journal = [[African Development Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 219–236 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8268.2011.00282.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Lack of healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/17537980810861475 |title=Spearheading human and economic development in the Arab world through evidence‐based and world‐class healthcare |journal=Education, Business and Society: Contemporary Middle Eastern Issues |volume=1 |pages=12 |year=2008 |last1=Bowman |first1=Brett |last2=Matzopoulos |first2=Richard |last3=Lerer |first3=Leonard }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Pervasiveness of intoxicating drugs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = Merrill | year = 2008 | title = Drugs and development: The global impact of drug use and trafficking on social and economic development | url = | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 467–478 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugpo.2006.12.007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Weak political, social, and economic institutions&lt;ref&gt;Hernando de Soto, ''Dead Capital and the Poor'', The Johns Hopkins University Press. 2001{{pn|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Ineffective taxation
*Environmental degradation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mosznski | first1 = Peter | year = 2011 | title = Environmental degradation risks undermining development progress, warns report | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 343 | issue = | pages = d7043| doi = 10.1136/bmj.d7043 | pmid = 22049525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Lack of religious/gender/racial/sexual freedoms
*Indebtedness
*Protectionist barriers to trade&lt;ref&gt;Merideth Kolsky Lewis "The EU's Protectionist Problem" Georgetown journal of International affairs. 01/01/2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Foreign aid&lt;ref&gt;Africa: the poorest continent is rising. Really. Dambisa Moyo. Foreign Policy. .172 (May–June 2009) p90&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Dependence upon primary resource exports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00125-8 |title=The curse of natural resources |journal=European Economic Review |volume=45 |issue=4–6 |pages=827 |year=2001 |last1=Sachs |first1=Jeffrey D. |last2=Warner |first2=Andrew M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Unequal distribution of wealth
*Inhospitable climate

Effective governments may address many barriers to economic and social development, however in many instances this is challenging due to the path dependency societies develop regarding many of these issues.  Some barriers to development may be impossible to address, such as climatic barriers to development.  In these cases societies must evaluate whether such climatic barriers to development dictate that society must relocate a given settlement in order to enjoy greater economic development.

Many scholars agree that foreign aid provided to developing nations is ineffective and in many instances counter productive.&lt;ref&gt;Africa: the poorest continent is rising. Really.Dambisa Moyo. Foreign Policy. .172 (May–June 2009) p90.&lt;/ref&gt;   This is due to the manner in which foreign aid changes the incentives for productivity in a given developing society, and the manner in which foreign aid has the tendency to corrupt the governments responsible for its allocation and distribution.

Cultural barriers to development such as discrimination based on gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation are challenging to address in certain oppressive societies, though recent progress has been significant in some societies.

While the aforementioned barriers to economic growth and development are most prevalent in the less developed economies of the world, even the most developed economies are plagued by select barriers to development such as drug prohibition and income inequality.

== Aid ==
[[MEDC]]s (More Economically Developed Countries) can give aid to [[LEDC]]s (Less Economically Developed Countries). There are several types of aid:
* Governmental (bilateral) aid
* International Organizational (multilateral) aid, e.g. The World Bank
* Voluntary aid from individuals, often mediated through NGOs
* Short-term/emergency aid (humanitarian assistance)
* Long-term/sustainable aid
* Non-governmental organization (NGO) aid

Aid can be given in several ways. Through money, materials, or skilled and learned people (e.g. teachers).

Aid has advantages. Mostly short-term or emergency aid help people in LEDCs to survive a natural (earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption etc.) or human (civil war etc.) disaster. Aid helps make the recipient country (the country that receives aid) get more developed.

However, aid also has disadvantages. Often aid does not even reach the poorest people. Often money gained from aid is used up to make infrastructures (bridges, roads etc.), which only the rich can use. Also, the recipient country becomes more dependent on aid from a donor country (the country giving aid).

Whilst the above conception of aid has been the most pervasive within development geography work, it is important to remember that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide alternative development discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of "LEDCs", as well as the discursive symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states.&lt;ref&gt;Mawdsley, E. (2012) 'The Changing Geographies of Foreign Aid and Development Cooperation: Contributions from Gift Theory' Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 37(2): 256-72&lt;/ref&gt; Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign aid policy as recently as 2011&lt;ref&gt;China publishes first report on foreign aid policy, ''[[The Guardian]]'' report: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/apr/28/china-foreign-aid-policy-report&lt;/ref&gt; and India, an often cited aid recipient, but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;India's foreign aid programmes: https://m.devex.com/news/india-s-foreign-aid-program-catches-up-with-its/80919&lt;/ref&gt;

The term down-shifting in the English language refers to the act of reducing the gear of a motor vehicle while driving a [[manual transmission]]. This title or term has now been re purposed and applied to describe a [[social behavior]] or [[Social Trends|trend]] in which individuals live simpler lives to escape from what critics call the [[rat race]].

The long-term effect of downshifting can include an escape from what has been described as [[economic materialism]], as well as reduce the "stress and psychological expense that may accompany [[economic materialism]]". This new social trend emphasizes finding an improved [[Work–life balance|balance between leisure and work]], while also focusing life goals on personal fulfillment, as well as building personal relationships instead of the all-consuming pursuit of economic success.

Down-shifting, as a concept, shares many characteristics with [[simple living]]. However, it is distinguished as an alternative form by its focus on moderate change and concentration on an individual comfort level and a gradual approach to living.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"&gt;Tracey Smith, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, this new form of simple living began appearing in the [[mainstream media]], and has continually grown in popularity among populations living in [[Industrial society|industrial societies]], especially the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 67;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values and motives==
Down-shifters are people that adopt long-term [[voluntary simplicity]] in their lives. A few of the main practices of down-shifters include accepting less money for fewer hours worked, while placing an emphasis on consuming less in order to reduce their ecological footprint.  One of the main results of these practices is being able to enjoy more [[Leisure|leisure time]] in the company of others, especially loved ones.  

The primary motivations for downshifting are gaining leisure time, escaping from [[consumerism|work-and-spend cycle]], and removing the clutter of unnecessary possessions. The personal goals of downshifting are simple:  To reach a holistic self-understanding and satisfying meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its personalized nature and emphasis on many minor changes, rather than complete lifestyle overhaul, it attracts downshifters or participants across the socioeconomic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Both of Hamilton's case studies in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  An intrinsic consequence of downshifting is increased time for non-work-related activities, which, combined with the diverse demographics of downshifters, cultivates higher levels of [[civic engagement]] and [[Social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of participation is limitless, because all members of society &amp;mdash; adults, children, businesses, institutions, organizations, and governments &amp;mdash; are able to downshift.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;

In practice, down-shifting involves a variety of [[behavior change (public health)|behavioral and lifestyle changes]]. The majority of these down-shifts are voluntary choices. Natural life course events, such as the loss of a job, or birth of a child can prompt involuntary down-shifting. There is also a [[Time|temporal dimension]], because a down-shift could be either temporary or permanent.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"&gt;Schor 1998, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

===Work and income===
The most common form of down-shifting is work (or income) down-shifting. Down-shifting is fundamentally based on dissatisfaction with the conditions and consequences of the workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  The philosophy of work-to-live replaces the social [[ideology]] of live-to-work. Reorienting economic priorities shifts the [[work–life balance]] away from the workplace.

Economically, work downshifts are defined in terms of reductions in either actual or potential [[income]], work hours, and spending levels.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  Following a path of earnings that is lower than the established market path is a downshift in potential earnings in favor of gaining other non-material benefits.

On an individual level, work downshifting is a voluntary reduction in annual income. Downshifters desire meaning in life outside of work and, therefore, will opt to decrease the amount of time spent at work or work hours.  Reducing the number of hours of work, consequently, lowers the amount earned.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, pps. 66-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply not working [[overtime]] or taking a half-day a week for leisure time, are work downshifts.

Career downshifts are another way of downshifting economically and entail lowering previous aspirations of [[wealth]], a promotion or higher [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Juniu 2000, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Quitting a job to work locally in the community, from home or to start a business are examples of career downshifts.  Although more radical, these changes do not mean stopping work altogether.

Many reasons are cited by workers for this choice and usually center on a personal [[cost–benefit analysis]] of current working situations and the quality extracurricular activities. High stress, pressure from employers to increase productivity, and long [[Commuting|commutes]] can be factors that contribute to the costs of being employed.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  If the down-shifter wants more [[quality time|non-material benefits]] like leisure time, a healthy family life, or personal freedom, then, switching jobs could be a desirable option.

Work down-shifting may also be a key to considerable [[Health#Maintaining|health benefit]]s as well as a healthy [[retirement]]. People are retiring later in life than previous generations. We can see by looking at The Health and Retirement Study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu|title=Welcome to the Health and Retirement Study|website=hrsonline.isr.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; done by the Health and Retirement Study Survey Research Center, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gustman|first=Alan|last2=Mitchell|first2=Olivia|last3=Steinmeier|first3=Thomas|date=1994-08|title=Retirement Research Using the Health and Retirement Survey|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w4813|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;women can show the long term [[Health#Maintaining|health benefits]] of down-shifting their work lives by working part time hours over a long period of years. Men however prove to be more unhealthy if they work part time from [[middle age]] till [[Retirement age|retirement]]. Men that down-shift their work life to part time hours at the age of 60 to 65 however benefit from continuing to work a part time job through a semi retirement even over the age of 70. This is an example of how flexible working policies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Suzan|last2=Roper|first2=Ian|date=2009-09-02|title=Flexible Working Arrangements: From Work–Life to Gender Equity Policies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199234738.003.0018|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199234738.003.0018}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be a key to being healthy while in retirement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Peggy|last2=Worts|first2=Diana|last3=Corna|first3=Laurie M.|last4=McMunn|first4=Anne|last5=Sacker|first5=Amanda|date=2017-12|title=Later-life employment trajectories and health|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2017.09.002|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|volume=34|pages=22–33|doi=10.1016/j.alcr.2017.09.002|issn=1040-2608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spending habits===
Another aspect of down-shifting is being a [[Ethical consumerism|conscious consumer]] or actively practicing alternative forms of consumption. Proponents of down-shifting point to [[consumerism]] as a primary source of stress and dissatisfaction because it creates a society of individualistic consumers who measure both social status and general happiness by an [[affluenza|unattainable quantity of material possessions]]. Instead of buying goods for personal satisfaction, consumption down-shifting, purchasing only the necessities, is a way to focus on quality of life rather than quantity.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"/&gt;

This realignment of spending priorities promotes the functional utility of goods over their ability to convey status which is evident in downshifters being, in general, less [[brand]]-conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; These consumption habits also facilitate the option of working and earning less because annual spending is proportionally lower. Reducing spending is less demanding than more extreme downshifts in other areas, like employment, as it requires only minor lifestyle changes.

===Policies that enable downshifting===
Unions, business, and governments could implement more [[Flextime|flexible working hours]], [[Part-time contract|part-time]] work, and other non-traditional work arrangements that enable people to work less, while still maintaining employment. Small business legislation, reduced filing requirements and reduced tax rates encourage small-scale individual [[entrepreneurship]] and therefore help individuals quit their jobs altogether and work for themselves on their own terms.&lt;ref name=GreenIllusions&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|url=http://www.greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment consequences===
The catch-phrase of International Downshifting Week is "Slow Down and Green Up".&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;  Whether intentional or unintentional, generally, the choices and practices of down-shifters nurture environmental health because they reject the fast-paced lifestyle fueled by [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and adopt more sustainable lifestyles. The [[Manifest and latent functions and dysfunctions|latent function]] of consumption down-shifting is to reduce, to some degree, the [[carbon footprint]] of the individual down-shifter.  An example is to shift from a corporate suburban rat race lifestyle to a small eco friendly farming lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444327204577615972288993492 ''The Ultimate Growth Business; Many corporate refugees think green acres are the place to be. How do they make the transition?]'' October 12, 2012 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down-shifting geographically===
As a response the hectic pace of life and stresses in urban areas, downshifting geographically is a relocation to a smaller, rural, or more slow-paced community.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  This is a more drastic change, but because the access to the internet is widespread and possible, downshifting geographically does not bring total removal from mainstream culture.

==Sociopolitical implications==
Although downshifting is primarily motivated by personal desire and not by a conscious political stance, it does define societal [[overconsumption]] as the source of much personal discontent. By redefining life satisfaction in non-material terms, downshifters assume an alternative lifestyle but continue to coexist in a society and political system preoccupied with the economy. In general, downshifters are politically apathetic because mainstream politicians mobilize voters through the ''hip-pocket nerve'', proposing governmental solutions to periods of financial hardship and [[recession|economic recessions]]. This economic rhetoric is meaningless to downshifters who have forgone worrying about money.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Jan. 2003, pps. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Although consumers do hold the majority in the United States, the UK, and Australia, a significant minority, approximately 20 to 25 percent,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Both 2003 Studies&lt;/ref&gt; of these countries' citizens identify themselves in some respect as downshifters. Downshifting is not an isolated or unusual choice.  Politics still centers around consumerism and unrestricted growth, but downshifting value, such as family priorities and workplace regulation, are appearing in political debates and campaigns.

Like downshifters, the [[The Cultural Creatives|Cultural Creatives]] is another social movement whose ideology and practices diverge from mainstream [[consumerism]] and according to Paul Ray, are followed by at least a quarter of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''In Praise of Slowness'', Carl Honoré relates followers of downshifting and [[simple living]] to the global [[Slow movement (culture)|Slow Movement]].

The emergence of a large and diverse class of downshifters challenges the economically bias ideas for improving society.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, pps. 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;  Downshifting and similar, [[Post-materialism|post-materialist]] ideologies are rising in popularity, but as a result of their [[grassroots]] nature, and relatively inconspicuous, non-confrontational subcultures, they represent unorganized [[List of social movements|social movements]] without political aspirations or motivating grievances.

These separation mechanisms operate essentially in superposition along the length of a gel filtration column to which an axial electric field gradient has been added.

'''Field acceleration method''' (FAM) is the target state variable of the field acceleration method is [[induction motor]] [[torque]]. In FAM theory, co-ordinate transformation is not involved. It attempts to avoid electromagnetic transients which cause delay in torque control response. First, electromagnetic transients of [[three-phase]] induction motor are analyzed. Initial attempt is made to derive `equivalent circuits valid for both steady state and transient states in induction motor.

The key point of FAM control is that the exciting current is kept constant in magnitude and continuous in the equivalent circuit. The speed of rotating air gap flux is made free or adjustable. This means that the magnetic field in the air gap is kept constant in its amplitude and that its speed is adjustable so that a desired value of torque is produced. When the air gap flux is kept constant, other variables like voltages, current and torque are functions of slip frequency only. By accelerating or decelerating rotation of the air gap flux to choose the slip frequency, the torque can be controlled as desired.

==Electromagnetic transients==
To obtain very quick torque control response in induction motor, it is required to suppress electromagnetic transients which might be caused by the control. Then it is necessary to investigate the electromagnetic transients of an induction motor. Within the induction motor, the largest inductance is the exciting inductance of exciting reactance. Exciting current flows there. If it is accompanied by any transient, delay time constant will be very large. it is necessary to avoid transients of exciting current. It is therefore necessary to maintain continuity of amplitude and phase of exciting current.

==Types of control==
FAM control of induction motor torque has two types of control namely current control and voltage control. Constant exciting current produces good linearity’s between torque and slip frequency. In current control, the primary current is the control input to the induction motor whereas the primary terminal voltage is the control input in voltage control. Two transient phenomena are associated with induction motor operation. One is the mechanical transient of the dynamic system driven by induction motor and the other is the electromagnetic transient within the induction motor. In the first, speed and position of the motor shaft are state variables whereas in latter voltage, current, magnetic field are the state variables. Even though the two systems are interconnected but they can be treated separately. In numerical analysis of electromagnetic transients, it is assumed that the related dynamic state variables are constant and the instantaneous value of the motor torque is found and is fed into the analysis of transients in the dynamic system.

==Performance==
In FAM control, torque can be controlled by the vector of secondary current.FAM control provides the induction motor with very superior steady state performances based on its T equivalent three circuits which behave same when viewed from primary terminals but differ due to different phenomena occurring in the secondary side.

[[File:Concorde on Bristol.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] in its final flight. The extremely high fineness ratio of the fuselage is evident.]]
[[File:Questair Venture.jpg|thumb|right|[[Questair Venture]], with an egg-shaped, very-low-fineness-ratio fuselage]]

In [[naval architecture]] and [[aerospace engineering]], the '''fineness ratio''' is the ratio of the length of a body to its maximum width. Shapes that are short and wide have a low fineness ratio, those that are long and narrow have high fineness ratios. Aircraft that spend time at [[supersonic]] speeds, e.g. the [[Concorde]], generally have high fineness ratios.

At speeds below [[critical mach]], one of the primary forms of drag is [[skin friction]]. As the name implies, this is drag caused by the interaction of the airflow with the aircraft's skin.  To minimize this drag, the aircraft should be designed to minimize the exposed skin area, or "wetted surface". One solution to this problem is constructing an "egg shaped" fuselage, for example as used on the home-built [[Questair Venture]].

Theoretical ideal fineness ratios in subsonic aircraft are typically found at about 6:1, however this may be compromised by other design considerations such as seating or freight size requirements. Because a higher fineness fuselage can have reduced tail surfaces, this ideal ratio can practically be increased to 8:1.&lt;ref name="GBooksf"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=_FBLtC3qpr4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=fineness+ratio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=fineness%20ratio&amp;f=false|title = Airplane Design, Part 3|accessdate = 14 June 2016|last = Roskam|first = Jan|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most aircraft have fineness ratios significantly greater than this, however. This is often due to the competing need to place the tail control surfaces at the end of a longer [[moment arm]] to increase their effectiveness. Reducing the length of the fuselage would require larger controls, which would offset the drag savings from using the ideal fineness ratio. An example of a high-performance design with an imperfect fineness ratio is the [[Lancair]]. In other cases, the designer is forced to use a non-ideal design due to outside factors such as seating arrangements or cargo pallet sizes. Modern [[airliner]]s often have fineness ratios much higher than ideal, a side effect of their cylindrical cross-section which is selected for strength, as well as providing a single width to simplify seating layout.

As an aircraft approaches the [[speed of sound]], [[shock wave]]s form on areas of greater curvature. These shock waves radiate away energy that the engines must supply, energy that does not go into making the aircraft go faster. This appears to be a new form of drag—referred to as [[wave drag]]—which peaks at about three times the drag at speeds even slightly below the [[critical mach]]. In order to minimize the wave drag, the curvature of the aircraft should be kept to a minimum, which implies much higher fineness ratios. This is why high-speed aircraft have long pointed noses and tails, and cockpit canopies that are flush to the fuselage line.

More technically, the best possible performance for a supersonic design is typified by two "perfect shapes", the [[Sears-Haack body]] which is pointed at both ends, or the [[von Kármán ogive]], which has a blunt tail. Examples of the latter design include the [[Concorde]], [[F-104 Starfighter]] and [[XB-70 Valkyrie]], although to some degree practically every post-World War II [[interceptor aircraft]] featured such a design. Missile designers are even less interested in low-speed performance, and missiles generally have higher fineness ratios than most aircraft.

The introduction of aircraft with higher fineness ratios also introduced a new form of instability, [[inertial coupling]]. As the engines and cockpit moved away from the aircraft's [[center of mass]], the roll inertia of these masses grew to be able to overwhelm the power of the aerodynamic surfaces. A variety of methods are used to combat this effect, including oversized controls and [[stability augmentation system]]s.

A '''forest kindergarten''' is a type of [[preschool education]] for children between the ages of three and six that is held almost exclusively outdoors. Whatever the weather, children are encouraged to play, explore and learn in a forest or natural environment. The adult supervision is meant to assist rather than lead. It is also known as ''[[:de:Waldkindergarten|Waldkindergarten]]'' (in German), ''outdoor nursery'', ''nature kindergarten'', or ''nature preschool''. &lt;ref&gt;Alice Gregory, "Running Free in Germany’s Outdoor Preschools". The New York Times Style Magazine, May 18, 2017 [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/t-magazine/germany-forest-kindergarten-outdoor-preschool-waldkitas.html?_r=0] &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activities==
A forest kindergarten can be described as a [[kindergarten]] "without a ceiling or walls". The daycare staff and children spend their time outdoors, typically in a forest. A distinctive feature of forest kindergartens is the emphasis on play with toys that are fashioned out of objects that can be found in nature, rather than commercial toys. Despite these differences, forest kindergartens are meant to fulfill the same basic purpose as other nurseries, namely, to care for, stimulate, and educate young children.

Each forest kindergarten is different, partly because the organisations are independently minded. But typical activities and goals may include:&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secretgardencurriculum"&gt;{{citation|last=Bache|first=Cathy|title=Pre-school curriculum|publisher=Secret Garden Outdoor Nursery|year=2008|url=http://www.secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/pre%20school%20curriculum.doc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219101917/http://secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/pre%20school%20curriculum.doc|archivedate=2009-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and organization==
Forest kindergartens operate mainly in woodland, although some other sites can be equally inspiring, for example beaches and meadows. There should be a building where children can shelter from extreme weather. They may also spend a small part of each day indoors, although that is more likely to be for administrative and organisational reasons, such as to provide a known location where parents can deliver and collect their children. If the woodland is too far away to walk, a vehicle might reluctantly be used for transport.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Children are encouraged to dress for the weather, with waterproof clothes and warm layers, according to the climate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There are some [[forest schools]] that take children of various ages to woodland less frequently, and with a stronger focus on environmental topics themselves. For example, the "Woods for Learning" strategy&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcfc106.pdf/$FILE/fcfc106.pdf|title=Woods for Learning Education Strategy|publisher=Forestry Commission|year=2005|isbn=0-85538-684-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the British Forestry Commission proposes "regular" access, for example once a week for eight weeks.

==History==
In rural areas, and historical times, access to nature has not been a problem. Over the last century, with increasing urbanisation and "[[nature deficit disorder]]", there have been many changes in stance on [[outdoor education]]. 

The first forest Kindergarten was created by Ella Flautau in [[Denmark]] in the early 1950s. The idea formed gradually as a result of her often spending time with her own and neighbors' children in a nearby forest, a form of daycare which elicited great interest among the neighborhood parents. The parents formed a group and created an initiative to establish the first forest kindergarten. 

In [[Sweden]] in 1957, an ex-military man, Goesta Frohm, created the idea of "Skogsmulle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skogsmullestiftelsen.org/eng/index.htm Skogsmulle Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; "Skog" means wood in Swedish. "Mulle" is one of four fictional characters he created to teach children about nature, along with "Laxe" representing water, "Fjällfina" representing mountains and "Nova" representing an unpolluted nature. [[Forest schools]] based on Frohm's model, called "I Ur och Skur" (Rain or Shine Schools) moved the idea from occasional activities to formal nursery schools, being set up by Siw Linde in 1985. Juliet Robertson's review of Skogsmulle is a valuable modern-day summary.&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 1|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084834/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-2"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 2|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084915/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest kindergartens have existed in [[Germany]] since 1968 but were first officially recognized as a form of daycare in 1993, enabling state subsidies to reduce the daycare fees of children who attended Forest Kindergarten. Since then, the forest kindergartens have become increasingly popular. As of 2005 there were approximately 450 forest kindergartens in Germany, some of which offer a mix of forest kindergarten and traditional daycare, spending their mornings in the forest and afternoons inside. By late 2017, the number of forest kindergartens in Germany surpassed 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvnw.de/uber-uns/|title=ÜBER UNS {{!}} Bundesverband der Natur- und Waldkindergärten in Deutschland e.V.|website=bvnw.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain in 2005, a Swedish early years educator, Helena Nilsson, started Wildflowers Kindergarten, where preschool-aged children spend each morning in nature, throughout the year.

[[Childminder]] Cathy Bache opened the [[Secret Garden (outdoor nursery)|Secret Garden]] in Scotland in 2008 with support from funding authorities and private donors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/Early-Education-Child-Care/17970/11874 Childcare regulations] of the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taxfreevouchers"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childcare/ Tax Free Childcare Regulations], UK government HMRC&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2018 on all forest kindergartens are invited to celebrate the [[:de:Liste_von_Gedenk-_und_Aktionstagen#Mai|"International Day of Forest Kindergarten"]] every year on the 3rd of May.

==Effects==
The fact that most forest kindergartens do not provide commercial toys that have a predefined meaning or purpose supports the development of language skills, as children verbally create a common understanding of the objects used as toys in the context of their play. Forest kindergartens are also generally less noisy than closed rooms, and noise has been shown to be a factor in the [[stress (biological)|stress]] level of children and daycare professionals.

Merely keeping sight of natural features improves self-discipline in inner-city girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Taylor|first=A.F|last2=Kuo|last3=Sullivan|first3=W.C|year=2001|url=http://www.outdoorfoundation.org/pdf/ViewsOfNature.pdf|title=Views of Nature and Self Discipline: Evidence from Inner City Children|periodical=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=21|doi=10.1006/jevp.2001.0241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting a [[Forest schools|forest school]] regularly is desirable for schools&lt;ref name="robertson2009"&gt;Robertson J., Martin P., Borradaile L. and Alker S.

Playing outside for prolonged periods has been shown to have a positive impact on children's development, particularly in the areas of balance and agility, but also [[manual dexterity]], physical [[motor coordination|coordination]], [[Touch|tactile]] sensitivity, and [[depth perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/Colleges/ArchitecturePlanning/discover/centers/CYE/Publications/Documents/Benefitsofnature-FactSheet1-April2007.pdf |title=Benefits of Nature for Children’s Health |date=April 2007 |publisher=[[Children Youth and Environments Center]] for Research and Design, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731075831/http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/Colleges/ArchitecturePlanning/discover/centers/CYE/Publications/Documents/Benefitsofnature-FactSheet1-April2007.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Grahn|first=P |last2=Martensson|first2=F | last3=Lindblad|first3=B | last4=Nilsson|first4=P | last5=Ekman|first5=A |year=1997 | chapter=Ute på dagis|title=Stad and Land| volume=145| place=Håssleholm, Sweden| publisher=Nora Skåne Offset}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these studies, children who attend forest kindergartens experience fewer injuries due to accidents and are less likely to injure themselves in a fall. A child's ability to [[Risk assessment|assess risks]] improves,&lt;ref name="underpressure"&gt;{{Citation|title=Under Pressure: Rescuing Our Children From The Culture Of Hyper-Parenting|first=Carl|last=Honoré|publisher=Orion|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7528-7531-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example in handling fire and dangerous tools. Other studies have shown that spending time in nature improves attention and medical [[prognosis]] in women&lt;ref&gt;Cimprich B. (2007).

Playing outdoors is said to strengthen the [[immune systems]] of children and daycare professionals.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

When children from German ''[[:de:Waldkindergarten|Waldkindergarten]]s'' go to primary school, teachers observe a significant improvement in reading, writing, mathematics, social interactions and many other areas.&lt;ref name="gorges"&gt;Gorges R. [http://bvnw.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Prof_Gorges_Schulfhigkeit.pdf] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Boys may be less intellectually able than girls at typical school tasks such as reading and mathematics, so forest kindergartens have been recommended in the early years.&lt;ref&gt;Sax L.

Roland Gorges found&lt;ref name="gorges"/&gt; that children who had been to a forest kindergarten were above average, compared by teachers to those who had not, in all areas of skill tested. In order of advantage, these were:

'''Freshwater environmental quality parameters'''  are the natural and man-made [[chemical]], [[biology|biological]] and [[microbiology|microbiological]] characteristics of [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[ground-water]]s, the ways they are measured and the ways that they change. The values or concentrations attributed to such [[Parameter#Environmental science|parameters]] can be used to describe the pollution status of an environment, its biotic status or to predict the likelihood or otherwise of a particular organisms  being present. Monitoring of environmental quality parameters is a key activity in managing the environment, restoring polluted environments and anticipating the effects of man-made changes on the environment.

'''Freshwater environmental quality parameters''' are those  chemical, physical or biological parameters that can be used to characterise a freshwater body. Because almost all water bodies are dynamic in their composition, the relevant quality parameters are typically expressed as a range of expected concentrations.

==Characterisation==
{{see also|water chemistry analysis}}
The first step in understanding the chemistry of freshwater is to establish the relevant concentrations of the parameters of interest. Conventionally this is done by taking representative samples of the water for subsequent analysis in a laboratory . However, in-situ monitoring using hand-held analytical equipment or using bank-side monitoring stations are also used.

===Sampling===
Freshwaters are surprisingly difficult to sample because they are rarely [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] and their quality varies during the day and during the year. In addition the most representative sampling locations are often at a distance from the shore or bank increasing the logistic complexity.

====Rivers====
Filling a clean bottle with river water is a very simple task, but a single sample is only representative of that point along the river the sample was taken from and at that point in time. Understanding the chemistry of a whole river, or even a significant tributary, requires prior investigation to understand how homogeneous or mixed the flow is and to determine if the quality changes during the course of a day and during the course of a year. Almost all natural rivers will have very significant patterns of change through the day and through the seasons. [[Water remote sensing]] offers a spatially continuous tool to improve understanding of spatial and temporal river water quality. Many rivers also have a very large flow that is unseen. This flows through underlying gravel and sand layers and is called [[hyporheic zone|hyporheic flow]]. How much mixing there is between the hyporheic zone and the water in the open channel will depend on a variety of factors, some of which relate to flows leaving [[aquifers]] which may have been storing water for many years.

===Ground-waters===
Ground waters by their very nature  are often very difficult to access to take a sample. As a consequence the majority of ground-water data comes from samples taken from [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, [[water well|well]]s, water supply bore-holes and in natural [[cave]]s. In recent decades as the need to understand ground water dynamics has increased, an increasing number or monitoring bore-holes have been drilled into aquifers

===Lakes===

''see also [[Limnology]]''

Lakes  and ponds can be very large  and support a complex  eco-system in which environmental parameters vary widely in all three physical dimensions and with time. Large lakes in the temperate zone often stratify in the warmer months into a warmer upper layers rich in oxygen and a colder lower layer with low oxygen levels. In the autumn, falling temperatures and  occasional high winds result in the mixing of the two layers into a more homogeneous whole. When stratification occurs it not only affects oxygen levels but also many related parameters such as [[iron]], [[phosphate]] and [[manganese]] which are all changed in their chemical form by change in the [[redox]] potential of the environment.

Lakes also receive waters, often from many different sources with varying qualities. Solids from stream inputs will typically settle near the mouth of the stream and depending on a variety of factors the incoming water may float over the surface of the lake, sink beneath the surface or rapidly mix with the lake water. All of these phenomena can  skew the results of any environmental monitoring unless the process are well understood.

==Mixing zones==
Where two rivers meet at a confluence there exists a mixing zone. A mixing zone may be very large and extend for many miles as in the case of the [[Mississippi]] and [[Missouri]] rivers in the [[United States]] and the [[River Clwyd]] and [[River Elwy]] in [[North Wales]]. In a mixing zone water chemistry may be very variable and can be difficult to predict. The chemical interactions are not just simple mixing but may be complicated by biological processes from submerged [[macrophyte]]s and by water joining the channel from the [[hyporheic]] zone or from springs draining an aquifer.

==Geological inputs==
The geology that underlies a river or lake has a major impact on its chemistry. A river flowing across very ancient [[precambrian]] [[schists]] is likely to have dissolved very little from the rocks and maybe similar to de-ionised water at least in the headwaters. Conversely a river flowing through [[chalk]] hills, and especially if its source is in the chalk, will have a high concentration of [[carbonate]]s and [[bicarbonate]]s of [[Calcium]] and possibly [[Magnesium]].

As a river progresses along its course it may pass through a variety of geological types and it may have inputs from aquifers that do not appear on the surface anywhere in the locality.

==Atmospheric inputs==
Oxygen is probably the most important chemical constituent of surface water chemistry, as all [[aerobic organism]]s require it for survival.  It enters the water mostly via diffusion at the water-air interface.  Oxygen’s solubility in water decreases as water temperature increases. Fast, turbulent streams expose more of the water’s surface area to the air and tend to have low temperatures and thus more oxygen than slow, backwaters.  Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis, so systems with a high abundance of aquatic algae and plants may also have high concentrations of oxygen during the day.  These levels can decrease significantly during the night when primary producers switch to respiration.  Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring such as following Autumn leaf-fall.

Most other atmospheric inputs come from man-made or [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sources the most significant of which are the oxides of sulphur produced by burning sulphur rich fuels such as [[coal]] and [[oil]] which give rise to [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;Likens, G. E., W. C. Keene, J. M. Miller and J. N. Galloway.  1987.  Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia.  J. Geophys. Res. 92(D11):13,299-13,314.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemistry of sulphur oxides is complex both in the [[atmosphere]] and in river systems. However the effect on the overall chemistry is simple in that it reduces the pH of the water making it more acidic. The pH change is most marked in rivers with very low concentrations of dissolved salts as these cannot [[Buffer solution|buffer]] the effects of the acid input. Rivers downstream of major industrial conurbations are also at greatest risk. In parts of [[Scandinavia]] and [[West Wales]] and [[Scotland]] many rivers became so acidic from oxides of sulphur that most fish life was destroyed and pHs as low as pH4 were recorded  during critical weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Air pollution, acid rain, and the environment. Kenneth Mellanby, Watt Committee on Energy, Springer, 1988 {{ISBN|1-85166-222-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85166-222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropogenic inputs==
The majority of rivers on the planet and many lakes have received or are receiving inputs from human-kind's activities. In the industrialised world, many rivers have been very seriously polluted, at least during the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. Although in general there has been much improvement in the developed world, there is still a great deal of river pollution apparent on the planet.

==Toxicity==
In most environmental situations the presence or absence of an organism is determined by a complex web of interactions only some of which will be related to measurable chemical or biological parameters. Flow rate, turbulence, inter and intra specific competition, feeding behaviour, [[disease]], [[parasite|parasatism]], [[commensalism]] and [[symbiosis]] are just a few of the pressures and opportunities facing any organism or population. Most chemical constituents favour some organisms and are less favourable to others. However, there are some cases where a chemical constituent exerts a toxic effect. i.e. where the concentration can kill or severely inhibit the normal functioning of the organism. Where a toxic effect has been demonstrated this may be noted in the sections below dealing with the individual parameters.

==Chemical constituents==

===Colour and turbidity===
Often it is the colour of freshwater or how clear or hazy the water is that is the most obvious visual characteristic. Unfortunately neither colour nor turbidity are strong indicators of the overall chemical composition of water. However both colour and turbidity reduce the amount of light penetrating the water and can have significant impact on algae and macrophytes. Some algae in particular are highly dependent on water with low colour and turbidity

Many rivers draining high moor-lands overlain by [[peat]] have a very deep yellow brown colour caused by dissolved [[humic acid]]s.

===Organic constituents===

One of the principal sources of elevated concentrations of organic chemical constituents is from treated sewage.
{{main|Sewage treatment}}

Dissolved organic material is most commonly measured using either the [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) test or the [[Chemical oxygen demand]] (COD) test. Organic constituents are significant in river chemistry for the effect that they have on dissolved oxygen concentration and for the impact that individual organic species may have directly on aquatic biota.

Any organic and degradable material consumes oxygen as it decomposes. Where organic concentrations are significantly elevated the effects on oxygen concentrations can be significant and as conditions get extreme the river bed may become [[anoxic waters|anoxic]].

Some organic constituents such as synthetic [[hormone]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[phthalate]]s have direct metabolic effects on aquatic biota and even on humans drinking water taken from the river. Understanding such constituents and how they can be identified and quantified is becoming of increasing importance in the understanding of freshwater chemistry.

===Metals===
A wide range of metals may be found in rivers from natural sources where metal ores are present in the rocks over which the river flows or in the aquifers feeding water into the river. However many rivers have an increased load of metals because of industrial activities which include mining and quarrying and the processing and use of metals.

====Iron====
Iron, usually as Fe&lt;sup&gt;+++&lt;/sup&gt; is a common constituent of river waters at very low levels. Higher iron concentrations in acidic springs or an anoxic hyporheic zone may cause visible orange/brown staining or semi-gelatinous precipitates of dense orange [[iron bacteria]]l [[Flocculation|floc]] carpeting the river bed. Such conditions are very deleterious to most organisms and can cause serious damage in a river system.

Coal mining is also a very significant source of  Iron both in mine-waters and from stocking yards of coal and from coal processing. Long abandoned mines can be a highly intractable source of high concentrations of Iron.
Low levels of iron are common in spring waters emanating from deep-seated aquifers and maybe regarding as health giving springs. Such springs are commonly called [[Chalybeate]] springs and have given rise to a number of [[Spa]] towns in Europe and the United States.

====Zinc====
[[Zinc]] is normally associated with metal mining, especially Lead and Silver mining but is also a component pollutant associated with a variety of other metal mining activities and with [[Coal mining]]. Zinc is toxic at relatively low concentrations to many aquatic organisms. ''Microregma'' starts to show a toxic reaction at concentrations as low as 0.33&amp;nbsp;mg/l &lt;ref&gt;Bringmann G. and Kuhn R., 1959, The toxic effects of waste water on aquatic bacteria, algae and small crustaceans, Gesund Ing 80, 115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heavy metals====
Lead and silver in river waters are commonly found together and associated with  lead mining. Impacts from very old mines can be very long-lived. In the [[River Ystwyth]] in [[Wales]] for example, the effects of silver and lead mining in the 17th and 18th centuries in the headwaters still causes unacceptably high levels of Zinc and [[Lead]] in the river water right down to its confluence with the sea. 
[[Silver]] is very toxic even at very low concentrations but leaves no visible evidence of its contamination.

Lead is also highly toxic to freshwater organisms and to humans if the water is used as drinking water. As with Silver, Lead pollution is not visible to the naked eye. The [[River Rheidol]] in west Wales had a major series of lead mines in its headwaters until the end of the 19th century and its mine discharges and waste tips remain to this day. In 1919 - 1921  only 14 species of invertebrates were found in the lower Rheidol when Lead concentrations were between 0.2ppm and 0.5ppm. By 1932 the lead concentration had reduced to 0.02ppm to 0.1ppm because of the abandonment of mining and, at those concentrations, the bottom fauna had stabilized to 103 species including three [[leech]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, R.D. and Jones, J.R.E., 1938, The faunistic recovery of a lead polluted river in north Cardiganshire, Wales, J. Anim. Ecol, 7, 272 -286&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal mining is also a very significant source of metals, especially Iron, Zinc and [[Nickel]] particularly where the coal is rich if [[pyrites]] which oxidises on contact with the air producing a very acidic [[leachate]] which is able to dissolve metals from the coal.

Significant levels of copper are unusual in rivers and where it does it occur the source is most likely to be mining activities, coal stocking, or [[pig]] farming. Rarely elevated levels may be of geological origin. Copper is acutely toxic to many freshwater organisms, especially algae, at very low concentrations and significant concentration in river water may have serious adverse effects on the local ecology.

===Nitrogen===
Nitrogenous compounds have a variety of sources including washout of oxides of nitrogen from the atmosphere, some geological inputs and some from macrophyte and [[algae|algal]] [[nitrogen fixation]]. However, for many rivers in the proximity of humans, the largest input is from sewage whether treated or untreated. The nitrogen derives from breakdown products of [[protein]]s found in [[urine]] and [[faeces]]. These products, being very soluble, often pass through sewage treatment process and are discharged into rivers as a component of [[sewage treatment]] effluent. Nitrogen may be in the form of [[nitrate]], [[nitrite]], [[ammonia]] or ammonium salts or what is termed albuminoid nitrogen or nitrogen still within an organic proteinoid molecule.

The differing forms of nitrogen are relatively stable in most river systems with nitrite slowly transforming into nitrate in well oxygenated rivers and ammonia transforming into nitrite/ nitrate. However, the process are slow in cool rivers and reduction in concentration may more often be attributed to simple dilution. All forms of nitrogen are taken up by macrophytes and algae and elevated levels of nitrogen are often associated with overgrowths of plants or [[eutrophication]]. These can have the effect of blocking channels and inhibiting [[navigation]]. However, ecologically, the more significant effect is on dissolved oxygen concentrations which may become super-saturated during daylight due to plant [[photosynthesis]] but then drop to very low levels during darkness as plant respiration uses up the dissolved oxygen. Coupled with the release of oxygen in photosynthesis is the creation of bi-carbonate ions which cause a steep rise in pH and this is matched in darkness as [[carbon dioxide]] is released through respiration which substantially lowers the pH. Thus high levels of nitrogenous compounds tends to lead to eutrophication with extreme variations in parameters which in turn can substantially degrade the ecological worth of the watercourse.

Ammonium ions also have a toxic effect, especially on [[fish]]. The toxicity of ammonia is dependent on both pH and temperature  and an added complexity is the buffering effect of the blood/water interface across the [[gill]] [[Biological membrane|membrane]] which masks any additional toxicity over about pH 8.0. The management of river chemistry to avoid ecological damage is particularly difficult in the case of ammonia as a wide range of potential scenarios of concentration, pH and temperature have to be considered and the diurnal pH fluctuation caused by photosynthesis considered. On warm summer days with high-bi-carbonate concentrations unexpectedly toxic conditions can be created.

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus]] compounds are usually found as relatively insoluble phosphates in river water and, except in some exceptional circumstances, their origin is [[agriculture]] or human sewage. Phosphorus can encourage excessive growths of plants and algae and contribute to [[eutrophication]]. If a river discharges into a lake or reservoir phosphate can be mobilised year after year by natural processes. In the summer time, lakes stratify so that warm oxygen rich water floats on top of cold oxygen poor water. In the warm upper layers - the [[epilimnion]]- plants consume the available phosphate. As the plants die in the late summer they fall into the cool water layers underneath - the [[hypolimnion]] - and decompose. During winter turn-over, when a lake becomes fully mixed through the action of winds on a cooling body of water - the phosphates are spread throughout the lake again to feed a new generation of plants. This process is one of the principal causes of persistent [[algal bloom]]s at some lakes.

===Arsenic===
Geological deposits of arsenic may be released into rivers where deep ground-waters are exploited as in parts of [[Pakistan]]. Many metalloid ores such as lead, gold and [[copper]] contain traces of arsenic and poorly stored tailings may result in arsenic entering the [[hydrological cycle]].

===Solids===
Inert solids are produced in all montane rivers as the energy of the water helps grind away rocks into gravel, sand and finer material. Much of this settles very quickly and provides an important substrate for many aquatic organisms. Many [[salmon]]id fish require beds of gravel and sand in which to lay their eggs.
Many other types of solids from agriculture, mining, quarrying, urban run-off and sewage may block-out sunlight from the river and may block interstices in gravel beds making them useless for spawning and supporting insect life.

===Bacterial, viral and parasite inputs===
Both agriculture and sewage treatment produce  inputs into rivers with very high concentrations of [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[virus]]es including a wide range of [[pathogen]]ic organisms. Even in areas with little human activity significant levels of bacteria and viruses can be detected originating from fish and aquatic mammals and from animals grazing near rivers such as [[deer]].
Upland waters draining areas frequented by [[sheep]], [[goats]] or deer may also harbour a variety of opportunistic human parasites such as [[liver fluke]]. Consequently, there are very few rivers from which the water is safe to drink without some form of sterilisation or disinfection. In rivers used for contact recreation such as swimming, safe levels of bacteria and viruses can be established based on risk assessment.

Under certain conditions bacteria can colonise freshwaters occasionally making large rafts of filamentous mats known as ''sewage fungus'' – usually ''[[Sphaerotilus natans]]''. The presence of such organisms is almost always an indicator of extreme [[Organic compound|organic pollution]] and would be expected to be matched with low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high BOD vales.

[[E. coli]] bacteria have been commonly found in recreational waters and their presence is used to indicate the presence of recent faecal contamination, but E. coli presence may not be indicative of human waste. '' E. coli'' are found in all warm-blooded animals.  ''E. coli''  have also been found in  fish and turtles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rhicks/lab/Hansen%20et%20al%202008%20JGLR%2034.pdf|title=Sources and Sinks of ''Escherichia coli'' in Benthic and Pelagic Fish|publisher=Internat.

Hicks|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enterobacteria]] may also persist in the environment in mud, sediments, sand and soil for considerable lengths of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rhicks/lab/Ksoll%20et%20al%202007%20AEM%2073.pdf|title=Presence and Sources of Faecal Coliform Bacteria in Epilithic Periphyton Communities of Lake Superior|publisher= American Society for Microbiology|date=2007|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pH===
pH in rivers is affected by the geology of the water source, atmospheric inputs and a range of other chemical contaminants. pH is only likely to become an issue on very poorly buffered upland rivers where atmospheric sulphur and nitrogen oxides may very significantly depress the pH as low as pH4 or in eutrophic alkaline rivers where photosynthetic bi-carbonate ion production in photosynthesis may drive the pH up above pH10

'''George Edward Moore''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|FBA}} (4 November 1873 – 24 October 1958) was an English philosopher. He was, with [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and (before them) [[Gottlob Frege]], one of the founders of the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition in philosophy. Along with Russell, he led the turn away from [[idealism]] in British philosophy, and became well known for his advocacy of [[common sense]] concepts, his contributions to [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]], and "his exceptional personality and moral character".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/moore/ "Moore, George Edward"]. Preston, Aaron. Internet Encyclopedia. Iep.utm.edu. 30 December 2005. Retrieved 13 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Cambridge]], highly influential among (though not a member of) the [[Bloomsbury Group]], and the editor of the influential journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. He was elected a fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1918. He was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], the intellectual secret society, from 1894 to 1901, and the Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club.

==Life==
Moore was born in [[Upper Norwood]], Croydon, Greater London, on 4 November 1873, the middle child of seven of Dr Daniel Moore and Henrietta Sturge.  His grandfather was the author [[George Moore (physician)|Dr George Moore]].  His eldest brother was [[Thomas Sturge Moore]], a poet, writer and engraver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Levy (journalist)|title=Moore: G.E.

He was educated at [[Dulwich College]]&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 87-88, (Heinemann: London)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1892 went up to [[Trinity College,  Cambridge]] to study [[classics]] and [[moral sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MR892GE|name=Moore, George Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He became a Fellow of Trinity in 1898, and went on to hold the [[University of Cambridge]] chair of Mental Philosophy and Logic, from 1925 to 1939.

Moore is best known today for his defence of [[ethical non-naturalism]], his emphasis on [[common sense]] in philosophical method, and the [[Moore's paradox|paradox that bears his name]]. He was admired by and influential among other philosophers, and also by the [[Bloomsbury Group]], but is (unlike his colleague Russell) mostly unknown today outside of academic philosophy.  Moore's essays are known for their clear, circumspect writing style, and for his methodical and patient approach to philosophical problems. He was critical of modern philosophy for its lack of [[Philosophical progress|progress]], which he believed was in stark contrast to the dramatic advances in the [[natural sciences]] since the [[Renaissance]]. Among Moore's most famous works are his book ''[[Principia Ethica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore |first1=G. E.|title=Principia Ethica|date=1903|publisher=University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0879754982|url=http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his essays, "The Refutation of Idealism", "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", and "A Proof of the External World".

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1918-19.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/about/the-council/ The Aristotelian Society – The Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]] wrote in ''Moore: G. E. Moore and the Cambridge Apostles'' (1979) that Moore was an important member of the secretive [[Cambridge Apostles]].

G. E. Moore died on 24 October 1958; he was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium on 28 October 1958 and his ashes interred at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in [[Cambridge]]; his wife, Dorothy Ely (1892-1977) was buried there. Together they had two sons, the poet [[Nicholas Moore]] and the composer Timothy Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yau|first1=John|authorlink1=John Yau|title=Nicholas Moore, Touched by Poetic Genius|url=http://hyperallergic.com/173897/nicholas-moore-touched-by-poetic-genius/|website=[[Hyperallergic]]|accessdate=29 October 2015|date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Nicholas | last = Marshall | title = Timothy Moore | date = 10 March 2003 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/10/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1 | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Ethics===
[[Image:Principia Ethica title page.png|thumb|right|200px|The title page of ''Principia Ethica'']]
His influential work ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' is one of the main inspirations of the movement against [[ethical naturalism]] (see [[ethical non-naturalism]]) and is partly responsible for the twentieth-century concern with [[meta-ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=metaethics |title=Metaethics}} by Geoff Sayre-McCord.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The naturalistic fallacy====
{{Main|Naturalistic fallacy}}

Moore asserted that philosophical arguments can suffer from a confusion between the use of a term in a particular argument and the definition of that term (in all arguments). He named this confusion the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. For example, an ethical argument may claim that if a thing has certain properties, then that thing is 'good.' A [[hedonism|hedonist]] may argue that 'pleasant' things are 'good' things. Other theorists may argue that 'complex' things are 'good' things. Moore contends that even if such arguments are correct, they do not provide definitions for the term 'good.' The property of 'goodness' cannot be defined. It can only be shown and grasped. Any attempt to define it (X is good if it has property Y) will simply shift the problem (Why is Y-ness good in the first place?).

====Open-question argument====
{{Main|Open-question argument}}
Moore's [[argument]] for the indefinability of "good" (and thus for the fallaciousness of the "naturalistic fallacy") is often called the [[open-question argument]]; it is presented in [http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.13 §13 of ''Principia Ethica'']. The argument hinges on the nature of statements such as "Anything that is pleasant is also good" and the possibility of asking questions such as "Is it ''good'' that x is pleasant?" According to Moore, these questions are ''open'' and these statements are ''significant''; and they will remain so no matter what is substituted for "pleasure". Moore concludes from this that any analysis of value is bound to fail. In other words, if value could be analysed, then such questions and statements would be trivial and obvious. Since they are anything but trivial and obvious, value must be indefinable.

Critics of Moore's arguments sometimes claim that he is appealing to general puzzles concerning analysis (cf. the [[paradox of analysis]]), rather than revealing anything special about value. The argument clearly depends on the assumption that if "good" were definable, it would be an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]] about "good," an assumption many contemporary moral realists like [[Richard Boyd]] and [[Peter Railton]] reject.  Other responses appeal to the [[Frege]]an distinction between [[sense and reference]], allowing that value concepts are special and ''sui generis'', but insisting that value properties are nothing but natural properties (this strategy is similar to that taken by [[physicalism|non-reductive materialists]] in [[philosophy of mind]]).

====Good as indefinable====
Moore contended that goodness cannot be analysed in terms of any other property. In ''[http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica Principia Ethica], ''he writes:

: It may be true that all things which are good are also something else, just as it is true that all things which are yellow produce a certain kind of vibration in the light. And it is a fact, that Ethics aims at discovering what are those other properties belonging to all things which are good. But far too many philosophers have thought that when they named those other properties they were actually defining good; that these properties, in fact, were simply not "other," but absolutely and entirely the same with goodness. ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.10#s10p3 § 10 ¶ 3])

Therefore, we cannot define "good" by explaining it in other words. We can only point to an ''action'' or a ''thing'' and say "That is good." Similarly, we cannot describe to a person born totally blind exactly what yellow is. We can only show a sighted person a piece of yellow paper or a yellow scrap of cloth and say "That is yellow."

====Good as a non-natural property====
In addition to categorising "good" as indefinable, Moore also emphasized that it is a non-natural property. This means that it cannot be empirically or scientifically tested or verified - it is not within the bounds of "natural science".

====Moral knowledge====
Moore argued that once arguments based on the [[naturalistic fallacy]] had been discarded, questions of intrinsic goodness could only be settled by appeal to what he (following [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]]) called "moral intuitions:" [[self-evidence|self-evident]] propositions which recommend themselves to moral reflection, but which are not susceptible to either direct proof or disproof ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.45 PE § 45]). As a result of his view, he has often been described by later writers as an advocate of [[ethical intuitionism]]. Moore, however, wished to distinguish his view from the views usually described as "Intuitionist" when ''Principia Ethica'' was written:

{{quotation|In order to express the fact that ethical propositions of my ''first'' class [propositions about what is good as an end in itself] are incapable of proof or disproof, I have sometimes followed Sidgwick's usage in calling them 'Intuitions.' But I beg that it may be noticed that I am not an 'Intuitionist,’ in the ordinary sense of the term. Sidgwick himself seems never to have been clearly aware of the immense importance of the difference which distinguishes his Intuitionism from the common doctrine, which has generally been called by that name. The Intuitionist proper is distinguished by maintaining that propositions of my ''second'' class—propositions which assert that a certain action is ''right'' or a ''duty''—are incapable of proof or disproof by any enquiry into the results of such actions. I, on the contrary, am no less anxious to maintain that propositions of ''this'' kind are ''not'' 'Intuitions,’ than to maintain that propositions of my ''first'' class ''are'' Intuitions.|G. E. Moore|[http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/preface#s0p5 ''Principia Ethica'', Preface ¶ 5]}}

Moore distinguished his view from the view of [[deontological ethics|deontological]] intuitionists, who held that "intuitions" could determine questions about what ''actions'' are right or required by [[duty]]. Moore, as a [[consequentialist]], argued that "duties" and moral rules could be determined by investigating the ''effects'' of particular actions or kinds of actions ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.89 PE § 89]), and so were matters for empirical investigation rather than direct objects of intuition ([http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.90 PE § 90]). On Moore's view, "intuitions" revealed not the rightness or wrongness of specific actions, but only what things were good in themselves, as ''ends to be pursued''.

===Proof of an external world===
{{Main|Here is one hand}}
One of the most important parts of Moore's philosophical development was his break from the [[idealism]] that dominated British philosophy (as represented in the works of his former teachers [[F. H. Bradley]] and [[J. M. E. McTaggart|John McTaggart]]), and his defence of what he regarded as a "common sense" form of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. In his 1925 essay "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", he argued against idealism and [[scepticism]] toward the external world, on the grounds that they could not give reasons to accept that their metaphysical premises were more plausible than the reasons we have to accept the common sense claims about our knowledge of the world, which sceptics and idealists must deny. He famously put the point into dramatic relief with his 1939 essay "Proof of an External World", in which he gave a common sense argument against scepticism by raising his right hand and saying "Here is one hand," and then raising his left and saying "And here is another," then concluding that there are at least two external objects in the world, and therefore that he knows (by this argument) that an external world exists. Not surprisingly, not everyone inclined to sceptical doubts found Moore's method of argument entirely convincing; Moore, however, defends his argument on the grounds that sceptical arguments seem invariably to require an appeal to "philosophical intuitions" that we have considerably less reason to accept than we have for the common sense claims that they supposedly refute. (In addition to fueling Moore's own work, the "Here is one hand" argument also deeply influenced [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], who spent his last years working out a new approach to Moore's argument in the remarks that were published posthumously as ''[[On Certainty]]''.)

===Moore's paradox===
Moore is also remembered for drawing attention to the peculiar inconsistency involved in uttering a sentence such as "It is raining but I do not believe it is raining."—a puzzle which is now commonly called "[[Moore's paradox]]". The puzzle arises because it seems impossible for anyone to consistently ''assert'' such a sentence; but there doesn't seem to be any ''logical contradiction'' between "It is raining" and "I don't believe that it is raining." because the former is a statement about the weather and the latter a statement about a person's belief about the weather, and it is perfectly logically possible that it may rain whilst a person does not believe that it is raining.

In addition to Moore's own work on the paradox, the puzzle also inspired a great deal of work by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who described the paradox as the most impressive philosophical insight that Moore had ever introduced. It is said that when Wittgenstein first heard this paradox one evening (which Moore had earlier stated in a lecture), he rushed round to Moore's lodgings, got him out of bed and insisted that Moore repeat the entire lecture to him.

===Organic wholes===
Moore’s description of the principle of [[organic unity]] is extremely straightforward; nonetheless, and a variant on a pattern that began with Aristotle:

: The value of a whole must not be assumed to be the same as the sum of the values of its parts (Principia, [http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.18 § 18]).

According to Moore, a moral actor cannot survey the "goodness" inherent in the various parts of a situation, assign a value to each of them, and then generate a sum in order to get an idea of its total value. A moral scenario is a complex assembly of parts, and its total value is often created by the relations between those parts, and not by their individual value. The organic metaphor is thus very appropriate: biological organisms seem to have emergent properties which cannot be found anywhere in their individual parts. For example, a human brain seems to exhibit a capacity for thought when none of its neurons exhibit any such capacity. In the same way, a moral scenario can have a value far greater than the sum of its component parts.

To understand the application of the organic principle to questions of value, it is perhaps best to consider Moore’s primary example, that of a consciousness experiencing a beautiful object. To see how the principle works, a thinker engages in "reflective isolation", the act of isolating a given concept in a kind of null-context and determining its intrinsic value. In our example, we can easily see that per ''sui'', beautiful objects and consciousnesses are not particularly valuable things. They might have some value, but when we consider the total value of a consciousness experiencing a beautiful object, it seems to exceed the simple sum of these values (Principia 18:2).

'''Gravitational-wave astronomy''' is an emerging branch of [[observational astronomy]] which aims to use [[gravitational wave]]s (minute distortions of [[spacetime]] predicted by [[Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]]) to collect observational data about objects such as [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s, events such as [[supernova]]e, and processes including those of the  [[early universe]] shortly after the [[Big Bang]].

Gravitational waves have a solid theoretical basis, founded upon the theory of relativity. They were first predicted by Einstein in 1916; although a specific consequence of general relativity, they are a common feature of all theories of gravity that obey [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Bernard F.|title=Gravitational waves on the back of an envelope|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=52|issue=5|pages=412|doi=10.1119/1.13627|bibcode = 1984AmJPh..52..412S |date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, after 1916 there was a long debate whether the waves were actually physical, or artefacts of coordinate freedom in general relativity; this was not fully resolved until the 1950s.  Indirect observational evidence for their existence first came in the late 1980s, from monitoring of the [[PSR B1913+16|Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar]] (discovered 1974); the pulsar orbit was found to evolve exactly as would be expected for gravitational wave emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hulse|first=R.

Ordinary gravitational waves frequencies are very low and much harder to detect, while higher frequencies occur in more dramatic events and thus have become the first to be observed.

In addition to a merger of black holes, a binary [[neutron star merger]] has been directly detected: a [[gamma-ray burst]] (GRB) was detected by the orbiting [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope#GRB 170817A signals a multi-messenger transient|Fermi gamma-ray burst monitor]] on 2017 August 17 12:41:06 UTC, triggering an automated notice worldwide. Six minutes later a single detector at Hanford LIGO, a [[gravitational-wave observatory]], registered a gravitational-wave candidate occurring 2 seconds before the gamma-ray burst. This set of observations is consistent with a binary [[neutron star]] merger,&lt;ref name=iop2017oct16&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa91c9/meta#apjlaa91c9s2 ''Astrophysical Journal Letters'' (2017 October 16), Multi-messenger Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger]&lt;/ref&gt; as evidenced by a multi-messenger transient event which was signalled by gravitational-wave,  and electromagnetic (gamma-ray burst, optical, and infrared)-spectrum sightings.

There are several current scientific collaborations for observing gravitational waves. There is a worldwide network of ground-based detectors, these are kilometre-scale [[Michelson interferometer|laser interferometers]] including: the [[LIGO|Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]] (LIGO), a joint project between [[MIT]], [[Caltech]] and the scientists of the [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]] with detectors in [[Livingston, Louisiana]] and [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]]; [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]], at the [[European Gravitational Observatory]], [[Cascina]], Italy; [[GEO600]] in [[Sarstedt]], Germany, and the [[KAGRA|Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector]] (KAGRA), operated by the [[University of Tokyo]] in the [[Kamioka Observatory]], Japan. LIGO and Virgo are currently being upgraded to their advanced configurations. Advanced LIGO began observations in 2015, detecting gravitational waves even though not having reached its design sensitivity yet; Advanced Virgo is expected to start observing in 2016. The more advanced KAGRA is scheduled for 2018. GEO600 is currently operational, but its sensitivity makes it unlikely to make an observation; its primary purpose is to trial technology.

=== Low frequency ===
An alternative means of observation is using [[pulsar timing array]]s (PTAs). There are three consortia, the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]] (EPTA), the [[North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves]] (NANOGrav), and the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] (PPTA), which co-operate as the [[International Pulsar Timing Array]]. These use existing radio telescopes, but since they are sensitive to frequencies in the nanohertz range, many years of observation are needed to detect a signal and detector sensitivity improves gradually. Current bounds are approaching those expected for astrophysical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sesana|first=A.|title=Systematic investigation of the expected gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries in the pulsar timing band|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters|date=22 May 2013|volume=433|issue=1|pages=L1–L5|doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slt034|arxiv = 1211.5375 |bibcode = 2013MNRAS.433L...1S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate frequencies===
Further in the future, there is the possibility of space-borne detectors. The [[European Space Agency]] has selected a gravitational-wave mission for its L3 mission, due to launch 2034, the current concept is the [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (eLISA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = ESA's new vision to study the invisible universe| publisher = ESA | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ESA_s_new_vision_to_study_the_invisible_Universe |accessdate = 29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in development is the Japanese [[Deci-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory]] (DECIGO).

==Scientific value==
[[Astronomy]] has traditionally relied on [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Originating with the visible band, as technology advanced, it became possible to observe other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], from [[Radio astronomy|radio]] to [[Gamma-ray astronomy|gamma rays]].

[[Russell Alan Hulse|Russell Hulse]] and [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.|Joseph Taylor]] were awarded the 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for showing that the orbital decay of a pair of neutron stars, one of them a pulsar, fits general relativity's predictions of gravitational radiation.&lt;ref name=npp1993&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1993 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/index.html|DUPLICATE_accessdate=|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, many other binary pulsars (including one [[PSR J0737-3039|double pulsar system]]) have been observed, all fitting gravitational-wave predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stairs|first=Ingrid H.|title=Testing General Relativity with Pulsar Timing|journal=Living Reviews in Relativity|volume=6|pages=5|doi=10.12942/lrr-2003-5|arxiv = astro-ph/0307536 |bibcode = 2003LRR.....6....5S |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to [[Rainer Weiss]], [[Kip Thorne]] and [[Barry Barish]] for their role in the first detection of gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="BBC-20171003"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rincon |first1=Paul |last2=Amos |first2=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41476648|title=Einstein's waves win Nobel Prize |work=[[BBC News]] |date=3 October 2017 |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20171003"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=2017 Nobel Prize in Physics Awarded to LIGO Black Hole Researchers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/science/nobel-prize-physics.html |date=3 October 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20171003dk"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaiser |first=David |authorlink=David Kaiser |title=Learning from Gravitational Waves |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/opinion/gravitational-waves-ligo-funding.html |date=3 October 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitational waves provide complementary information to that provided by other means. By combining observations of a single event made using different means, it is possible to gain a more complete understanding of the source's properties. This is known as [[multi-messenger astronomy]]. Gravitational waves can also be used to observe systems that are invisible (or almost impossible to detect) to measure by any other means. For example, they provide a unique method of measuring the properties of black holes.

Gravitational waves can be emitted by many systems, but, to produce detectable signals, the source must consist of extremely massive objects moving at a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]]. The main source is a binary of two [[compact object]]s. Example systems include:
* Compact binaries made up of two closely orbiting stellar-mass objects, such as [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s. Wider binaries, which have lower orbital frequencies, are a source for detectors like [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelemans|first=Gijs|title=The Galactic gravitational wave foreground|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 May 2009|volume=26|issue=9|pages=094030|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/26/9/094030|arxiv = 0901.1778 |bibcode = 2009CQGra..26i4030N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroeer|first=A|author2=Vecchio, A|title=The LISA verification binaries|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 October 2006|volume=23|issue=19|pages=S809–S817|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/23/19/S19|arxiv = astro-ph/0605227 |bibcode = 2006CQGra..23S.809S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closer binaries produce a signal for ground-based detectors like [[LIGO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abadie|first=J|author2=et al.|title=Predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 September 2010|volume=27|issue=17|pages=173001|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/27/17/173001|arxiv = 1003.2480 |bibcode = 2010CQGra..27q3001A |last3=Abbott|first3=R.|last4=Abernathy|first4=M.|last5=Accadia|first5=T.|last6=Acernese|first6=F.|last7=Adams|first7=C.|last8=Adhikari|first8=R.|last9=Ajith|first9=P.|last10=Allen|first10=B.|last11=Allen|first11=G.|last12=Amador Ceron|first12=E.|last13=Amin|first13=R.

Gravitational waves interact only weakly with matter. This is what makes them difficult to detect. It also means that they can travel freely through the Universe, and are not [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] or [[scattering|scattered]] like electromagnetic radiation. It is therefore possible to see to the center of dense systems, like the cores of [[supernova]]e or the [[Galactic Centre]]. It is also possible to see further back in time than with electromagnetic radiation, as the [[Chronology of the universe|early universe]] was opaque to light prior to [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], but transparent to gravitational waves.

The ability of gravitational waves to move freely through matter also means that [[gravitational-wave detector]]s, unlike [[telescope]]s, are not pointed to observe a single [[field of view]] but observe the entire sky. Detectors are more sensitive in some directions than others, which is one reason why it is beneficial to have a network of detectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Bernard F|title=Networks of gravitational wave detectors and three figures of merit|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=21 June 2011|volume=28|issue=12|pages=125023|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/28/12/125023|arxiv = 1102.5421 |bibcode = 2011CQGra..28l5023S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In cosmic inflation===
[[Inflation (cosmology)|Cosmic inflation]], a hypothesized period when the universe rapidly expanded during the first 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds after the [[Big Bang]], would have given rise to gravitational waves; that would have left a characteristic imprint in the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the CMB radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=Wayne|author2=White, Martin|title=A CMB polarization primer|journal=New Astronomy|volume=2|issue=4|pages=323–344|doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(97)00022-5|arxiv = astro-ph/9706147 |bibcode = 1997NewA....2..323H |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamionkowski|first=Marc|author2=Stebbins, Albert|title=Statistics of cosmic microwave background polarization|journal=Physical Review D|volume=55|issue=12|pages=7368–7388|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.7368|arxiv = astro-ph/9611125 |bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.7368K |date=1997|last3=Stebbins|first3=Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to calculate the properties of the primordial gravitational waves from measurements of the patterns in the [[microwave]] radiation, and use those calculations to learn about the early universe. {{how|date=August 2017}}

==Development==
[[Image:LIGO control.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The LIGO Hanford Control Room]]
As a young area of research, gravitational-wave astronomy is still in development; however, there is consensus within the astrophysics community that this field will evolve to become an established component of 21st century [[multi-messenger astronomy]].&lt;ref name=LIGO_plan/&gt;

Gravitational-wave observations complement observations in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=Larry|title=Looking for the Afterglow: The LIGO Perspective|journal=LIGO Magazine|date=September 2015|issue=7|page=10|url=http://www.ligo.org/magazine/LIGO-magazine-issue-7.pdf#page=10|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LIGO_plan&gt;{{cite web|title=PLANNING FOR A BRIGHT TOMORROW: PROSPECTS FOR GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE ASTRONOMY WITH ADVANCED LIGO AND ADVANCED VIRGO|url=http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-ObservingScenario/index.php|publisher=[[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These waves also promise to yield information in ways not possible via detection and analysis of electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves can be absorbed and re-radiated in ways that make extracting information about the source difficult. Gravitational waves, however, only interact weakly with matter, meaning that they are not scattered or absorbed. This should allow astronomers to view the center of a supernova, stellar nebulae, and even colliding galactic cores in new ways.

Ground-based detectors have yielded new information about the inspiral phase and mergers of binary systems of two [[stellar black hole|stellar mass black hole]]s, and merger of two [[neutron star]]s. They could also detect signals from [[core-collapse supernova]]e, and from periodic sources such as pulsars with small deformations. If there is truth to speculation about certain kinds of [[phase transition]]s or kink bursts from long [[cosmic string]]s in the very early universe (at [[cosmic time]]s around 10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), these could also be detectable.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Cutler|Thorne|2002|loc=sec. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Space-based detectors like LISA should detect objects such as binaries consisting of two [[white dwarfs]], and [[AM CVn star]]s (a [[white dwarf]] accreting matter from its binary partner, a low-mass helium star), and also observe the mergers of [[supermassive black hole]]s and the inspiral of smaller objects (between one and a thousand [[solar mass]]es) into such black holes. LISA should also be able to listen to the same kind of sources from the early universe as ground-based detectors, but at even lower frequencies and with greatly increased sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Cutler|Thorne|2002|loc=sec. 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Detecting emitted gravitational waves is a difficult endeavor. It involves ultra stable high quality lasers and detectors calibrated with a sensitivity of at least 2·10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt; as shown at the ground-based detector, GEO600.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Seifert F., et al.|2006|loc=sec. 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that even from large astronomical events, such as supernova explosions, these waves are likely to degrade to vibrations as small as an atomic diameter.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Golm|Potsdam|2013|loc=sec. 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greenhouse Sports''' aims to develop social, thinking, emotional and physical skills for young people in London’s communities through sports programmes delivered by coaches.

Greenhouse Sports (originally Greenhouse Schools Project and then later Greenhouse Charity) was founded in 2002 when Chief Executive and founder, Michael de Giorgio, set up a multisports pilot to give young people on a local housing estate something positive to do in the school holidays. In 2004 the organisation then moved their programmes full-time into schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6224">[[Sigmund Freud]] noticed that [[humor]], like dreams, can be related to unconscious content.&lt;ref name = Freud2&gt;Freud, S. (1928). Humor. ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]], 9,'' 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1905 book ''[[Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten}}), as well as in the 1928 journal article ''Humor'', Freud distinguished contentious jokes&lt;ref name = Matte7&gt;Matte, G. (2001). A psychoanalytical perspective of humor. ''Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 14''(3),223-241&lt;/ref&gt; from non-contentious or silly humor.  In fact, he sorted humor into three categories that could be translated as: [[joke]], [[comic]], and [[mimetic]].&lt;ref name =Freud3&gt;Freud, S. (1960). ''Jokes and their relation to the unconscious'' (J. Strachey, Trans.). New York: W. W. Norton. (Original work published 1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's theory of humor==
In Freud's view, jokes (the verbal and interpersonal form of humor) happened when the [[conscious]] allowed the expression of thoughts that society usually suppressed or forbade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Masculinity and Ridicule| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Anna | last2= Hickey-Moody | journal=Gender: Laughter |publisher=Macmillan Reference|location=Farmington Hills, MI| pages= 215–228 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[superego]] allowed the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] to generate [[humor]].&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;  A benevolent [[superego]] allowed a light and comforting type of humor, while a harsh superego created a biting and sarcastic type of humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  A very harsh superego suppressed humor altogether.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  [[Freud]]’s humor theory, like most of his ideas, was based on a dynamic among [[id, ego, and super-ego]].&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;  The commanding superego would impede the ego from seeking pleasure for the id, or to momentarily adapt itself to the demands of reality,&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt; a mature coping method.  Moreover, Freud (1960)&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; followed [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ideas of energy being conserved, bottled up, and then released like so much steam venting to avoid an explosion.  Freud was imagining psychic or emotional energy, and this idea is now thought of as the relief theory of laughter.

Later, Freud re-turned his attention to humor noting that not everyone is capable of formulating humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name = Newirth8&gt;Newirth, J. (2006). Jokes and their relation to the unconscious: humor as a fundamental emotional experience. ''Psychoanalytic dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 557–571&lt;/ref&gt;

==The different types of humor==
If [[jokes]] let out forbidden thoughts and feelings that the conscious mind usually suppresses in deference to society,&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, A. (2006). ''Humor.'' In The internet encyclopedia of philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/humor.htm#H3, retrieved from the web on 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there was an interaction between unconscious drives and conscious thoughts.

[[Mimesis]], on the other hand, was a process involving two different representations of the body in our mind.&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; For example, in the phrase “Their hearts are in the right place,” the heart has two representations.  One is, of course, anatomical while the other is a metaphorical reference to caring and meaning well.

===Tendentious jokes===
Tendentious jokes are jokes that have to contain lust, hostility or both.

===Non-tendentious jokes===

The [[comic]] meant applying “to one and the same act of ideation, two different ideational methods” (Freud, 1905, 300; as cited in Matte, G. (2001)&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;). [[William Shakespeare]]’s [[Falstaff]] would be an example of Freud's "comic," generating laughter by expressing previously repressed inhibition.&lt;ref name = Kincaid4&gt;Kincaid, J. R. (2001). ''Falstaff as an example for Freud’s “comic.”'' http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/kincaid2, retrieved from the web on the 12 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An upset American says at Sunday School: "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] is my Shepherd; I am in want. He makes me to lie down on park benches; he leads me in the paths of destruction for His party's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. (2006) ''Studies in American humor'', University of Southern California, http://www.compedit.com/introduction.htm, retrieved from the web 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In advertising ==
An analysis of content from [[business-to-business]] advertising magazines in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany found a high (23 percent) overall usage of humor. The highest percentage was found in the British sample at 26 percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCullough|first=Lynette S.|last2=Taylor|first2=Ronald K.|date=1993|title=Humor in American, British, and German Ads|url=|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|volume=22|pages=17-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the types of humor found by McCullough and Taylor,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; three categories correspond with Freud’s grouping of tendentious (aggression and sexual) and non-tendentious (nonsense) wit. 20 percent of the humor are accounted for as “aggression” and “sexual.” “Nonsense” is listed at 18 percent.

==Criticism==
It has been claimed that Freud's division is artificial and not very clear.&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1&gt;Altman, N. (2006). And now for something completely different: Humor in psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 573–577.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Altman (2006),&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; these divisions are more semantic than functional.  Hence, all three types of humor may be the result of the dynamic of the [[conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; For example, hate and anger can be hidden by a false sense of love and compassion, which could be the opposite of what was meant, and which could formulate a joke.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt;

'''IT risk management''' is the application of [[risk management]] methods to [[information technology]] in order to manage [[IT risk]], i.e.:
:''The business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of IT within an enterprise or organization''
&lt;!----- transclusion --------&gt;
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
IT risk management can be considered a component of a wider [[enterprise risk management]] system.&lt;ref name=RISKITW&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment, maintenance and continuous update of an [[Information security management system]] (ISMS) provide a strong indication that a company is using a systematic approach for the identification, assessment and management of information security risks.&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL&gt;[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/files/deliverables/risk-management-principles-and-inventories-for-risk-management-risk-assessment-methods-and-tools/at_download/fullReport Enisa Risk management, Risk assessment inventory, page 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different methodologies have been proposed to manage IT risks, each of them divided into processes and steps.&lt;ref name=Vacca1&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Risk IT]] framework,&lt;ref name=RISKITW/&gt; this encompasses not only the negative impact of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact.{{clarify|date=September 2017|post-text=incomprehensible sentence}}

Because [[Risk#Risk as a vector quantity|risk]] is strictly tied to uncertainty, [[decision theory]] should be applied to manage risk as a science, i.e. rationally making choices under uncertainty.

Generally speaking, [[risk]] is the product of likelihood times [[result|impact]] (Risk = Likelihood * Impact).&lt;ref&gt;"Risk is a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure(s)" (OHSAS 18001:2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of an IT risk can be determined as a product of threat, vulnerability and [[asset (computing)|asset]] values:&lt;ref name=Vacca&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Asset&lt;/math&gt;

A more current Risk management framework for IT Risk would be the TIK framework:
:&lt;math&gt;Risk = ((Vulnerability * Threat) / Counter Measure) * Asset Value at Risk&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://it-risk-management.com/ IT Risk Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

&lt;!----- transclusion --------&gt;
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
The [[Certified Information Systems Auditor]] Review Manual 2006 produced by ISACA, an international professional association focused on IT Governance, provides the following definition of risk management: ''"Risk management is the process of identifying [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and [[threat (computer)|threats]] to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]], if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization."''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = ISACA
 | title = CISA Review Manual 2006
 | publisher = [http://www.isaca.org/ Information Systems Audit and Control Association]
 | year = 2006
 | pages = 85
 | isbn = 1-933284-15-3 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
&lt;!----- transclusion END HERE BUT FOLLOWS --------&gt;

There is two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the ''process'' of risk management is an ongoing iterative [[Business process|process]]. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] emerge every day. Second, the choice of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] ([[security controls|controls]]) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected.

''[[Risk management]] is the process that allows IT managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the IT systems and data that support their organizations’ missions. This process is not unique to the IT environment; indeed it pervades decision-making in all areas of our daily lives''.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

The head of an organizational unit must ensure that the organization has the capabilities needed to accomplish its mission. These mission owners must determine the security capabilities that their IT systems must have to provide the desired level of mission support in the face of real world [[threat (computer)|threat]]s. Most organizations have tight budgets for IT security; therefore, IT security spending must be reviewed as thoroughly as other management decisions. A well-structured risk management methodology, when used effectively, can help management identify appropriate [[security controls|controls]] for providing the mission-essential security capabilities.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
[[File:Osa metamodel v003.png|thumb|Relationships between IT security entity]]

Risk management in the IT world is quite a complex, multi faced activity, with a lot of relations with other complex activities. The picture to the right shows the relationships between different related terms.

The American [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] defines risk management in the IT field as:&lt;ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"&gt;[http://niatec.info/Glossary.aspx?term=4253&amp;alpha=R NIATEC Glossary of terms]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The total process to identify, control, and minimize the impact of uncertain events. The objective of the risk management program is to reduce risk and obtain and maintain DAA approval. The process facilitates the management of security risks by each level of management throughout the system life cycle. The approval process consists of three elements: [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], certification, and approval.''
# ''An element of managerial science concerned with the identification, measurement, control, and minimization of uncertain events. An effective risk management program encompasses the following four phases:''
##a ''Risk assessment, as derived from an evaluation of threats and vulnerabilities.''
## ''Management decision.''
## ''Control implementation.''
## ''Effectiveness review.''
# ''The total process of identifying, measuring, and minimizing uncertain events affecting AIS resources. It includes [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]], cost benefit analysis, safeguard selection, security test and evaluation, safeguard implementation, and systems review.''
# ''The total process of identifying, controlling, and eliminating or minimizing uncertain events that may affect system resources. lt includes risk analysis, cost benefit analysis, selection, implementation and test, security evaluation of safeguards, and overall security review.''

== Risk management as part of enterprise risk management ==
Some organizations have, and many others should have, a comprehensive [[Enterprise risk management]] (ERM) in place. The four objective categories addressed, according to [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] (COSO) are:
* Strategy - high-level goals, aligned with and supporting the organization's mission
* Operations - effective and efficient use of resources
* Financial Reporting - reliability of operational and financial reporting
* Compliance - compliance with applicable laws and regulations
According to the [[Risk IT]] framework by [[ISACA]],&lt;ref name=riskit&gt;The Risk IT Framework by ISACA, {{ISBN|978-1-60420-111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT risk is transversal to all four categories. The IT risk should be managed in the framework of Enterprise risk management: [[Risk appetite]] and Risk sensitivity of the whole enterprise should guide the IT risk management process. ERM should provide the context and business objectives to IT risk management

== Risk management methodology ==
[[File:The Risk Management Process.png|thumb|ENISA: The Risk Management Process, according to ISO Standard 13335]]
The term [[methodology]] means an organized set of principles and rules that drive action in a particular field of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;
A methodology does not describe specific methods; nevertheless it does specify several processes that need to be followed. These processes constitute a generic framework. They may be broken down in sub-processes, they may be combined, or their sequence may change. However, any risk management exercise must carry out these processes in one form or another, The following table compares the processes foreseen by three leading standards.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt; The [[ISACA]] [[Risk IT]] framework is more recent. The Risk IT Practitioner-Guide&lt;ref name=RISKITP&gt;[http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/The-Risk-IT-Practitioner-Guide.aspx The Risk IT Practitioner Guide, Appendix 3 ISACA] {{ISBN|978-1-60420-116-1}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; compares Risk IT and ISO 27005.
The overall comparison is illustrated in the following table.
{| class="wikitable"

Due to the probabilistic nature and the need of cost benefit analysis, IT risks are managed following a process that according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30 can be divided in the following steps:&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
# [[risk assessment]],
# [[#Risk mitigation|risk mitigation]], and
# [[evaluation]] and [[wikt:assessment|assessment]].

Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle]].&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

Information [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] conducted on applications, computer installations, networks and systems under development should be undertaken using structured methodologies.&lt;ref name=SOGP&gt;[https://www.isfsecuritystandard.com Standard of Good Practice by Information Security Forum (ISF) Section SM3.4 Information risk analysis methodologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context establishment ==
This step is the first step in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO/IEC 27005]] framework. Most of the elementary activities are foreseen as the first sub process of Risk assessment according to [[NIST]] SP 800-30.
This step implies the acquisition of all relevant information about the organization and the determination of the basic criteria, purpose, scope and boundaries of risk management activities and the organization in charge of risk management activities. The purpose is usually the compliance with legal requirements and provide evidence of due diligence supporting an [[Information security management system|ISMS]] that can be certified. The scope can be an incident reporting plan, a [[business continuity plan]].

Another area of application can be the certification of a product.

Criteria include the risk evaluation, risk acceptance and impact evaluation criteria. These are conditioned by:&lt;ref name=ISO27005&gt;ISO/IEC, "Information technology -- Security techniques-Information security risk management" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* legal and regulatory requirements
* the strategic value for the business of information processes
* [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] expectations
* negative consequences for the reputation of the organization

Establishing the scope and boundaries, the organization should be studied: its mission, its values, its structure; its strategy, its locations and cultural environment. The constraints (budgetary, cultural, political, technical) of the organization are to be collected and documented as guide for next steps.

=== Organization for security management ===
The set up of the organization in charge of risk management is foreseen as partially fulfilling the requirement to provide the resources needed to establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an ISMS.&lt;ref name=ISO27001&gt;ISO/IEC 27001&lt;/ref&gt; The main roles inside this organization are:&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
* Senior Management
* [[Chief information officer]] (CIO)
* System and Information owners
* the business and functional managers
* the [[ISSO (IT)|Information System Security Officer]] (ISSO) or [[Chief information security officer]] (CISO)
* IT Security Practitioners
* Security Awareness Trainers

== Risk assessment ==
[[File:Octave like.jpg|thumb|ENISA: Risk assessment inside risk management]]
Risk Management is a recurrent activity that deals with the analysis, planning, implementation, control and monitoring of implemented measurements and the enforced security policy. On the contrary, Risk Assessment is executed at discrete time points (e.g. once a year, on demand, etc.) and – until the performance of the next assessment - provides a temporary view of assessed risks and while parameterizing the entire Risk Management process.
This view of the relationship of Risk Management to Risk Assessment is depicted in figure as adopted from OCTAVE.&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL/&gt;

Risk assessment is often conducted in more than one iteration, the first being a high-level assessment to identify high risks, while the other iterations detailed the analysis of the major risks and other risks.

According to [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] risk assessment in the IT field is:&lt;ref name="NIATEC Glossary of terms"/&gt;
# ''A study of the vulnerabilities, threats, likelihood, loss or impact, and theoretical effectiveness of security measures. Managers use the results of a risk assessment to develop security requirements and specifications.''
# ''The process of evaluating threats and vulnerabilities, known and postulated, to determine expected loss and establish the degree of acceptability to system operations.''
# ''An identification of a specific ADP facility's assets, the threats to these assets, and the ADP facility's vulnerability to those threats.''
# An analysis of system assets and vulnerabilities to establish an expected loss from certain events based on estimated probabilities of the occurrence of those events. The purpose of a risk assessment is to determine if countermeasures are adequate to reduce the probability of loss or the impact of loss to an acceptable level. ''
#''A management tool which provides a systematic approach for determining the relative value and sensitivity of computer installation assets, assessing vulnerabilities, assessing loss expectancy or perceived risk exposure levels, assessing existing protection features and additional protection alternatives or acceptance of risks and documenting management decisions. Decisions for implementing additional protection features are normally based on the existence of a reasonable ratio between cost/benefit of the safeguard and sensitivity/value of the assets to be protected. Risk assessments may vary from an informal review of a small scale microcomputer installation to a more formal and fully documented analysis (i. e., risk analysis) of a large scale computer installation. Risk assessment methodologies may vary from qualitative or quantitative approaches to any combination of these two approaches.''

=== ISO 27005 framework ===
Risk assessment receives as input the output of the previous step [[#Context establishment|Context establishment]]; the output is the list of assessed risks prioritized according to risk evaluation criteria.
The process can be divided into the following steps:&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
* [[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]], further divided in:
** [[#Risk identification|Risk identification]]
** [[#Risk estimation|Risk estimation]]
** [[#Risk evaluation|Risk evaluation]]
The following table compares these ISO 27005 processes with [[Risk IT]] framework processes:&lt;ref name=RISKITP/&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

* RE2 Analyse risk comprises more than what is described by the ISO 27005 process step. RE2 has as its objective developing useful information to support risk decisions that take into account the business relevance of risk factors.
* RE1 Collect data serves as input to the analysis of risk (e.g., identifying risk factors, collecting data on the external environment).
|-
| Risk identification || This process is included in RE2.2 Estimate IT risk. The identification of risk comprises the following elements:

|}
The [[ISO/IEC 17799|ISO/IEC 27002:2005]] Code of practice for information security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:
*[[security policy]],
*[[organization]] of information security,
*[[asset management]],
*[[human resources]] security,
* [[physical security|physical]] and [[environmental security]],
*[[communications]] and operations management,
*[[access control]],
*information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, (see [[Systems Development Life Cycle]])
*information security [[incident management]],
* [[business continuity]] management, and
* [[regulatory compliance]].

Risk identification states what could cause a potential loss; the following are to be identified:&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;
* [[asset (computing)|assets]], primary (i.e. Business processes and related information) and supporting (i.e. hardware, software, personnel, site, organization structure)
* [[Threat (computer)|threat]]s
* existing and planned security measures
* vulnerabilities
* consequence
* related business processes
The output of sub process is made up of:

* list of asset and related business processes to be risk managed with associated list of threats, existing and planned security measures
* list of vulnerabilities unrelated to any identified threats
* list of incident scenarios with their consequences.

==== Risk estimation ====
There are two methods of risk assessment in information security field, [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]].&lt;ref name="CISSP-Guide"&gt;{{cite book | title=Official (ISC)2 Guide to CISSP CBK | publisher=Auerbach Publications | year=2007 | pages=1065 | location=Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purely quantitative risk assessment is a mathematical calculation based on security metrics on the [[asset (computing)|asset]] (system or application).
For each [[risk scenario]], taking into consideration the different [[risk factor (computing)|risk factors]] a [[Single loss expectancy]] (SLE) is determined. Then, considering the probability of occurrence on a given period basis, for example the annual rate of occurrence (ARO), the [[Annualized Loss Expectancy]] is determined as the product of ARO X SLE.&lt;ref name="Vacca"/&gt;
It is important to point out that the values of [[asset (computing)|assets]] to be considered are those of all involved assets, not only the value of the directly affected resource.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if you consider the risk scenario of a Laptop theft threat, you should consider the value of the data (a related asset) contained in the computer and the reputation and liability of the company (other assets) deriving from the lost of availability and confidentiality of the data that could be involved.
It is easy to understand that [[intangible asset]]s (data, reputation, liability) can be worth much more than physical resources at risk (the laptop hardware in the example).&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-27/politics/va.data.theft_1_laptop-personal-data-single-veteran?_s=PM:POLITICS CNN article about a class action settlement for a Veteran Affair stolen laptop]&lt;/ref&gt;
Intangible asset value can be huge, but is not easy to evaluate: this can be a consideration against a pure quantitative approach.&lt;ref name=FAIR/&gt;

Qualitative risk assessment (three to five steps evaluation, from Very High to Low) is performed when the organization requires a risk assessment be performed in a relatively short time or to meet a small budget, a significant quantity of relevant data is not available, or the persons performing the assessment don't have the sophisticated mathematical, financial, and risk assessment expertise required.&lt;ref name="CISSP-Guide" /&gt; Qualitative risk assessment can be performed in a shorter period of time and with less data. Qualitative risk assessments are typically performed through interviews of a sample of personnel from all relevant groups within an organization charged with the security of the asset being assessed. Qualitative risk assessments are descriptive versus measurable.
Usually a qualitative classification is done followed by a quantitative evaluation of the highest risks to be compared to the costs of security measures.

Risk estimation has as input the output of risk analysis and can be split in the following steps:
* assessment of the consequences through the valuation of assets
* assessment of the likelihood of the incident (through threat and vulnerability valuation)
* assign values to the likelihood and consequence of the risks
The output is the list of risks with value levels assigned. It can be documented in a [[risk register]].

Risks arising from security threats and adversary attacks may be particularly difficult to estimate. This difficulty is made worse because, at least for any IT system connected to the Internet, any adversary with intent and capability may attack because physical closeness or access is not necessary. Some initial models have been proposed for this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global adversarial capability modeling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7120797|journal = 2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1–21|doi = 10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120797|first = J.|last = Spring|first2 = S.|last2 = Kern|first3 = A.|last3 = Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During risk estimation there are generally three values of a given asset, one for the loss of one of the [[CIA triad|CIA]] properties: [[Information security|Confidentiality]], Integrity, [[Availability]].&lt;ref name="BS7799"&gt;British Standard Institute "ISMSs-Part 3: Guidelines for information security risk management" BS 7799-3:2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Risk evaluation ====
The risk evaluation process receives as input the output of risk analysis process. It compares each risk level against the risk acceptance criteria and prioritise the risk list with risk treatment indications.

=== NIST SP 800 30 framework ===
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1.png|thumb|Risk assessment according NIST SP 800-30 Figure 3-1]]
To determine the likelihood of a future adverse event, [[threat (computer)|threat]]s to an IT system must be in conjunction with the potential [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and the [[security controls|controls]] in place for the IT system.&lt;br /&gt;
Impact refers to the magnitude of harm that could be caused by a threat’s exercise of vulnerability. The level of impact is governed by the potential mission impacts and produces a relative value for the IT assets and resources affected (e.g., the criticality sensitivity of the IT system components and data). The risk assessment methodology encompasses nine primary steps:&lt;ref name=SP80030&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Step 1 System Characterization
* Step 2 Threat Identification
* Step 3 Vulnerability Identification
* Step 4 Control Analysis
* Step 5 Likelihood Determination
* Step 6 Impact Analysis
* Step 7 Risk Determination
* Step 8 Control Recommendations
* Step 9 Results Documentation

== Risk mitigation ==
Risk mitigation, the second process according to SP 800-30, the third according to ISO 27005 of risk management, involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk assessment process.
Because the elimination of all risk is usually impractical or close to impossible, it is the responsibility of senior management and functional and business managers to use the least-cost approach and implement the most appropriate controls to decrease mission risk to an acceptable level, with minimal adverse impact on the organization’s resources and mission.

=== ISO 27005 framework ===
The risk treatment process aim at selecting security measures to:
* reduce
* retain
* avoid
* transfer
risk and produce a risk treatment plan, that is the output of the process with the residual risks subject to the acceptance of management.

There are some list to select appropriate security measures,&lt;ref name=ISO27001/&gt; but is up to the single organization to choose the most appropriate one according to its business strategy, constraints of the environment and circumstances. The choice should be rational and documented. The importance of accepting a risk that is too costly to reduce is very high and led to the fact that risk acceptance is considered a separate process.&lt;ref name=ISO27005/&gt;

Risk transfer apply were the risk has a very high impact but is not easy to reduce significantly the likelihood by means of security controls: the [[insurance]] premium should be compared against the mitigation costs, eventually evaluating some mixed strategy to partially treat the risk. Another option is to outsource the risk to somebody more efficient to manage the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Costas Lambrinoudakisa, Stefanos Gritzalisa, Petros Hatzopoulosb, Athanasios N. Yannacopoulosb, Sokratis Katsikasa, "A formal model for pricing information systems insurance contracts", Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces - Volume 27, Issue 5, June 2005, Pages 521-532 {{doi|10.1016/j.csi.2005.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk avoidance describe any action where ways of conducting business are changed to avoid any risk occurrence. For example, the choice of not storing sensitive information about customers can be an avoidance for the risk that customer data can be stolen.

The ''residual risks'', i.e. the risk remaining after risk treatment decision have been taken, should be estimated to ensure that sufficient protection is achieved. If the residual risk is unacceptable, the risk treatment process should be iterated.

=== NIST SP 800 30 framework ===
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2.png|thumb|Risk mitigation methodology flow chart from NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-2]]
[[File:NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1.png|thumb|Risk mitigation action point according to NIST SP 800-30 Figure 4-1]]
Risk mitigation is a systematic methodology used by senior management to reduce mission risk.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Risk mitigation can be achieved through any of the following risk mitigation options:
* '''Risk Assumption'''. To accept the potential risk and continue operating the IT system or to implement controls to lower the risk to an acceptable level
* '''Risk Avoidance'''. To avoid the risk by eliminating the risk cause and/or consequence (e.g., forgo certain functions of the system or shut down the system when risks are identified)
* '''Risk Limitation'''. To limit the risk by implementing controls that minimize the adverse impact of a threat’s exercising a vulnerability (e.g., use of supporting, preventive, detective controls)
* '''Risk Planning'''. To manage risk by developing a risk mitigation plan that prioritizes, implements, and maintains controls
* ''' Research and Acknowledgement'''. To lower the risk of loss by acknowledging the vulnerability or flaw and researching controls to correct the vulnerability
* '''Risk Transference'''. To transfer the risk by using other options to compensate for the loss, such as purchasing insurance.
Address the greatest risks and strive for sufficient risk mitigation at the lowest cost, with minimal impact on other mission capabilities: this is the suggestion contained in&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

== Risk communication ==
{{main article|Risk_management#Risk_communication}}
Risk communication is a horizontal process that interacts bidirectionally with all other processes of risk management. Its purpose is to establish a common understanding of all aspect of risk among all the organization's stakeholder. Establishing a common understanding is important, since it influences decisions to be taken. The Risk Reduction Overview method &lt;ref&gt;[http://rro.sourceforge.net RRO website]&lt;/ref&gt; is specifically designed for this process. It presents a comprehensible overview of the coherence of risks, measures and residual risks to achieve this common understanding.

== Risk monitoring and review ==
Risk management is an ongoing, never ending process. Within this process implemented security measures are regularly monitored and reviewed to ensure that they work as planned and that changes in the environment rendered them ineffective. Business requirements, vulnerabilities and threats can change over the time.

Regular audits should be scheduled and should be conducted by an independent party, i.e. somebody not under the control of whom is responsible for the implementations or daily management of [[Information security management system|ISMS]].

== IT evaluation and assessment ==
Security controls should be validated. Technical controls are possible complex systems that are to tested and verified. The hardest part to validate is people knowledge of procedural controls and the effectiveness of the real application in daily business of the security procedures.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;

[[Vulnerability assessment (computing)|Vulnerability assessment]], both internal and external, and [[Penetration test]] are instruments for verifying the status of security controls.

[[Information technology security audit]] is an organizational and procedural control with the aim of evaluating security.
The IT systems of most organization are evolving quite rapidly. Risk management should cope with these changes through change authorization after risk re evaluation of the affected systems and processes and periodically review the risks and mitigation actions.&lt;ref name=Vacca/&gt;

Monitoring system events according to a security monitoring strategy, an incident response plan and security validation and metrics are fundamental activities to assure that an optimal level of security is obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to monitor the new vulnerabilities, apply procedural and technical security controls like regularly [[Patch (computing)|updating software]], and evaluate other kinds of controls to deal with [[zero-day attack]]s.

The attitude of involved people to [[benchmarking|benchmark]] against [[best practice]] and follow the seminars of [[professional association]]s in the sector are factors to assure the state of art of an organization IT risk management practice.

== Integrating risk management into system development life cycle ==
Effective risk management must be totally integrated into the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|SDLC]]. An IT system’s SDLC has five phases: initiation, development or acquisition, implementation, operation or maintenance, and disposal. The risk management methodology is the same regardless of the SDLC phase for which the assessment is being conducted. Risk management is an iterative process that can be performed during each major phase of the SDLC.&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|+ align="center" |'''Table 2-1 Integration of Risk Management into the SDLC'''&lt;ref name=SP80030/&gt;
|-
! SDLC Phases!!Phase Characteristics!!Support from Risk Management Activities
|-
| Phase 1: Initiation||The need for an IT system is expressed and the purpose and scope of the IT system is documented||Identified risks are used to support the development of the system requirements, including security requirements, and a security concept of operations (strategy)
|-
| style=white-space:nowrap| Phase 2: Development or Acquisition||The IT system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed||The risks identified during this phase can be used to support the security analyses of the IT system that may lead to architecture and design tradeoffs during system development
|-
| Phase 3: Implementation||The system security features should be configured, enabled, tested, and verified||The risk management process supports the assessment of the system implementation against its requirements and within its modeled operational environment. Decisions regarding risks identified must be made prior to system operation
|-
| style=white-space:nowrap|Phase 4: Operation or Maintenance||The system performs its functions. Typically the system is being modified on an ongoing basis through the addition of hardware and software and by changes to organizational processes, policies, and procedures||Risk management activities are performed for periodic system reauthorization (or reaccreditation) or whenever major changes are made to an IT system in its operational, production environment (e.g., new system interfaces)
|-
| Phase 5: Disposal||This phase may involve the disposition of information, hardware, and software. Activities may include moving, archiving, discarding, or destroying information and sanitizing the hardware and software||Risk management activities are performed for system components that will be disposed of or replaced to ensure that the hardware and software are properly disposed of, that residual data is appropriately handled, and that system migration is conducted in a secure and systematic manner

[[NIST]] SP 800-64&lt;ref name=NIST80064&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-64-Rev2/SP800-64-Revision2.pdf 800-64 NIST Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to this topic.

Early integration of security in the SDLC enables agencies to maximize return on investment in their security programs, through:&lt;ref name=NIST80064/&gt;
* Early identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in lower cost of security control implementation and vulnerability mitigation;
* Awareness of potential engineering challenges caused by mandatory security controls;
* Identification of shared [[Security service (telecommunication)|security services]] and reuse of security strategies and tools to reduce development cost and schedule while improving security posture through proven methods and techniques; and
* Facilitation of informed executive decision making through comprehensive risk management in a timely manner.
This guide&lt;ref name=NIST80064/&gt; focuses on the information security components of the SDLC. First, descriptions of the key security roles and responsibilities that are needed in most information system developments are provided. Second, sufficient information about the SDLC is provided to allow a person who is unfamiliar with the SDLC process to understand the relationship between information security and the SDLC.
The document integrates the security steps into the linear, sequential (a.k.a. waterfall) SDLC. The five-step SDLC cited in the document is an example of one method of development and is not intended to mandate this methodology.
Lastly, SP 800-64 provides insight into IT projects and initiatives that are not as clearly defined as SDLC-based developments, such as service-oriented architectures, cross-organization projects, and IT facility developments.

Security can be incorporated into information systems acquisition, development and maintenance by implementing effective security practices in the following areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/itsg2/Information+Systems+Acquisition%2C+Development%2C+and+Maintenance+%28ISO+12%29 EDUCAUSE Dashboard ISO 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Security requirements for information systems
* Correct processing in applications
* Cryptographic controls
* Security of system files
* Security in development and support processes
* Technical vulnerability management

Information systems security begins with incorporating security into the requirements process for any new application or system enhancement. Security should be designed into the system from the beginning. Security requirements are presented to the vendor during the requirements phase of a product purchase. Formal testing should be done to determine whether the product meets the required security specifications prior to purchasing the product.

Correct processing in applications is essential in order to prevent errors and to mitigate loss, unauthorized modification or misuse of information. Effective coding techniques include validating input and output data, protecting message integrity using encryption, checking for processing errors, and creating activity logs.

Applied properly, cryptographic controls provide effective mechanisms for protecting the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of information. An institution should develop policies on the use of encryption, including proper key management. Disk Encryption is one way to protect data at rest. Data in transit can be protected from alteration and unauthorized viewing using SSL certificates issued through a Certificate Authority that has implemented a Public Key Infrastructure.

System files used by applications must be protected in order to ensure the integrity and stability of the application. Using source code repositories with version control, extensive testing, production back-off plans, and appropriate access to program code are some effective measures that can be used to protect an application's files.

Security in development and support processes is an essential part of a comprehensive quality assurance and production control process, and would usually involve training and continuous oversight by the most experienced staff.

Applications need to be monitored and patched for technical vulnerabilities. Procedures for applying patches should include evaluating the patches to determine their appropriateness, and whether or not they can be successfully removed in case of a negative impact.

== Critique of risk management as a methodology ==
Risk management as a scientific methodology has been criticized as being shallow.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt; Major IT risk management programmes for large organizations, such as mandated by the US [[FISMA#Critique|Federal Information Security Management Act]], have been criticized.

By avoiding the complexity that accompanies the formal probabilistic model of risks and uncertainty, risk management looks more like a process that attempts to guess rather than formally predict the future on the basis of statistical evidence. It is highly subjective in assessing the value of assets, the likelihood of threats occurrence and the significance of the impact.

However, a better way to deal with the subject has not emerged.&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;

== Risk managements methods ==

It is quite hard to list most of the methods that at least partially support the IT risk management process. Efforts in this direction were done by:
* [[NIST]] Description of Automated Risk Management Packages That NIST/NCSC Risk Management Research Laboratory Has Examined, updated 1991
* [[ENISA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods ENISA, Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006; a list of methods and tools is available on line with a comparison engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rm-inv.enisa.europa.eu/rm_ra_methods.html Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; Among them the most widely used are:&lt;ref name=Vacca1/&gt;
** [[CRAMM]] Developed by British government is compliant to [[ISO/IEC 17799]], [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA) and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA)
** [[EBIOS]] developed by the French government it is compliant with major security standards: [[ISO/IEC 27001]], ISO/IEC 13335, [[ISO/IEC 15408]], [[ISO/IEC 17799]] and ISO/IEC 21287
** [[Standard of Good Practice]] developed by [[Information Security Forum]] (ISF)
** [[Mehari]] developed by [https://www.clusif.asso.fr/ Clusif Club de la Sécurité de l'Information Français]
** TIK IT Risk Framework developed by [http://itriskinstitute.com/ IT Risk Institute]
** Octave developed by Carnegie Mellon University, SEI ([[Software Engineering Institute]]) The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability EvaluationSM (OCTAVE) approach defines a risk-based strategic assessment and planning technique for security.
** [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs|IT-Grundschutz]] (IT Baseline Protection Manual) developed by Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) (Germany); IT-Grundschutz provides a method for an organization to establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It comprises both generic IT security recommendations for establishing an applicable IT security process and detailed technical recommendations to achieve the necessary IT security level for a specific domain
Enisa report&lt;ref name=ENISAFULL/&gt; classified the different methods regarding completeness, free availability, tool support; the result is that:
* EBIOS, ISF methods, IT-Grundschutz cover deeply all the aspects (Risk Identification, Risk analysis, Risk evaluation, Risk assessment, Risk treatment, Risk acceptance, Risk communication),
* EBIOS and IT-Grundschutz are the only ones freely available and
* only EBIOS has an open source tool to support it.

The [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]] (FAIR) main document, "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006;&lt;ref name=FAIR&gt;,[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf |date=2014-11-18 }};&lt;/ref&gt;
outline that most of the methods above lack of rigorous definition of risk and its factors. FAIR is not another methodology to deal with risk management, but it complements existing methodologies.&lt;ref name=OGC081&gt;Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy {{ISBN|1-931624-77-1}} Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

FAIR has had a good acceptance, mainly by [[The Open Group]] and [[ISACA]].

ISACA developed a methodology, called [[Risk IT]], to address various kind of IT related risks, chiefly security related risks. It is integrated with [[COBIT]], a general framework to manage IT.
Risk IT has a broader concept of [[IT risk]] than other methodologies, it encompasses not just only the negative [[impact (security)|impact]] of operations and service delivery which can bring destruction or reduction of the value of the organization, but also the benefit\value enabling risk associated to missing opportunities to use technology to enable or enhance business or the IT project management for aspects like overspending or late delivery with adverse business impact.&lt;ref name=RISKITW/&gt;

The "''Build Security In''" initiative of [[Homeland Security Department]] of United States, cites FAIR.&lt;ref&gt;https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/best-practices/deployment/583-BSI.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The initiative Build Security In is a collaborative effort that provides practices, tools, guidelines, rules, principles, and other resources that software developers, architects, and security practitioners can use to build security into software in every phase of its development. So it chiefly address [[Secure coding]].

In 2016, Threat Sketch launched an abbreviated cyber security risk assessment specifically for small organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hub.innovationquarter.com/2016/10/05/a-start-up-grows-up-in-the-innovation-quarter/|title=Threat Sketch: A Start-up Grows Up in the Innovation Quarter|date=2016-10-05|website=Innovation Quarter Hub|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twcnews.com/nc/triad/news/2016/11/11/entrepreneurs-share-business-ideas-on-startup-weekend.html|title=Triad Entrepreneurs Share Business Ideas on Startup Weekend|newspaper=TWC News|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology uses [[Real options valuation|real options]] to forecast and prioritize a fixed list of high-level threats.

'''Indole-3-acetic acid''' ('''IAA''', '''3-IAA''') is the most common, naturally occurring, [[plant hormone]] of the [[auxin]] class. It is the best known of the auxins, and has been the subject of extensive studies by plant physiologists.&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.12.007 |title=Why plants need more than one type of auxin |year=2011 |last1=Simon |first1=Sibu |last2=Petrášek |first2=Jan |journal=Plant Science |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=454–60 |pmid=21421392}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAA is a derivative of [[indole]], containing a carboxymethyl substituent. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in polar organic solvents.

== Biosynthesis ==
{{Main|Auxin}}
IAA is predominantly produced in cells of the apex ([[bud]]) and very young leaves of a [[plant]]. Plants can synthesize IAA by several independent biosynthetic pathways.  Four of them start from [[tryptophan]], but there is also a biosynthetic pathway independent of tryptophan.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-042809-112308 |title=Auxin Biosynthesis and Its Role in Plant Development |year=2010 |last1=Zhao |first1=Yunde |journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology |volume=61 |pages=49–64 |pmid=20192736 |pmc=3070418}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plants mainly produce IAA from tryptophan through [[indole-3-pyruvic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2011PNAS..10818512M |title=The main auxin biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis |last1=Mashiguchi |first1=Kiyoshi |last2=Tanaka |first2=Keita |last3=Sakai |first3=Tatsuya |last4=Sugawara |first4=Satoko |last5=Kawaide |first5=Hiroshi |last6=Natsume |first6=Masahiro |last7=Hanada |first7=Atsushi |last8=Yaeno |first8=Takashi |last9=Shirasu |first9=Ken |last10=Yao |first10=H. |last11=McSteen |first11=P. |last12=Zhao |first12=Y. |last13=Hayashi |first13=K.-i. |last14=Kamiya |first14=Y. |last15=Kasahara |first15=H. |volume=108 |year=2011 |pages=18512–7 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.1108434108 |issue=45 |pmid=22025724 |pmc=3215075|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2011PNAS..10818518W |title=Conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetic acid by TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASES OF ARABIDOPSIS and YUCCAs in Arabidopsis |last1=Won |first1=Christina |last2=Shen |first2=Xiangling |last3=Mashiguchi |first3=Kiyoshi |last4=Zheng |first4=Zuyu |last5=Dai |first5=Xinhua |last6=Cheng |first6=Youfa |last7=Kasahara |first7=Hiroyuki |last8=Kamiya |first8=Yuji |last9=Chory |first9=Joanne |last10=Zhao |first10=Y. |volume=108 |year=2011 |pages=18518–23 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.1108436108 |issue=45 |pmid=22025721 |pmc=3215067|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IAA is also produced from tryptophan through [[indole-3-acetaldoxime]] in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.5430S |title=Biochemical analyses of indole-3-acetaldoxime-dependent auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis |last1=Sugawara |first1=Satoko |last2=Hishiyama |first2=Shojiro |last3=Jikumaru |first3=Yusuke |last4=Hanada |first4=Atsushi |last5=Nishimura |first5=Takeshi |last6=Koshiba |first6=Tomokazu |last7=Zhao |first7=Yunde |last8=Kamiya |first8=Yuji |last9=Kasahara |first9=Hiroyuki |volume=106 |year=2009 |pages=5430–5 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.0811226106 |issue=13 |pmid=19279202 |jstor=40455212 |pmc=2664063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rats, IAA is a product of both endogenous and colonic microbial metabolism from dietary [[tryptophan]] along with [[tryptophol]]. This was first observed in rats infected by ''[[Trypanosoma brucei gambiense]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Howard Stibbs Henry |author2=Richard Seed John | year = 1975 | title = Short-Term Metabolism of [14C]Tryptophan in Rats Infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense | url = | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 131 | issue = 4| pages = 459–462 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/131.4.459 | pmid=1117200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and correlation with protein intake has been confirmed in 2015. Humans did not excrete IAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poesen R, Mutsaers HA | date = Oct 2015 | title = The Influence of Dietary Protein Intake on Mammalian Tryptophan and Phenolic Metabolites | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 10| page = e0140820 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0140820 |display-authors=etal | pmid=26469515 | pmc=4607412| bibcode=2015PLoSO..1040820P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological effects==
As all auxins, IAA has many different effects, such as inducing [[Cell (biology)|cell]] elongation and [[cell division]] with all subsequent results for plant growth and development. On a larger scale, IAA serves as signaling molecule necessary for development of plant organs and coordination of growth.

===Plant gene regulation===
IAA enters the plant cell nucleus and binds to a protein complex composed of a [[ubiquitin-activating enzyme]] (E1), a [[ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme]] (E2), and a [[ubiquitin ligase]] (E3), resulting in  [[Ubiquitin#Ubiquitination|ubiquitination]] of [[Auxin#Aux/IAA, ARF, TIR1, SCF auxin regulatory pathways|Aux/IAA]] proteins with increased speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. |year=2005 |last1=Pekker |first1=MD |last2=Deshaies |first2=RJ |journal=Plant Cell |volume=6 |pages=9–20 |doi=10.1038/nrm1547 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aux/IAA proteins bind to [[Auxin#Aux/IAA, ARF, TIR1, SCF auxin regulatory pathways|auxin response factor]] (ARF) proteins, forming a heterodimer, suppressing ARF activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aux/IAA proteins contain a potent transcriptional repression domain. |year=2004 |last1=Tiwari |first1=SB |last2=Hagen |first2=G |last3=Guilfoyle |first3=TJ |journal=Plant Cell |volume=16 |pages=533–43 |doi=10.1105/tpc.017384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 it was described how ARFs bind to auxin-response gene elements in promoters of auxin regulated genes, generally activating transcription of that gene when an Aux/IAA protein is not bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ARF1, a transcription factor that binds to auxin response elements. |year=1997 |last1=Ulmasov |first1=T |last2=Hagen |first2=G |last3=Guilfoyle |first3=TJ |journal=Science |volume=276 |pages=1865–68 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5320.1865 |pmid=9188533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IAA inhibits the [[photorespiration|photorespiratory]]-dependent cell death in photorespiratory [[catalase]]  mutants. This suggests a role for auxin signalling in stress tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kerchev P, Muhlenbock P, Denecker J, Morreel K, Hoeberichts FA, van der Kelen K, Vandorpe M, Nguyen L, Audenaert D, van Breusegem F | date = Feb 2015 | title = Activation of auxin signalling counteracts photorespiratory H2O2-dependent cell death | url = | journal = Plant Cell Environ | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 253–65 | pmid = 26317137 | doi=10.1111/pce.12250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacterial physiology===
IAA production is widespread among environmental bacteria that inhabit soils, waters, but also plant and animal hosts. Distribution and [[substrate specificity]] of the involved enzymes suggests these pathways play a role beyond plant-microbe interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patten CL, Blakney AJ, Coulson TJ | date = Nov 2013 | title = Activity, distribution and function of indole-3-acetic acid biosynthetic pathways in bacteria | url = | journal = Crit Rev Microbiol | volume = 39 | issue = 4| pages = 395–415 | doi = 10.3109/1040841X.2012.716819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enterobacter cloacae]] can produce IAA, from aromatic and branched-chain amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parsons CV, Harris DM, Patten CL | date = Sep 2015 | title = Regulation of indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis by branched-chain amino acids in Enterobacter cloacae UW5 | url = | journal = FEMS Microbiol Lett | volume = 362 | issue = 18| pages = fnv153| doi = 10.1093/femsle/fnv153 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungal symbiosis===
Fungi can form a fungal mantle around roots of perennial plants called [[ectomycorrhiza]]. A fungus specific to spruce called [[Tricholoma vaccinum]] was shown to produce IAA from tryptophan and excrete it from its [[hyphae]]. This induced branching in cultures, and enhanced [[Hartig net]] formation. The fungus uses a multidrug and toxic extrusion (MATE) transporter Mte1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krause K, Henke C, Asiimwe T, Ulbricht A, Klemmer S, Schachtschabel D, Boland W, Kothe E | date = Oct 2015 | title = Biosynthesis and Secretion of Indole-3-Acetic Acid and Its Morphological Effects on Tricholoma vaccinum-Spruce Ectomycorrhiza | url = | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 81 | issue = 20| pages = 7003–11 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.01991-15 | pmc = 4579454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into IAA-producing fungi to promote plant growth and protection in sustainable agriculture is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fu SF1 Wei JY, Chen HW, Liu YY, Lu HY, Chou JY | date = Aug 2015 | title = Indole-3-acetic acid: A widespread physiological code in interactions of fungi with other organisms | url = | journal = Plant Signal Behav | volume = 10 | issue = 8| page = e1048052 | doi = 10.1080/15592324.2015.1048052 | pmc = 4623019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Chemically, it can be synthesized by the reaction of [[indole]] with [[glycolic acid]] in the presence of base at 250&amp;nbsp;°C:&lt;ref&gt;{{ OrgSynth | author = Johnson, Herbert E.; Crosby, Donald G. | title = Indole-3-acetic Acid | volume = 44 | pages = 64 | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 654 | year = 1964 | prep = CV5P0654 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:Synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid.png|450px]]

Alternatively the compound has been synthesized by [[Fischer indole synthesis]] using [[Glutamic acid]] and [[Phenylhydrazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Sidney W.|last2=Bullock|first2=Milon W.|title=Synthesis of Indoleacetic Acid from Glutamic Acid and a Proposed Mechanism for the Conversion|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1951|volume=73|issue=6|pages=2754–2755|doi=10.1021/ja01150a094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glutamic acid was converted to the necessary [[aldehyde]] via [[Strecker degradation]].

Many methods for its synthesis have been developed since its original synthesis from indole-3-acetonitrile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cber.19250580917 |title=Synthetische Versuche in der Indol-Gruppe, VI.: Eine neue Synthese von β-Indolyl-alkylaminen |year=1925 |last1=Majima |first1=Rikō |last2=Hoshino |first2=Toshio |journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft (A and B Series) |volume=58 |issue=9 |pages=2042–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and synthetic analogs ==
William Gladstone Tempelman studied substances for growth promotion at [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] Ltd. After 7 years of research he changed the direction of his study to try the same substances at high concentrations in order to stop plant growth. In 1940 he published his finding that IAA killed broadleaf plants within a cereal field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Templeman W. G. |author2=Marmoy C. J. | year = 2008 | title = The effect upon the growth of plants of watering with solutions of plant-growth substances and of seed dressings containing these materials | url = | journal = Annals of Applied Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 453–471 | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-7348.1940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for an acid with a longer half life, i.e. a metabolically and environmentally more stable compound led to [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T), both [[phenoxy herbicide]]s and analogs of IAA. Robert Pokorny an industrial chemist for the C.B. Dolge Company in [[Westport, Connecticut]] published their synthesis in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pokorny Robert | year = 1941 | title = New Compounds. Some Chlorophenoxyacetic Acids | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01851a601?journalCode=jacsat | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 63 | issue = 6| pages = 1768–1768 | doi = 10.1021/ja01851a601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other less expensive synthetic [[auxin]] analogs on the market for use in [[horticulture]] are [[indole-3-butyric acid]] (IBA) and [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|1-naphthaleneacetic acid]] (NAA).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
When sprayed on broad-leaf dicot plants, they induce rapid, uncontrolled growth, eventually killing them. First introduced in 1946, these herbicides were in widespread use in [[agriculture]] by the middle of the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Mammalian toxicity/health effects==
Little research has been conducted on the effects of IAA on humans and toxicity data are limited. No data on human carcinogenic, [[Teratology|teratogenic]], or developmental effects have been created.

IAA is listed in its [[Material safety data sheet|MSDS]] as mutagenic to mammalian [[somatic cell]]s, and possibly carcinogenic based on animal data. It may cause adverse reproductive effects (fetotoxicity) and birth defects based on animal data. No human data as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh-rtecs/NL3010B0.html "1H-Indole-3-acetic acid"] Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS). Page last updated:November 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed as a potential skin, eye, and respiratory irritant, and users are warned not to ingest it. Protocols for ingestion, inhalation, and skin/eye exposure are standard for moderately poisonous compounds and include thorough rinsing in the case of skin and eyes, fresh air in the case of inhalation, and immediately contacting a physician in all cases to determine the best course of action and not to induce vomiting when of ingested. The [[NFPA 704]] health hazard rating for IAA is 2, which denotes a risk of temporary incapacitation with intense or prolonged, but not chronic exposure, and a possibility of residual injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-world.com/site/accounts/masterfiles/MSDS/MS-30631010.pdf "Indole-3-Acetic Acid: Material Safety Data Sheet."] November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental toxicity===
IAA produces [[microcephaly]] in rats during the early stage of cerebral cortex development. IAA decreased the locomotor activities of rat embryos/fetuses; treatment with IAA and analog 1(methyl)-IAA resulted in apoptosis of neuroepithelial cell and significantly decreased brain sizes relative to body weight in embryonic rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2131/jts.30.165 |title=Effect of Indole-3-Acetic Acid Derivatives on Neuroepithelium in Rat Embryos |year=2005 |last1=Furukawa |first1=Satoshi |last2=Usuda |first2=Koji |last3=Abe |first3=Masayoshi |last4=Ogawa |first4=Izumi |journal=The Journal of Toxicological Sciences |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=165–74 |pmid=16141651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immunotoxin===
IAA is an [[apoptosis]]-inducing ligand in mammals. As of 2010, the [[signal transduction pathway]]s are as follows: IAA/HRP activates [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases]] and [[c-Jun N-terminal kinases]].  It induces [[caspase-8]] and [[caspase-9]], which results in [[caspase-3]] activation and [[poly(adp-ribose) polymerases]] cleavage.&lt;ref name=bladder&gt;

In 2002 it had been hypothesized that IAA coupled with [[horseradish peroxidase]] (HRP) could be used in targeted cancer therapy. Radical-IAA molecules would attach to cells marked by HRP and HRP reactive cells would be selectively killed.&lt;ref&gt;Wardman P. Indole-3-acetic acids and horseradish peroxidase: a new prodrug/enzyme combination for targeted cancer therapy. Curr Pharm Des. 2002;8(15):1363-74. Review. {{PMID|12052213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 in vitro experiments proved this concept of IAA as an [[immunotoxin]] when used in preclinical studies of targeted cancer therapy, as it induced apoptosis in bladder&lt;ref name=bladder/&gt; and in hematological malignancies.&lt;ref&gt;Dalmazzo LF, Santana-Lemos BA, Jácomo RH, Garcia AB, Rego EM, da Fonseca LM, Falcão RP.

'''Jean-Marie Klinkenberg'''  (born 8 October 1944) is a Belgian linguist and semiotician, professor at the State University of [[Liège]], born in Verviers ([[Belgium]]) in 1944. Member of the interdisciplinary [[Groupe µ]]. President of the [[visual semiotics|International Association for visual Semiotics]].

== Biography ==

Jean-Marie Klinkenberg, born in 1944 in [[Verviers]] ([[Belgium]]), received his Masters (1967) and his Doctorate (1971) in Romance Philology at the State University of [[Liège]]. He teaches language studies at the [[University of Liège]], focusing on [[rhetoric]] and [[semiotics]]. He also teaches French-language literature (particularly Belgian and Québécois).

His scientific activities focus on two areas: linguistics/semiotics and French-speaking cultures. In the first area, he made his mark in the late 1960s by revitalizing the field of rhetoric as a member of the interdisciplinary team known as the [[Groupe µ|µ Group]]. More recently, he has helped to steer semiotics in a social, cognitivist direction. His writings on semiotics and rhetoric have been translated into 15 or more languages.

In the second field, he has modernized the study of the arts in Belgium by casting them in a social and institutional light, an approach that can be readily transferred to the other French-speaking cultures he has studied (such as [[Quebec]]'s) and by establishing inter-university research programs. He founded and chairs Belgium's Centre d’Études des Lettres Francophones.

He is president of the International Association for [[visual semiotics]].

He is a member of the "Ordre des francophones d'Amérique" ([[Quebec]]) and [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Commandeur des Arts et Lettres]] ([[France]]).

Member of the "[[Académie royale de Belgique]]" (Royal Academy of [[Belgium]]).

'''[[Statistics]]''' is the mathematical science involving the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. A number of specialties have evolved to apply statistical and methods to various disciplines. Certain topics have "statistical" in their name but relate to manipulations of probability distributions rather than to statistical analysis.



*'''[[Actuarial science]]''' is the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in the [[insurance]] and [[finance]] industries.
*'''[[Astrostatistics]]''' is the discipline that applies statistical analysis to the understanding of astronomical data.
*'''[[Biostatistics]]''' is a branch of [[biology]] that studies biological phenomena and observations by means of statistical analysis, and includes [[medical statistics]].
*'''[[Business analytics]]''' is a rapidly developing business process that applies statistical methods to data sets (often very large) to develop new insights and understanding of business performance &amp; opportunities
*'''[[Chemometrics]]''' is the science of relating measurements made on a [[chemistry|chemical]] system or process to the state of the system via application of mathematical or statistical methods.
*'''[[Demography]]''' is the statistical study of all [[population]]s. It can be a very general science that can be applied to any kind of dynamic population, that is, one that changes over time or space.
*'''[[Econometrics]]''' is a branch of [[economics]] that applies statistical methods to the empirical study of economic theories and relationships.
*'''[[Environmental statistics]]''' is the application of statistical methods to [[environmental science]]. Weather, climate, air and water quality are included, as are studies of plant and animal populations.
*'''[[Epidemiology]]''' is the study of factors affecting the health and illness of populations, and serves as the foundation and logic of interventions made in the interest of public health and preventive medicine.
*'''[[Geostatistics]]''' is a branch of [[geography]] that deals with the analysis of data from disciplines such as [[petroleum geology]], [[hydrogeology]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[oceanography]], [[geochemistry]], [[geography]].
*'''[[Machine learning]]''' is the subfield of [[computer science]] that formulates algorithms in order to make predictions from data.
*'''[[Operations research]]''' (or operational research) is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics and formal science that uses methods such as mathematical modeling, statistics, and algorithms to arrive at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex problems.
*'''[[Population ecology]]''' is a sub-field of [[ecology]] that deals with the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].
*'''[[Psychometrics]]''' is the theory and technique of educational and psychological measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits.
*'''[[Quality control]]''' reviews the factors involved in manufacturing and production; it can make use of [[Sampling (statistics)|statistical sampling]] of product items to aid decisions in [[process control]] or in accepting deliveries.
*'''[[Quantitative psychology]]''' is the science of statistically explaining and changing mental processes and behaviors in humans.
*'''[[Reliability engineering]]''' is the study of the ability of a system or component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time
*'''[[Statistical finance]]''', an area of [[econophysics]], is an empirical attempt to shift finance from its [[Normative economics|normative]] roots to a [[positivist]] framework using exemplars from statistical physics with an emphasis on emergent or collective properties of financial markets.
*'''[[Statistical mechanics]]''' is the application of [[probability]] theory, which includes mathematical tools for dealing with large populations, to the field of [[mechanics]], which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force.
*'''[[Statistical physics]]''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[physics]], and uses methods of [[probability]] theory in solving physical problems.
*'''[[Statistical signal processing]]''' utilizes the statistical properties of [[signal]]s to perform signal processing tasks.
*'''[[Statistical thermodynamics]]''' is the study of the microscopic behaviors of [[thermodynamic system]]s using probability theory and provides a molecular level interpretation of thermodynamic quantities such as [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], [[heat]], [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], and [[entropy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4256">The Department of Nutrition is one of six departments at the School of Public Health. While nutrition was always part of the curriculum at the university, the department was initiated when the School of Public Health was begun in 1963.
== Nut Studies==
The Department of Nutrition is notable for its landmark research on the health and nutrition properties of [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Department Chair Dr. Joan Sabaté discovered the link between nut consumption and protection from the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. The outcomes of his research were published in 1993 in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199303043280902&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, findings from a pooled analysis of 25 intervention trials with nuts, compiled by Dr. Sabaté, was published by the [[Archives of Internal Medicine]]. This confirmed the original research and established that the consumption of nuts improves blood lipid levels and provides heart health protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/170/9/821&lt;/ref&gt; The department has conducted research on almonds, peanuts, pecans, walnuts and nuts in general and includes both clinical intervention studies and epidemiological studies.  Results from 19 separate inquiries are available at the department website on their nut studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nutstudies.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vegetarian Research ==
The Department of Nutrition at [[Loma Linda University]] has dedicated extensive research to examining the nutrition and health effects of [[vegetarian nutrition|plant foods]] and plant based diet patterns. Research also includes  assessing the [[safety]], adequacy and optimacy of vegetarian eating patterns as well as assessing the potential impact of animal vs plant foods on [[nutrition]], [[microbial]] contamination and [[sanitary]] concerns, and on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.llu.edu/public-health/nutrition/research.page?&lt;/ref&gt;
Every five years, beginning in 1992, Loma Linda University sponsors the International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition. The 5th congress, held March 4–6, 2008 was attended by over 700 research and health professionals from over 40 countries. Dr. Joan Sabaté has chaired the last two congresses and Nutrition Department faculty have served as chair of the scientific program.  Proceedings from these congresses have been published in the [[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] and are available through the congress website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vegetariannutrition.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Two vegetarian resources have been produced from department research. Dr. Joan Sabaté is editor of the book Vegetarian Nutrition. This book contains expert summaries of various aspects of a [[Vegetarianism|plant-based diet]]. It provides not only ethical, moral, and religious viewpoints from different periods of history but also modern perspectives on health promotion and disease prevention. The department has also produced a [[Vegetarian Diet Pyramid|Vegetarian Food Pyramid]], a 4-page brochure that includes guidelines for healthful vegetarian diets, serving guides and other recommended lifestyle habits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6169">'''Medical Missions for Children''' is an independent, non-profit organization that works to improve health outcomes for our world's most critically ill children by providing individual [[telemedicine]] consultations and implementing education programs focused on narrowing the knowledge gap between healthcare providers in the United States and those in the developing world.  MMC focuses on "transferring medical knowledge from those who have it to those who need it" using a state-of-the-art communications infrastructure in order to touch the lives of more than one million critically ill children each year.

==About==
Medical Missions for Children was founded in 1999 by Frank and Peg Brady.  Its Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network - GTTN - currently serves over 100 countries throughout Latin America/Caribbean, Africa, North America, Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe/Central Asia and the Middle East.

MMC is located on the campus of [[St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. It is a major stakeholder in [[List of tallest buildings in Paterson|The Hamiltonian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hamiltonian |publisher=Garret Mountain Associates |date= |url=http://www.gmanj.com/home.html |accessdate=2014-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121171821/http://www.gmanj.com/home.html |archivedate=2014-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 14-story hotel and conference center projected to open in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = Medical Missions for Children Hilton Doubletree   | publisher = Emporis   | date =    | url = http://www.emporis.com/building/medical-missions-for-children-hilton-doubletree-paterson-nj-usa   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web      | last = Prochilo   | first = Dan   | title = Developer predicts $150M Paterson hotel will be 'very, very busy'   | publisher = Emporis   | date = August 11, 2014   | url = http://www.fios1news.com/newjersey/node/33976#.VIgKLt77-8U   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | last = Ma   | first = Myles   | title = $100 million Paterson hotel to break ground in October   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = August 7, 2014   | url = http://www.nj.com/passaic-county/index.ssf/2014/08/100_million_paterson_hotel_to_break_ground_in_october.html   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Malinconico   | first = Joe   | title = Paterson hotel project at hospital gets $105 million in state funding   | publisher = NorthJersey.com   | date = December 10, 2013   | url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/paterson-hotel-project-at-hospital-gets-105-million-in-state-funding-1.653635   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network==
The Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network (GTTN) comprises several programs:
*The Medical Broadcasting Channel - A 24/7/365 channel airing medical programming via satellite broadcast, [[Internet2]], and IPTV Networks.
*The Telemedicine Outreach Program -  a network of 27 tier-one mentoring hospitals in the United States and Europe linking to hospitals and institutions in more than 100 countries.

This Medical Missions for Children/Paterson, NJ (MMC) should not be confused with Medical Missions for Children (MMFC), a 501(3)(c) charity based in Woburn, MA that sends 13-15 surgical, medical and dental missions around the world each year to care for impoverished children who suffer from cleft deformities, microtia (absence of ear), head and neck abnormalities and severe, untreated burn injuries

==Television Programs==
MMC currently produces four healthcare series, several of which have been broadcast on the [[New Jersey Network]], the predecessor to NJTV, New Jersey's affiliate of [[PBS]].
*Tomorrow's Medicine Today
*Plain Talk About Health
*Take Care
*Healthy U

==The ''Giggles'' Children's Theater==
Located at St. Joseph's Children's Hospital, the ''Giggles'' Children's Theater (''Giggles'') draws its curtains twice each week to bring the healing powers of laughter through the performing arts to hospitalized children in Paterson.  Each performance is broadcast live on the hospital's closed-circuit TV system so that no child is excluded due to sickness or incapacity. Each performance is also recorded and rebroadcast so that 10 shows per week are offered on the hospital's Giggles TV channel.

In April 2007 a second ''Giggles'' theater opened at The Children's Inn located at the campus of the [[National Institutes of Health]].

''MoneyForce''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moneyforce.org.uk MoneyForce]&lt;/ref&gt; is a programme that aims to improve the [[financial capability]] of the [[UK Armed Forces]] by providing money guidance to all those serving in the military and their families.

The ethos and branding is built around the concept of getting 'MoneyFit' with MoneyForce and the MoneyForce website is fronted by former Olympic gold medallist [[Dame Kelly Holmes]].

Comprising online resources and briefings at military bases across the UK, the programme is delivered for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] by the [[Royal British Legion]]. Funding comes from the [[Standard Life]] Charitable Trust, and some of the online content is provided by the [[Money Advice Service]].

The programme was officially launched&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uy9F7wWNqU MoneyForce launch event]&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2013 by [[Mark Francois]], the [[Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans]], at the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] in Woolwich.

Development of the MoneyForce programme was overseen by [[Bill Rollo|General Sir Bill Rollo]].

'''Mustahabb''' ({{Lang-ar|مستحبّ|lit=recommended}}) is an [[Islamic term]] referring to recommended, favoured or [[virtue|virtuous]] actions.

Mustahabb actions are those whose status of approval in Islamic law (''[[ahkam]]'') falls between ''[[mubah]]'' (neither encouraged nor discouraged) and ''[[wajib]]'' (compulsory). One definition is "duties recommended, but not essential; fulfilment of which is rewarded, though they may be neglected without punishment".&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Levy, ''The Social Structure of Islam'', p.&amp;nbsp;202&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms of ''mustahabb'' include ''masnun'' and ''mandub''. The opposite of ''mustahabb'' is ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged).

==Examples==
There are thousands of mustahabb acts,&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Colin|title=Islam: The Basics|publisher=Routledge|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/?id=utxkAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Mustahabb+example#v=onepage&amp;q=Mustahabb%20example&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2014|isbn=9781134296910|date=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: 

* [[As-Salamu Alaykum]] (a traditional Islamic [[greeting]],(the islamic greeting is FARD on the believers) Arabic for "peace be upon you") 
* [[Sadaqah]] (charity outside of [[zakat]])
* [[Umrah]]
* two Rakat before Fajr
* tayyitul masjid (two Rakat when entering the mosque); some scholars hold it to be fard due to certain evidences and Allah knows best.
* salatul witr
One must know that mustahabb are acts that increase or bring reward, but there is no sin if left off.

National Solar Thermal Test Facility
During the late 1970s, rising fuel costs and the demand for a cleaner environment gave impetus to advance technology which used solar energy to create electricity.  Studies identified the central receiver concept as having high potential to generate electricity on a large scale.  The United States government initiated support through the [[National Science Foundation]] [[Research Applied to National Needs]] (RANN) program in 1972 which was eventually funded by the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]].  Six central receiver pilot plants were constructed including the 5 MW (thermal) test facility at [[Sandia National Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, Patricia Falcone, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, "A Handbook for Solar Central Receiver Design." SAND 86-8009 Unlimited Release. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility overview==

===Heliostat field===
[[Image:NSTTF heliostat field.jpg|thumb|right|The [[heliostat]] field at Sandia National. Labs.]]
The heliostat field has 218 individual heliostats. This capability directly supports the SunShot goals by providing flux levels of greater than 250 W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and total power in excess of 6 MWt. Each heliostat has two motors and two drives (one azimuth and one elevation), one 480 V power box, one electronics box, and one control box and associated cabling. The total reflective area on each heliostat is 37 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reflectivity on the recently replaced facets is 96%.

===Solar tower===
[[Image:NSTTF SolarTower Sandia National Labs.jpg|thumb|right|The [[solar power tower]] field at Sandia National. Labs.]]
The tower is a 61&amp;nbsp;m (200&amp;nbsp;ft) high concrete structure with three test locations on the north side and the top of the tower. The tower can support testing for CSP experiments and large-scale, high-flux materials samples. The equipment in the tower includes a 100-ton capacity elevating module for lifting experiments to the top of the tower, internal cranes for receiver fabrication, water glycol cooling systems and air coolers to provide heat removal from experiments, air compressors, control valves, generators, uninterruptible power supplies, piping systems, and pressure-relief valves.

===Molten salt test loop===
The molten salt test loop directly supports the SunShot goals by providing development for thermal energy storage costs ≤$15/kWhth and by allowing greater collection efficiencies and higher-temperature operation for linear Fresnel and trough systems through utilization of molten salt HTF. The facility also provides a means of performing accelerated lifetime testing on components, thus reducing the risk of the technology. Though operating below 600&amp;nbsp;°C, many of the lessons learned at this facility will be directly applicable to molten salt systems operating in the SunShot temperature range ≥ 650&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11934 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: Molten Salt Test Loop |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218180903/http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11934 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dish test facility===
This area of the site allows industry partners to install full-scale solar dishes for long-term reliability testing and evaluation. There are currently ten dishes from [[Stirling Energy Systems]] and six [[Infinia]] dishes at this location. The site also includes two SNL-developed solar dishes that are available for research. Solar dishes can be used for the high-temperature portions of the SunShot goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11958 |title=Sandia National Laboratories: Dish Test Facility |publisher=Energy.sandia.gov |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218181207/http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=11958 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the social phenomenon, see [[social occultation]].}}[[File:Occultation.jpg|thumb|200px|In this July 1997 still frame captured from video, the bright star [[Aldebaran]] has just reappeared on the dark limb of the waning [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] in this predawn occultation.]]

An '''occultation''' is an event that occurs when one object is hidden by another object that passes between it and the observer. The term is often used in [[astronomy]], but can also refer to any situation in which an object in the foreground blocks from view (occults) an object in the background. In this general sense, occultation applies to the visual scene observed from low-flying aircraft (or [[computer-generated imagery]]) when foreground objects obscure distant objects dynamically, as the scene changes over time.

== Occultations by the Moon ==
[[File:Occultation.ogv|thumb|Occultation of a star by the Moon]]

The term occultation is most frequently used to describe those relatively frequent occasions when the [[Moon]] passes in front of a [[star]] during the course of its orbital motion around the Earth. Since the Moon, with an [[angular speed]] with respect to the stars of 0.55 [[Minute of arc#Symbols, abbreviations and subdivisions|arcsec]]/s or 2.7 µrad/s, has a very thin atmosphere and stars have an [[Angular diameter#Use in astronomy|angular diameter]] of at most 0.057 [[arcsecond]]s or 0.28 µrad, a star that is occulted by the Moon will disappear or reappear in 0.1 seconds or less on the Moon's edge, or limb. Events that take place on the Moon's dark limb are of particular interest to observers, because the lack of glare allows these occultations to more easily be observed and timed.

The Moon's orbit is inclined to the [[ecliptic]] (see [[orbit of the Moon]]), and any stars with an ecliptic latitude of less than about 6.5 degrees may be occulted by it. There are three first magnitude stars that are sufficiently close to the ecliptic that they may be occulted by the Moon and by planets – [[Regulus]], [[Spica]] and [[Antares]].&lt;ref name="planets"&gt;{{cite web |title=Occultations of bright stars by planets between 0 and 4000 |url=http://www.pierpaoloricci.it/dati/occpiastelle_eng.htm |accessdate=2005-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occultations of [[Aldebaran]] are presently only possible by the Moon, because the planets pass Aldebaran to the north. Neither planetary nor lunar occultations of [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] are currently possible. However, in the far future, occultations of Pollux will be possible, as they were in the far past. Some [[deep-sky object]]s, such as the [[Pleiades]], can also be occulted by the Moon.

[[File:OccultJupiter 6-7-2005 6-07PM Nelson NZ.jpg|thumb|200px|Jupiter (the bright object in the upper right) a few minutes before being occulted by the Moon on 16 June 2005]]

Within a few kilometres of the edge of an occultation's predicted path, referred to as its northern or southern limit, an observer may see the star intermittently disappearing and reappearing as the irregular limb of the Moon moves past the star, creating what is known as a [[grazing lunar occultation]]. From an observational and scientific standpoint, these "grazes" are the most dynamic and interesting of lunar occultations.

The accurate timing of lunar occultations is performed regularly by (primarily amateur) astronomers. Lunar occultations timed to an accuracy of a few tenths of a second have various scientific uses, particularly in refining our knowledge of lunar topography. Photoelectric analysis of lunar occultations have also discovered some stars to be very close visual or spectroscopic [[binary star|binaries]]. Some angular diameters of stars have been measured by timing of lunar occultations, which is useful for determining [[effective temperature]]s of those stars. Early radio astronomers found occultations of radio sources by the Moon valuable for determining their exact positions, because the long wavelength of radio waves limited the resolution available through direct observation. This was crucial for the unambiguous identification of the radio source [[3C 273]] with the optical quasar and its jet,&lt;ref name="HazardMackeyShimmins63" /&gt; and a [[fundamental astronomy|fundamental]] prerequisite for [[Maarten Schmidt]]'s discovery of the cosmological nature of [[quasars]].

Several times during the year, someone on Earth can usually observe the Moon occulting a planet.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm this site] for information.&lt;/ref&gt; Since planets, unlike stars, have significant angular sizes, lunar occultations of planets will create a narrow zone on Earth from which a partial occultation of the planet will occur. An observer located within that narrow zone could observe the planet's disk partly blocked by the slowly moving moon. The same mechanic can be seen with the Sun, where observers on Earth will view it as a [[solar eclipse]]. Therefore, a total solar eclipse is effectively the same event as the Moon occulting the Sun.

== Occultation by planets ==

{{main|Planetary transits and occultations}}

Stars may also be occulted by planets. Occultations of bright stars are rare. In 1959, [[Venus]] occulted [[Regulus]], and the next occultation of a bright star (also Regulus by Venus) will be in 2044.&lt;ref name="planets"/&gt; [[Uranus]]'s rings were first discovered when that planet occulted a star in 1977. On 3 July 1989, [[Saturn]] passed in front of the 5th magnitude star [[Sagittarius (constellation)|28 Sagittarii]]. [[Pluto]] occulted stars in 1988, 2002, and 2006, allowing its tenuous atmosphere to be studied via [[atmospheric limb sounding]].

In rare cases, one planet can pass in front of another. If the nearer planet appears larger than the more distant one, the event is called a mutual planetary occultation.

=={{anchor|Occultations by asteroids}} Occultations by minor planets ==

An [[#top|occultation]] occurs when a [[minor planet]] (an [[asteroid]], [[Distant minor planet|distant object]], or [[dwarf planet]]) passes in front of a [[star]] (occults a star), temporarily blocking its light (as seen from [[Earth]]).&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; These occultations are useful for measuring the size and position of minor planets much more precisely than can be done by any other means. A cross-sectional profile of the shape of an asteroid can even be determined if a number of observers at different, nearby, locations observe the occultation. Occultations have also been used to estimate the diameter of [[trans-Neptunian object]]s such as {{mpl-|55636|2002 TX|300}}, [[28978 Ixion|Ixion]], and [[20000 Varuna|Varuna]].

In addition, mutual occultation/eclipsing events can occur between a minor planet and its [[Minor-planet moon|satellite]]. A [[Minor-planet moon#List of minor planets with moons|large number of these minor-planet moons]] have been discovered analyzing the photometric [[light curve]]s of rotating  minor planets and detecting a second, superimposed brightness variation, from which an [[orbital period]] for the satellite (secondary), and a secondary-to-primary diameter-ratio (for the [[Binary asteroid|binary system]]) can often be derived.

==== Asteroids ====
* On 12 March 2009 there were 8 asteroid occulations, including [[85 Io]], [[247 Eukrate]], [[1585 Union]], [[201 Penelope]], [[70 Panopaea]], [[980 Anacostia]], [[2448 Sholokhov]], [[1746 Brouwer]], and [[191 Kolga]]. Any one of these would be expected to occult at a time and place on the globe, at a certain magnitude, and with a certain star.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;
* According to the 1998 European Asteroidal Occultation Results from Euraster, [[39 Laetitia]] was observed by over 38 observatories in one occultation on 3 March 1998, which resulted in many chords being determined.&lt;ref name=euraster /&gt; The star [[Regulus]] was occulted by the asteroid [[163 Erigone]] in the early morning of 20 March 2014.&lt;ref name=IOTA2006 /&gt; This was the brightest occultation of an asteroid ever predicted to occur over a populated area. As the [[main belt asteroid]] passed in front of the star its 67-mile-wide (100&amp;nbsp;km) shadow swept across [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and Suffolk counties, all of New York City and the [[Hudson River Valley]], with the center of the shadow path following a line roughly connecting New York City, White Plains, Newburgh, Oneonta, Rome and Pulaski before crossing into Canada near Belleville and [[North Bay, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=IOTA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Solex/&gt; Bad weather obscured the occultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://occultations.org/regulus2014/ |title=Volunteer observers invited to time the March 20, 2014 Occultation of Regulus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distant objects ====
* Preliminary results of a 6 November 2010 occultation by the dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] of a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 17 [http://www.wikisky.org/?ra=1.6527583999999989&amp;de=-4.353371999999999&amp;zoom=10&amp;show_grid=1&amp;show_constellation_lines=1&amp;show_constellation_boundaries=1&amp;show_const_names=0&amp;show_galaxies=1&amp;show_box=1&amp;box_ra=1.6527584&amp;box_de=-4.353372&amp;box_width=50&amp;box_height=50&amp;img_source=DSS2 star] in the [[constellation]] of [[Cetus]] placed an upper limit on Eris's diameter of 2320&amp;nbsp;km, making it almost the same size as Pluto.&lt;ref name=occult /&gt; Due to their slower movement through the night sky, occultations by TNOs are far less common than by asteroids in the main-belt.
* The dwarf planet [[Haumea]] was observed in a stellar transit on 21 January 2017, identifying a ring.
* On 3 June 2017, a star was occulted by the Kuiper belt object {{mpl|2014 MU|69}}, the first such occultation detected.&lt;ref name="First KBO Occultation" /&gt; The multi-faceted campaign involved cooperation from the Argentinian government (including local governments – a major highway was closed for two hours, and street lights were turned off, in order to preclude light pollution), three spacecraft, 24 portable ground-based telescopes, and NASA's SOFIA airborne observatory in "the most challenging stellar occultation in the history of astronomy," in an effort spanning six months. &lt;ref name="NASA's New Horizons Team Strikes Gold in Argentina"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20170719 |title=NASA's New Horizons Team Strikes Gold in Argentina |date=2017-07-19 |website=New Horizons: NASA's Mission to Pluto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Double occultations ==

The Moon or another celestial body can occult multiple celestial bodies at the same time. Because of its relatively large [[angular diameter]], the Moon at any given time occults an indeterminate number of stars. However, an event when the Moon occults two bright objects (e.g. two planets or a bright star and a planet) simultaneously is extremely rare and can be seen only from a small part of the world. The last event of such type was on 23 April 1998 when the Moon occulted Venus and Jupiter for observers on [[Ascension Island]].

== Artificial occultations ==

The ''Big Occulting Steerable Satellite (BOSS)'' was a proposed [[satellite]] that would work in conjunction with a [[telescope]] to detect [[planet]]s around distant stars. The satellite consists of a large, very lightweight sheet, and a set of maneuvering thrusters and navigation systems. It would maneuver to a position along the line of sight between the telescope and a nearby star. The satellite would thereby block the radiation from the star, permitting the orbiting planets to be observed.&lt;ref name="Copi-2000" /&gt;

The proposed satellite would have a dimension of {{convert|70|x|70|m|ft}}, a mass of about 600&amp;nbsp;kg, and maneuver by means of an [[ion drive]] engine in combination with using the sheet as a light sail. Positioned at a distance of 100,000&amp;nbsp;km from the telescope, it would block more than 99.998% of the starlight.

There are two possible configurations of this satellite. The first would work with a [[space telescope]], most likely positioned near the [[Earth]]'s {{L2}} [[Lagrangian point]]. The second would place the satellite in a highly elliptical orbit about the Earth, and work in conjunction with a ground telescope. At the [[apogee]] of the orbit, the satellite would remain relatively stationary with respect to the ground, allowing longer exposure times.

An updated version of this design is called the [[Starshade]], which uses a [[sunflower]]-shaped [[coronagraph]] disc. A comparable proposal was also made for a satellite to occult bright X-ray sources, called an ''X-ray Occulting Steerable Satellite'' or XOSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hea.cwru.edu/xoss/ |title=The X-ray Occulting Steerable Satellite (XOSS) |publisher=CASE |accessdate=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}
An '''ore dock''' is a large structure used for loading [[ore]] (typically from railway cars or [[Ore jenny|ore jennies]]) onto ships, which then carry the ore to steelworks or to transshipment points. Most known ore docks were constructed near [[iron mines]] on the upper [[Great Lakes]] and served the lower Great Lakes. Ore docks still in existence are typically about {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|80|ft|m}} high, and vary from {{convert|900|ft|m}}  to {{convert|2400|ft|m}} in length. They are commonly constructed from wood, steel, [[reinforced concrete]], or combinations of these materials.&lt;ref name="sia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siahq.org/conference/duluth/papersessions/abstracts.html|work=ABSTRACTS from Paper Sessions of the [[Society for Industrial Archeology|SIA]] Annual Conference held on June 3, 2000 in Duluth, MN|title=Iron ore docks of the Great Lakes|author= Cooleybeck, Patrick — Moshe Safdie &amp; Associates, Somerville, MA|accessdate=2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are commonly used for loading [[bulk ore carrier]]s with high mass, low-value ore, such as [[iron ore]], in raw or [[taconite]] form.

==Construction ==
Ore docks are typically long, high structures, with a railway track or tracks along the top and a number of "pockets" into which ore is unloaded from railcars, typically by gravity. Each pocket has a chute that can be lowered to discharge the ore into the hold of a ship berthed alongside. The use of pockets and chutes allows the dock itself to be loaded with ore before it is transferred into the [[cargo ship|freighter]].&lt;ref name="marqCountry"&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.marquettecountry.org/ore.php|title=Check out Marquette's Iron Ore Docks|accessdate=2008-01-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214111324/http://www.marquettecountry.org/ore.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The docks' storage bins or pockets typically are wider at the top than the bottom, and they lead to movable steel chutes. These chutes project out over the water at a slight angle from the sides of the docks. The hinged chutes, which are lowered to drop ore from the pockets into ships, are located at twelve-foot intervals over the length of the dock.

This spacing is not coincidental, as the docks and the [[lake freighter|lakers]] they could load evolved together, and laker hatch spacing is typically 12, or {{convert|24|ft|m|sing=on}} on center.

==History==

Since the late 1800s, ore docks have been a common sight in many [[Lake Superior]] ports of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]] and especially [[Michigan]]. Rich [[iron ore]] deposits were first discovered in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] in the 1840s and remain a significant source of wealth for the state. By the 1890s, Michigan was the largest supplier of iron ore in the United States. Railroads would haul ore from the mines to the ore docks on the [[Great Lakes]] in places such as [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]] and [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]], where the cargo would be loaded onto ore freighters and transported to the rest of the country.

Iron ore was first discovered in Michigan's [[Upper Peninsula]] on September 19, 1844, by [[William A. Burt]], who was then employed to lead a party engaged in surveying the Upper Peninsula on behalf of the United States government. Variations in the readings of magnetic compasses employed suggested that something was disturbing the local magnetic fields, and, on investigation of part of the [[Marquette Iron Range]], ore was found as close to the surface as just below the sod.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.ulib.csuohio.edu/SpecColl/glihc/articles/carrhist.html|title=History of the Iron Ore Trade|work= 1910 Annual Report of the Lake Carriers' Association|accessdate=2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of this find was ongoing throughout the 1840s and early 1850s. The initial focus was on producing iron locally, as shipping was difficult. Early shipping attempts using [[mule]] teams, [[plank road]]s, and barrels loaded as deck cargo on [[schooner]]s required transshipment after [[portage|portaging]] the [[St. Marys River (Michigan–Ontario)|St. Marys River]] rapids, and costs proved prohibitive. However, as the mines continued to develop and railways were put in place, the volume of ore increased, far outstripping the local production capacity. In 1855, the [[Soo Locks]] opened, and the volume of ore shipped increased, with the first year seeing 1447 tons on various brigs and schooners. The first dock specifically for the ore trade was built in Marquette in 1857. It was flat rather than elevated, and the vessels were loaded with wheelbarrows.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"/&gt;

By 1860, the volume of ore shipped through the Soo Locks had increased to 114,401 tons, only to fall again to 49,909 tons in 1861 after the [[American Civil War]] broke out. However, by 1862, an additional wooden dock had been constructed at Marquette, this time featuring an elevated railway trestle for ore jennies to discharge ore into pockets. In 1911 another iron ore loading dock was built, where the wooden frame work was replaced with a concrete and steel frame work.  The new iron ore loading dock at Marquette was 1200 feet long; 75 feet high; and 60 feet wide.  Four railroad tracks ran across the top and there was storage space inside the bottom concrete part for 60,000 tons of iron ore.  The new iron ore loading dock incorporated a concrete bottom half with and a light steel frame work on top; doing away with the wooden supports used in previous iron ore docks.  While more expensive than previous iron ore loading docks, that used both iron and wood frame works, the builders claimed the new construction would hold up far longer than the old construction method.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-t0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA878&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y4zsT9OSGMriqAGU1PW8BQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Concrete Steel Iron Ore Docks"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1911, p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt; Schooners now started to feature regularly spaced hatch covers, speeding up loading.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"/&gt; However [[steamship|steamer]]s of the day were not well adapted for bulk cargoes such as iron ore. They did not have hatches through their decks. Instead they had gangways through the sides. So ore shipments were loaded via wheelbarrows through the gangways. The docks had provisions for this by having a flat surface on one side and moorings directly under the pockets for schooners to receive the ore directly, while steamers moored on the opposite side of the dock.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"/&gt; However, unloading was still a laborious hand-powered affair.

During this period, the iron ore trade was dwarfed by the grain and lumber trade. For example, grain received at the port of [[Buffalo, New York]], alone in 1866 were about 1,500,000 tons, and the lumber received at [[Chicago, Illinois]], were about 400,000 tons, whereas the received amount of iron ore at all [[Lake Erie]] ports amounted to only 278,976 gross tons.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"/&gt; Marquette remained the only port on [[Lake Superior]] that shipped iron ore until 1876.
&lt;ref name="MarqMarit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mqtinfo.org/history0006.asp |title=Maritime History |work=Marquette County Community Information site |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Civil War, advancement was rapid. The [[Cleveland-Cliffs|Cleveland Iron Mining Company]]'s dock was {{convert|30|ft|m}} above the lake level and was originally built with 29 schooner pockets and 6 steam boat pockets but, by 1872, had been extended an additional {{convert|350|ft|m}}, providing 54 additional pockets. During the 1873 season, the total tonnage of iron ore shipped from the port of Marquette was 1,175,000 tons.&lt;ref name="MarqMarit"/&gt;

As additional ranges (the Gogebic, Menominee East, and Menominee West) began to be developed, with the acceleration of the US as an industrial power, other (primarily Lake Superior) ports also constructed ore docks. For example, [[Ashland, Wisconsin]], the natural port for the Gogebic Range, had three docks by 1916, the first built by the Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western Railway in 1884-1885. It was {{convert|1400|ft|m}} long, with 234 pockets, and four tracks on the dock, and could hold 25,000 tons of ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsincentral.net/Culture041907.html |title=Ashland's iron ore docks, a fascinating history |work=Wisconsin Central |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural port for the Menominee East range was [[Escanaba, Michigan]]; the first docks there were built in 1865.

By 1884, locomotives played a vital part in hauling ore from the mines to the docks. The pockets and chutes were filled using the hopper type ore cars. In 1889, the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway operated a dock with 284 pockets. The railroads also provided alternate transportation for people, goods and eventually, iron ore.

The length and capacity of docks corresponded with the capacity of the ore freighters which they were designed to accommodate. As ore carriers increased in height and width, higher pocket openings were required and it was necessary to construct new docks and rebuild old ones. In 1867, vessels carried ore cargoes of 550 tons. The first steel ore freighters introduced in the 1880s had a capacity of 2,500 tons. By 1898, ships were carrying 6,400 tons and by 1938, 15,000 tons.

The demand for iron ore grew, faster dispatch of vessels was necessary and larger cars and the number of more powerful locomotives for transporting the ore from mines to the docks increased with improved technology. These developments caused the old wooden Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway ore dock built in 1898 to become obsolete. A new dock was constructed by the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad Company of reinforced concrete and steel in 1911 and 1912 in the Upper Harbor near Presque Isle Park. This dock is {{convert|75|ft|m}} high, {{convert|1200|ft|m}} long and has 200 pockets with a total capacity of 50,000 tons of ore pellets. By 1929, more than one and one half times the combined yearly tonnage of the Panama and Suez Canals passed through the Soo Locks. The dock is still in use today.

Activity also continued in Marquette's Lower Harbor. The Duluth, South Short and Atlantic Railway, in order to remain competitive, completed construction of a new dock in 1932. This dock was constructed of steel and concrete, {{convert|85.5|ft|m}} high, {{convert|969|ft|m}} long, with 150 pockets. The total capacity was 47,500 tons. The D.S.S. &amp; A. Railway merged with other companies to form the Soo Line. The dock remained in operation until the late 1960s when a decrease in demand for iron ore forced it to close. In 1987, the Soo Line sold its Lake States Division to Wisconsin Central Ltd. and the ownership passed to the latter railroad where it remains today.

==Today==
Many docks have been torn down or abandoned, but a few remain in operation. The Lake Superior &amp; Ishpeming dock, one of the docks at [[Marquette, Michigan]], recently loaded its 400 millionth ton of ore after 90 years of service.&lt;ref name="miningJournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/49.html?nav=6|title=Ore dock marks 94-year milestone|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other dock, built later by [[Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott]] for the [[Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway]] (DSS&amp;A) was taken out of service in 1971. The largest dock of the type in the world exist in Superior, Wisconsin as part of BNSF's Allouez Taconite Facility, however, these docks have been abandoned since 1978. Two ore docks, one in Duluth, MN and one in Two Harbors, MN, are still in service  and operated by Canadian National Railway.

'''Permissible stress design'''  is a design philosophy used by [[civil engineer]]s. The designer ensures that the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] developed in a structure due to service loads do not exceed the [[elastic limit]]. This limit is usually determined by ensuring that stresses remain within the limits through the use of [[factor of safety|factors of safety]].

The permissible stress design approach has generally been replaced internationally by [[limit state design]] (also known as ultimate stress design, or in USA, Load and Resistance Factor Design, LRFD) as far as [[structural engineering]] is considered, except for some isolated cases.

In USA construction, allowable stress design (ASD) has not yet been completely superseded by limit state design except in the case of [[Suspension bridges]], which changed from allowable stress design to limit state design in the 1960s. Wood, steel, and other materials are still frequently designed using allowable stress design, although LRFD is probably more commonly taught in the USA university system.

The '''Piganino''', a [[portmanteau]] of ''pig'' and piano, is a conjectural [[musical instrument]] using a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] as to produce [[pitch (music)|sound]] from [[pig]]s by poking them. Satirical use includes further portmanteaus as in {{lang-de|Schweineorgel}} (pig organ), {{lang-fr|l’orgue à cochons}}, and "Hog [[Harmonium]]", (a play on "[[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]]") "Swineway", or (a play on "[[pianoforte]]") "Porko Forte"  in English.

== Background ==
[[Louis XI of France]] was said to have challenged '''Abbé de Baigne''' to develop such an instrument, believing that it was impossible to do so.&lt;ref name=ann&gt; Jean Bouchet: ''Les annales d’Aquitaine.'' Enguilbert de Marnef, Poitiers 1557, Blatt 164. [https://books.google.com/books?id=989TAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA18-PR47 (Scan)]. Cited in [[Nathaniel Wanley]] and also in [[Pierre Bayle]]: ''[[Dictionnaire historique et critique]]''. [http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/dicos/baylepublic.pl?objectid=1944 (Scan)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Sandys (antiquarian)|Sandys, William]] and Forster, Andrew (1864).

John Russel Smith. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbé, a well known constructor, anecdotally accepted the order against payment. The instrument was a variant of an organ using a keyboard to pick the pigs, which were sorted sizewise.&lt;ref name=ann/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin|Weckerlin, Jean-Baptiste]] (1877). ''Musiciana, extraits d'ouvrages rare ou bizarre'', p.349. Paris: Garnier Freres.

{{Quote|That brutal monarch, Louis XI of France, is said to have constructed, with the assistance of the Abbé de Baigne, an instrument designated a "pig organ," for the production of natural sounds. The master of the royal music, having made a very large and varied assortment of swine, embracing specimens of all breeds and ages, these were carefully ''voiced'', and placed in order, according to their several tones and semitones, and so arranged that a key-board communicated with them, severally and individually, by means of rods ending in sharp spikes. In this way a player, by touching any note, could instantly sound a corresponding note in nature, and was enabled to produce at will either natural melody or harmony! The result is said to have been striking, but not very grateful to human ears.&lt;ref name="Vocal"&gt;Crofts 1885, cf. also Quignard 1996. Cited in Bhagwati, Sandeep (2013).

== Striped pigs in the US ==

The American [[quickstep]] song ''La Piganino'' mocked Italian influences on amateur music and popular culture in the 19th-century US. Beside lack of taste and vocal variety, the tendency to Italianize the names of all things chic and musical was lampooned.&lt;ref&gt;David Tatham: ''The Lure of the Striped Pig: The Illustration of Popular Music in America, 1820–1870.'' Imprint Society, Barre (MS) 1973, {{ISBN|0-87636-051-7}}, S. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon anticipates the surrealistic machinery of [[Rube Goldberg]]. The 19th century played on various allegations, besides Piganino, further nicknames used for the fictitious instrument were "Hog Harmonium", "Swineway" or "Porko Forte".&lt;ref name="cri"&gt;Mary Babson Fuhrer: ''A Crisis of Community: The Trials and Transformation of a New England Town, 1815–1848.'' The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-4696-1550-9}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Just as understatement of the ludicrous is a standard mode of caricature, so too is overstatement, as we see in this happy example. Burlesquing genteel taste, amateur vocalists, and the vogue for Italianizing the names of all things with musical associations, this cartoon also anticipates the ingenious and surrealistic machines of Rube Goldberg. We may suppose that in more than a few parlors "La Piganino" was slipped onto the music rack as a hint to the vocalist when the evening reached that point at which guests' ears began to droop.&lt;ref&gt;David, Tatham (1973). Quoted at "[http://www.porkopolis.org/pig_artist/piganino/ The Piganino]", ''Porkopolis.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The background was a [[commons]]-related conflict: poor farmers tended to let their pigs roam freely, feeding on what the rich did not use, whereas the rich preferred towns and property to be tidily divided.&lt;ref name="cri"/&gt;  The striped pig was used to represent such untidiness in general and drinking men specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachushistory.org/second-great-awakening-age-reform/resources/death-striped-pig|title=Death on the Striped Pig|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piganino and related cartoons insofar referred to uppity and wannabee neighbors and their porcine conflicts with others.&lt;ref name="cri"/&gt;  In parallel, the ''[[Schweinfurt]]er Anzeiger'' as of 1873 had renewed interest on the French historical origin of the Schweineorgel.&lt;ref&gt;Zwei seltsame Instrumente, Franconia: Unterhaltungsblatt zum "Schweinfurter Anzeiger". Reichardt, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Le Libertin'' ==
In the film ''[[The Libertine (2000 film)|Le Libertin]]'' (2000), the philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] is depicted as a screwball eccentric, trying to have his forbidden ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' printed under the eyes of Catholic fanatics. The film is staged in the chateau of a crazy Baron, loosely based on the [[Baron d'Holbach]]. In reality, the Baron d'Holbach was a devoted atheist and important sponsor and contributor to the Encyclopédie. The film shows him as an adversary of Diderot and inventor of a large variety of funny machinery. The noise of a Piganino, one of the inventions, is being used to hide the printing of the forbidden encyclopaedia in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Biographische Fiktionen: das Paradigma Denis Diderot im interkulturellen Vergleich (1765 - 2005), Heidi Denzel de Tirado Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further use ==
In German, ''Schweineorgel'' has also been used as a nickname for the [[accordion]] or [[harmonium]], as those instruments were deemed rural and not appropriate for music on academic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horniger.de/schweineorgel/texte/wasist_d.html|title=Was ist eine SCHWEINEORGEL ?|author=Rainer Siebert|date=1 July 2002|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Das Akkordeon: Schweineorgel oder Avantgarde Instrument? Christina Appert Kantonsschule Wil, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s [[cat organ|Katzenklavier]] uses a similar concept with cats. This sort of caricature was often used when new music styles came around or were adopted in musical realms that had not dealt with them previously. The [[cat organ]], a similar instrument using cats, is used in stories which criticize the cruelty of royalty.

[[Monty Python]]'s "Musical Mice" uses mice instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9nGyPz9uT0 Monty Python - mouse organ sketch] (YouTube). ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'', "Arthur Ewing and His Musical Mice," Season One, Episode Two.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6299">{{For|the belief in growth|Productivism}}

'''Producerism''' is an ideology which holds that those members of society engaged in the production of tangible wealth are of greater benefit to society than, for example, [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] who inherit their wealth and station.

==History==
Robert Ascher traces the history of producerism back as early as the [[Diggers]] in the 1640s. This outlook was not widespread among artisans of the time because they owed their livelihoods to the patronage of the aristocracy, but by the time of the [[American Revolution]], the producerist view was dominant among American artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Ascher, Robert, "Producerism is consciousness of class," ''Organized labor and American politics : 1894-1994 : the labor-liberal alliance'', Albany : State Univ. of New York Press, 1998, pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosanne Currarino identifies two varieties of producerism in the mid-19th Century: "proprietary producerism," which is popular among self-employed farmers and urban artisans, and "industrial producerism," which spoke to wage-laborers and is identified in particular with the [[Knights of Labor]] and the rise of [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Currarino, Roseanne, ''The Labor Question in America: Economic Democracy in the Gilded Age'', University of Illinois Press, 2011, pp. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

For some commentators, the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, led by [[Eugene V. Debs]], was a high-water mark in the history of American producerism.&lt;ref&gt;Stromquist, Shelton, "The crisis of 1894 and the legacies of producerism, ''The Pullman Strike and the crisis of the 1890s : essays on labor and politics'', Urbana, Ill. [u.a.] University of Illinois Press 1999, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Currarino, Roseanne, ''The Labor Question in America: Economic Democracy in the Gilded Age'', University of Illinois Press, 2011, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westbrook, Robert B., ''Democratic hope : pragmatism and the politics of truth'', Ithaca, N.Y : Cornell University Press, 2005, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, producerism was historically influential in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], especially its [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] wing, until the early 20th century, pitting "the many against the few" - i.e. the working and middle classes against the landed aristocracy, expressed in support of ideas such as the [[Single tax|single land tax]] advocated by [[Georgist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Anthony |date=1 April 2011 |title=The Political Life of Josiah C. Wedgwood: Land, Liberty and Empire, 1872-1943 |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1065 |journal=[[Reviews in History]]|access-date=29 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day producerism==
Producerism has seen a contemporary revival, sparked by popular opposition to the machinations of globalized [[financial capital]] and large, politically connected corporations. Critics of producerism see a correlation between producerist views, and views that are antagonistic toward lower income people and immigrants, such as [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]. These critics see producerism as analogous to [[populism]].&lt;ref name=Berlet&gt;{{Citation |last=Berlet |first=Chip |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Matthew N. |last2=Lyons |year=2000 |title=Right-wing populism in America: Too close for comfort |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=1-57230-562-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Betz&gt;{{Citation |last=Betz |first=Hans-Georg |year=1994 |title=Radical Right-wing Populism in Western Europe |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-08390-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of politicians or groups that are cited by these critics include the [[Reform Party of the United States of America]], [[Ross Perot]], [[Pat Buchanan]], and [[Lou Dobbs]], as well as [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in [[France]], [[Björn Höcke]] in [[Germany]] and similar dissident politicians across Europe.&lt;ref name=Betz/&gt;

==Religion and social issues==
{{cite check|date=December 2013}}
Although producerism is primarily economic in emphasis, it also has a perspective on social issues. Namely it upholds the traditional values of the middle class as the only true national values. It defends those values against the corruption of decadent inherited wealth, and against the dangerous apathy and sloth it sees as being the inevitable consequence of dependency on a [[welfare state]]. Therefore, producerists tend to be patriotic but at the same time intensely distrustful of the State, which they believe to be under the control of forces hostile to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Canovan, Stock, Kazin&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=December 2013}}

Some have pointed out a similarity between producerism and certain Christian [[End Times]] narratives that prophesize betrayal by trusted political and religious leaders, with many citizens drifting into laziness and sin. The producerist emphasis on the inherent value of hard work is directly related to the [[Protestant work ethic]], outlined by Weber. In the United States and in Europe it is often sympathetic towards conservative or Fundamentalist/Primitive Christianity, seen as a defender against both the moral degeneracy of the poor and the rapaciousness of unbridled capitalism. But producerism is not tied to a specific religious world view, and its emphasis on economics, labor, and class resentments embues it with a materialism not entirely compatible with a purely religious outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Kazin, Berlet &amp; Lyons&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=December 2013}}

'''Páramo''' can refer to a variety of [[alpine tundra]] [[ecosystem]]s. Some ecologists describe the páramo broadly as "all high, tropical, montane vegetation above the continuous timberline".&lt;ref name="Baruch"/&gt; A more narrow term classifies the páramo according to its regional placement in the northern [[Andes]] of South America and adjacent southern Central America. The páramo is the ecosystem of the regions above the continuous forest line, yet below the permanent snowline.&lt;ref name=Baruch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baruch|first=Zdravko|title=Ordination and Classification of Vegetation along an Altitudinal Gradient in the Venezuelan Páramos|journal=Vegetation|date=20 March 1984|volume=55|series=2|pages=115–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "[[Neotropical]] high mountain biome with a vegetation composed mainly of giant rosette plants, shrubs and grasses".&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; According to scientists, páramos may be "[[evolution|evolutionary hot spots]]" and among the fastest evolving regions on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20131107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=High Above Sea Level, Evolutionary Hot Spots |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/science/high-above-sea-level-evolutionary-hot-spots.html |date=November 7, 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=November 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Andean Paramo global ecoregion includes the [[Cordillera Central páramo]] (Ecuador, Peru), [[Santa Marta páramo]] (Colombia), [[Cordillera de Merida páramo]] (Venezuela) and [[Northern Andean páramo]] (Colombia, Ecuador) terrestrial ecoregions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Northern Andean Paramo – WWF Global}}|title=Northern Andean Paramo|publisher=WWF Global|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/northern_andean_paramo.cfm|accessdate=2017-04-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205181324/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/northern_andean_paramo.cfm|archivedate=2017-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Costa Rican páramo]] in Costa Rica and Panama is another páramo ecoregion.
In the strictest sense of the term, all páramo ecosystems are located in the [[Neotropics]], specifically South and Central America.  Scattered throughout the regions between [[11th parallel north|11°N]] and [[8th parallel south|8°S]] latitudes, these ecosystems are located mainly in the northwest corner of South America, in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]].

In Venezuela, the páramo occurs in the [[Cordillera de Mérida]]. Páramo ecosystems are also found in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] in Colombia, and in the regions of [[Huehuetenango]] and [[El Quiché]] of Guatemala in the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinberg, Michael and Matthew Taylor   |year=2008 |title=Guatemala's Altos de Chiantla: Changes on the High Frontier|journal=Mountain Research and Development |volume=28 |issue=3/4 |pages=255–262|issn=1994-7151 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1659/mrd.0891 |doi=10.1659/mrd.0891}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] of Costa Rica and the westernmost part of Panama has  páramo. In northern Ecuador, the [[Guandera Biological Station]] is a fairly undisturbed páramo ecosystem.

The majority of the páramo ecosystems occur in the [[Colombian Andes]]. The [[Sumapaz Páramo]], south of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]] (about {{convert|20|km|mi}} south of Bogotá), is the largest páramo in the world. This region was declared a National Park of Colombia in 1977 because of its importance as a [[biodiversity hotspot]] and main source of water for the most densely populated area of the country, the Bogotá Savannah.
The {{convert|1405|acre|km2|1|adj=on|order=flip}} Páramo Wildlife Refuge Park in the [[San José Province]] of Costa Rica "protects tropical forest areas in the high elevations of the [[Talamanca Mountains]]".&lt;ref name="Páramo Wildlife Refuge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paramo Wildlife Refuge|url=http://www.costarica-nationalparks.com/paramowildliferefuge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cotopaxi National Park]] contains {{convert|81524|acre|km2|1|order=flip}} of protected land in the [[Cotopaxi Province]] of Ecuador. Much of this park is páramo. Its flora includes [[Gentiana|gentians]], [[Lycopodiopsida|clubmosses]], [[valeriana|valerians]], and [[asteraceae|asters]] such as ''[[Loricaria (plant)|Loricaria]]'' and ''[[Chuquiraga]]'' species.&lt;ref name="Planet Ecuador"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marbache|first=Julie|title=National Parks|url=http://www.planetecuador.net/parks.htm|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
[[File:Culcitium.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Culcitium]]'' sp. in Páramo de Chiles, [[Carchi]], [[Ecuador]].]]
Páramo climates differ slightly depending on the specific location. In Colombia and northern Ecuador, air masses from the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) have a substantial effect on the climate, and these regions tend to be consistently humid (approx. 70-85%)&lt;ref name=Luteyn&gt;{{cite book|last=Luteyn|first=James L.|title=Páramos: A Checklist of Plant Diversity, Geographical Distribution, and Botanical Literature|year=1999|publisher=New York Botanical Garden Press|location=Bronx, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  throughout the year. The Andes also play a key role in the climate of these regions as they cause an orographic uplift in which moist air rises. This creates continuous moisture via rain, clouds, and fog, with many of them receiving over {{convert|2000|mm|abbr=on}} of rain annually.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt;

The páramos of the northern-most Andes of Venezuela, northern Colombia, and Costa Rica experience a different climate due to the dry season, which is caused by northeasterly trade winds. Southern Ecuador and northern Peru experience the most severe dryness as they are influenced by an air mass from the Amazon Basin, which releases its moisture on the eastern slopes, as well as another air mass from the west that is influenced by the [[Humboldt Current]].

Overall, páramo climates are known for their daily fluctuations in temperature and humidity. While they are generally cold and humid ecosystems, they often undergo a sudden and drastic change in weather in which they fluctuate between temperatures from below freezing to as high as {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}}. This oscillation often results in a daily freeze-and-thaw cycle, sometimes described as "summer every day and winter every night."&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt;  Mean annual temperatures of páramo ecosystems range from {{convert|2|C|F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|C|F|abbr=on}}, with increasingly colder temperatures at higher latitudes.

== Soils==
[[File:Rabanal.JPG|thumb|left|Páramo de Rabanal, [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], Colombia]]
Soils in páramo ecosystems vary, but most are young and partially weathered. The soil has a relatively low pH because of an abundance of moisture and organic content. Organic content, even within disturbed sites averages very high which contributes to water retention in the soil. During cold and wet weather, there are few nutrients available and productivity is very low in páramo soils.&lt;ref name=Hofstede&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofstede|first=Robert|author2=Arnout Rossenaar |title=Biomass of Grazed, Burned, and Undisturbed Páramo Grasslands, Colombia. II. Root Mass and Aboveground:Belowground Ratio|journal=Arctic and Alpine Research|date=February 1995|volume=27|issue=1|pages=13–18|jstor=1552063|doi=10.2307/1552063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soils in páramo ecosystems have changed because of human activity, especially due to burning vegetation to clear land for grazing.

Soils in the south Ecuadorian páramo are characterized broadly into [[Andisols]], [[Inceptisols]], [[Histosols]], [[Entisols]], and [[Mollisols]].&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; Recently, there has been an increase in Andisol soils, largely due to more volcanic activity&lt;ref name=Buytaert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buytaert|first=W.|author2=J. Sevink |author3=B. De Leeuw |author4=J. Deckers |title=Clay mineralogy of the soils in the south Ecuadorian páramo region|journal=Geoderma|year=2005|volume=127|pages=114–129|url=http://www.paramo.be/pubs/geoderma.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2011|doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.11.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These soils have a very high water retention rate, which contributes to the rise in cultivation and differential land use. This water supply stored in the soil in the higher elevation páramo in the Andes becomes the water supply for Andean settlements in lower altitudes.
{{Clear}}

==Vegetation zones==
Páramos are divided into separate zones based on altitude and vegetation structure, with the three main types of páramo vegetation unequally distributed throughout the different zones. 
[[File:Azorella peduculata (14401587732).jpg|thumb|''[[Azorella pedunculata]]'']]

Superpáramo is at the highest elevation and is usually considered to be the transition zone between the higher, permanent snow region and the lower grass páramo zone. The superpáramo zone is generally narrow and exists atop loose stones and sandy soils at about {{convert|4500|-|4800|m|abbr=on}}. It has the lowest air temperature, precipitation level, soil water-holding capacity, and nutrient content of all the zones. Being the highest in altitude, it also has the highest levels of solar radiation and night frost. For this reason, vegetation in the superpáramo must be highly resistant to such severe fluctuations in weather. Air temperatures are low - cold at night and cool during the day with daily oscillations greater than the oscillations of monthly averages.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; Due to its localization on high mountains, this area is the least disturbed by humans and contains the most endemic species of all the zones. Flora includes ''[[Azorella pedunculata]]'' of the [[Apiaceae]] family and species from the [[Asteraceae]], [[Fabaceae]], and [[Ericaceae]] families.

[[File:Blühende Rosetten.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Espeletia]] grandiflora'' in Páramo de Guerrero, [[Colombia]]]]
[[File:Espeletia killipii 1.JPG|thumb|''Espeletia killipii'' in Páramo de [[Guasca]], Colombia.]]
The most broadly described zone is the grass páramo. Grass páramos cover large areas of mountain ranges, while others are limited to small areas on slopes and summits of very high mountains.&lt;ref name=Sklenar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sklenar|first=P.|author2=P.M. Jorgensen |title=Distribution Patterns of Paramo Plants in Ecuador|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=July 1999|volume=26|issue=4|pages=681–691|jstor=2656172|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00324.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "páramo" is sometimes used to refer to this specific type. It has continuous vegetation and plant cover with a "yellowish to olive–brown" look due to the combination of dead and living grasses.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; The grass páramo extends from approximately {{convert|3500|-|4100|m|abbr=on}}, and is composed of mostly tussock-grasses and bunch-grasses.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; Grasses of the ''[[Calamagrostis]]'' and ''[[Festuca]]'' genera tend to dominate this zone. Other common vegetation includes large and small shrubs, stunted trees, cushion plants, herbs, and rosette plants.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; While these are the dominant species, grass páramos can also contain tall- and short-grass communities, including herbaceous and woody vegetation. Due to its easier access and high levels of grass, this zone is more impacted by humans and suffers from both burning and grazing activities.

Subpáramo is the lowest and most diverse zone. At {{convert|3000|-|3500|m|abbr=on}}, it is a shrub-dominated zone that combines aspects of both the grass páramo above and the forest below. Along with shrubs, this zone also contains small, scattered trees which gradually transition into the grasses and herbs of the grass páramo above. Plant communities in this vegetation zone are also known to include thickets that are mainly composed of shrubby or woody vegetation, including species from the ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Ageratina]]'', and ''[[Baccharis]]'' genera. Fragmented forests can appear in the subpáramo due to [[microclimate|microclimatic]] or [[edaphic]] conditions, yet the more abrupt changes are generally due to anthropogenic disruption such as cutting, burning, and grazing activities. Because of these high levels of disruption, it is believed that subpáramos are made up of largely secondary-growth communities. The high levels of disruption also make this zone particularly difficult to define, as humans typically extend and expand the zone for their own purposes, sometimes over hundreds or thousands of years. This has altered forest lines, often lowering them by several hundred meters, which has also affected the [[zoning habitat]]s for many animals.

==Fauna==
[[File:Pudu mephistolephis.png|thumb|''Pudu mephistolephis'', the Northern [[Pudú]], the smallest deer in the world, found up to 4,000 metres]]
[[File:Osoandino.JPG|thumb|''Tremarctos ornatus'', the [[spectacled bear]] or Andean bear is the only surviving species of bear native to South America.]]

The vegetation of the páramo provides shelter and habitat for a variety of mammals, birds, insects, amphibians, and reptiles. Some animals commonly found in páramo ecosystems include the [[Culpeo]] (sometimes called the páramo wolf), the [[white-tailed deer]], and the [[spectacled bear]]  which occasionally forages in the high páramo for its favored food, ''[[Puya (genus)|Puya]]'' bromeliads.&lt;ref name="Travel site" /&gt; Invertebrates such as grasshoppers, cockroaches, beetles, and flies are found in the subpáramo. Amphibians have been well documented in páramo ecosystems, including [[salamander]]s such as ''[[Bolitoglossa]]'' species and frogs such as ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'' species. Reptiles include lizards of the genera ''[[Stenocercus]]'', ''[[Phenacosaurus]]'', and ''[[Proctoporus]]''.

Sixty-nine species of birds are considered to be "total users" of páramo habitats, with "41 species making it their primary habitat and 16 as [[indicator species]]".&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt; The [[Andean condor]], also called "king of the Andes", is known for its wide wingspan, but is no longer frequently seen. The most numerous bird families in the páramo include [[eagle]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]], [[Tanager|thraupid "finches"]], and [[tyrant flycatcher]]s.&lt;ref name="Travel site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity: Paramo Regions|url=http://www.ecuador-travel.net/biodiversity.ecosystems.paramo.htm|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hummingbirds tolerate the cold climate by going into "a kind of nightly hibernation."&lt;ref name="Travel site"/&gt;

Hummingbirds, bees and flies are all important [[pollinator]]s in the páramo, while birds and smaller mammals such as [[rabbit]]s and [[Cavia|guinea pigs]] are important [[seed dispersal|seed dispersers]]. Many of the larger mammals of the páramo are rare due to hunting.

==Human impact and climate change==
[[File:Charolais cattle, Sierra Nevada, Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Cattle were introduced to the páramos in the early 18th century. A feral [[Charolais cattle|charolais bull]] in the [[Sierra Nevada de Mérida|Sierra Nevada]], Venezuela]]
[[File:Erosioenparamo.jpg|thumb|[[Erosion]] in a páramo, caused by wind and [[overgrazing]]]]

Humans have inhabited the páramo of the Andes for approximately the past 15,000 years. Deforestation has been extensive and in some cases, like the northern Andes, 90-95% of forests have been cleared. Other sites in Venezuela and Colombia show evidence that humans settled there at least 800 years ago and used the land for agriculture and hunting.&lt;ref name="Luteyn" /&gt;

When Europeans came to the Americas they introduced exotic plants and animals that greatly affected the land, especially cattle, which were introduced to the páramos in the early 18th century. By the 20th century the growing population of settlers led to an increased demand for land, and páramo ecosystems suffered accordingly. As more land was needed for cattle, fire was used to clear land, and eventually páramos became excessively burned and overgrazed. Both burning and grazing have damaged vegetation, soils, species diversity, and water storage capacity of the páramos. In burned and disturbed sites that were studied in the Andes the pH and phosphorus concentration in the soil are higher than in non-burned sites.&lt;ref name=Suarez&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suárez|first=Esteban|author2=Galo Medina |title=Vegetation Structure and Soil Properties in Ecuadorian Páramo Grasslands with Different Histories of Burning and Grazing|journal=Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research|date=May 2001|volume=33|issue=2|pages=158–164|jstor=1552216|doi=10.2307/1552216}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- [[File:Páramo andino venezolano nevado.jpg|thumb|right|Snowfall in a páramo in the [[Sierra La Culata|Sierra La Culata, Venezuela]]]] --&gt;
[[Climate change]] is becoming an increasingly pressing issue for páramo ecosystems.
Growing populations in Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador have forced settlements in higher elevations covering more páramo. Recent developments such  as construction of aqueducts, drainage systems, and roads, mining, and afforestation have been a huge additional páramo disturbance.  Increases in temperature extremes are forcing many fauna and flora species to higher grounds, and eventually they could face extinction. The flora of páramos is adapted to specific conditions and is thus vulnerable to even small climatic change. Climate change in the Andes is causing glaciers in the páramo to disappear and a drop in rainfall, virtually drying up páramo and in turn, drying up the water supply for cities such as Quito, Ecuador and Bogotá, Colombia.

On 8 February 2016, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] banned all mining operations in the paramos, prioritising the protection of the environment, and terminating 347 mining licenses that had operational rights in the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/corte-constitucional-prohibe-proyectos-mineros-en-los-paramos-del-pais/16504666&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">'''Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment''' ('''RICE''') is an experiment designed to detect the [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] emission in the radio regime of the electromagnetic spectrum from the interaction of [[Particle Physics|high energy]] [[neutrino]]s (greater than 1&amp;nbsp;[[peta-|P]][[electron volt|eV]]) with the [[Antarctic]] ice cap. The goals of this experiment are to determine the potential of the radio-detection technique for measuring the high energy cosmic neutrino [[flux]], determining the sources of this flux, and measuring neutrino-[[nucleon]] cross sections at energies above those accessible with existing [[Particle accelerator|accelerators]]. Such an experiment also has sensitivity to neutrinos from [[gamma ray burst]]s, as well as highly ionizing charged particles (monopoles, e.g.) traversing the Antarctic icecap.

== Experimental operation and results ==
Two [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] were installed successfully during the 1995–96 [[Southern Hemisphere|austral]] summer. During the 1996–97 season, a prototype array of several antennas was deployed down the [[Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array]] (AMANDA) bore holes at depths from 140–210 meters. This prototype demonstrated the ability to successfully deploy receivers and transmitters and enabled an estimate of the noise temperature in the deep ice. Several more receivers and transmitters were deployed in three new AMANDA holes during the 1997–1998 season, in dedicated shallow "dry" holes during the 1998–99 season, and finally in several AMANDA holes drilled during the 1999–2000 season. Five years of data-taking (two years of livetime) resulted in the most stringent upper limits on the neutrino flux in the interval 50&amp;nbsp;PeV&amp;nbsp;– 1&amp;nbsp;[[exa-|E]]eV, as well as results on departures from [[Standard Model]] cross-sections and searches for gamma-ray burst coincidences. Currently, RICE hardware is being modified for use in the [[IceCube Neutrino Detector|IceCube]] boreholes being drilled from 2006 to 2010.

This wasp behaviour evidences the most fundamental characteristic of animal sociality: [[parental investment]]. Parental investment is any expenditure of [[resource]]s (time, energy, [[social capital]]) to benefit one's [[offspring]]. Parental investment detracts from a parent's capacity to invest in future reproduction and aid to [[Family|kin]] (including other offspring). An animal that cares for its young but shows no other sociality traits is said to be  ''subsocial''.

An animal that exhibits a high degree of sociality is called a ''social animal''. The highest degree of sociality recognized by sociobiologists is ''[[eusociality]]''. A eusocial [[taxon]] is one that exhibits [[Overlapping generations|overlapping adult generations]], [[Reproduction|reproductive]] [[division of labor]], cooperative care of young, and—in the most refined cases—a biological [[caste system]].

[[Solitary animal|Solitary animals]], such as the [[jaguar]], do not associate except for [[courtship]] and [[mating]]. If an animal taxon shows a degree of sociality beyond courtship and mating, but lacks any of the characteristics of eusociality, it is said to be ''presocial''.&lt;ref name="Gadagkar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gadagkar |first=Raghavendra |date=September 1987 |title=What are social insects? |url=http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/hpg/ragh/publication_list/Gadagkar_Publications/Gadagkar_1987b.pdf |format=PDF |journal=IUSSI Indian Chapter Newsletter |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although presocial species are much more common than eusocial species, eusocial species have disproportionately large populations.&lt;ref name="Nowak, Tamita, and Wilson, (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nowak | first1=Martin A. | last2=Tamita | first2=Corina E. | first3=Edward O. | last3=Wilson | year=2010 | title=The Evolution of Eusociality | journal=Nature | volume=466 | issue=7310 | pages=1057–1062 | doi=10.1038/nature09205 | pmid=20740005 | pmc=3279739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presociality ==
The [[entomologist]] [[Charles Duncan Michener|Charles D. Michener]] published a classification system for presociality in 1969, building on the earlier work of Suzanne Batra (who coined the words ''eusocial'' and ''quasisocial'' in 1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Michener | first1=C.

In his use of these words, he did not generalize beyond [[insect]]s. [[E. O. Wilson]] later refined Batra's definition of ''quasisocial''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.

=== Subsociality ===

Subsociality is common in the animal kingdom. In ''subsocial'' [[taxa]], parents care for their young for some length of time. Even if the period of care is very short, the animal is still described as subsocial. If adult animals associate with other adults, they are not called ''subsocial'', but are ranked in some other classification according to their social behaviours. If occasionally associating or nesting with other adults is a taxon's most social behaviour, then members of those populations are said to be ''solitary but social''. See Wilson (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E. O. |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |year=1971 |title= The Insect Societies |location= [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] |isbn=9780674454903 |oclc=199513}}&lt;/ref&gt; for definitions and further sub-classes of varieties of subsociality.

{{See also|Solitary animal}}

Solitary-but-social animals forage separately, but some individuals sleep in the same location or share nests. The [[home range]]s of females usually overlap, whereas those of males do not. Males usually do not associate with other males, and male offspring are usually evicted upon maturity. Among [[primate]]s, this form of social organization is most common among the nocturnal [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] species and [[tarsier]]s. Some examples of solitary-but-social species are [[mouse lemur]]s, [[loris]]es, and [[orangutan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sussman |first=R.

=== Parasociality ===
Sociobiologists place communal, quasisocial, and semisocial animals into a meta-class: the ''parasocial''. The two commonalities of parasocial taxa are the exhibition of parental investment, and socialization in a single, [[Nest|cooperative dwelling]].&lt;ref name="Gadagkar"/&gt;

Communal, quasisocial, and semisocial groups differ in a few ways. In a communal group, adults cohabit in a single nest site, but they each care for their own young. Quasisocial animals cohabit, but they also share the responsibilities of [[Alloparenting|brood care]]. (This has been observed in some [[Hymenoptera]] and spider taxa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1006/anbe.1997.0648 | last1=Furey | first1=R. E. | title=Two cooperatively social populations of the theridiid spider Anelosimus studiosus in a temperate region | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=55 | issue=3 |pages=727–735 | year=1998 | pmid=9515053}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in some other [[invertebrate]]s.)&lt;ref name="Gadagkar"/&gt; A semisocial population has the features of communal and quasisocial populations, but they also have a biological caste system that delegates labor according to whether or not an individual is able to reproduce.

Beyond parasociality is eusociality. Eusocial insect societies have all the characteristics of a semisocial one, except overlapping generations of adults cohabit and share in the care of young. This means that more than one adult generation is alive at the same time, and that the older generations also care for the newest offspring.

== Eusociality ==
[[File:Natural Beehive and Honeycombs.jpg|thumb|alt=Bees almost completely cover a honeycomb suspended from a tree branch.|[[Giant honey bee]]s cover the [[honeycomb]] of their nest.]]
{{Main|Eusociality|Evolution of eusociality}}

Eusocial societies have overlapping adult generations, cooperative care of young, and division of reproductive labor. When organisms in a species are born with physical characteristics specific to a caste which never changes throughout their lives, this exemplifies the highest acknowledged degree of sociality. Eusociality has evolved in several orders of insects. Common examples of eusociality are from Hymenoptera ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, [[Sawfly|sawflies]], and wasps) and [[Blattodea]] (infraorder [[Isoptera]], termites), but some [[Coleoptera]] (such as the beetle ''[[Austroplatypus incompertus]]''),  [[Hemiptera]] (bugs such as ''[[Pemphigus spyrothecae]]''), and [[Thysanoptera]] (thrips) are described as eusocial. Eusocial species that lack this criterion of morphological caste differentiation are said to be ''primitively eusocial''.&lt;ref name="Gadagkar"/&gt;

Two potential examples of primitively eusocial mammals are the [[naked mole-rat]] and the [[Damaraland mole-rat]] (''Heterocephalus glaber'' &amp; ''Fukomys damarensis'', respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Burda | first1=H. Honeycutt | last2=Begall | first2=S. | last3=Locker-Grutjen | first3=O | last4=Scharff | first4=A. | year=2000 | title=Are naked and common mole-rats eusocial and if so, why? | url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1456956 | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=47 | issue=5| pages=293–303 | doi=10.1007/s002650050669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both species are [[diploid]] and highly [[inbred]], and they aid in raising their siblings and relatives, all of whom are born from a single reproductive queen. They usually live in harsh or limiting environments. However, a study conducted by O’Riain and Faulkes in 2008 suggests that due to regular [[inbreeding avoidance]], mole rats sometimes outbreed and establish new colonies when resources are sufficient.&lt;ref name="O'Riain and Faulkes, (2008)"&gt;{{cite book | last1=O'Riain | first1=M.J. | last2=Faulkes | first2=C.

Eusociality has arisen among some [[crustacean]]s that live in groups in a restricted area. ''[[Synalpheus regalis]]'' are parasitic shrimp that rely on fortress defense. They live in groups of closely related individuals, amidst tropical [[reef]]s and [[sponge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiple origins of eusociality among sponge-dwelling shrimps (''Synalpheus'')|first=J.

As with other eusocial societies, there is a single shared living space for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|title=On the frequency of eusociality in snapping shrimps (Decapoda: Alpheidae), with description of a second eusocial species|author=Duffy, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">In [[metrology]] and the fields that it serves (such as [[manufacturing]], [[machining]], and [[engineering]]), '''total indicator reading''' ('''TIR'''), also known by the newer name '''full indicator movement''' ('''FIM'''), is the difference between the maximum and minimum [[measurement]]s, that is, readings of an [[indicator (distance amplifying instrument)|indicator]], on the [[plane (geometry)|planar]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], or contoured surface of a part,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineersedge.com/engineering/Engineering_Terms_Glossary/T/total_indicator_reading_tir_4448.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729021818/http://www.engineersedge.com/engineering/Engineering_Terms_Glossary/T/total_indicator_reading_tir_4448.htm |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing its amount of deviation from flatness, roundness (circularity), cylindricity, concentricity with other cylindrical features, or similar conditions. The indicator traditionally would be a dial indicator; today dial-type and digital indicators coexist. 

The earliest expansion of "TIR" was '''total indicated run-out''' and concerned cylindrical or tapered (conical) parts, where "[[run-out]]" (noun) refers to any imperfection of form that causes a [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotating]] part such as a shaft to "run out" (verb), that is, to not rotate with perfect smoothness. These conditions include being out-of-round (that is, lacking sufficient [[roundness (object)|roundness]]); eccentricity (that is, lacking sufficient [[concentric|concentricity]]); or being bent axially (regardless of whether the surfaces are perfectly round and concentric at every cross-sectional point). The purpose of emphasizing the "total" in TIR was to duly maintain the distinction between per-side differences and both-sides-considered differences, which requires perennial conscious attention in [[lathe (metal)|lathe]] work. For example, all depths of cut in lathe work must account for whether they apply to the radius (that is, per side) or to the diameter (that is, total). Similarly, in shaft-straightening operations, where calibrated amounts of bending force are applied laterally to the shaft, the "total" emphasis corresponds to a bend of half that magnitude. If a shaft has 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm TIR, it is "out of straightness" by half that total, i.e., 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm. 

Today TIR in its more inclusive expansion, "total indicator reading", concerns all kinds of features, from round to flat to contoured. One example of how the "total" emphasis can apply to flat surfaces as well as round ones is in the topic of [[surface roughness]], where both peaks and valleys count toward an assessment of the magnitude of roughness. Statistical methods such as [[root mean square]] (RMS) duly address the "total" idea in this respect.

The newer name "full indicator movement" (FIM) was coined to emphasize the requirement of zero [[Indicator (distance amplifying instrument)#Dial test indicator tips|cosine error]]. Whereas dial test indicators will give a foreshortened reading if their tips are on an angle to the surface being measured (cosine error), a drawing callout of FIM is defined as referring to the distance traveled by the extremity of the tip—not by the lesser amount that its lever-like action moves the needle. Thus a FIM requirement is only met when the measured part itself is truly in geometric compliance—not merely when the needle sweeps a certain arc of the dial. 

The "TIR" abbreviation is still more widely known and used than "FIM". This is natural given that (1) many part designs that are still being manufactured are made from decades-old [[engineering drawing]]s, which still say "TIR"; and (2) generations of machinists were trained with the term "TIR", whereas only recent curriculum uses "FIM".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">An '''umbrella effect''' is the protection extended by the presence of an [[umbrella species]] to other [[species]] in the same [[habitat]].  

The umbrella species is often either a [[flagship species]] whose [[Conservation biology|conservation]] benefits other species&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, 2002, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[keystone species]] which may be targeted for conservation due to its impact on an [[ecosystem]].  
&lt;br /&gt;More generally, an umbrella species determines the area over which conservation occurs.  
They are often representative of other species in their habitat, being an easily observable and known species.

==Example==
A good example of an umbrella species and its impact is summed up by Kimberly Andrews, a University of Georgia doctoral student at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Protecting a species like the [[Canebrake Rattlesnake|canebrake]] has practical applications, as protection measures would have broad [[natural environment|environmental]] value because of an umbrella effect. That is, protecting the [[rattlesnakes]] would ensure protection of other [[wildlife]] species that use the same habitats but are less sensitive to [[overdevelopment|development]] or require fewer [[resources]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Uses this concept==
The concept of an umbrella species is further utilized to create [[wildlife corridor]]s with what are termed [[EDGE species#Focal species|focal species]]. These focal species are chosen for a number of reasons and fall into several types, generally measured by their potential for an umbrella effect. By carefully choosing species based on this criterion, a linked or networked habitat can be created from single-species corridors.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Arizona University (Majka, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are determined with the assistance of [[geographic information system]]s on the larger scale. Regardless of the location or scale of conservation, the umbrella effect is a measurement of a species' impact on others and is an important part of determining an approach.

'''Urban Agricultural Architecture (UAA)''' is the practice of integrating [[Organic farming|organic]], [[hydroponic]], [[aeroponic]] or [[aquaponic]] [[Agricultural science|farming technologies]] into buildings of all types.  An example can be as small as building a lean-to-[[greenhouse]] on a single-family home and using it as a [[kitchen garden]].  Examples of large-scale projects are the hydroponic greenhouses of [[Lufa Farms]], the rooftop farms of [[Brooklyn Grange]] Rooftop Farm,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.growingagreenerworld.com/episode322/&lt;/ref&gt; and the vertical farms of Sky Greens.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFQOkzEjxQ&lt;/ref&gt;  Building types that can incorporate food growing technologies include: single-family home, multi-family housing, mixed-use buildings, schools,&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/nyc/photos-fifth-street-farm-unveils-new-rooftop-farm-designed-by-michael-arad-at-the-east-village-earth-school/&lt;/ref&gt; restaurants,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/photo/rosemary-s-rooftop-farm-/218685.html&lt;/ref&gt; institutional buildings,&lt;ref&gt;http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/General_University_News_2/rooftop_farm.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; vertical farms, hoop houses and greenhouses that are designed to urban conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://popupcity.net/top-5-of-the-greatest-urban-rooftop-farms/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vertical Farm Video".

'''Walter Holden Capps''' (May 5, 1934 – October 28, 1997) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]]. He was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Capps lost an election to [[Andrea Seastrand]] for the 22nd district in [[California]] in 1994, which was a landslide year for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. While driving home from a campaign event during the summer of 1996, Capps' vehicle was struck by a drunk driver. Capps was seriously injured and was unable to actively campaign until the final few weeks of the race. During his absence from the campaign, his opponent, graciously, didn't make his failing health an issue.  Ultimately, despite his absence from the campaign trail, Capps won, even as Bob Dole edged Bill Clinton in the district.

Capps died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Dulles Airport]] only nine months into his term. The Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] attended his funeral. Capps was succeeded by his widow, [[Lois Capps]], who won in a special election in the spring of 1998. Subsequent legislation by Congresswoman Capps has mandated the presence of [[Automated external defibrillator|AEDs]] in public places.

Before entering politics, Capps taught for more than thirty years at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. As a Professor in the Religious Studies department he helped define the field, and cataloged the growth and changes in his 1995 book ''Religious Studies: The Making of a Discipline''. An anti-war activist during the 1960s, he later initiated a nationally renowned course titled "Religion and the Impact of Vietnam" in 1979.

==Education==
Capps received both a master's degree and PhD from [[Yale Divinity School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cappscenter.ucsb.edu/walter-capps/educational-history/|title=Educational History - Capps Center|website=www.cappscenter.ucsb.edu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 30, 1997 Capps received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of 
Theology  at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/|title=Honorary doctorates - Uppsala University, Sweden|website=www.uu.se|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this methodology, it is likely to identify a finite test-set that exhaustively determines whether the tested system's implementation matches its specification.  This goal is achieved by a divide-and-conquer approach, in which the design is decomposed by refinement&lt;ref name="IpHol98"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'. ''Int. J. Comp. Math.'' '''68''', pp. 197-219.&lt;/ref&gt; into a collection of [[Stream X-Machine]]s, which are implemented as separate modules, then tested bottom-up.  At each integration stage, the testing method guarantees that the tested components are correctly integrated.&lt;ref name="IpHol97"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1997) 'An integration testing method that is proved to find all faults', ''International Journal of Computer Mathematics'' '''63''', pp. 159-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology overcomes formal [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem#Relationship with computability|undecidability]] limitations by requiring that certain [[design for test]] principles are followed during specification and implementation.  The resulting scalability means that practical software&lt;ref name="BogHol98"&gt;K. Bogdanov and M. Holcombe (1998) 'Automated test set generation for Statecharts', in: D. Hutter, W Stephan, P. Traverso and M. Ullmann eds. ''Applied Formal Methods: FM-Trends 98'', Boppard, Germany, ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'' '''1641''', pp. 107-121.&lt;/ref&gt; and hardware&lt;ref name="Van01"&gt;Salim Vanak (2001), ''Complete Functional Testing of Hardware Designs'', PhD Thesis, University of Sheffield.&lt;/ref&gt; systems consisting of hundreds of thousands of states and millions of transitions have been tested successfully.

== Motivation ==

Much [[software testing]] is merely hopeful, seeking to exercise the software system in various ways to see whether any faults can be detected.  Testing may indeed reveal some faults, but can never guarantee that the system is correct, once testing is over.  
[[Functional testing]] methods seek to improve on this situation, by developing a [[formal specification]] describing the intended behaviour of the system, against which the implementation is later tested (a kind of [[conformance testing]]).  The specification can be validated against the user-requirements and later [[Mathematical proof|proven]] to be [[consistent]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] by mathematical reasoning (eliminating any logical design flaws).  Complete [[functional testing]] methods exploit the specification systematically, generating test-sets which exercise the implemented software system ''exhaustively'', to determine whether it conforms to the specification.  In particular:
* Full positive testing: confirms that all desired behaviour is present in the system;
* Full negative testing: confirms that no unintended behaviour is present in the system.
This level of testing  can be difficult to achieve, since software systems are extremely complex, with hundreds of thousands of states and millions of transitions.  What is needed is a way of breaking down the specification and testing problem into parts which can be addressed separately.

=== Scalable, Abstract Specifications ===

Mike Holcombe first proposed using [[Samuel Eilenberg]]'s theoretical [[X-machine]] model as the basis for software specification in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hol88"&gt;M. Holcombe (1988)
  'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification',
  ''Software Engineering Journal'' '''3'''(2), pp. 69-76.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is because the model cleanly separates the ''control flow'' of a system from the ''processing'' carried out by the system.  At a given level of abstraction, the system can be viewed as a simple [[finite state machine]] consisting of a few states and transitions.  The more complex processing is delegated to the ''processing functions'' on the transitions, which modify the underlying fundamental data type ''X''.  Later, each processing function may be separately exposed and characterized by another [[X-machine]], modelling the behaviour of that system operation.

This supports a divide-and-conquer approach, in which the overall system architecture is specified first, then each major system operation is specified next, followed by subroutines, and so forth.  At each step, the level of complexity is manageable, because of the independence of each layer.  In particular, it is easy for software engineers to validate the simple [[finite state machine]]s against user requirements.

=== Incrementally Testable Specifications ===

Gilbert Laycock first proposed a particular kind of [[X-machine]], the [[Stream X-Machine]], as the basis for the testing method.&lt;ref name="Lay93" /&gt;  The advantage of this variant was the way in which testing could be controlled.  In a [[Stream X-Machine]], the fundamental data type has a particular form:  ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*, where ''In''* is an input stream, ''Out''* is an output stream, and ''Mem'' is the internal memory.  The transitions of a [[Stream X-Machine]] are labelled with processing functions of the form φ: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem'', that is, they consume one input from the input stream, possibly modify memory, and produce one output on the output stream (see the [[Stream X-Machine|associated article]] for more details).

The benefits for testing are that software systems designed in this way are ''observable'' at each step.  For each input, the machine takes one step, producing an output, such that input/output pairs may be matched exactly.  This contrasts with other approaches in which the system ''runs to completion'' (taking multiple steps) before any observation is made.  Furthermore, layered [[Stream X-Machine]]s offer a convenient abstraction.  At each level, the tester may ''forget'' about the details of the processing functions and consider the (sub-)system just as a simple [[finite state machine]].  Powerful methods exist for testing systems that conform to finite state specifications, such as Chow's W-method.&lt;ref name="Chow78"&gt;T. S. Chow (1978) 'Testing software design modelled by finite state machines', ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'', '''4''' ''(3)'', pp. 178-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specification Method ==

When following the (Stream) X-Machine methodology, the first stage is to identify the various types of data to be processed.  For example, a word processor will use basic types ''Character'' (keyboard input), ''Position'' (mouse cursor position) and ''Command'' (mouse or menu command).  There may be other constructed types, such as ''Text'' ::= ''Character''* (a sequence of characters), ''Selection'' ::= ''Position'' × ''Position'' (the start and end of the selection) and ''Document'' ::= ''Text'' × ''Selection'' × ''Boolean'' (the text, a possible selection, and a flag to signal if the document has been modified).

=== High-Level Specification ===

The top-level specification is a [[Stream X-Machine]] describing the main user interaction with the system.  For example, the word processor will exist in a number of states, in which keystrokes and commands will have different effects.  Suppose that this word processor exists in the states {'''Writing''', '''Selecting''', '''Filing''', '''Editing'''}.  We expect the word processor to start in the initial '''Writing''' state, but to move to the '''Selecting''' state if either the mouse is ''dragged'', or the ''shift-key'' is held down.  Once the selection is established, it should return to the '''Writing''' state.  Likewise, if a menu option is chosen, this should enter the '''Editing''' or '''Filing''' state.  In these states, certain keystrokes may have different meanings.  The word processor eventually returns to the '''Writing''' state, when any menu command has finished.  This state machine is designed and labelled informally with the various actions that cause it to change state.

The input, memory and output types for the top-level machine are now formalised.  Suppose that the memory type of the simple word processor is the  type ''Document'' defined above.  This treats a document as a text string, with two positions marking a possible selection and a flag to indicate modification since the last ''save''-command.  A more complex word processor might support undoable editing, with a sequence of document states: ''Document'' ::= (''Text'' × ''Selection'')*, which are collapsed to one document every time a ''save''-command is performed.

Suppose that the input type for the machine is:  ''In'' ::= ''Command'' × ''Character'' × ''Position''.  This recognises that every interaction could be a simple character insertion, a menu command or a cursor placement.  Any given interaction is a 3-tuple, but some places may be empty.  For example, (''Insert'', 'a', ε) would represent typing the character 'a'; while (''Position'', ε, 32) would mean placing the cursor between characters 32 and 33; and (''Select'', ε, 32) would mean selecting the text between the current cursor position and the place between characters 32 and 33.

The output type for the machine is designed so that it is possible to determine from the output ''which'' processing function was executed, in response to a given input.  This relates to the property of ''output distinguishability'', described below.

=== Low-Level Specification ===

If a system is complex, then it will most likely be decomposed into several [[Stream X-Machine]]s.  The most common kind of refinement is to take each of the major processing functions (which were the labels on the high-level machine) and treat these as separate [[Stream X-Machine]]s.&lt;ref name="IpHol98" /&gt;  In this case, the input, memory and output types for the low-level machines will be different from those defined for the high-level machine.  Either, this is treated as an expansion of the data sets used at the high level, or there is a translation from more abstract data sets at the high level into more detailed data sets at the lower level.  For example, a command ''Select'' at the high level could be decomposed into three events: ''MouseDown'', ''MouseMove'', ''MouseUp'' at the lower level.

Ipate and Holcombe mention several kinds of refinement, including ''functional refinement'', in which the behaviour of the processing functions is elaborated in more detail, and ''state refinement'', in which a simple state-space is partitioned into a more complex state-space.&lt;ref name="HolIp98" /&gt;  Ipate proves these two kinds of refinement to be eventually equivalent&lt;ref name="Ip95"&gt;Florentin Ipate (1995) ''Theory of X-Machines with Applications in Specification and Testing'', PhD Thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems are otherwise specified down to the level at which the designer is prepared to trust the primitive operations supported by the implementation environment.  It is also possible to test small units exhaustively by other testing methods.

=== Design-For-Test Conditions ===

The (Stream) X-Machine methodology requires the designer to observe certain [[design for test]] conditions.  These are typically not too difficult to satisfy.  For each [[Stream X-Machine]] in the specification, we must obtain:

* '''Minimal Specification''': The specification must be a ''minimal'' [[finite state machine]].  This means that the state machine should not contain redundant states, that is, states in which the observable transition behaviour is identical to that in some other state.
* '''Deterministic Specification''': For each state of the machine, at most one of the processing functions φ should be [[Stream X-Machine#The Stream X-Machine|enabled]] for the current memory and next input value.  This ensures that the required behaviour to be tested is predictable.
* '''Test Completeness''': Each processing function φ must be executable for at least one input, with respect to all memory states.  This ensures that there are no deadlocks, where the machine is blocked by the current state of memory.  To ensure test completeness, the [[domain of a function]] φ may be extended with special ''test inputs'' that are only used during testing.
* '''Output Distinguishability''': It must be possible to distinguish which processing function was invoked from its output value alone, for all memory-input pairs.  This ensures that the state machine can be decoupled from the processing functions.  To ensure output distinguishability, the [[codomain]] of a function φ may be extended with special ''test outputs'' that are only relevant during testing.

A minimal machine is the machine with the fewest states and transitions for some given behaviour.  Keeping the specification minimal simply ensures that the test sets are as small as possible.  A deterministic machine is required for systems that are predictable.  Otherwise, an implementation could make an arbitrary choice regarding which transition was taken.  Some recent work has relaxed this assumption to allow testing of non-deterministic machines.&lt;ref name="IpHol00"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (2000) 'Testing non-deterministic X-machines'.  In: ''Words, Sequences, Grammars, Languages: Where Biology, Computer Science, Linguistics and Mathematics Meet, Vol II'', eds. C Martin-Vide and V. Mitrana, Kluwer.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Test completeness is needed to ensure that the implementation is testable within tractable time.  For example, if a system has distant, or hard-to-reach states that are only entered after memory has reached a certain limiting value, then special test inputs should be added to allow memory to be bypassed, forcing the state machine into the distant state.  This allows all (abstract) states to be covered quickly during testing.  Output distinguishability is the key property supporting the scalable testing method.  It allows the tester to treat the processing functions φ as simple labels, whose detailed behaviour may be safely ignored, while testing the state machine of the next integration layer.  The unique outputs are witness values, which guarantee that a particular function was invoked.

== Testing Method ==

The (Stream) X-Machine Testing Method assumes that both the design and the implementation can be considered as (a collection of) [[Stream X-Machine]]s.  For each pair of corresponding machines (''Spec'', ''Imp''), the purpose of testing is to determine whether the behaviour of ''Imp'', the machine of the implementation, exactly matches the behaviour of ''Spec'', the machine of the specification.  Note that ''Imp'' need not be a minimal machine - it may have more states and transitions than ''Spec'' and still behave in an identical way.

To test all behaviours, it must be possible to drive a machine into all of its states, then attempt all possible transitions (those which should succeed, and those which should be blocked) to achieve full ''positive'' and ''negative'' testing (see above).  For transitions which succeed, the destination state must also be verified.  Note that if ''Spec'' and ''Imp'' have the same number of states, the above describes the smallest test-set that achieves the objective.  If ''Imp'' has more states and transitions than ''Spec'', longer test sequences are needed to guarantee that ''redundant'' states in ''Imp'' also behave as expected.

=== Testing all States ===

The basis for the test generation strategy is Tsun S. Chow's W-Method for testing finite state automata,&lt;ref name="Chow78" /&gt; chosen because it supports the testing of redundant implementations.  Chow's method assumes simple [[finite state machine]]s with observable inputs and outputs, but no directly observable states.  To map onto Chow's formalism, the functions φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; on the transitions of the [[Stream X-Machine]]s are treated simply as labels (inputs, in Chow's terms) and the distinguishing outputs are used directly.  (Later, a mapping from real inputs and memory (''mem'', ''in'') is chosen to trigger each function φ, according to its domain).

To identify specific states in ''Imp'', Chow chooses a ''characterization set, W'', the smallest set of test sequences that uniquely characterizes each state in ''Spec''.  That is, when starting in a given state, exercising the sequences in ''W'' should yield at least one observable difference, compared to starting in any other state.

To reach each state expected in ''Spec'', the tester constructs the ''state cover, C'', the smallest set of test sequences that reaches every state.  This can be constructed by automatic breadth-first exploration of ''Spec''.  The test-set which validates all the states of a minimal ''Imp'' is then: ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W'', where &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''concatenated product'' of the two sets.  For example, if ''C'' = {&lt;''a''&gt;, &lt;''b''&gt;} and ''W'' = {&lt;''c''&gt;, &lt;''d''&gt;}, then ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W'' = {&lt;''ac''&gt;, &lt;''ad''&gt;,&lt;''bc''&gt;, &lt;''bd''&gt;}.

=== Testing all Transitions ===

The above test-set determines whether a minimal ''Imp'' has the same states as ''Spec''.  To determine whether a minimal ''Imp'' also has the same transition behaviour as ''Spec'', the tester constructs the ''transition cover, K''.  This is the smallest set of test sequences that reaches every state and then attempts every possible transition once, from that state.  Now, the input alphabet consists of (the labels of) every function φ in Φ.  Let us construct a set of length-1 test sequences, consisting of single functions chosen from Φ, and call this Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  The transition cover is defined as ''K'' &lt;code&gt;::=&lt;/code&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

This will attempt every possible transition from every state.  For those which succeed, we must validate the destination states. So, the smallest test-set ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which completely validates the behaviour of a minimal ''Imp'' is given by:  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ::= ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W'' &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W''.  This formula can be rearranged as:

  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;code&gt;::=&lt;/code&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; (Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; Φ &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W'',

where Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the set containing the empty sequence {&lt;&gt;}.
  
If ''Imp'' has more states than ''Spec'', the above test-set may not be sufficient to guarantee the conformant behaviour of replicated states in ''Imp''.  So, sets of longer test sequences are chosen, consisting of all pairs of functions Φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, all triples of functions Φ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; up to some limit Φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, when the tester is satisfied that ''Imp'' cannot contain chains of duplicated states longer than ''k''-1.  The final test formula is given by:

  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;code&gt;::=&lt;/code&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; (Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; Φ &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; Φ &lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W''.

This test-set completely validates the behaviour of a non-minimal ''Imp'' in which chains of duplicated states are expected to be no longer than ''k''-1.  For most practical purposes, testing up to ''k''=2, or ''k''=3 is quite exhaustive, revealing all state-related faults in really poor implementations.
