'''Advanced Placement (AP) Physics 1''', along with [[AP Physics 2]], is a year-long [[Advanced Placement|AP]] course whose first exam was given in 2015. The course is intended to proxy a one-semester algebra-based university course.  Topics covered include forces and motion, conservation laws, waves, and electricity. &lt;ref&gt;[http://jacobsphysics.blogspot.com/2011/07/ap-physics-1-and-2-redesign-as-it.html Jacobs Physics: AP Physics 1 and 2 Redesign (as it stands now) and Honors Physics I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The heavily computational AP Physics B course served for four decades as the College Board's algebra-based offering.  As part of the College Board's redesign of science courses, AP Physics B was discontinued and AP Physics 1 and 2 were created with guidance from the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/math-and-science/physics AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 | Advances in AP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The course covers material of a first-[[semester]] [[university]] [[undergraduate]] [[physics]] course offered at American universities that use best practices of physics pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Greg|title=What does a 5 on the AP Physics 1 Exam mean?  It still means an A, but read on...|url=https://jacobsphysics.blogspot.com/2016/01/what-does-5-on-ap-physics-1-exam-mean.html|website=Jacobs Physics|publisher=Greg Jacobs|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first AP Physics 1 classes had begun in the 2014-2015 school year, with the first AP exams administered in May 2015.

==Curriculum==
AP Physics 1 is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course that includes topics such as Newtonian mechanics; work, energy, and power; mechanical waves and sound; and introductory, simple circuits.  The College Board published a curriculum framework that includes seven big ideas on which the new AP Physics courses are based, along with "enduring understandings" students will be expected to acquire within each of the big ideas.:&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/2012advances/11b_4615_AP_Physics_CF_WEB_120910.pdf AP Physics 1: Algebra-based and AP Physics 2: Algebra-based Curriculum Framework 2014–2015] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927033758/http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/2012advances/11b_4615_AP_Physics_CF_WEB_120910.pdf |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions for the exam are constructed with direct reference to items in the curriculum framework.  Student understanding of each topic is tested with reference to multiple skills -- that is, questions require students to use quantitative, semi-quantitative, qualitative, and experimental reasoning in each content area.

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Activated charcoal''', also known as '''activated carbon''', is a medication used to treat [[poison]]ings that occurred [[oral administration|by mouth]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt; To be effective it must be used within a short time of the poisoning occurring, typically an hour.&lt;ref name=WHO2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt; It does not work for poisonings by [[cyanide poisoning|cyanide]], [[corrosive agents]], [[iron poisoning|iron]], [[lithium poisoning|lithium]], [[alcohol]]s, or [[malathion]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO Model Formulary 2008|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241547659|page=57|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s16879e/s16879e.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213060118/http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s16879e/s16879e.pdf|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be taken by mouth or given by a [[nasogastric tube]].&lt;ref name=Ric2015/&gt; Other uses include inside [[hemoperfusion machines]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt;
Common side effects include [[vomiting]], black stools, diarrhea, and [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt; The more serious side effect, [[pneumonitis]], may result if [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirated into the lungs]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AHFS2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Charcoal, Activated|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/charcoal-activated.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=8 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221011707/https://www.drugs.com/monograph/charcoal-activated.html|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use in [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]] is safe.&lt;ref name=Ric2015/&gt; Activated charcoal works by [[adsorption|adsorbing]] the toxin.&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Society and culture --&gt;

==Medical uses==
===Poison ingestion===
Activated charcoal is used to treat many types of oral poisonings such as [[phenobarbital]] and [[carbamazepine]].&lt;ref name=AHFS/&gt; It is not effective for a number of poisonings including: strong acids or bases, [[iron poisoning|iron]], [[lithium]], [[arsenic]], [[methanol poisoning|methanol]], [[ethanol]] or [[ethylene glycol]].&lt;ref name=AHFS&gt;{{cite web | title = Charcoal, Activated | url = https://www.drugs.com/monograph/charcoal-activated.html | work = The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists | accessdate = 23 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140522002026/http://www.drugs.com/monograph/charcoal-activated.html | archivedate = 22 May 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[randomized controlled trials]] have shown activated charcoal improves outcomes and routine use is not recommended.&lt;ref name=AHFS/&gt;  In a study of acute poisonings from agricultural [[pesticide]]s and [[Cascabela thevetia|yellow oleander]] seeds, the administration of activated carbon did not affect survival rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Eddleston M, Juszczak E, Buckley NA |title=Multiple-dose activated charcoal in acute self-poisoning: a randomised controlled trial|journal=Lancet|year=2008|volume=371|issue=9612|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60270-6|pages=579–87 | pmid=18280328|pmc=2430417 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gastrointestinal tract-related issues===
[[Charcoal biscuit]]s were sold in England starting in the early 19th century, originally as remedy to [[flatulence]] and stomach trouble.&lt;ref name=Rolland&gt;{{cite book | last= Rolland |first= Jacques L. | title= The Food Encyclopedia: Over 8,000 Ingredients, Tools, Techniques and People | publisher=Robert Rose | year=2006 | isbn= 0-7788-0150-0 | page= 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|charcocaps}}

[[Tablet (pharmacy)|Tablets]] or [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] of activated carbon are used in many countries as an [[over-the-counter drug]] to treat [[diarrhea]], [[indigestion]], and [[flatulence]].&lt;ref name="stearn2007"&gt;
{{cite book |title       = Warts and all: straight talking advice on life's embarrassing problems |last        = Stearn |first       = Margaret |year        = 2007 |publisher   = Murdoch Books |location    = London |isbn        = 978-1-921259-84-5 |page        = 333 |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=aSRmxC47VNMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA333 |accessdate  = 2009-05-03 |deadurl     = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910183018/https://books.google.com/books?id=aSRmxC47VNMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA333 |archivedate = 2017-09-10 |df          = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence of its effectiveness to prevent diarrhea in cancer patients who have received [[irinotecan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michael M, Brittain M, Nagai J |title=Phase II study of activated charcoal to prevent irinotecan-induced diarrhea |journal=J Clin Oncol |volume=22 |issue=21 |pages=4410–7 |date=Nov 2004 |pmid=15514383 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2004.11.125 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can interfere with the absorption of some medications, and lead to unreliable readings in medical tests such as the [[stool guaiac test|guaiac]] card test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gogel HK, Tandberg D, Strickland RG |title=Substances that interfere with guaiac card tests: implications for gastric aspirate testing |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=474–80 |date=Sep 1989 |pmid=2787993 |doi=10.1016/0735-6757(89)90248-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activated carbon is also used for bowel preparation by reducing intestinal gas content before abdominal [[radiography]] to visualize [[bile]] and pancreatic and [[renal stones]]. A type of [[charcoal biscuit]] has also been marketed as a pet care product.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Other===
Claims that activated charcoal will do things such as whiten teeth, cure alcohol-induced [[hangovers]], and prevent bloating, are not supported by evidence.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Side effects==
Incorrect application (e.g. into the lungs) results in [[pulmonary aspiration]] which can sometimes be fatal if immediate medical treatment is not initiated.&lt;ref name="Chest1989-Elliott"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elliott C, Colby T, Kelly T, Hicks H | title = Charcoal lung. Bronchiolitis obliterans after aspiration of activated charcoal | journal = Chest | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 672–4 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2766830 | doi = 10.1378/chest.96.3.672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of activated carbon is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] when the ingested substance is an acid, an alkali, or a petroleum product.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Mechanism of action==
In cases of suspected poisoning, medical personnel administer activated carbon on the scene or at a hospital's [[emergency department]]. In rare situations, it may also be used in a [[hemoperfusion]] system to remove toxins from the blood stream of poisoned patients. Activated carbon has become the treatment of choice for many poisonings, and other decontamination methods such as [[syrup of ipecac|ipecac]]-induced [[emesis]] or [[Gastric lavage|stomach pumping]] are now used rarely.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

*Binding of the poison to prevent stomach and intestinal absorption.  Reversible binding using a [[cathartic]], such as [[sorbitol]], may be added.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
*It interrupts the [[enterohepatic circulation|enterohepatic]] and [[enteroenteric circulation]] of some drugs/toxins and their [[metabolites]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">'''Advanced Innovation Design Approach''' (AIDA) is a holistic approach for enhancing innovative and competitive capability of industrial companies. The name Advanced Innovation Design Approach (AIDA) was proposed in the research project "Innovation Process 4.0" run at the [[University of Applied Sciences Offenburg]], Germany in co-operation with 10 German industrial companies in 2015-2017.&lt;ref&gt;Livotov P. [http://triz.h4u.eu/Innovator_01-2016_(02).pdf Systemic Approach for Enhancing Innovative and Competitive Capability of Industrial Companies - Research Concept. Journal of the European TRIZ Association  01-2016 (163-169)].&lt;/ref&gt;
AIDA can be considered as a pioneering mindset, an individually adaptable range of strongest innovation techniques such as comprehensive [[Front end innovation|front-end innovation]] process, advanced innovation methods, best tools and methods of the theory of inventive problem solving [[TRIZ]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] 4521 (2016). Inventive Problem Solving with TRIZ. Fundamentals and Definitions.&lt;/ref&gt; organisational measures for accelerating innovation, IT-solutions for Computer-Aided Innovation, and other tools for [[new product development]], elaborated in the recent decade in the industry and academia.

Initially the AIDA has been conceptualised as systemic approach including analysis, optimizations and further development of the innovation process and promoting the innovation climate in industrial companies. The innovation process with self-configuration, self-optimization, self-diagnostics and intelligent information processing and communication, is understood as a holistic system comprising following typical phases with feedback loops and simultaneous auxiliary or follow-up processes: uncovering of solution-neutral customer needs, technology and market trends, identification of the needs and problems with high market potential and formulation of the innovation tasks and strategy, systematic idea generation and problem solving, evaluation and enhancement of solution ideas, creation of innovation concepts based on solution ideas, evaluation of the innovation concepts as well as [[implementation]], validation and market launch of chosen innovation concepts. &lt;br&gt;
The Advanced Innovation Design Approach was refined and further developed for the application in the field of process engineering in the context of the [[EU]] research project "Intensified by Design - Platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling” within international consortium of 22 universities, research institutes and industrial companies under H2020 SPIRE programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibd-project.eu/ Intensified by Design] - Platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling. EU Research Project (Horizon 2020, SPIRE Programme)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of completeness ==

As a holistic innovation approach, AIDA postulates the complete problem analysis and a comprehensive idea generation and problem solving. The problems faced by the industry can not be solved by single eureka idea. 
The principle of completeness in the new product development can be illustrated by following 4 steps.&lt;ref&gt;Casner D. et al. (2017) [https://www.designsociety.org/publication/39714/Advanced+innovation+design+approach+for+process+engineering Advanced Innovation Design Approach for Process Engineering]. Proceedings of the ICED17 - 21st International Conference of Engineering Design, [[The Design Society|The Design Society]],  Aug. 21-25, 2017, Vancouver, [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
#Initial complex problem must be segmented into the partial problems. The problem ranking method helps to identify problems crucial for innovation success.
#The strongest TRIZ inventive principles replace the random [[brainstorming]], increasing the quality and quantity of ideas within a short period of time.  For each partial problem several ideas must be generated. No relevant idea should be overseen.
#The complementary solution ideas are combined to the solution concepts. A robust solution concept delivers solutions for all partial problems.
#The solution concepts often have their secondary side effects, like costs, risks or R&amp;D expenditures, which must be limited through concept optimization.

Another example demonstrates the principle of completeness in the phase of the innovation strategy formulation. For the complete identification of existing and future customer needs or benefits several complementary methods are used simultaneously (Tool 4. Innovation potential analysis):

'''Aestheticism''' (also the '''Aesthetic Movement''') is an intellectual and [[art movement]] supporting the emphasis of [[aesthetic]] values more than social-political themes for [[literature]], [[fine art]], [[music]] and other [[art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference - 3rd Edition|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|pages=261|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denney, Colleen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvTZrnmy5RoC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Aesthetic+movement%22+swinburne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQGt-5H3y4&amp;sig=Ir3QCh29f7c926rkx620LbcB5fs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kjKSuy9BNDdlAebobGSAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Aesthetic%20movement%22%20swinburne&amp;f=false "At the Temple of Art: the Grosvenor Gallery, 1877-1890"], Issue 1165, p. 38, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8386-3850-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning&amp;nbsp;— "art for art's sake". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as [[Walter Pater]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as [[Harold Bloom]], who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] or [[Decadent movement|decadence]] represented in France, or [[decadentism]]o represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Aesthetic literature==
The British decadent writers were much influenced by the [[Oxford]] professor [[Walter Pater]] and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty.  His text ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the [[Decadent movement]] used the slogan "[[Art for Art's Sake]]" (''L'art pour l'art''), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher [[Victor Cousin]], although [[Angela Leighton]] in the publication ''On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word'' (2007) notes that the phrase was used by [[Benjamin Constant]] as early as 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Leighton (2007) 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted to have been promoted by [[Théophile Gautier]] in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and [[morality]].

[[Image:Design for an Aesthetic theatrical poster.png|thumb|left|300px|One of many ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons about æsthetes]]
The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept [[John Ruskin]],  [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[George MacDonald]]'s conception of art as something moral or useful, "Art for truth's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Raeper, William (1987) George MacDonald, p. 183. Tring, Herts., and Batavia, IL: Lion Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they believed that Art did not have any [[didactic]] purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and [[Synesthesia|synaesthetic]]/[[ideasthesia|Ideasthetic]] effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Predecessors of the Aesthetics included [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and some of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem ''L’Art'' by [[Théophile Gautier]], who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Aesthetic Movement in English Literature|last=McMullen|first=Lorraine|publisher=Bytown Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ but rather “a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.

In Britain the best representatives were [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], both influenced by the French Symbolists, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The style and these poets were satirised by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' and other works, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s drama ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'', and in comic magazines such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' particularly in works by George Du Maurier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YgrdCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=michele%20mendelssohn&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Aesthetic Culture|last=Mendelssohn|first=Michèle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0748623853|location=|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton Mackenzie]]'s novel ''[[Sinister Street]]'' makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of [[Evelyn Waugh]], who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are [[Robert Byron]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Harold Acton]], [[Nancy Mitford]], [[A.E. Housman]] and [[Anthony Powell]].

==Aesthetic visual arts==

Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley|Aubrey Beardsley]]. Although the work of [[Edward Burne-Jones]] was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and  conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition.

==Aesthetic Movement decorative arts==
[[File:Florian Papp Aesthetic Exhibition.jpg|thumb|Aesthetic Movement antiques at [[Florian Papp]], New York City]]
The primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim "art for art's sake", identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially [[fine art]], cannot apply in this context. Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Dresser]]. ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorative art is dissociated from fine art.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'' LXXXI, Saturday, August 12, 1882, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Morley. ''Reform and Eastern Art'' Decorative Arts Society Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.

Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. [[Christopher Dresser]], a student and later Professor at the school  worked with Owen Jones on ''The Grammar of Ornament'', as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862, and ''Principles of Design'' 1873.

Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:
* [[Ebonized]] wood with gilt highlights.
* Far Eastern influence.
* Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers.
* Blue and white on [[porcelain]] and other fine china.

Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.

Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that [[Oscar Wilde]] used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by ''Punch'' magazine and in ''Patience''.

In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled "The House Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;O'brien (1982) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the "Ornamental Aesthetic" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in [[Annandale National Historic Site]], located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular stylem but one such example is [[18 Stafford Terrace]], London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics.

'''Ainola''', meaning "Aino's place", was the home of the composer [[Jean Sibelius]], his wife [[Aino Sibelius|Aino]] and their family from the autumn of 1904 until 1972. It stands on the scenic shores of [[Lake Tuusulanjärvi]] in [[Järvenpää]], 38 kilometers north of [[Helsinki]], the [[Finland|Finnish]] capital. It was designed by the famous  architect [[Lars Sonck]]. The only requests Sibelius had for Sonck were to include both a lakefront view and a green fireplace in the dining room. Water pipes were never installed until after Sibelius died because he did not want the distraction while he was there composing. 

Its distance from the hustle and bustle of the nation's capital gave the composer the peace that he needed for his creative endeavours. [[Erik W. Tawaststjerna]] writes that "when Sibelius first left Helsinki, Järvenpää was to a large extent untouched countryside. Foals and sheep almost nosed their way into the house, and from time to time an elk majestically bestrode the grounds." There were also other artistic families living in the neighborhood who provided a lively social circle for the Sibelius family.

Daily life in Ainola was documented by Sibelius’ private secretary [[Santeri Levas]] in the 1945 photographic book ''Jean Sibelius and His Home''.

[[Image:Ainola sauna.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Ainola’s sauna was designed by Aino Sibelius.]]
Buildings around Ainola include the [[sauna]] and the family's personal workshop. Sibelius died at Ainola on September 20, 1957; he is buried in a garden there. His wife Aino lived in Ainola for the next twelve years until she died on June 8, 1969. She is buried there with her husband.

In 1972 Jean Sibelius' daughters, Eva, Ruth, Katarina, Margareta, and Heidi, sold Ainola to the State of Finland. The [[Government of Finland#Ministry of Education|Ministry of Education]] and the [[Sibelius Society of Finland]] opened it as a museum in 1974. It is currently open from May to September. Among the personal effects remaining there are a grand piano, which was a gift to Sibelius on his fiftieth birthday, and paintings by Aino's brother [[Eero Järnefelt]].

Sir '''Andrew Douglas Maclagan''' &lt;small&gt;[[President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|PRSE]] [[FRCPE]] [[FRCSE]] [[Fellow of the Chemical Society|FCS]] [[FRSSA]]&lt;/small&gt; (17 April 1812, in [[Ayr]] – 5 April 1900, in [[Edinburgh]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] surgeon, [[toxicologist]] and scholar of [[medical jurisprudence]]. He served as president of 5 [[learned societies]]: the [[Royal Medical Society]] (1832), the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (1859–61), the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] (1884–87), the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (1890–5), and the [[Royal Scottish Society of Arts]] (1900).

==Life==
He was born on 17 April 1812 in [[Ayr]] to the Scottish physician [[David Maclagan]] [[FRSE]] (1785–1865), and Jane Whiteside.&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book

He was the elder brother of [[William Dalrymple Maclagan]], who would become [[Archbishop of York]]; and of the engineer and soldier Gen Sir [[Robert Maclagan]]. His youngest brother was the eminent accountant, David Maclagan [[FRSE]] (1824-1883) manager of the Edinburgh Life Assurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]], graduating in 1833. He subsequently toured hospitals in London and in continental Europe with [[James Young Simpson]].

On his return to Scotland, Maclagan was appointed Assistant Surgeon at the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]]. He lectured on ''[[materia medica|Materia Medica]]'' at the [[Extramural School of Medicine]] 1845-1862. Maclagan was a close friend of toxicologist [[Robert Christison]], and he developed an interest in [[toxicology]] and [[forensic medicine]].

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1843, his proposer being [[Robert Christison]]. He served as their Curator 1856-1878, Vice President 1878-1890, and President 1890-1895.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Maclagan was appointed to the Chair of Medical Jurisprudence and Public Health at the University of Edinburgh in 1862, retiring in 1897. This included some of the world's first lectures on Forensic Science.

He died at home, 28 Heriot Row in [[Edinburgh]] on 5 April 1900.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/&gt;

He is buried with his wife and children in [[Dean Cemetery]] on the west side of Edinburgh. He is buried in his father's plot, against the north wall of the original cemetery, backing onto the north extension.

==Family==

His sons included Dr David Philip Maclagan and Dr Robert Craig Maclagan.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/b21465812/b21465812_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials of Note==

In his role both as a toxicologist and forensic scientist Maclagan gave evidence in many trials, including some very notable cases:&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/doyle.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Maclagan family: six generations of service |first=D |last=Doyle |journal=[[Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] |date=2010 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=178–84 |doi=10.4997/JRCPE.2010.217 |publisher=Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aquatic ecosystem''' is an [[ecosystem]]  in a [[body of water]]. [[Biocoenosis|Communities]] of [[biota (ecology)|organisms]] that are dependent on each other and on their environment live in aquatic ecosystems. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine===
{{main|Marine ecosystem}}
Marine ecosystems, the largest of all ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of California Museum of Paleontology: The Marine Biome|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/marine.php?|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover approximately 71% of the [[Earth's surface]] and contain approximately 97% of the planet's water. They generate 32% of the world's net [[primary production]].&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinguished from freshwater ecosystems by the presence of dissolved [[chemical compound|compounds]], especially [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, in the water. Approximately 85% of the dissolved materials in [[seawater]] are [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]]. Seawater has an average salinity of 35 [[parts-per notation|parts per thousand]] of water. Actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web| last = United States Environmental Protection Agency| authorlink = United States Environmental Protection Agency| title = Marine Ecosystems| date = 2 March 2006| url = http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/aquatic/marine.html| accessdate = 2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:oceanic divisions.svg|thumb|300px|right|A classification of marine habitats.]]
Marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. The [[ocean]]ic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live.  The [[benthic]] zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The [[intertidal zone|intertidal]] zone is the area between high and low tides; in this figure it is termed the littoral zone. Other near-shore (neritic) zones can include [[estuary|estuaries]], [[salt marsh]]es, [[coral reef]]s, [[lagoon]]s and [[mangrove]] swamps.  In the deep water, [[hydrothermal vent]]s may occur where [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] [[sulfur]] [[bacteria]] form the base of the food web.

[[class (biology)|Classes]] of organisms found in marine ecosystems include [[brown algae]], [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[coral]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, and [[shark]]s. Fishes caught in marine ecosystems are the biggest source of commercial foods obtained from wild populations.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

Environmental problems concerning marine ecosystems include unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[Fisheries and climate change|climate change]], and building on coastal areas.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

===Freshwater===

{{main|Freshwater ecosystem}}

[[File:Panorama presa las niñas mogan gran canaria.jpg|thumb|640px|left|Freshwater ecosystem.]]{{clear}}
Freshwater ecosystems cover 0.78% of the Earth's surface and inhabit 0.009% of its total water. They generate nearly 3% of its net primary production.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Freshwater ecosystems contain 41% of the world's known fish species.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book

There are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems:
*[[Lentic system ecology|Lentic]]: slow moving water, including [[pond|pool]]s, [[pond]]s, and [[lake]]s.
*[[Lotic System Ecology|Lotic]]: faster moving water, for example [[stream]]s and [[river]]s.
*[[Wetland]]s: areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time.&lt;ref name=Vaccari&gt;{{cite book

===Lentic ===
{{see also|Lake ecosystem}}

[[File:Primary zones of a lake.png|thumb|400px|right|The three primary zones of a lake.]]
Lake ecosystems can be divided into zones. One common system divides lakes into three zones (see figure).  The first, the [[littoral zone]], is the shallow zone near the shore. This is where rooted wetland plants occur.  The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone.  In the open water zone (or photic zone) sunlight supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them.  In the deep water zone, sunlight is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones.  Some systems use other names.  The off shore areas may be called the [[pelagic zone]], the [[photic zone]] may be called the [[limnetic zone]] and the [[aphotic zone]] may be called the [[profundal zone]]. Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a [[riparian zone]] which has plants still affected by the presence of the lake—this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage. The production of the lake as a whole is the result of production from plants growing in the littoral zone, combined with production from plankton growing in the open water.

[[Wetland]]s can be part of the lentic system, as they form naturally along most lake shores, the width of the wetland and littoral zone being dependent upon the slope of the shoreline and the amount of natural change in water levels, within and among years. Often dead trees accumulate in this zone, either from windfalls on the shore or logs transported to the site during floods.  This woody debris provides important habitat for fish and nesting birds, as well as protecting shorelines from erosion.

Two important subclasses of lakes are [[pond]]s, which typically are small lakes that intergrade with wetlands, and water [[reservoir]]s. Over long periods of time, lakes, or bays within them, may gradually become enriched by nutrients and slowly fill in with organic sediments, a process called succession. When humans use the watershed, the volumes of sediment entering the lake can accelerate this process. The addition of sediments and nutrients to a lake is known as [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

====Ponds====

Ponds are small bodies of freshwater with shallow and still water, [[marsh]], and [[aquatic plants]].&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be further divided into four zones: vegetation zone, open water, bottom mud and surface film.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p. p.160-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The size and depth of ponds often varies greatly with the time of year; many ponds are produced by spring flooding from rivers. [[Food web]]s are based both on free-floating [[algae]] and upon aquatic plants. There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators.  Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as [[vernal pools]]. Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;

===Lotic ===
{{see also|River ecosystem}}

The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into [[upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|upland and lowland]] rivers.  The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] derive the majority of their food base from algae. [[Fish migration|Anadromous fish]] are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and [[introduced species]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed.  The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.&lt;ref name= Keddy/&gt;

===Wetlands ===
Wetlands are dominated by [[vascular plant]]s that have adapted to saturated soil.&lt;ref name=Keddy&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Wetland Ecology. Principles and Conservation.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51940-3|page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main types of wetlands: swamp, marsh, fen and bog (both fens and bogs are types of [[mire]]). Wetlands are the most productive natural ecosystems in the world because of the proximity of water and soil. Hence they support large numbers of plant and animal species. Due to their productivity, wetlands are often converted into dry land with [[ditch|dykes]] and [[drainage|drains]] and used for agricultural purposes. The construction of dykes, and dams, has negative consequences for individual wetlands and entire watersheds.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Their closeness to lakes and rivers means that they are often developed for human settlement.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Once settlements are constructed and protected by dykes, the settlements then become vulnerable to land subsidence and ever increasing risk of flooding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;  The Louisiana coast around New Orleans is a well-known example;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., D. Campbell, T. McFalls, G. Shaffer, R. Moreau, C. Dranguet, and R. Heleniak.  2007. The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future.

Earth and Environmental Science, 29, 57–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Aquatic ecosystems perform many important environmental functions. For example, they [[biogeochemical cycle|recycle nutrients]], purify water, attenuate floods, recharge ground water and provide habitats for wildlife.&lt;ref name=Loeb&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Loeb
  | first = Stanford L.
  | title = Biological Monitoring of Aquatic Systems
  | publisher = [[CRC Press]]
  | date = 24 January 1994
  | isbn = 0-87371-910-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic ecosystems are also used for human recreation, and are very important to the [[tourism]] industry, especially in coastal regions.&lt;ref name=Daily/&gt;

The health of an aquatic ecosystem is degraded when the ecosystem's ability to absorb a stress has been exceeded. A stress on an aquatic ecosystem can be a result of physical, chemical or biological alterations of the environment. Physical alterations include changes in water temperature, water flow and light availability. Chemical alterations include changes in the loading rates of biostimulatory nutrients, oxygen consuming materials, and toxins. Biological alterations include over-harvesting of commercial species and the introduction of exotic species. Human populations can impose excessive stresses on aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; There are many examples of excessive stresses with negative consequences. Consider three. The environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America illustrates this problem, particularly how multiple stresses, such as water pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species can combine.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"&gt;Vallentyne, J. R. (1974). The Algal Bowl: Lakes and Man, Miscellaneous Special Publication No. 22. Ottawa, ON: Department of the Environment, Fisheries and Marine Service.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norfolk Broadlands in England illustrate similar decline with pollution and invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, B. (1983). The Norfolk Broadland: experiments in the restoration of a complex wetland. Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 58, 521–561.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lake Pontchartrain along the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the negative effects of different stresses including levee construction, logging of swamps, invasive species and salt water intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P. A., Campbell, D., McFalls T., Shaffer, G., Moreau, R., Dranguet, C., and Heleniak, R. (2007). The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future. Environmental Reviews, 15, 1–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abiotic characteristics==
An ecosystem is composed of [[Biotic component|biotic]] communities that are structured by biological interactions and [[abiotic]] environmental factors. Some of the important abiotic environmental factors of aquatic ecosystems include substrate type, water depth, nutrient levels, temperature, salinity, and flow.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; It is often difficult to determine the relative importance of these factors without rather large experiments.  There may be complicated feedback loops.  For example, sediment may determine the presence of aquatic plants, but aquatic plants may also trap sediment, and add to the sediment through peat.

The amount of dissolved oxygen in a water body is frequently the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of organic life in the water body. Fish need dissolved oxygen to survive, although their tolerance to low oxygen varies among species; in extreme cases of low oxygen some fish even resort to air gulping.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J. B. (1997). Air Breathing Fishes. San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants often have to produce [[aerenchyma]], while the shape and size of leaves may also be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Sculthorpe, C. D. (1967). The Biology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Reprinted 1985 Edward Arnold, by London.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, oxygen is fatal to many kinds of [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] bacteria.&lt;ref name=Manahan&gt;{{cite book| last = Manahan| first = Stanley E.| title = Environmental Chemistry| publisher = [[CRC Press]]| date = 1 January 2005| isbn = 1-56670-633-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutrient levels are important in controlling the abundance of many species of algae.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1982). The nitrogen and phosphorus dependence of algal biomass in lakes: an empirical and theoretical analysis. Limnology and Oceanography, 27, 1101–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus can in effect determine which species of algae come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1983). Low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios favor dominance by bluegreen algae in lake phytoplankton. Science, 221, 669–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Algae are a very important source of food for aquatic life, but at the same time, if they become over-abundant, they can cause declines in fish when they decay.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"/&gt; Similar over-abundance of algae in coastal environments such as the Gulf of Mexico produces, upon decay, a hypoxic region of water known as a [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. E. and Rabelais, N. N. (2003). Linking landscape and water quality in the Mississippi River Basin for 200 years. BioScience, 53, 563–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salinity of the water body is also a determining factor in the kinds of species found in the water body. Organisms in marine ecosystems tolerate salinity, while many freshwater organisms are intolerant of salt. The degree of salinity in an estuary or delta is an important control upon the type of [[wetland]] (fresh, intermediate, or brackish), and the associated animal species.  Dams built upstream may reduce spring flooding, and reduce sediment accretion, and may therefore lead to saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands.&lt;ref name = Keddy/&gt;

Freshwater used for [[irrigation]] purposes often absorbs levels of salt that are harmful to freshwater organisms.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt;

The biotic characteristics are mainly determined by the organisms that occur.  For example, wetland plants may produce dense canopies that cover large areas of sediment—or snails or geese may graze the vegetation leaving large mud flats. Aquatic environments have relatively low oxygen levels, forcing adaptation by the organisms found there.  For example, many wetland plants must produce [[aerenchyma]] to carry oxygen to roots. Other biotic characteristics are more subtle and difficult to measure, such as the relative importance of competition, mutualism or predation.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; There are a growing number of cases where predation by coastal herbivores including snails, geese and mammals appears to be a dominant biotic factor.&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, B. R., Grosholz, E. D., and Bertness, M. D. (eds.) (2009). Human Impacts on Salt Marshes: A Global Perspective. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotrophic organisms===
[[Autotroph]]ic organisms are producers that generate organic compounds from inorganic material. Algae use solar energy to generate biomass from carbon dioxide and are possibly the most important autotrophic organisms in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; The more shallow the water, the greater the biomass contribution from rooted and floating vascular plants. These two sources combine to produce the extraordinary production of estuaries and wetlands, as this autotrophic biomass is converted into fish, birds, amphibians and other aquatic species.

Chemosynthetic bacteria are found in benthic marine ecosystems. These organisms are able to feed on [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water that comes from [[volcanic vent]]s. Great concentrations of animals that feed on these bacteria are found around volcanic vents. For example, there are [[giant tube worm]]s (''Riftia pachyptila'') 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in length and clams (''[[Calyptogena magnifica]]'') 30&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book| last = Chapman| first = J.L.|author2=Reiss, M.J.| title = Ecology| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| date = 10 December 1998| isbn = 0-521-58802-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterotrophic organisms===
[[Heterotrophic]] organisms consume autotrophic organisms and use the organic compounds in their bodies as energy sources and as raw materials to create their own [[biomass]].&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; [[Euryhaline]] organisms are salt tolerant and can survive in marine ecosystems, while [[stenohaline]] or salt intolerant species can only live in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;

The chalcolithic [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]], in Eastern Europe, left behind thousands of [[Human settlement|settlement]] ruins, circa 6000 to 3500 BC, containing a wealth of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] attesting to their [[Archaeological culture|cultural]] and [[Assemblage (archaeology)|technological]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mallory"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mallory|first1= James P|title= In search of the Indo-Europeans: language, archaeology and myth |year=1989 |publisher= Thames and Hudson |location= London |isbn=0-500-05052-X |oclc= 246601873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction techniques==
{{See also|Neolithic architecture}}
The houses of the Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements were constructed in several general ways:
* Wattle and daub homes.
* Log homes, called ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|площадки}} ''ploshchadki'').
* Semi-underground homes called [[Bordei]].
Some Cucuteni-Trypillia homes were two storeys tall, and evidence shows that the members of this culture sometimes decorated the outsides of their homes with many of the same complex red-ochre swirling designs that are to be found on their pottery. Most houses had thatched roofs and wooden floors covered with clay.
Archaeologists have identified two types of [[Timber framing|house framing]] found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites. One type, somewhat resembling the [[Post and lintel|post and beam]] style, used evenly distributed fork-shaped log pillars that were partially sunk vertically into the ground so that the fork was located at the top and supported the roof beams above. The other type of framing used vertical beams measuring {{cvt|15|–|20|cm|in|disp=x|in diameter (|)}}, or greater, which rested on horizontal ground-sill foundational timbers that were in turn fixed in place on top of the soil.

Most of the walls were built in the [[Wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]] style. The construction of these houses first started by erecting the framework of larger timbers in place [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/123.ridicare.casa.stadiul.1.poz.2.jpg (photo 1)], which would take the weight of the structure, and then the space between these timbers would be filled in with a "wattle" made of pliable smaller branches and vines woven together to form a thin twiggy [[Latticework|latticed]] net which was then affixed to the sturdy timbers [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/116.peretele.c.impletitura.orizontala.jpg (photo 2)]. Onto this wattle framework the "daub" would be applied made of mostly dampened clay soil although sometimes mixed with small bits of straw and/or animal dung to help keep its structural integrity ([http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/145.jpg photo 3]). The daub had to be applied with some force against the wattle in order for it to partially push through the twiggy framework, to which it would stick. Sometimes there would only be a single layer of wattle, and at other times two wattle layers would be used; one for the interior and another for the exterior of the wall. Daub was applied on both sides of the wall, inside and out [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/casa.jpg (photo 4)], creating a finished wall that was usually about {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick. Once applied it was smoothed before drying to create an air- and water-tight barrier against the elements [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/last.jpg (photo 5)]. After the daub was fully dried, it was usually painted with [[Lime plaster|lime]] to prevent infestations of [[Pest (organism)|pests]].(''note: the photographic examples used in this paragraph were taken from the web page "Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house", hosted by The Archaeological Park Cucuteni, see "External Links" at bottom of this article'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house |publisher=The Archaeological Park Cucuteni |url= http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/ine.html |language=English, Romanian |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628222111/http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/ine.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the walls were made of [[Log home|horizontally laid timbers]] (similar to log homes) that were then covered with clay daub. Some examples have been found where the horizontal timbers were in turn covered with a wattle-and-daub layer. At other times the horizontal timbers would be covered with a layer of primitively finished lumber. There was no standard practice in building walls there during Neolithic times; sometimes, even in the same house, walls would be constructed with horizontal timbers while others would be covered with finished lumber or wattle-and-daub. This type of horizontal log construction found in Cucuteni-Trypillia houses is called {{lang-ru|italic=yes|площадки}} ''ploshchadki'' in Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Darvill |first= Timothy |work= Archaeology Dictionary |title= definition: ploshchadki | publisher= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology |year=2003 |url= http://www.answers.com/topic/ploshchadki |format= online system or service |oclc= 425961211 |accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Kipfer |first= Barbara Ann |authorlink =Barbara Ann Kipfer&lt;!--http://archaeologywordsmith.com/arch-cv.php--&gt; |work= Archaeology Wordsmith |title= definition: ploshchadki | publisher = Dr. Barbara Ann Kipfer |url= http://archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=ploshchadki |format= online system or service |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cucuteni-Trypillia houses were roofed with [[Sod|live turf]] or [[Thatching|thatched reeds]].&lt;ref name="Cucoș1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cucoș | first = Ștefan |title= Faza Cucuteni B în zona subcarpatică a Moldovei | trans-title= Cucuteni B period in the lower Carpathian region of Moldova | journal = Bibliotheca Memoriae antiquitatis (BMA) (Memorial Library antiquities) | volume = 6 | publisher = Muzeul de Istorie Piatra Neamț (Historical Museum Piatra Neamț) | location = Piatra Neamț, Romania | year = 1999 | url = http://www.neamt.ro/cmj/istorie/piatra-neamt/BMA_2.html | language = Romanian | oclc = 223302267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the house was usually rectangular but some were laid out in an "L" shape.

==Bordei dwellings==
{{See also|Bordei}}
Some of the houses found by archeologists were [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] [[earth house]]s, of the style called ''bordei'' in both Romanian ({{lang-ro |italic=yes|bordei}}) and Ukrainian ({{lang-ua|italic=yes|бордей}}). Unlike surface dwellings characterized by walls with right angles and rectangular shapes the bordei houses were characterized by elliptical shapes. These houses would typically have a wooden [[floor]] that was about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} below ground, which would place the roof at just above ground level.&lt;ref name="Sorochin" /&gt; Images of bordei homes may be seen at the Romanian Art Zone page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Grigorescu |first=Nicolae |title=Bordei in padure |trans-title=Bordei in the forest |publisher=Art Zone |date=1838–1907 |url=http://art-zone.ro/picturi/ng/2/Bordei_in_padure_nicolae_grigorescu.html |postscript=An online reproduction of an oil painting done by Romanian artist Nicolae Grigorescu (1838—1907) |accessdate=6 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201190925/http://art-zone.ro/picturi/ng/2/Bordei_in_padure_nicolae_grigorescu.html |archivedate=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==House interior==
[[File:Cucuteni House Clay Model.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Clay Model of house interior with two fireplaces]]
Most of the Cucuteni-Trypillia houses were arranged by locating the front door opposite from where the [[fireplace]] sat. Large ceramic pottery containers used to store water and grain were placed next to the fireplace. Other ceramic containers, including the more valuable painted pottery, would also be located near the fireplace. Some of the fine painted pottery for which this culture is known would be used for clothing storage but most of it seems to have been used in rituals.&lt;ref name="Monah"&gt;{{Citation |first=Dan |last=Monah |author-link=Dan Monah &lt;!--http://www.arheo.ro/text/colectiv/Pagini_personale/Monah%20Dan.html--&gt; |editor-last=Dumitroaia |editor-first=Gheorghe |contribution = Religie si arta in cultura Cucuteni (Religion and art in Cucuteni culture) |booktitle=Primul muzeu Cucuteni din Romania |title=Muzeul Cucuteni prima pentru Romania |trans-title=The first Cucuteni museum for Romania |series=Bibliotheca memoriae antiquitatis XV |year=2005 |pages=162–173 |place=Piatra-Neamț, Romania |publisher=Editura Foton |language=Romanian |oclc=319165024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of fireplaces found within each house varied from just one (which was the most common) to several, or even none. Each of the fireplaces found in houses that had more than one would have its own specific use such as one for cooking, one for [[Kiln|firing ceramics]], etc. Most Cucuteni-Trypillia fireplaces were a type of open [[fire pit]] and were usually constructed on the floor by laying down a bed of clay mixed with broken pottery shards and then covering this with a smooth clay-plastered surface.

It is assumed that furniture was extensively used however, due to the climate of this region, wood does not preserve well here. However some of the many miniature clay figurines found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites were placed sitting or reclining on different pieces of furniture, some of which resemble sofas, chairs, or even ovens. There is also some evidence of furniture being incorporated into the structure of the walls of houses by using woven branches covered with clay.&lt;ref name="Krichevski"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Кричевский  (Krichevski) | first = Евгений Юрьевич (Evgeniye Yurivich) | title = Трипольские площадки ; по раскопкам последних лет (Triploskiye ploshchadki : po raskopkam poslednič let) |trans-title=Trypillian ploshchadki : on the excavations of recent years | journal = Советская археология (''Sovyetskaya arkheologiya'' Soviet Archeology) | volume = 6 | publisher = институтом археологии АН СССР (Archeological Institute A.N.

[[File:Memory-seals.jpg|thumb|Graphical memory devices from the works of [[Giordano Bruno]]]]

The '''art of memory''' (Latin: ''ars memoriae'') is any of a number of loosely associated [[mnemonic]] principles and techniques used to organize memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. An alternative and frequently used term is "Ars Memorativa" which is also often translated as "art of memory" although its more literal meaning is "Memorative Art". It is sometimes referred to as ''mnemotechnics''.&lt;ref&gt;In her general introduction to the subject (''The Art of Memory'', 1966, p4) Frances Yates suggests that "it may be misleading to dismiss it with the label 'mnemotechnics'" and "The word 'mnemotechnics' hardly conveys what the artificial memory of Cicero may have been like". Furthermore, "mnemotechnics", etymologically speaking, emphasizes practical application, whereas the art of memory certainly includes general principles and a certain degree of 'theory'.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an 'art' in the Aristotelian sense, which is to say a method or set of prescriptions that adds order and discipline to the pragmatic, natural activities of human beings.&lt;ref name="Carruthers_1990_123"&gt;Carruthers 1990, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; It has existed as a recognized group of principles and techniques since at least as early as the middle of the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BCE]],&lt;ref&gt;Simonedes of Ceos, the poet credited by the ancients with the discovery of fundamental principles of this art, was active around 500 BCE, and in any case a fragment known as the ''Dialexis'', which is dated to about 400 BCE contains a short section on memory which outlines features known to be central to the fully developed classical art.

Hornblower and Spawforth, 1999, p1409.&lt;/ref&gt; and was usually associated with training in [[rhetoric]] or [[logic]], but variants of the art were employed in other contexts, particularly the religious and  the magical.

Techniques commonly employed in the art include the association of emotionally striking memory images within visualized locations, the chaining or association of groups of images, the association of images with schematic graphics or ''notae'' ("signs, markings, figures" in Latin), and the association of text with images. Any or all of these techniques were often used in combination with the contemplation or study of architecture, books, sculpture and painting, which were seen by practitioners of the art of memory as externalizations of internal memory images and/or organization.

Because of the variety of principles and techniques, and their various applications, some researchers refer to "the arts of memory", rather than to a single art.&lt;ref name="Carruthers_1990_123"/&gt;

==Origins and history==
It has been suggested that the art of memory originated among the [[Pythagoreans]] or perhaps even earlier among the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, but no conclusive evidence has been presented to support these claims.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 1966, pp. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary classical sources for the art of memory which deal with the subject at length include the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' (Bk III), [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De oratore]]'' (Bk II 350-360), and [[Quintilian]]'s ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' (Bk XI). Additionally, the art is mentioned in fragments from earlier Greek works including the ''[[Dialexis]]'', dated to approximately 400 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 1966, pp. 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] wrote extensively on the subject of memory, and mentions the technique of the placement of images to lend order to memory. Passages in his works ''[[On The Soul]]'' and ''[[On Memory|On Memory and Reminiscence]]'' proved to be influential in the later revival of the art among [[Medieval philosophy|medieval Scholastics]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's assertion that we cannot contemplate or understand without an image in the mind's eye representing the thing considered was also highly influential. Aristotle, De Anima 3.8 in ''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', ed. Jonathan Barnes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common account of the creation of the art of memory centers around the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]], a famous [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek poet]], who was invited to chant a [[lyric poem]] in honor of his host, a nobleman of [[Thessaly]]. While praising his host, Simonides also mentioned the twin gods [[Castor and Pollux]].  When the recital was complete, the nobleman selfishly told Simonides that he would only pay him half of the agreed upon payment for the [[panegyric]], and that he would have to get the balance of the payment from the two gods he had mentioned. A short time later, Simonides was told that two men were waiting for him outside.  He left to meet the visitors but could find no one.  Then, while he was outside the banquet hall, it collapsed, crushing everyone within. The bodies were so disfigured that they could not be identified for proper burial. But, Simonides was able to remember where each of the guests had been sitting at the table, and so was able to identify them for burial. This experience suggested to Simonides the principles which were to become central to the later development of the art he reputedly invented.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 1966, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He inferred that persons desiring to train this faculty (of memory) must select places and form mental images of the things they wish to remember and store those images in the places, so that the order of the places will preserve the order of the things, and the images of the things will denote the things themselves, and we shall employ the places and the images respectively as a [[wax tablet|wax writing-tablet]] and the letters written upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, De oratore, II, lxxxvi, 351-4, English translation by E.W. Sutton and H. Rackham from Loeb Classics Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Art of memory, "De praeternaturali utriusque..." Fludd, 1621 Wellcome L0016208.jpg|thumb|''Ars Memoriæ'', by Robert Fludd]]

The early [[Christian monasticism|Christian monks]] adapted techniques common in the art of memory as an art of composition and [[Christian meditation|meditation]], which was in keeping with the [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] and [[Dialectic|dialectical]] context in which it was originally taught. It became the basic method for reading and meditating upon the Bible after making the text secure within one's memory. Within this tradition, the art of memory was passed along to the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] (or Early Modern period). When Cicero and Quintilian were revived after the 13th century, humanist scholars understood the language of these ancient writers within the context of the medieval traditions they knew best, which were profoundly altered by monastic practices of meditative reading and composition.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] was an important influence in promoting the art when he defined it as a part of [[Prudence]] and recommended its use to meditate on the virtues and to improve one's piety.  In [[scholasticism]] artificial memory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/artificial_memory|title=artificial memory - definition of artificial memory in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to be used as a method for recollecting the whole universe and the roads to Heaven and Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers &amp; Ziolkowski 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were particularly important in promoting its uses,&lt;ref&gt;Bolzoni 2004&lt;/ref&gt; see for example [[Cosmos Rossellius]].

The [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Matteo Ricci]] - who from 1582 until his death in 1610, worked to introduce [[Christianity]] to [[China]] - described the system of places and images in his work, ''A Treatise On Mnemonics''. However, he advanced it only as an aid to passing examinations (a kind of rote memorization) rather than as a means of new composition, though it  had traditionally been taught, both in dialectics and in rhetoric, as a tool for such composition or 'invention'. Ricci was apparently trying to gain favour with the Chinese imperial service, which required a notoriously difficult entry examination.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GiordanoBrunomnemonic.gif|alt=|thumb|One of Giordano Bruno's simpler pieces]]
Perhaps following the example of [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]], vaguely described in Quintilian's ''Institutio oratoria'', [[Giordano Bruno]], a defrocked Dominican, used a variation of the art in which the trained memory was based in some fashion upon the zodiac. Apparently, his elaborate method was also based in part on the combinatoric concentric circles of [[Ramon Llull]], in part upon schematic diagrams in keeping with medieval ''Ars Notoria'' traditions, in part upon groups of words and images associated with late antique [[Hermeticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruno's use of groups of words may also be associated with the use of shorthand, or with techniques associated with shorthand in antiquity. Yates (1966) mentions the possibility of a relationship between shorthand ''notae'' and the art(s) of memory (p15 ''footnote 16'') and the possible role of shorthand ''notae'' in 'magical' memory training (p43). ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' (Third Edition, 1999, in the article "tachygraphy") discusses the formal characteristics of late Hellenistic shorthand manuals, noting "These show a fully organized system, composed of a syllabary and a (so-called) Commentary, consisting of groups of words, arranged in fours or occasionally eights, with a sign attached to each, which had to memorized." This can be compared with Bruno's atria in ''De Imaginum, Signorum, et Idearum Compositione'' (1591) in which groups of 24 words are each associated within an atrium with ''Atrii Imago'' (e.g. ''Altare'', ''Basili'', ''Carcer'', ''Domus'', etc.)&lt;/ref&gt; and in part upon the classical architectural mnemonic. According to one influential interpretation, his memory system was intended to fill the mind of the practitioner with images representing all knowledge of the world, and was to be used, in a magical sense, as an avenue to reach the intelligible world beyond appearances, and thus enable one to powerfully influence events in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', 1966; ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  Such enthusiastic claims for the encyclopedic reach of the art of memory are a feature of the early Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the "Memory Theater" of Giulio Camillo discussed by Yates (1966, pp 129-159)&lt;/ref&gt; but the art also gave rise to better-known developments in logic and [[scientific method]] during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Yates 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this transition was not without its difficulties, and during this period the belief in the effectiveness of the older methods of memory training (to say nothing of the esteem in which its practitioners were held) steadily became [[occult|occluded]]. In 1584, a huge controversy over the method broke out in England when the [[Puritans]] attacked the art as impious because it was thought to excite absurd and obscene thoughts; this was a sensational, but ultimately not a fatal skirmish.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', 1966, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam and other humanists, Protestant and Catholic, had also chastised practitioners of the art of memory for making extravagant claims for its efficacy, although they themselves believed firmly in a well-disposed, orderly memory as an essential tool of productive thought.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers &amp; Ziolkowski 2002; Rossi 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for the steady decline in the importance of the art of memory from the 16th to the 20th century is offered by the late [[Ioan P. Culianu]],  who argued that it was suppressed during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] when Protestants and reactionary Catholics alike worked to eradicate pagan influence and the lush visual imagery of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Culianu 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the causes, in keeping with general developments, the art of memory eventually came to be defined primarily as a part of [[Dialectics]], and was assimilated in the 17th century by [[Francis Bacon]] and [[René Descartes]] into the curriculum of Logic, where it survives to this day as a necessary foundation for the teaching of Argument.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi 2000 p102; Bolzoni 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplified variants of the art of memory were also taught through the 19th century as useful to public orators, including preachers and [[Individual_events_(speech)#After_Dinner_Speaking|after-dinner speaker]]s.

==Principles==

===Visual sense and spatial orientation===
Perhaps the most important principle of the art is the dominance of the visual sense in combination with the orientation of 'seen' objects within space. This principle is reflected in the early ''Dialexis'' fragment on memory, and is found throughout later texts on the art. [[Mary Carruthers]], in a review of [[Hugh of St. Victor]]'s ''Didascalion'', emphasizes the importance of the visual sense as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even what we hear must be attached to a visual image. To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking as well as the appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, pp. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This passage emphasizes the association of the visual sense with spatial orientation. The image of the speaker is placed ''in a room''. The importance of the visual sense in the art of memory would seem to lead naturally to the importance of a spatial context, given that our sight and depth-perception naturally position images seen within space.

===Order===
The positioning of images in virtual space leads naturally to an order, furthermore, an order to which we are naturally accustomed as biological organisms, deriving as it does from the sense perceptions we use to orient ourselves in the world. This fact perhaps sheds light on the relationship between the ''artificial'' and the ''natural'' memory, which were clearly distinguished in antiquity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is possible for one with a well-trained memory to compose clearly in an organized fashion on several different subjects. Once one has the all-important starting-place of the ordering scheme and the contents firmly in their places within it, it is quite possible to move back and forth from one distinct composition to another without losing one's place or becoming confused.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again discussing Hugh of St. Victor's works on memory, Carruthers clearly notes the critical importance of order in memory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One must have a rigid, easily retained order, with a definite beginning. Into this order one places the components of what one wishes to memorize and recall. As a [[money-changer]] ("nummularium") separates and classifies his coins by type in his [[money bag]] ("sacculum," "marsupium"), so the contents of wisdom's storehouse ("thesaurus," "archa"), which is the memory, must be classified according to a definite, orderly scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Limited sets===
Many works discussing the art of memory emphasize the importance of ''brevitas'' and ''divisio'', or the breaking up of a long series into more manageable sets. This is reflected in advice on forming images or groups of images which can be taken in at a single glance, as well as in  discussions of memorizing lengthy passages, "A long text must always be broken up into short segments, numbered, then memorized a few pieces at a time."&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers 1990, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  This is known in modern terminology as [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]].

===Association===
[[File:Johann Romberch, Congestorium artificiose... Wellcome L0032270.jpg|thumb|''Congestorium artificiose memoriae'', by Johann Romberch]]

Association was considered to be of critical importance for the practice of the art. However, it was clearly recognized that associations in memory are idiosyncratic, hence, what works for one will not automatically work for all. For this reason, the [[associative value]]s given for images in memory texts are usually intended as examples and are not intended to be "universally normative". Yates offers a passage from Aristotle that briefly outlines the principle of association. In it, he mentions the importance of a starting point to initiate a chain of recollection, and the way in which it serves as a stimulating cause.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For this reason some use places for the purposes of recollecting. The reason for this is that men pass rapidly from one step to the next; for instance from milk to white, from white to air, from air to damp; after which one recollects autumn, supposing that one is trying to recollect the season.&lt;ref&gt;''De memoria et reminiscentia'', 452 8-16, cited in Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', 1966, p34&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Affect===
The importance of affect or emotion in the art of memory is frequently discussed. The role of emotion in the art can be divided into two major groupings: the first is the role of emotion in the process of seating or fixing images in the memory, the second is the way in which the recollection of a memory image can evoke an emotional response.

One of the earliest sources discussing the art, the ''Ad Herennium''  emphasizes the importance of using emotionally striking imagery to ensure that the images will be retained in memory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We ought, then, to set up images of a kind that can adhere longest in memory. And we shall do so if we establish similitudes as striking as possible; if we set up images that are not many or vague but active; if we assign to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we ornament some of them, as with crowns or purple cloaks, so that the similitude may be more distinct to us; or if we somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud and smeared with red paint, so that its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Herrenium'', III, xxii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, the image associated with an emotion will call up the emotion when recollected. Carruthers discusses this in the context of the way in which the trained medieval memory was thought to be intimately related with the development of prudence or moral judgement.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since each phantasm is a combination not only of the neutral form of the perception, but of our response to it (''intentio'') concerning whether it is helpful or hurtful, the phantasm by its very nature evokes emotion. This is how the phantasm and the memory which stores it helps to cause or bring  into being moral excellence and ethical judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, 1990, pp. 67-71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern terminology, the concept that salient, bizarre, shocking, or simply unusual information will be more easily remembered can be referred to as the [[Von Restorff effect]].

===Repetition===
The well-known role of repetition in the common process of memorization of course plays a role in the more complex techniques of the art of memory. The earliest of the references to the art of memory, the ''Dialexis'', mentioned above, makes this clear: "repeat again what you hear; for by often hearing and saying the same things, what you have learned comes complete into your memory."&lt;ref&gt;from the excerpt of this work available in Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', 1966, p29&lt;/ref&gt; Similar advice is a commonplace in later works on the art of memory.

==Techniques==
The art of memory employed a number of techniques which can be grouped as follows for purposes of discussion, however they were usually used in some combination:

===Architectural mnemonic===
{{main|Method of loci}}
The architectural mnemonic was a key group of techniques employed in the art of memory. It is based on the use of places (Latin ''loci''), which were memorized by practitioners as the framework or ordering structure that would 'contain' the images or signs 'placed' within it to record experience or knowledge. To use this method one might walk through a building several times, viewing distinct places within it, in the same order each time. After the necessary repetitions of this process, one should be able to remember and visualize each of the places reliably and in order. If one wished to remember, for example, a speech, one could break up the content of the speech into images or signs used to memorize its parts, which would then be 'placed' in the locations previously memorized. The components of the speech could then be recalled in order by imagining that one is walking through the building again, visiting each of the loci in order, viewing the images there, and thereby recalling the elements of the speech in order. A reference to these techniques survives to this day in the common English phrases "in the first place", "in the second place", and so forth{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. These techniques, or variants, are sometimes referred to as [[Method of loci|"the method of loci"]], which is discussed in a separate section below. 

The primary source for the architectural mnemonic is the anonymous ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', a Latin work on rhetoric from the first century BCE. It is unlikely that the technique originated with the author of the ''Ad Herennium''. The technique is also mentioned by [[Cicero]] and Quintilian. According to the account in the ''Ad Herennium'' (Book III) backgrounds or 'places' are like wax tablets, and the images that are 'placed' on or within them are like writing. Real physical locations were apparently commonly used as the basis of memory places, as the author of the ''Ad Herennium'' suggests

&lt;blockquote&gt;
it will be more advantageous to obtain backgrounds in a deserted than in a populous region, because the crowding and passing to and fro of people confuse and weaken the impress of the images, while solitude keeps their outlines sharp.&lt;ref&gt;Book III, xix, 31, Loeb Classics  English translation by Harry Caplan&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, real physical locations were not the only source of places. The author goes on to suggest

&lt;blockquote&gt;
if we are not content with our ready-made supply of backgrounds, we may in our imagination create a region for ourselves and obtain a most serviceable distribution of appropriate backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Book III, xix, 32, Loeb Classics  English translation by Harry Caplan&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Places or backgrounds hence require, and reciprocally impose, order (often deriving from the spatial characteristics of the physical location memorized, in cases where an actual physical structure provided the basis for the 'places'). This order itself organizes the images, preventing confusion during recall. The anonymous author also advises that places should be well lit, with orderly intervals, and distinct from one another. He recommends a virtual 'viewing distance' sufficient to allow the viewer to encompass the space and the images it contains with a single glance.

Turning to images, the anonymous author asserts that they are of two kinds: those establishing a likeness based upon subject, and those establishing a likeness based upon a word. This was the basis for the subsequent distinction, commonly found in works on the art of memory, between 'memory for words' and 'memory for things'. He provides the following famous example of a likeness based upon subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Often we encompass the record of an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor has said that the defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin ''testiculi'' suggests ''testes'' or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Book III, xix, 33, Loeb Classics  English translation by Harry Caplan&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In order to memorize likenesses based on words he provides an example of a verse and describes how images may be placed, each of which corresponds to words in the verse. He notes however that the technique will not work without combination with rote memorization of the verse, so that the images call to mind the previously memorized words.

The architectural mnemonic was also related to the broader concept of learning and thinking. Aristotle considered the technique in relation to topica, or conceptual areas or issues. In his ''Topics'' he suggested

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For just as in a person with a trained memory, a memory of things themselves is immediately caused by the mere mention of their places, so these habits too will make a man readier in reasoning, because he has his premisses classified before his mind's eye, each under its number.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Topica, 163, 24-30 (translated by W.A. Pickard-Cambridge in Works of Aristotle, ed. W.D. Ross, Oxford, 1928, Vol. I), cited in Yates, The Art of Memory, 1966, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Graphical mnemonic===
Because of the influence of the pioneering work of [[Frances Yates]], the architectural mnemonic is often characterized as the art of memory itself. However, primary sources show that from very early in the development of the art, non-physical or abstract locations and/or spatial graphics were employed as memory 'places'. Perhaps the most famous example of such an abstract system of 'places' is the memory system of Metrodorus of Scepsis, who was said by Quintilian to have organized his memory using a system of backgrounds in which he "found three hundred and sixty places in the twelve signs of the zodiac through which the sun moves". Some researchers (L.A. Post and Yates) believe it likely that Metorodorus organized his memory using places based in some way upon the signs of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 1966, pp. 39-42&lt;/ref&gt; In any case Quintilian makes it clear that non-alphabetic signs can be employed as memory images, and even goes on to mention how 'shorthand' signs (''notae'') can be used to signify things that would otherwise be impossible to capture in the form of a definite image (he gives "conjunctions" as an example).&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, Institutio oratoria, XI, ii, 23-26, Loeb Edition English translation by H. E. Butler&lt;/ref&gt;

This makes it clear that though the architectural mnemonic with its buildings, niches and three-dimensional images was a major theme of the art as practiced in classical times, it often employed signs or notae and sometimes even non-physical imagined spaces. During the period of migration of barbarian tribes and the transformation of the Roman empire the architectural mnemonic fell into disuse. However the use of tables, charts and signs appears to have continued and developed independently. Mary Carruthers has made it clear that a trained memory occupied a central place in late antique and medieval pedagogy, and has documented some of the ways in which the development of medieval memorial arts was intimately intertwined with the emergence of the book as we understand it today. Examples of the development of the potential inherent in the graphical mnemonic include the lists and combinatory wheels of the Majorcan Ramon Llull. The Art of Signs (Latin ''Ars Notoria'') is also very likely a development of the graphical mnemonic. Yates mentions [[Apollonius of Tyana]] and his reputation for memory, as well as the association between trained memory, astrology and divination.&lt;ref&gt;Yates 1966, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to suggest

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It may have been out of this atmosphere that there was formed a tradition which, going underground for centuries and suffering transformations in the process, appeared in the Middle Ages as the ''Ars Notoria'', a magical art of memory attributed to Apollonius or sometimes to Solomon. The practitioner of the ''Ars Notoria'' gazed at figures or diagrams curiously marked and called 'notae' whilst reciting magical prayers. He hoped to gain in this way knowledge, or memory, of all the arts and sciences, a different 'nota' being provided for each discipline. The ''Ars Notoria'' is perhaps a descendant of the classical art of memory, or of that difficult branch of it which used the shorthand ''notae''. It was regarded as a particularly black kind of magic and was severely condemned by Thomas Aquinas.&lt;ref&gt;Yates 1966, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Textual mnemonic===
Carruthers's studies of memory suggest that the images and pictures employed in the medieval arts of memory were not representational in the sense we today understand that term. Rather, images were understood to function "textually", as a type of 'writing', and not as something different from it in kind.&lt;ref name="Carruthers_1990_222"&gt;Carruthers 1990, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

If such an assessment is correct, it suggests that the use of text to recollect memories was, for medieval practitioners, merely a variant of techniques employing ''notae'', images and other non-textual devices. Carruthers quotes [[Pope Gregory I]], in support of the idea that 'reading' pictures was considered to be a variation of reading itself.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is one thing to worship a picture, it is another by means of pictures to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated. For what writing makes present to those reading, the same picturing makes present to the uneducated, to those perceiving visually, because in it the ignorant see what they ought to follow, in it they read who do not know letters. Wherefore, and especially for the common people, picturing is the equivalent of reading.&lt;ref name="Carruthers_1990_222"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her work makes clear that for medieval readers the act of reading itself had an oral phase in which the text was read aloud or sub-vocalized (silent reading was a less common variant, and appears to have been the exception rather than the rule), then meditated upon and 'digested' hence making it one's own. She asserts that both 'textual' activities (picturing and reading) have as their goal the internalization of knowledge and experience in memory.

The use of manuscript illuminations to reinforce the memory of a particular textual passage, the use of visual alphabets such as those in which birds or tools represent letters, the use of illuminated capital letters at the openings of passages, and even the structure of the modern book (itself deriving from scholastic developments) with its index, table of contents and chapters reflect the fact that reading was a memorial practice, and the use of text was simply another technique in the arsenal of practitioners of the arts of memory.

==Method of loci==
{{Main|Method of loci}}

The 'method of loci' (plural of Latin ''locus'' for place or location) is a general designation for mnemonic techniques that rely upon memorized spatial relationships to establish, order and recollect memorial content. The term is most often found in specialized works on [[psychology]], [[neurobiology]] and [[memory]], though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on Rhetoric, Logic and [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in a discussion of "topical memory" (yet another designator) Jamieson mentions that "memorial lines, or verses, are more useful than the method of loci." [[Alexander Jamieson]], ''A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy'', A. H. Maltby, 1835, p112&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Keefe and Nadel refer to "'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by Yates (1966) in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' as well as by [[Alexander Luria|Luria]] (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or a video game,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2987335/Building_a_memory_palace_in_minutes_Equivalent_memory_performance_using_virtual_versus_conventional_environments_with_the_Method_of_Loci Building a memory palace in minutes: Equivalent memory performance using virtual versus conventional environments with the Method of Loci]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Artificial_Memory_Palaces Artificial memory palaces]&lt;/ref&gt; or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Palace#Get_more_memory_palaces_or_journeys Getting more memory palace locations]&lt;/ref&gt; When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any distinguishing feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use."&lt;ref&gt;John O'Keefe &amp; Lynn Nadel, ''The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'', Oxford University Press, 1978, p389-390&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the art of memory, the origins of which are related, according to tradition, in the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]]: and the collapsing banquet hall discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', University of Chicago, 1966, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Steven M. Kosslyn remarks "[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Kosslyn, "Imagery in Learning" in: Michael S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), ''Perspectives in Memory Research'', MIT Press, 1988,  p245; it should be noted that Kosslyn fails to cite any example of the use of an equivalent term in period Greek or Latin sources.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles]] and [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan]] indicate that "an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps" originated with the story of Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Skoyles, Dorion Sagan, ''Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, "One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC"&lt;ref&gt;Linda Verlee Williams, ''Teaching For The Two-Sided Mind: A Guide to Right Brain/Left Brain Education'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus cites the [[foundation story]] of Simonides (more or less taken from Frances Yates) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the art of memory. She states, "This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the "method of loci".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, ''Human Memory: The Processing of Information'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1976, p65&lt;/ref&gt; While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to "method of loci" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Aristotle referred to ''topoi'' (places) in which memorial content could be aggregated - hence our modern term "topics", while another primary classical source, ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' (Bk III) discusses rules for places ''and'' images. In general Classical and Medieval sources describe these techniques as the art or arts of memory (''ars memorativa'' or ''artes memorativae''), rather than as any putative "method of loci". Nor is the imprecise designation current in specialized historical studies, for example Mary Carruthers uses the term "architectural mnemonic" to describe what is otherwise designated "method of loci".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: "The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon A. Gutman, ''Quick Reference Neuroscience For Rehabilitation Professionals'', SLACK Incorporated, 2001, p216&lt;/ref&gt;

This term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the art of memory, hastily glossed in some of the works just cited, depended equally upon images ''and'' places. The designator "method of loci" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utexas.edu/research/memoria/Ad_Herennium_Passages.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bomboniere''' (Italian bomboniera, from the french bonbonnière,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/bonbonni%C3%A8re/10119&lt;/ref&gt; a box containing "bonbons" (candies)) also known as "favors", are gifts given by hosts to their guests on special occasions such as [[weddings]], [[baptism]], [[First Communion]] or [[Confirmation]]. They usually include [[Jordan Almonds]], known in Italian as [[Confectionary|Confetti]].
Five sugared almonds symbolize [[health]], [[wealth]], [[happiness]], [[fertility]] and [[Longevity|long life]].

Confetti can be made in many forms using several different ingredients.

Sugared almonds are put inside a bag made of tulle or satin and tied with ribbons in assorted colors. The colour of sugared almonds is white for a wedding, [[First Communion]] or [[Confirmation]]; pink or light-blue for birthday or Baptism of a baby girl or baby boy, respectively, red for a graduation, and silver or gold for 25 or 50 year anniversaries.

Often they are adorned with dried natural flowers or artificial flowers made of silk or paper. The bag is often given stored inside a small vessel made of silver, crystal or porcelain.

In [[Australia]] the word "bomboniere" is applied to any small gift or keepsake given by the hosts to guests at any function held to celebrate weddings, first holy communions and the like. Such gifts may take the form of a wine bottle stopper, glass vase or picture frame as well as the more traditional sugared almonds in decorative bags.&lt;ref name="website01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petitcadeau.com.au/bomboniere-handcrafted-gifts/about_us |title=About Bomboniere |last=  |first=  |work=Bomboniere |publisher= |accessdate=2015-11-26 |quote=bomboniere for your wedding, engagement, christening, baptism, holy communion, bridal shower, baby shower, kitchen tea, birthday party, anniversary or any other special occasion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''Torta Bomboniera'''&lt;br&gt;
A different and new type of bomboniera is the Favor Cake or "Torta Bomboniera" as it is called in Italy.
They are made using little carton box forming one or more tier of a "cake".&lt;br&gt;Inside each box there are the sugared almonds and a card printed with the data of ceremony (names, date etc.).
On each box there are glued several types of fine objects made of many materials.

Some samples are below, for various ceremonies:

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''Evolution of "Torta Bomboniera" to "Pasticceria Artigianale in Porcellana" (Porcelain Artisan Pastries)'''&lt;br&gt;
The following type of Italian Favor Cake is an evolution of above types.&lt;br&gt;
It is made using porcelain boxes shaped and hand decorated like very real edible "bignè" or cream puff.&lt;br&gt;
Inside each box there are five sugared almonds and a card printed with data of ceremony.&lt;br&gt;
For this reasons, the name that Italians give to this new idea is "Pasticceria Artigianale in Porcellana", that is '''Porcelain Artisan Pastries'''

== History ==

30 years ago the Bonne Bay Marine Station was a small field station of [[Memorial University]]. The original station was a 2-storey house. The top floor had a small kitchen, a living room and three small bedrooms. The main floor had two larger rooms that were converted into labs and a small bathroom that was converted into a chemical lab where radioactive work and the chemical work was performed. It had a full basement, and there was an old fish store as a second building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curra.ca/documents/Newsletter_Western_Shorefast-Issue_3_for_Email.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bob Hooper first visited the Bonne Bay area then and was taken with its breathtaking beauty, amazing marine biodiversity, and potential as a prime location for teaching and research. He helped convert this outport house with a fishing store into a marine teaching and research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601090408/http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer teaching activities began in 1979 with a single two week program. By 2001 seven, two week academic programs were running from mid April to September. The student demand for courses, and high level of research interest, often exceeded the available space. In addition, local visitors and summer tourists were frequently "dropping in" to view the aquarium, and learn about the latest research ventures. The existing station could no longer accommodate the needs for the facility. A new teaching and research facility plan was developed.

The official opening of the new Bonne Bay Marine Station occurred September 6, 2002. Built on the site of the old station this $3.2 million facility was funded by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; the Gros Morne Co-operating Association; the Department of Industry, Trade and Rural Development, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador; and Memorial University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601090408/http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CURRA ==

The Community-University Research for Recovery Alliance (CURRA) is a 5-year research program centered at Bonne Bay Marine Station. This program of innovative, interdisciplinary research projects is helping communities and organizations along Newfoundland's west coast develop strategies for the recovery of fish stocks and fishery communities.

The CURRA brings together researchers from the social and natural sciences and fine arts at Memorial University in St. John's and [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]] in working partnerships with numerous stakeholders and community organizations.

The long-term objectives of the CURRA include promoting community engagement with the Station, promoting and diversifying the research community affiliated with the Station and training researchers in collaborative, community-based research approaches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curra.ca/about_us.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">'''Bureaupedia''' is a [[corporate wiki|wiki used internally]] at the [[FBI]] with the intention of capturing the knowledge of senior agents and reduce knowledge loss due to retirement.

Bureaupedia's existence was revealed in a September 2008 article in ''[[Federal Computer Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://fcw.com/articles/2008/09/26/fbi-creates-knowledge-wiki.aspx |title= FBI creates knowledge wiki |first= Ben |last= Bain |journal= [[Federal Computer Week|FCW]] |date= Sep 26, 2008 |dead-url= no |archive-date= October 2, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081002074743/http://www.fcw.com/online/news/153926-1.html |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI officials see Bureaupedia as a [[knowledge management]] tool that will let agents and analysts share their experiences to ensure that their accumulated insight remains after they retire. The project is a collaborative effort between the FBI’s chief knowledge officer and chief technology officer.

==Critiques==
[[File:Bureaupedia - Special Statistics - 2.jpg|thumb|Bureaupedia Special:Statistics]]

An earlier wiki, [[Intellipedia]], had been established for similar purposes across the U.S. government's 16 intelligence agencies including the FBI, and it has been suggested that FBI staff should use that one instead of the new smaller-scope Bureaupedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marv |last=Corea |website=Esenai |url=http://esenai.com/blog/intellipedia/2008/09/bureaupedia_fbis_own_wiki_why.html |title=Bureaupedia - FBI's own wiki?

The '''Center for Hellenic Studies''' (CHS) is a research institute for [[classics]] located in [[Washington, D.C.]] at 3100 NW Whitehaven Street.  It is affiliated with [[Harvard University]].

Nestled in [[Rock Creek Park]] behind [[Embassy Row]], the Center for Hellenic Studies offers a variety of both residential and remote fellowships each year to scholars and researchers working on projects in a variety of fields, including "archaeology, [[art history]], [[epigraphy]], history, literary criticism, philology, philosophy, pedagogical applications, reception, and interdisciplinary studies".&lt;ref name="CHS Fellowships"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=Fellowships&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=0|title=Opportunities for Researchers: CHS Fellowships in Hellenic Studies |website=CHS |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center provides housing for "residential" fellows and their families, and accommodates remote fellows and visiting scholars during shorter stays.  Fellows are selected by a panel of Senior Fellows, a group of five internationally selected senior [[classicists]].  Fellows are typically pre-tenured PhDs from around the world, most often from [[Europe]] or North America.  The "Center", as it is commonly called, has been a stopping point in the careers of many budding classicists who have gone on to be major contributors in the field.

==Director of the Center==
The Director of the Center is appointed by Harvard University.  [[Michael C.J. Putnam]] ([[Brown University]], 1962) was the first director, but acted as a substitute for [[Bernard Knox]] ([[Yale University]], 1963–1985), the Center's first official Director.  Knox was succeeded by Zeph Stewart ([[Harvard University]], 1985–1992), and Stewart by Co-Directors, [[Kurt Raaflaub]] and Deborah Boedeker ([[Brown University]], 1992–2000).&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;Lindquist, Eric N. "The Origins of the Center for Hellenic Studies." Princeton, N.J.: Princeton UP, 1990.  {{ISBN|0-691-03174-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current Director of the Center is [[Gregory Nagy]] ([[Harvard University]], 2000–present).

==Campus==
The main building of the Center houses one of the world's premier research libraries for the study of the classical world. The library is primarily used by residential and visiting fellows, as well as visiting scholars, but it is also open to the public.  It includes a rare book room with editions from as early as the 1600s.  The main building also houses offices for the fellows,  staff, and administration.

The wooded campus has a large [[mansion]] as the director's residence, a "stoa" with five apartments for the fellows without families, three [[cottage]]s for the fellows with families, two subdivided cottages serving as double residences, five guest-rooms to accommodate visiting scholars, and one cottage that has been transformed into a multi-media conference facility.&lt;ref name="Convergeo, Digital Agora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convergeo.com/agora.html|title=Convergeo - Harvard Hellenic Center|website=www.convergeo.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is easy access from the Center to Rock Creek Park.

== History ==

The Center was established in 1961 through an endowment, "exclusively for the establishment of an educational center in the field of [[Hellenic studies|Hellenic Studies]] designed to rediscover the humanism of the Hellenic Greeks," made by the [[Old Dominion Foundation]], (the predecessor to the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]).  The governing body was the "Trustees of Harvard University" (one of [[Harvard University]]'s two governing boards, now known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College or Harvard Corporation).  The Center was completed in 1963 by the architect [[H. Page Cross]] on land donated by Marie Beale in memory of her son, Walker Blaine Beale (Harvard College class of 1918) who died in [[World War I]].  In 1996, the [[Italian Embassy in Washington|Italian Embassy]] bought about half of the land from the Center and built a new facility there.  In the mid-1990s, under the directorship of Raaflaub and Boedecker, the Center was greatly expanded (from 8 Junior Fellows to 12, and with a significant renovation of the library).

Starting in 2000, the current Director, [[Gregory Nagy]], has brought a new focus on outreach (both national and international), information technology, publishing, and collaborative research to the Center for Hellenic Studies, as evidenced by the Center's dynamic website. In 2003, under Nagy's direction, the Center began renovations to transform one of the cottages into a new multi-media conference center.  The design plans were drawn up by the architectural firm, Convergeo,&lt;ref name="Convergeo home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convergeo.com/|title=Convergeo - Waldvogel &amp; Huang|website=www.convergeo.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006, the "Digital Agora"&lt;ref name="Convergeo, Digital Agora"  /&gt; was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savethis.clickability.com/st/saveThisApp?clickMap=link&amp;webPadID=K769688262{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CHS Greece ==
In 2008, the Center for Hellenic Studies opened a campus in [[Nafplio]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="CHS Greece"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nafplio.gr/en/kentroellspoudonharvardmenu.html|title=The Center for Hellenic Studies (Greece), Harvard University|last=|first=|date=|website=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece, Harvard University|Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece]] is a Harvard international Center that unites the humanistic pursuits of the CHS in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] with the homeland of Hellenism. Dr. Ioannis Petropoulos of the [[Democritus University of Thrace]] is the first, and current Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece (CHS GR).  CHS GR began as an office of the CHS DC, and has evolved into a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] base of operations and twin institution to its counterpart in Washington, D.C. It organizes, hosts and supports the summer programs of Harvard and other institutions, including opportunities for research, study and internship abroad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4733">The '''Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland''' or '''CELCIS''' is an organisation that supports the [[well-being]] of children.

==History==
CELCIS was established in 2011 with the intention being to provide a holistic approach, rather than serving a specialist part of the professionals who deal with looked after children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/protecting/lac/CELCIS |title=Centre for excellence for looked after children in Scotland |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to facilitate collaboration and therefore works with a range of organisations to improve outcomes relating to the lives of looked after children in Scotland. The centre was preceded by the Scottish Institute of Residential Child Care (SIRCC), which was a centre of excellence that had been set up in 2000.

Types of work that CELCIS are involved with include supporting policy implementation, oversight of the looked after children strategic group and the provision of training, information resources and consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/12464/1/SB_11-79.pdf | page=12 |title=SPICe Briefing: Educational Attainment of Looked After Children |last=Kidner |first=Camilla |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since August 2012 they have a specific responsibility for identifying the development needs of professionals working with looked after children.&lt;ref name="workforce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccpscotland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LACSIG-Update-for-CCPS-Jan-2013.pdf |title=Looked After Children Strategic Implementation Group  |publisher=Coalition of Care and Support Providers |date=January 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre are funded by the [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celcis.org/about_us/governance/ |title=Governance: Direction, scrutiny, accountability |publisher= Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are hosted by the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.strath.ac.uk/media/ps/rkes/generalweb/CELCIS.pdf |title=Knowledge Exchange.

==International Work==
In 2012 they were commissioned by the [[International Social Service]] to produce the “Moving Forward” report which aims to embed children’s rights in alternative care provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativecareguidelines.org/Portals/46/Moving-forward/Moving-forward-implementing-the-guidelines-ENG.pdf | title=Moving Forward: Implementing the ‘Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children’ |last1=Cantwell |first1=N. |last2=Davidson |first2=J. |last3=Elsley, S. |last4=Milligan |first4=I.|last5=Quinn |last6=N. |publisher=Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland |date=2012 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014 they were commissioned by [[SOS Children’s Villages]] to produce "Drumming Together

'''Cultural materialism''' in [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]] traces its origin to the work of the [[left-wing]] literary critic [[Raymond Williams]]. Cultural materialism makes analysis based in [[critical theory]], in the tradition of the [[Frankfurt School]]. 

==Overview==
Cultural materialism emerged as a theoretical movement in the early 1980s along with [[new historicism]], an American approach to [[early modern]] literature, with which it shares much common ground. The term was coined by Williams, who used it to describe a theoretical blending of leftist culturalism and [[Marxist]] analysis. Cultural materialists deal with specific historical documents and attempt to analyze and recreate the zeitgeist of a particular moment in history. 

Williams viewed culture as a "productive process", part of the [[means of production]], and cultural materialism often identifies what he called "residual", "emergent" and "oppositional" cultural elements. Following in the tradition of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Antonio Gramsci]] and others, cultural materialists extend the [[Social class|class]]-based analysis of traditional [[Marxism]] ([[Neo-Marxism]]) by means of an additional focus on the [[marginalized]].

Cultural materialists analyze the processes by which [[hegemony|hegemonic]] forces in society appropriate canonical and historically important texts, such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Jane Austen|Austen]], and utilize them in an attempt to validate or inscribe certain values on the cultural [[Imaginary (sociology)|imaginary]]. [[Jonathan Dollimore]] and [[Alan Sinfield]], authors of ''[[Political Shakespeare]]'', have had considerable influence in the development of this movement and their book is considered to be a seminal text. They have identified four defining characteristics of cultural materialism as a theoretical device:
* Historical context
* Close textual analysis
* Political commitment
* Theoretical method

Cultural materialists seek to draw attention to the processes being employed by contemporary power structures, such as the church, the state or the academy, to disseminate [[ideology]]. To do this they explore a text’s historical context and its political implications, and then through close textual analysis note the dominant hegemonic position. They identify possibilities for the rejection and/or subversion of that position. British critic [[Graham Holderness]] defines cultural materialism as a "politicized form of historiography".

Through its insistence on the importance of an engagement with issues of [[gender]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]], cultural materialism has had a significant impact on the field of literary studies, especially in Britain. Cultural materialists have found the area of Renaissance studies particularly receptive to this type of analysis. Traditional [[Humanism|humanist]] readings often eschewed consideration of the oppressed and marginalized in textual readings, whereas cultural materialists routinely consider such groups in their engagement with literary texts, thus opening new avenues of approach to issues of [[Representation (arts)|representation]] in the field of literary criticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8369">'''Cultural practice''' generally refers to the manifestation of a [[culture]] or [[sub-culture]], especially in regard to the traditional and customary practices of a particular ethnic or other cultural group.  In the broadest sense, this term can apply to any person manifesting any aspect of any culture at any time.  However, in practical usage it often refers to the traditional practices developed within specific [[ethnic]] cultures, especially those aspects of culture that have been practiced since ancient times.

The term is gaining in importance due to the increased controversy over "rights of cultural practice", which are protected in many jurisdictions for [[indigenous peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/canadian/canada/justice/ethnocultural-groups/ecg-003-00.html|title=Cultural Practices in Conflict with Canadian Law|publisher=nizkor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ethnic minorities.  It is also a major component of the field of [[cultural studies]], and is a primary focus of international works such as the [[United Nations]] declaration of the rights of indigenous Peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/drip.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011180532/http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/drip.pdf|archivedate=2007-10-11|title=United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural practice is also a subject of discussion in questions of cultural survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onefish.org/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0zODkyLjMwMjUxJjY9ZW4mMzM9ZG9jdW1lbnRzJjM3PWluZm8~|title=oneFish Community Knowledge Directory|date=27 September 2011|publisher=www.onefish.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927234707/http://www.onefish.org/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0zODkyLjMwMjUxJjY9ZW4mMzM9ZG9jdW1lbnRzJjM3PWluZm8~|archivedate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If an ethnic group retains its formal ethnic identity but loses its core cultural practices or the knowledge, resources, or ability to continue them, questions arise as to whether the culture is able to actually survive at all.  International bodies such as the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] continually work on these issues, which are increasingly at the forefront of [[globalization]] questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUD7nh8S74C&amp;dq=globalization%20indigenous%20cultural%20practice&amp;pg=PA109&amp;ots=tFWPvlmt2t&amp;sig=UVDszTZyqoLl0inD8cLaBqRjvhc&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=globalization+indigenous+cultural+practice&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=3|title=Globalization: Culture and identity|first=Roland|last=Robertson|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415236911|editor1=Roland Robertson|editor2=Kathleen E.

==Qualifications==

The real question of what qualifies as a legitimate cultural practice is the subject of much legal and ethnic community debate.  The question arises in controversial subject areas such as [[genital mutilation]], indigenous [[hunting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/message.aspx?&amp;mst=404|title=Global Affairs Canada|first1=Global Affairs|last1=Canada|first2=Affaires mondiales|last2=Canada|date=26 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Intensive gathering|gathering]] practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WD-huzL13PgC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=native%20gathering%20rights&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6-ctah600m&amp;sig=7ZFC04KaQAmiTbXeWsVmhC1W39k#PPA8,M1|title=The Role of Customary Law in Sustainable Development|first=Peter|last=Orebech|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question of licensing of [[Traditional medicine|traditional medical practitioners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camsociety.org/issues/Attitudes.htm|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine in Chinese-American Communities|first=Conrad|last=Wang|publisher=www.camsociety.org|date=Fall 1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001021235131/http://www.camsociety.org/issues/Attitudes.htm|archivedate=2000-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/583/1/173.pdf|title=Traditional Medicine in Africa|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2002|volume=583|issue=1|pages=173–176|doi=10.1177/000271620258300111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00192826|title=The changing geography of traditional medicine: Urban herbalism on the Witwatersrand, South Africa|first=Rolf P.

Many traditional cultures acknowledge members outside of their ethnicity as cultural practitioners, but only under special circumstances.  Generally, the knowledge or title must be passed in a traditional way, such as family knowledge shared through [[adoption]], or through a master of that practice choosing a particular student who shows qualities desired for that practice, and teaching that student in a hands-on manner, in which they are able to absorb the core values and belief systems of the culture.  The degree to which these non-ethnic practitioners are able to exercise "customary and traditional" rights, and the degree to which their practice is acknowledged as valid, is often a subject of considerable debate among indigenous and other ethnic communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/eaglefeatherlaw/argument.html]{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes with the legal systems under which these communities function.  The difference between bona fide non-native cultural practitioners and cultural piracy, or [[cultural appropriation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthcall.org/en/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903191209/http://www.earthcall.org/en/faq/|archivedate=2005-09-03|publisher=earthcall.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a major issue within the study of [[globalization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ejcl.org/75/art75-7.html|title=Biotechnology, Patent Law and Piracy|volume=7|issue=5|first=Jerzy |last=Koopman|journal=Electronic Journal of Comparative Law|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[modernization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= indigenous cultures|url=http://www.caslon.com.au/ipguide14.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213204315/http://caslon.com.au/ipguide14.htm|archivedate=2014-02-13|publisher=Caslon Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of culture==
The evolution of traditional cultures is a subject of much discussion in legal, scholarly, and community forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/Saht_indig_way.html|title=Earthdance: Chapter 20 - The Indigenous Way|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally accepted that all cultures are to some degree in a continual state of [[sociocultural evolution]].  However, major questions surround the legitimacy of newly evolved cultural expressions, especially when these are influenced by [[modernization]] or by the influence of other cultures.  Also, there is significant debate surrounding the source of evolution: for example, an indigenous community may accept the use of store-bought materials in the creation of traditional arts, but may reject requirements to apply for a permit for certain gathering purposes; the central difference being that one is an ''internal'' cultural evolution, while the other is ''externally'' driven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/8152/Westernization-Africa.html|title=Westernization - Africa - Bibliography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the society or legal body that surrounds the culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2648">The '''DAPPLE Project''' ([[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|Dispersion of Air Pollution]] and its Penetration into the Local Environment) was a four-year research project, funded by the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]]. It involved a consortium of six universities between 2002 and 2006. Field work was based at a site at the junction of Marylebone Road and Gloucester Place in central London.

==Transportation study==
As part of the project a study was designed to measure exposure to [[air pollution]] during transportation and looked at five transport methods for travelling across London. It was carried out by a team from [[Imperial College London]] and the [[Health and Safety Executive|Health and Safety Laboratory]], [[Buxton]] co-ordinated by Dr Surbjit Kaur.

The results, published in the journal ''Atmospheric Environment'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/246/description#description Elsevier publishers, ''Atmospheric Environment'' website]&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the level of  pollution that people are exposed to differs according to the mode of transport that they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="80863">'''Development aid''' or '''development cooperation''' (also '''development assistance''', '''technical assistance''', '''international aid''', '''overseas aid''', '''official development assistance''' (ODA), or '''foreign aid''') is financial [[aid]] given by governments and other agencies to support the economic, environmental, social, and political [[International development|development]] of [[developing countries]]. It is distinguished from [[humanitarian aid]] by focusing on alleviating poverty in the long term, rather than a short term response.
[[File:Africa Technical Cooperation Grants.jpg|thumb|Technical cooperation grants are one type of development aid.|353x353px]]
The term '''development cooperation''', which is used, for example, by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), is used to express the idea that a [[International development#partnership|partnership]] should exist between donor and recipient, rather than the traditional situation in which the relationship was dominated by the wealth and specialised knowledge of one side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story016/en/index.html WHO glossary of terms, "Development Cooperation"] Accessed 25 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most development aid comes from the Western industrialised countries but some poorer countries also contribute aid.

Aid may be '''bilateral''': given from one country directly to another; or it may be '''multilateral''': given by the donor country to an international organisation such as the [[World Bank]] or the United Nations Agencies ([[UNDP]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNAIDS]], etc.) which then distributes it among the developing countries. The proportion is currently about 70% bilateral 30% multilateral.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Stats. Portal &gt;&gt; Extracts &gt;&gt; Development &gt;&gt; Other &gt;&gt; DAC1 Official and Private Flows. Retrieved April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 80-85% of developmental aid comes from government sources as [[official development assistance]] (ODA). The remaining 15-20% comes from private organisations such as "[[non-governmental organisation]]s" (NGOs), foundations and other [[development charities]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Oxfam]]).&lt;ref&gt;OECD, DAC1 Official and Private Flows (''op. cit.''). The calculation is Net Private Grants / ODA.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, remittances received from migrants working or living in diaspora form a significant amount of international transfer.

Some governments also include military assistance in the notion "foreign aid", although many [[NGO]]s tend to disapprove of this.

Official development assistance is a measure of government-contributed aid, compiled by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) since 1969. The DAC consists of 34 of the largest aid-donating countries.

==History==

===Origins===
The concept of development aid goes back to the [[colonial era]] at the turn of the twentieth century, in particular to the British policy of colonial development that emerged during that period. The traditional government policy had tended to favor [[laissez-faire]] style economics, with the free market for capital and goods dictating the economic role that colonies played in the [[British Empire]].

[[Image:British Political Personalities 1936-1945 CH4432.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] presided over a Development Committee for the colonies. He is pictured entertaining [[Jamaica]]n recruits for the [[RAF]].]]
Changes in attitudes towards the moral purpose of the Empire, and the role that government could play in the promotion of welfare slowly led to a more proactive policy of economic and developmental assistance towards poor colonies. The first challenge to Britain was the economic crisis that occurred after World War I. Prior to the passage of the 1929 Colonial Development Act, the doctrine that governed Britain (and other European colonizers) with their territories was that of financial self-sufficiency. What this simply meant was that the colonies were responsible for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hodge, Gerald Hodl, &amp; Martin Kopf (edi) Developing Africa: Concepts and Practices in Twentieth-Century Colonialism, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain was not going to use the money that belongs to the metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.&lt;ref&gt;Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Stephen Constantine]], ''The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940'', London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], then [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]]. Its initial annual budget of £1 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the [[infrastructure]] of [[transport]], [[electrical power]] and [[water supply]] in colonies and [[dominion]]s abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade.&lt;ref name="Kanbur"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | contribution = The economics of international aid | editor-last1 = Kolm | editor-first1 = Serge-Christophe | editor-last2 = Ythier | editor-first2 = Jean Mercier | editor-link1 = Serge-Christophe Kolm | title = Handbook of the economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity: foundations, volume 1 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780444506979  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies.

By the late 1930s, especially after the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–1939]], it was clear that this initial scheme was far too limited in scope. A [[Royal Commission]] under [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] was sent to investigate the living conditions in the [[British West Indies]] and it published its [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Report]] in 1940 which exposed the horrendous living conditions there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Cary|title=The Twilight of Colonial Rule in the British West Indies: Nationalist Assertion vs. Imperial Hubris in the 1930s|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1/2|page=2|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&amp;hid=107&amp;sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&amp;AN=45526514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basdeo|first=Sahadeo|title=Walter Citrine and the British Caribbean Worker's Movement during the Commission Hearing|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1983|volume=18|issue=2|page=46|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&amp;vid=11&amp;hid=28&amp;bquery=(AU+(basdeo))+AND+(citrine)&amp;bdata=JmRiPWFobCZkYj1oaWEmdHlwZT0xJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission's recommendations urged health and education initiatives along with increased sugar subsidies to stave off a complete and total economic meltdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Colonial Office]], eager to prevent instability while the country was at [[Second World War|war]], began funneling large sums of cash into the region.&lt;ref name=Thomas283&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colonial Development and Welfare Act was passed in 1940 to organize and allocate a sum of £5 million per year to the British West Indies for the purpose of long-term development. Some £10 million in loans was cancelled in the same Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolland|title=The Politics of Labour in the British Caribbean|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 increased the level of aid to £120m over a twenty-year period. Further Acts followed in 1948, 1959 and 1963, dramatically increasing the scope of monetary assistance, favourable [[interest rate|interest-free]] [[loan]]s and development assistance programs.

===Postwar expansion===
[[Image:Marshall Plan poster.JPG|thumb|A poster promoting the [[Marshall Plan]] in Europe, the first large scale development program. It was designed to boost European economies shattered by [[World War Two|war]] and prevent the growth of [[communism|communist]] influence.]]
The beginning of modern development aid is rooted in the context of Post-[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and the [[Cold War]]. Launched as a large-scale aid program by the United States in 1948, the European Recovery Program, or [[Marshall Plan]], was concerned with strengthening the ties to the [[West Europe]]an states to contain the influence of the [[USSR]]. Implemented by the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the Marshall Plan also expanded its reconstruction finance to strategic parts of the Middle East and Asia.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwusaidgovabout_usaidusaidhisthtml"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidhist.html |title=USAID: USAID History |publisher=Usaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009131110/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidhist.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale was well summarized in the 'Point Four Program', in which United States president [[Harry Truman]] stated the anti-communist rationale for U.S. development aid in his inaugural address of 1949, which also announced the founding of [[NATO]]:&lt;ref name=Kanbur /&gt;

:"In addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security. Fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas. More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres53.html Transcript of the speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State to run the Point Four program. Development aid was aimed at offering technical solutions to social problems without altering basic [[social structure]]s. The United States was often fiercely opposed to even moderate changes in social structures, for example the [[land reform]] in [[Guatemala]] in the early 1950s.

In 1953 at the end of the [[Korean War]], the incoming [[Eisenhower Administration]] established the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as an independent government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance. In 1955, foreign aid was brought back under the administrative control of the Department of State and FOA was renamed the International Cooperation Administration (ICA).

In 1956, the Senate conducted a study of foreign aid with the help of a number of independent experts.  The result, stated in a 1959 amendment to the Mutual Security Act, declared that development in low-income regions was a U.S. objective along with and additional to other foreign-policy interests, attempting thus to clarify development assistance's relationship with the effort to contain Communism. In 1961, the Congress approved the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961 with President [[J.F. Kennedy]]'s support, which retained the 1959 policy of international development as an independent U.S. objective and set up a new Agency for International Development, [[USAID]].

The volume of international aid to [[Developing country|developing countries]] (called "[[Third World]]" at the time) grew dramatically from the 1960s. This aid came mainly from the US and [[Western Europe]]an countries, but there were also significant contributions from the [[Soviet Union]] in exchange for overseas political influence in the context of the heightened global tensions of the [[Cold War]].

The practice of extending aid to politically aligned parties in recipient nations continues today; Faye and Niehaus (2012) are able to establish a causal relationship between politics and aid in recipient nations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faye|first=Michael|last2=Niehaus|first2=Paul|date=2012-12-01|title=Political Aid Cycles|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3516–3530|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their analysis of the competitive 2006 Palestinian elections, they note that USAID provided funding for development programs in Palestine to support the Palestinian Authority, the US backed entity running for reelection. Faye and Niehaus discovered that the greater the degree of alignment the recipient party has with the donor entity, the more aid it receives on average during an election year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an analysis of the 3 biggest donor nations (Japan, France, and the US), Alesina and Dollar (2000) discovered that each has its own distortions to the aid it gives out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alesina|first=Alberto|last2=Dollar|first2=David|date=2000|title=Who Gives Foreign Aid to Whom and Why?|jstor=40216022|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|volume=5|issue=1|pages=33–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan appears to prioritize giving aid nations that exercise similar voting preferences in the United Nations, France mostly sends aid to its former colonies, and the U.S. disproportionately provides aid to Israel and Egypt.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These allocations are often powerful tools for maintaining the strategic interests of the donor country in the recipient country.

The [[Development Assistance Committee]] was established in 1960 by the [[OECD|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] to coordinate development aid amongst the rich nations. A 1961 resolution decreed that:

{{Quotation|The Committee will continue to consult on the methods for making national resources available for assisting countries and areas in the process of economic development and for expanding and improving the flow of long-term funds and other development assistance to them.|Development Assistance Committee|Mandate (1961)}}

== Extent of Aid ==
{{Development economics sidebar}}
Most [[official development assistance]] (ODA) comes from the 28 members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC), or about $135&amp;nbsp;billion in 2013. A further $15.9&amp;nbsp;billion came from the [[European Commission]] and non-DAC countries gave an additional $9.4&amp;nbsp;billion. Although development aid rose in 2013 to the highest level ever recorded, a trend of a falling share of aid going to the neediest sub-Saharan African countries continued.&lt;ref name=OECD-2013 /&gt;

[[File:Cartoon, Warren Buffett wants African children to have more Coke - and healthier teeth.gif|thumb|Warren Buffett is considered one of the world's leading philanthropists, yet he is also the biggest investor in Coca-Cola, which aggressively seeks to expand into poorer countries. This cartoon, from an organization critical of the true motives of international aid, calls attention to what it perceives as a contradiction.]]Development aid is often provided by means of supporting local development aid projects. In these projects, it sometimes occurs that no strict code of conduct is in force. In some projects, the development aid workers do not respect the local [[code of conduct]]. For example, the local [[dress code]] as well as [[Human communication|social interaction]]. In developing countries, these matters are regarded highly important and not respecting it may cause severe offense, and thus significant problems and delay of the projects.

There is also much debate about evaluating the quality of development aid, rather than simply the quantity.  For instance, [[tied aid]] is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. Tied aid can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_2649_33959_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD The Typing of Aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also criticism because donors may give with one hand, through large amounts of development aid, yet take away with the other, through strict trade or migration policies, or by getting a foothold for foreign corporations.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] measures the overall policies of donors and evaluates the quality of their development aid, instead of just comparing the quantity of [[official development assistance]] given.

Aid effectiveness is the degree to which development aid works, and is a subject of significant disagreement. Dissident economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argued in the 1960s that aid is ineffective:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The sad loss of Lord Bauer| url =http://www.la-articles.org.uk/bauer.htm| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | ... an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries. | Peter Bauer}}

In economics, there are two competing positions on aid. A view pro aid, supported by Jeffrey Sachs and the United Nations, which argues that foreign aid will give the big push to break the low-income poverty trap poorer countries are trapped in. From this perspective, aid serves to finance  “the core inputs to development – teachers, health centers, roads, wells, medicine, to name a few...” (United Nations 2004).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553|title=Making Progress on Foreign Aid|last=Qian|first=Nancy|date=2015-08-03|website=dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; And a view that is skeptic about the impacts of aid, supported by William Easterly, that points out that aid has not proven to work after 40 years of large investments in Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

American political scientist and professor [[Nicolas van de Walle]] has also argued that despite more than two decades of donor-supported reform in Africa, the continent continues to be plagued by economic crises due to the combination of state generated factors and to the counter productivity of international development aid to Africa. Van de Walle first attributes the failure to implement economic policy reform to factors within the African state:
# Neopatrimonial tendencies of state elites that serve to preserve and centralize power, maintain limited access orders, and create political obstacles to reform.
# Ideological obstacles that have been biased by two decades of failed economic policy reform and in turn, create a hostile environment for reform.
# Low state capacity that reinforces and that in turn, is reinforced by the neopatrimonial tendencies of the state.
Van de Walle later argues that these state generated factors that have obstructed the effective implementation of economic policy reform are further exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid, therefore, makes policy reform less likely, rather than more likely. Van de Walle posits that international aid has sustained economic stagnation in Africa by:
# Pacifying Africa's neopatrimonial tendencies, thereby lessening the incentives for state elites to undertake reform and preserving the status quo.
# Sustaining poorly managed bureaucratic structures and policies that would be otherwise rectified by market forces.
# Allowing state capacities to deteriorate through externalizing many state functions and responsibilities.
In order for aid to be productive and for economic policy reform to be successfully implemented in Africa, the relationship between donors and governments must change. Van de Walle argues that aid must be made more conditional and selective to incentivize states to take on reform and to generate the much needed accountability and capacity in African governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democratic Reform in Africa: The Quality of Progress|last=Van de Walle|first=Nicolas|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1588262464|editor-last=Gyimah-Boadi|editor-first=Emmanuel|location=1800 30th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301|pages=29–63|chapter=Economic Reform: Patterns and Constraints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, information asymmetries often hinder the appropriate allocation of aid; Blum et al. (2016) note that both South Sudan and Liberia struggle tremendously with paying employees and controlling the flow of money - South Sudan had a significant number of ghosts on its payroll, while Liberia's Civil Service Agency could not adequately pay civil servants because there was minimal communication from the Ministries of Health and Education regarding their respective payrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. “Public Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.” World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[econometric]] studies in recent years have supported the view that development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop. Negative side effects of aid can include an unbalanced [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]] of the recipient's currency (known as [[Dutch Disease]]), increasing corruption, and adverse political effects such as postponements of necessary economic and democratic reforms.&lt;ref name="brookings.edu"&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx Aid Effectiveness and Governance: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009071531/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx |date=2009-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued{{By whom|date=September 2010}} that much government-to-government aid was ineffective because it was merely a way to support strategically important leaders (Alesino and Dollar, 2000). A good example of this is the former dictator of [[Zaire]], [[Mobuto Sese Seko]], who lost support from the West after the Cold War had ended. Mobuto, at the time of his death, had a sufficient personal fortune (particularly in Swiss banks) to pay off the entire external debt of Zaire.&lt;ref name="brookings.edu"/&gt;

Besides some instances that only the president (and/or his close entourage) receives the money resulting from development aid, the money obtained is often badly spent as well. For example, in Chad, the [http://www.esso.com/Chad-English/PA/Files/suppvol1ch1.pdf Chad Export Project], an oil production project supported by the World Bank, was set up. The earnings of this project (6.5 million dollars per year and rising) were used to obtain arms. The government defended this purchase by stating that "development was not possible without safety". However, the [[Military of Chad]] is notorious for severe misconduct against the population (abuse, rape, claiming of supplies and cars) and did not even defend the population in distress (e.g. in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]]). In 2008, the World Bank retreated from the project that thus increased environmental pollution and human suffering.&lt;ref name="Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen"&gt;Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism has been that Western countries often project their own needs and solutions onto other societies and cultures. In response, western help in some cases has become more 'endogenous', which means that needs as well as solutions are being devised in accordance with local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html The Future of The Anti-Corruption Movement], Nathaniel Heller, Global Integrity&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sometimes projects are set up which wish to make several [[ethnic group]]s cooperate. While this is a noble goal, most of these projects fail because of this intent.&lt;ref name="Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen"/&gt;

The [https://www.cgdev.org/ Center for Global Development] have published a review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moss, Petterson and van de Walle|first=|date=January 2006|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.cgdev.org|journal=Center for Global Development|volume=Working Paper Number 74|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; essay of the existing literature studying the relationship between Aid and public institutions. In this review,  they concluded that a large and sustained Aid can have a negative effect in the development of good public institutions in low income countries. They also mention some of the arguments exhibited in this article as possible mechanism for this negative effect, for instance, they considered the [[Dutch Disease]], the discourage of revenue collections and the effect on the state capacity among others.

Furthermore, the effect of Aid on conflict intensity and onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dube and Naidu|first=|date=January 6, 2015|title=Bases, Bullets, and Ballots: The Effect of US Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/679021|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume= 77| issue = 1.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Aid from the US seems to have been diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence. Moreover, Nunn and Qian (2014)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nunn and Qian|first=|date=June 2014|title=US Food Aid and Civil Conflict|jstor=42920861|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1630-1666|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that an increase in U.S. food aid increases conflict intensity; they claim that the main mechanism driving this result is predation of the aid by the rebel groups. In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crost, Felter and Johnston|first=|date=June 2014|title=Aid Under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.104.6.1833|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1833–1856|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.

It has also been argued that help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption, and has an adverse effect on local production. As a result, a shift has taken place towards aid based on activation of local assets and stimulation measures such as [[microcredit]].

Aid has also been ineffective in young recipient countries in which ethnic tensions are strong: sometimes ethnic conflicts have prevented efficient delivery of aid.

In some cases, western surpluses that resulted from faulty agriculture- or other policies have been dumped in poor countries, thus wiping out local production and increasing dependency.

In several instances, loans that were considered irretrievable (for instance because funds had been embezzled by a dictator who has already died or disappeared), have been written off by donor countries, who subsequently booked this as development aid.

In many cases, Western governments placed orders with Western companies as a form of subsidizing them, and later shipped these goods to poor countries who often had no use for them. These projects are sometimes called '[[white elephant]]s'.

According to [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], these issues might be caused by deficient diagnostics of the development agencies. In his book [[The Anti-Politics Machine]], Ferguson uses the example of the [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] project in [[Lesotho]] to illustrate how a bad diagnostic on the economic activity of the population and the desire to stay away from local politics, caused a livestock project to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=1994|title=The anti-politics machine: 'development' and bureaucratic power in Lesotho|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24 |issue=5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so).&lt;ref name="momentum-media.nl"&gt;[http://www.momentum-media.nl/files/_articles/31/Gestrand_Ontwikkelingswerk.pdf Kijk magazine; oktober 2008, Gestrand Ontwikkelingswerk]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common criticism in recent years is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of [[tied aid]], donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp|title=US and Foreign Aid Assistance|publisher=Global Issues|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Development Aid in Congo Wasted.jpeg|thumb|250px|In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], an abandoned ferry as a relic of a development project is rusting next to the boats people use today.]]
All of these problems have made that a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product).&lt;ref name="momentum-media.nl"/&gt;

For the Italian development aid for instance, we find that one of their successful projects (the Keita project) was constructed at the cost of 2/3 of 1 F-22 fighter jet (100 million $), and was able to reforest {{convert|1876|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of broken, barren earth, hereby increasing the socio-economic wellbeing of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita project increasing socio-economic wellbeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However -like the Dutch development aid- again we find that, the Italian development aid too is still not performing up to standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 Italian aid not up to standard overall]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes clear that there are great differences between the success of the projects and that budgetary follow-up may not be so strictly checked by independent third parties.

An excerpt from [[Thomas Dichter]]'s recently published book ''[[Despite Good Intentions]]: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed'' reads: "This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing "product", results, and accountability…the tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable. Because funding for development is increasingly finite, this situation is very much a zero-sum game. What gets lost in the shuffle is the far more challenging long-term process of development."

Effectiveness of development aid can be argued to be uncoordinated and unsustainable.  Development aid tends to be put towards specific diseases with high death rates and simple treatments, rather than funding health basics and infrastructure.  Though a lot of NGO's and funding have come forth, little sustainable outcomes have been made.  This is due to the fact that the money doesn't go towards developing a sustainable medical basis.  Money is given to specific diseases to show short-term results, reflecting the donor's best interests rather than the citizens' necessities.  It is evident that many development aid projects are not helping with basic and sustainable health care due to the generally high numbers of deaths due to preventable diseases.  Development aid could do more justice if used to generate general public health with infrastructure and trained personnel rather than pin-pointing specific diseases and reaching for quick fixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that developed nations are more likely to give aid to nations who have the worst economic situations and policies (Burnside, C., Dollar, D., 2000). They give money to these nations so that they can become developed and begin to turn these policies around. It has also been found that aid relates to the population of a nation as well, and that the smaller a nation is, the more likely it is to receive funds from donor agencies. The harsh reality of this is that it is very unlikely that a developing nation with a lack of resources, policies, and good governance will be able to utilize incoming aid money in order to get on their feet and begin to turn the damaged economy around. It is more likely that a nation with good economic policies and good governance will be able to utilize aid money to help the country establish itself with an existing foundation and be able to rise from there with the help of the international community. But research shows that it is the low-income nations that will receive aid more so, and the better off a nation is, the less aid money it will be granted. On the other hand, Alesina and Dollar (2000) note that private foreign investment often responds positively to more substantive economic policy and better protections under the law.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is increased private foreign investment in developing nations with these attributes, especially in the higher income ones, perhaps due to being larger and possibly more profitable markets.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== MIT based study ===
[[File:DBP 1981 1103 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.jpg|thumb|250px|Development aid, German stamp (1981).]]

The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Abhijit Banerjee and Ruimin He have undertaken a rigorous study of the relatively few independent evaluations of aid program successes and failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410233354/http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10|format=PDF|title=Making aid work|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest the following interventions are usually highly effective forms of aid in normal circumstances:
* subsidies given directly to families to be spent on children's education and health
* education vouchers for school uniforms and textbooks
* teaching selected illiterate adults to read and write
* deworming drugs and vitamin/nutritional supplements
* vaccination and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs
* indoor sprays against [[malaria]], anti-[[mosquito]] bed netting
* suitable fertilizers
* clean [[water supply|water supplies]]

=== UK Parliamentary study ===

An inquiry into aid effectiveness by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Debt, Aid and Trade featured evidence from Rosalind Eyben, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]]. Her evidence to the inquiry stated that effective aid requires as much investing in relationships as in managing money. It suggests Development organisations need to change the way they work to manage better the multiple partnerships that the Accra Agenda for Action recognises is at the core of the aid business. In relation to this specific inquiry, Dr Eyben outlined the following points:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/putting-relationships-first-for-aid-effectiveness 'Putting Relationships First for Aid Effectiveness'] Evidence Submission to the APPG Inquiry on Aid Effectiveness, Institute of Development Studies (IDS)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Achieving impact requires investing in relationships, development organisations need to support their staff to do this. At the moment, the opposite is happening.
*In multiple sets of relationships there will be different ideas about what is success and how to achieve it and this should be reflected in methodologies for defining and assessing the impact of aid.
*Helpful procedural harmonisation should not mean assuming there is only a single diagnosis and solution to any complex problem.
*In addition to measuring results, donors need to assess the quality of relations at project/programme, country and international levels against indicators agreed with partners.
*Decisions on aid need to be made on a case by case basis on the advice of well-informed country offices.
*Accountable states depend on empowered citizens
*Development organisations also need to be more accountable to UK citizens through encouraging conversations as to the real challenges and limitations of aid. (Point made in relation to UK as evidence for UK parliamentary inquiry)

The views above are of Eyben. There were many other submissions to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade's inquiry into Aid Effectiveness. The final report gathered a vast amount of information from a wide range of sources to ensure a balanced perspective on the issues of aid effectiveness. The All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade's inquiry into Aid Effectiveness can be found online and the submissions of other contributors are available upon request.

===Effect on the Recipient Country's Development===

Albert Hirschman’s Exit-Voice-Loyalty model can be used to understand how certain policy changes affect the growth of a nation and the change of bargaining power inside it. Clark et al.’s formalization of the model to politics shows the effect that developmental aid can have on the receiving country’s development and highlights that the aid can potentially harm that country.

[[Albert O. Hirschman]]’s EVL model is based on the foundation that “under any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations, in general, are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous, or otherwise functional behavior” [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty]]. The customer who is affected by the lapse in the system (a fall in the quality of a product they are consuming) has two ways to answer to this- “exit” or “voice”. If the individual in a chooses the former, they simply stop buying the product and inflict a revenue drop that forces the firm to either correct their mistake or cease to exist. If the individual chooses the “voice” option, then they will express their dissatisfaction to either the firm or something that has authority over it. This will force the firm to fix their lapse, but it will not suffer a decline in revenue. Lastly, Hirschman introduces the “loyalty” option, which occurs when the consumer cannot “exit” and the firm does not care about the effect that “voice” will have on their revenue, and the consumers who chose it continues to consume the lapsed good.

Clark et al.’s paper takes Hirschman’s Exit-Voice-Loyalty model [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf] and applies it to political developments inside a nation. When a government changes a policy that now has a negative effect on the welfare of some citizens, or is already being unresponsive to a deleterious situation, the citizens have the same 3 choices of response as before. Here, “exit” can take the form of citizens leaving the country [[The Art of Not Being Governed]] and hence depriving the state of their taxes or simply rearranging their capital and goods so they are not taxed by the government, as seen with British merchants threatening to move capital to the Netherlands if not given representation after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. “Voice” takes the form of non-violent civil disobedience, as seen with Gandhi's [[Salt March]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests in Ferguson, a violent demonstration, as seen with [[Luddite]] breaking weaving machinery to protest the lack of protectionist policies by the English government, or even “everyday resistance” [http://abahlali.org/files/Scotts-Weapons.pdf] where small, non-cooperation and false create high costs for the state. “Loyalty” entails that the citizens simply accept the situation and continue their lives before.

How foreign aid enters this equation in weak states is by changing the citizens’ power of “voice” and “exit” and weakening the state’s dependence on their citizens and hence becoming less responsive to their needs. If the state receives international aid, it is less dependent on the tax revenue that it collects from its constituents. A higher level of fiscal independence on the part of the state decreases the bargaining power of the citizens. The government is threatened less by the citizens’ “exit” option, and less hurt if it is implemented, hence this takes away a credible threat to use at the negotiation table in order for the citizens to request improvement to their current condition. At the same time, the lack of dependence for revenue decreases the “voice” action of the citizen by weakening the effect a violent demonstration or everyday resistance has on impacting the state’s decision-making.

As long as the government of a nation receiving international aid knows that it will keep receiving it, and there will be no repercussion on the side of the donors for failing to address its constituents’ issues, it stays optimal for that government to keep ignoring the weakened demands of its citizens. With weakened bargaining power and a less responsive state, there can be no bargaining between citizen and state that will, in the long, run lead to economic and/or development within the nation. Although international has done far-reaching things with respect to increasing access to improved medical care, improving education, and decreasing poverty and hunger,  only in 1997 did the [[World Bank]] began to rethink its aid policy structure and begin using parts of it specifically for building up the state capability of the aid-receiving nations [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980]. Even more recently, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]], a US-based aid agency, started working with developing nation to provide them with strictly development aid as they set and implement goals for national development.

==Corruption==
{{Main|Political corruption|Aid#Support of corrupt state structures}}
While development aid is an important source of investment for poor and often insecure societies, aid's complexity and the ever-expanding budgets leave it vulnerable to corruption, yet discussing it remains difficult as for many it is a taboo subject.&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Sarah Bailey (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2385&amp;title=corruption-risks-perceptions-prevention-humanitarian-assistance Need and greed: corruption risks, perceptions and prevention in humanitarian assistance] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption is very hard to quantify as it is often hard to differentiate it from other problems, such as wastage, mismanagement and inefficiency, to illustrate the point, over $8.75&amp;nbsp;billion was lost to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement in the [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief effort.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Often a lack of understanding of the process by those meant to be receiving aid leads to cynicism and belief that greed and corruption are the key failures. [[Non-governmental organizations]] have in recent years made great efforts to increase participation, accountability and transparency, humanitarian assistance remains a poorly understood process to those meant to be receiving it—much greater investment needs to be made into researching and investing in relevant and effective accountability systems.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

However, there is little clear consensus on the trade-offs between speed and control, especially in emergency situations when the humanitarian imperative of saving lives and alleviating suffering may conflict with the time and resources required to minimise corruption risks.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have highlighted the need to tackle corruption with, but not limited to, the following methods:&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;
# Resist the pressure to spend aid rapidly.
# Continue to invest in audit capacity, beyond simple paper trails;
# Establish and verify the effectiveness of complaints mechanisms, paying close attention to local power structures, security and cultural factors hindering complaints;
# Clearly explain the processes during the targeting and registration stages, highlighting points such as the fact that people should not make payments to be included, photocopy and read aloud any lists prepared by leaders or committees.

== Types of Aid ==

===Private Aid===
[[Development charities]] make up a vast web of [[non-governmental organization]]s, religious ministries, foundations, business donations and college scholarships devoted to development aid. Estimates vary, but private aid is at least as large as ODA within the United States, at $16 billion in 2003. World figures for private aid are not well tracked, so cross-country comparisons are not easily possible, though it does seem that per person, some other countries may give more, or have similar incentives that the United States has for its citizens to encourage giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp#Sidenoteonprivatecontributions|title=Ranking The Rich Based On Commitment To Development|publisher=globalissues.org|accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting at the beginning of the UN Decade for Women in 1975, the [[Women in development|Women in Development]] approach to international development began to inform the provision of development aid.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=Hillary|date=|title=Not Waving But Drowning Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United nations|url=|journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal|volume=18|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics criticized the [[Women in development|Women in Development]] approach for relying on integrating women into existing development aid paradigms instead of promulgating specific aid to encourage gender equality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[Gender and development|Gender and Development]] approach was created in response, to discuss international development in terms of societal gender roles and to challenge these gender roles within development policy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|date=|title=Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?|url=|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=39|pages=182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Development predominated as the approach to gender in development aid through the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Robert|last2=Swiss|first2=Liam|date=September 2014|title=Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending|url=|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=29|issue=3|pages=574|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the early 1990s Gender and Development’s influence encouraged [[Gender mainstreaming|Gender Mainstreaming]] within international development aid.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, Ranjula Bali and Garikipati, Supriya. 2016.

The [[World Conference on Women, 1995]] promulgated Gender Mainstreaming on all policy levels for the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, Hilary. "Not Waving But Drowing Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United Nations". ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''. 18: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/gopher-data/conf/fwcw/off/a--20.en|title=Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender Mainstreaming has been adopted by nearly all units of the UN with the UN Economic and Social Council adopting a definition which indicated an “ultimate goal… to achieve gender equality.”&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, Hillary. "Not Waving But Drowning Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United nations". ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''. 18: 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN included  promoting gender equality and empowering women as one of eight [[Millennium Development Goals]] for developing countries.

The EU integrated Women and Development thinking into its aid policy starting with the Lomé Convention in 1984.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|last2=Hulse|first2=Merran|date=|title=Including Women's Voices? Gender Mainstreaming in EU and SADC Development Strategies for Southern Africa|url=|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|volume=40|issue=3|pages=561–562|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the EU’s Latin American and Asian development policy first clearly said that development programs should not have detrimental effects on the position and role of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|date=|title=Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?|url=|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=39|pages=181|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the EU has continued the policy of including gender equality within development aid and programs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Within the EU gender equality is increasingly introduced in programmatic ways.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|date=|title=Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?|url=|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=39|pages=187–189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the EU’s aid for gender equality seeks to increase women’s access to education, employment and reproductive health services. However, some areas of gender inequality are targeted according to region, such as land reform and counteracting the effects of gangs on women in Latin America.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] first established a Woman in Development office in 1974 and in 1996 promulgated the Gender Plan of Action to further integrate gender equality into aid programs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1865/GenderEqualityPolicy_0.pdf|title=Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=USAID|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 USAID released a Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy to guide its aid programs in making gender equality a central goal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; USAID saw increased solicitations from aid programs which integrated gender equality from 1995-2010.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As part of their increased aid provision, USAID developed PROMOTE to target gender inequality in Afghanistan with $216 million in aid coming directly from USAID and $200 million coming from other donors.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/promote/|title=Promote|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=USAID|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many NGOs have also incorporated gender equality into their programs. Within the Netherlands, NGOs including Oxfam Netherlands Organization for Development Assistance, the Humanist Institute for Cooperation with Developing Countries, Interchurch Organization for Development Cooperation, and Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid have included certain targets for their aid programs with regards to gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Eerdewijk|first=Anouka|date=|title=The Micropolitics of Evaporation: Gender Mainstreaming Instruments in Practice|url=|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=26|pages=348–349|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs which receive aid dollars through the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] or which partner with the Norwegian government on aid projects must “demonstrate that they take women and gender equality seriously.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Østebo|first=Marit|last2=Haukanes|first2=Haldis|last3=Blystad|first3=Astrid|date=|title=Strong State Policies on Gender and Aid: Threats and Opportunities for Norwegian Faith-Based Organisations|url=|journal=Forum for Development Studies|volume=40|issue=2|pages=194|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this requirement organizations like the Norwegian Christian charity Digni have initiated projects which target gender equality.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Private foundation|Private Foundations]] provide the majority of their gender related aid to health programs and have relatively neglected other areas of gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931344632|title=Non-traditional aid and gender equity evidence from million dollar donations|last=Okonkwo|first=Osili, Una|date=2013|publisher=WIDER|year=|isbn=9789292306533|location=|pages=4–5|oclc=931344632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundations, such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], have partnered with governmental aid organizations to provide funds for gender equality, but increasingly aid is provided through partnerships with local organizations and NGOS.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Corporations also participate in providing gender equality aid through their [[Corporate social responsibility|Corporate Social Responsibility]] programs. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] helped to create the [[Girl Effect]] to provide aid programs targeted towards adolescent girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931344632|title=Non-traditional aid and gender equity evidence from million dollar donations|last=Okonkwo|first=Osili, Una|date=2013|publisher=WIDER|year=|isbn=9789292306533|location=|pages=6|oclc=931344632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using publicly available data Una Osili an economist at the [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis]] found that between 2000-10 $1.15 billion in private aid grants over $1 million from the United States targeted gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931344632|title=Non-traditional aid and gender equity evidence from million dollar donations|last=Okonkwo|first=Osili, Una|date=2013|publisher=WIDER|year=|isbn=9789292306533|location=|pages=8|oclc=931344632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] provides detailed analysis of the extent of aid for gender equality. OECD member countries tag their aid programs with gender markers when a program is designed to advanced gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931344632|title=Non-traditional aid and gender equity evidence from million dollar donations|last=Okonkwo|first=Osili, Una|date=2013|publisher=WIDER|year=|isbn=9789292306533|location=|pages=3|oclc=931344632}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 OECD member nations committed almost $37 billion to aid for gender equality, with over $7 billion of that committed to programs where gender equality is a principal programmatic goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/gender-related-aid-data.htm|title=Gender-related aid data at a glance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=OECD|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effectiveness ====
Three main measures of gender inequality are used in calculating gender equality and testing programs for the purposes of development aid. In the 1995 Human Development Report the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] introduced the [[Gender Development Index]] and [[Gender Empowerment Measure]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Swain, Ranjula Bali and Garikipati, Supriya. 2016. Does Foreign Aid Improve Gender Performance of Recipient Countries? Results from Structural Equation Analysis. Paper presented at 25th IAFFE Annual Conference, Galway, Ireland. 7. Abstract retrieved from https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IAFFE2016&amp;paper_id=66&amp;file_type=slides.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gender Empowerment Measure is calculated based on three measures, proportion of women in national parliaments, percentage of women in economic decision making positions and female share of income. The Gender Development Index uses the Human Development Index and corrects its results in life expectancy, income, and education for gender imbalances.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Due to criticisms of these two indexes the United Nations Development Program in its 2010 Human Development Report introduced the [[Gender Inequality Index]]. The Gender Inequality Index uses more metrics and attempts to show the losses from gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Even with these indexes, Ranjula Swain of the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] and Supriya Garikipati of the [[University of Liverpool]] found that, compared to the effectiveness of health, economic, and education targeted aid, foreign aid for gender equality remains understudied.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, Ranjula Bali and Garikipati, Supriya. 2016. Does Foreign Aid Improve Gender Performance of Recipient Countries? Results from Structural Equation Analysis. Paper presented at 25th IAFFE Annual Conference, Galway, Ireland. 5. Abstract retrieved from https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IAFFE2016&amp;paper_id=66&amp;file_type=slides.&lt;/ref&gt; Swain and Garikipati found in an analysis of Gender Equality Aid that on a country and region-wide level gender equality aid was not significant in its effect. Swain and Garikipati blame this on the relative lack of aid with gender equality as a primary motivation.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Swain, Ranjula Bali and Garikipati, Supriya. 2016. Does Foreign Aid Improve Gender Performance of Recipient Countries? Results from Structural Equation Analysis. Paper presented at 25th IAFFE Annual Conference, Galway, Ireland. 12-13. Abstract retrieved from https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IAFFE2016&amp;paper_id=66&amp;file_type=slides.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Interagency Gender Working Group and [[World Health Organization]] released the “So What? Report” on the effectiveness of Gender Mainstreaming in NGO reproductive health programs. The report found these programs effective, but had trouble finding clear gender outcomes because most programs did not measure this data.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender-equity-rights/knowledge/so-what-report.pdf|title=A Summary of the "So What?" Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=WHO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When gender outcomes were measured, the report found positive programmatic effects, but the report did not look at whether these results were from increased access to services or increasing gender equality.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ravindran|first=TKS|last2=Kelkar-Khambete|first2=A.|date=|title=Gender Mainstreaming in Health: Looking Back, Looking Forward|url=|journal=Global Public Health|volume=3|pages=127–129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when gender equality is identified as a goal of aid, other factors will often be the primary focus of the aid.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In some instances the nature of aid’s gender equality component can fail to be implemented at the level of individual projects when it is a secondary aspect of a project.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, Hilary. "Not Waving But Drowing Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United Nations". ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''. 18: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender equality is often put forward as a policy goal for the organization but program staff have differing commitment and training with regards to this goal.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Van Eerdewijk, Anouka. "The Micropolitics of Evaporation: Gender Mainstreaming Instruments in Practice". Journal of International Development. 26: 353.&lt;/ref&gt; When gender equality is a secondary aspect, development aid which has funds required to impact gender equality can be used to meet quotas of women receiving aid, without effecting the changes in gender roles that Gender Mainstreaming was meant to promote.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Programs can also fail to provide lasting effects, with local organizations removing gender equality aspects of programs after international aid dollars are no longer funding them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Robert C. Jones of [[McGill University]] and Liam Swiss of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland|Memorial University]] argue that women leaders of governmental aid organizations and NGOs are more effective at Gender Mainstreaming than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Robert|last2=Swiss|first2=Liam|date=|title=Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending|url=|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=29|issue=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found in a literature review that NGOs headed by women were more likely to have Gender Mainstreaming programs and that women were often the heads of Gender Mainstreaming programs within organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert; Swiss, Liam (September 2014). "Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending". ''Sociological Forum''. '''29''' (3): 578.&lt;/ref&gt; By breaking down gender equality programs into two categories, gender mainstreamed programs and gender-focused programs which do not mainstream gender, Jones and Swiss found that female leaders of governmental aid organizations provided more financial support to gender mainstreamed programs and slightly more support to gender aware programs overall.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert; Swiss, Liam (September 2014). "Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending". ''Sociological Forum''. '''29''' (3): 582-583.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticisms ====
Petra Debusscher of [[Ghent University]] has criticized EU aid agencies for following an “integrationist approach” to gender mainstreaming, where gender mainstreaming is used to achieve existing policy goals, as opposed to a “transformative approach” which seeks to change policy priorities and programs fundamentally to achieve gender equality.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; She finds that this approach more closely follows a Women in Development model than a Gender and Development one. Debussher criticized the EU’s development policy in Latin America for focusing too much attention on gender inequality as a problem to be solved for women.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Debusscher, Petra. "Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?". ''Latin American Perspectives''. '''39''': 190.&lt;/ref&gt; She found that the language used represented more of a Woman in Development approach than a Gender and Development Approach.&lt;ref&gt;Debusscher, Petra. "Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?". ''Latin American Perspectives''. '''39''': 192-194.&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that men’s role in domestic violence is insufficiently brought forward, with program and policy instead targeting removing women from victimhood.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Rather than discussing the role of men and women relative to each other, women are discussed as needing to “catch up with an implicit male norm.”&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Debussher also criticized EU’s development aid to [[Southern Africa]] as too narrow in its scope and too reliant on integrating women and gender into existing aid paradigms.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Debusscher, Petra; Hulse, Merran. "Including Women's Voices? Gender Mainstreaming in EU and SADC Development Strategies for Southern Africa". ''Journal of Southern African Studies''. '''40''' (3): 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt; Debusscher notes that women’s organizations in the region are often concerned with different social constructions of gender, as opposed to the economic growth structure favored by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;Debusscher, Petra; Hulse, Merran. "Including Women's Voices? Gender Mainstreaming in EU and SADC Development Strategies for Southern Africa". ''Journal of Southern African Studies''. '''40''' (3): 566-567.&lt;/ref&gt; For EU development aid to Europe and surrounding countries, Debsusscher argued that programs to encourage education of women were designed primarily to encourage overall economic growth, not to target familial and social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|date=2012-10-01|title=Mainstreaming Gender in European Union Development Policy in the European Neighborhood|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1554477X.2012.722427|journal=Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy|volume=33|issue=4|pages=333|doi=10.1080/1554477X.2012.722427|issn=1554-477X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticism of gender equality development aid discusses a lack of voices of women’s organizations in developing aid programs. Debusscher argued that feminist and women’s organizations were not represented enough in EU aid.&lt;ref&gt;Debusscher, Petra. "Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?". ''Latin American Perspectives''. '''39''': 191-192.
&lt;/ref&gt; and that while feminist and women’s organizations were represented in implementing policy programs they were not sufficiently involved in their development in EU aid to [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Similarly, Jones and Swiss argue that more women need to be in leadership positions of aid organizations and that these organizations need to be “demasculinized” in order to better gender mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert; Swiss, Liam (September 2014). "Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending". ''Sociological Forum''. '''29''' (3): 583-584.&lt;/ref&gt; T.K.S. Ravindran and A. Kelkar-Khambete criticized the Millennium Development Goals for insufficiently integrating gender into all development goals, instead creating its own development goal, as limiting the level of aid provided to promote gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Ravindran, TKS; Kelkar-Khambete, A. "Gender Mainstreaming in Health: Looking Back, Looking Forward". ''Global Public Health''. '''3''': 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remittances==
It is doubtful whether [[remittances]], money sent home by foreign workers, ought to be considered a form of development aid. However, they appear to constitute a large proportion of the flows of money between developed and developing countries, although the exact amounts are uncertain because remittances are poorly tracked. [[World Bank]] estimates for remittance flows to developing countries in 2004 totalled $122&amp;nbsp;billion; however, this number is expected to change upwards in the next few years as the formulas used to calculate remittance flows are modified. The exact nature and effects of remittance money remain contested,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp03189.pdf Are Immigrant Remittance Flows a Source of Capital for Development? - WP/03/189&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however in at least 36 of the 153 countries tracked remittance sums were second only to FDI and outnumbered both public and private aid donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2005/021705.pdf Approaches to a Regulatory Framework for Formal and Informal Remittance Systems: Experiences and Lessons, February 17, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Monetary Fund]] has reported that private remittances may have a negative impact on economic growth, as they are often used for private consumption of individuals and families, not for economic development of the region or country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=16801.0 Are Immigrant Remittance Flows a Source of Capital for Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Doctor of Social Work''' (DSW) is a [[professional doctorate]] in [[social work]], most often offering advanced training in a professional area of practice including but not limited to; [[nonprofit organization]], [[leadership development]], and [[social justice]]. The DSW usually focuses on clinical practice or nonprofit administration. The DSW is related to, but also distinct from the more traditional [[PhD]], which is a more research-oriented degree for social workers who wish primarily to further their careers in academia or research settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Social Work Doctoral Programs |url=https://socialworklicensure.org/social-worker-education/social-work-doctoral-programs/ |website=SocialWorkLicensure.org |accessdate=November 10, 2018 |language=English |quote=There are two types of social work doctorate: the DSW and the PhD. The Doctor of Social Work or DSW has traditionally been considered a practice doctorate, as opposed to a research degree. It’s the newer degree, but it’s actually far from new. The first DSW programs came into being in the 1940’s – when today’s retirees were mere children.  There is a difference between DSW and PhD programs… sometimes. The title of the degree may have as much to do with its history as its current requirements. Each degree has had times in history when it was favored. If a school offers both degrees, one can expect the PhD to be the research-heavy one.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although different schools vary in the extent to which they emphasize each, both DSW and PhD candidates in the field of social work gain experience in education, advanced practice, teaching, supervision, research, policy analysis, administration and/or program development. As with other doctorates, a holder of a DSW is referred to using the formal title of 'doctor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Individuals who hold the '''Doctor of Social Work''' work in a variety of fields and disciplines that coincide with that of [[social work]] including [[higher education]], [[health care administration]] and [[nonprofit organization]]. 

==History of the DSW degree==
Although the first doctoral degrees that were offered in the field of social work were that of PhD's, in late 1940's the '''Doctor of Social Work''' program emerged, with some of the earliest DSW degrees having been offered at [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Smith College]]. Some institutions that originally offered PhD programs in Social Work later converted to the DSW professional doctorate degree due to growing and improving trends in social work and in academia. 

By the 1960's and 1970's, doctoral degrees for social work increased significantly. By the early 1970's, many universities began only offering the DSW professional doctorate, surpassing that of the PhD degree in social work that was originally offered at many competing institutions. 

Over the years, great confusion lied between the PhD and the DSW with many holders of the DSW entering research based positions within higher education. Seeing that the DSW is a professional practice based doctorate, many institutions slowly began to remove the DSW from their curriculum in an effort to promote research education within the discipline. 

With many social workers and allied health professionals pursuing clinical practice based doctoral degrees in other disciplines including education, nursing, psychology, physical therapy and nutrition, the discussion to promote the DSW degree was slowly placed at the forefront. 

Understanding that not all practice based doctorates should be solely focused on advanced clinical practice, the DSW was emerged as an advanced practice [[professional doctorate]]. 

Having being an advanced practice doctoral degree, the Doctor of Social Work is an important development in community based social services encompassing components in education, social justice, social welfare and policy development/analysis. 

Holders of this degree are expected to work in a variety of fields and arenas in social service agencies, health and mental health care institutions, higher education and academia, and community service organizations.

==Time frame==

The typical time frame for completion of a Doctor of Social Work is 3 to 4 years after earning a master's degree. Some institutions however, offer an advanced alternative to the degree for those with prior knowledge and experience in social work and furthermore, for holders with other social work oriented degrees.

==Admission==

Admission to a Doctor of Social Work program in the USA is highly competitive. Typically, institutions require applicants to hold a master's degree. Applicants may also hold a MSW degree from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited program or a related degree including but not limited to [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA), [[Master of Public Health]] (MPA),  [[Master of Arts in Education]] (MAEd), [[Master of Science in Nursing]] (MSN), [[Master of Public Policy]] (MPP) and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2561">'''Ethnodoxology''' is an application of [[ethnomusicology]], ethnic arts studies, worship studies, [[missiology]], and related disciplines. Those in this field study local musical traditions and work with local musicians and churches to adapt and develop locally created musical forms for Christian worship. Examples of such work include engaging a local praise singer in translating and singing Mary's [[Magnificat]],&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Wedekind. 1975. "The praise singers." ''The Bible Translator'' 26: 245-47.&lt;/ref&gt; developing local hymns, leading people in creating localized forms of liturgy,&lt;ref&gt;Kedra Larsen. 2009. Bokyi and Yala Lutheran liturgy in song. MA thesis, Bethel University.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing examples of starting points for people interested in utilizing local arts but not knowing where to start.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Balonek. 2009. "You Can Use That in the Church?" Musical Contextualization and the Sinhala Church. MA Thesis, Bethel University. Also at: https://www.amazon.com/That-Church-Musical-Contextualization-Sinhala/dp/1463759061&lt;/ref&gt; A broad resource for those in the field is a pair of volumes: ''Worship and Mission for the Global Church: An Ethnodoxology Handbook''&lt;ref&gt;James Krabill, ed. 2013. William Carey Library.&lt;/ref&gt; and its how-to companion ''Creating Local Arts Together: A Manual to Help Communities Reach their Kingdom Goals''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Schrag, ed. 2013. William Carey Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Council of Ethnodoxologists'' define ethnodoxology as;

:''"the [[theological]] and [[anthropological]] study, and practical application, of how every culture group might use its unique and diverse [[artistic]] expressions appropriately to worship the [[God]] of the [[Bible]]."''

The term was coined by Dave Hall, a pioneer of the school of ethnodoxology and founder of ''Worship From The Nations''.

Hall states;

:''I define ethnodoxology as "the study of the worship of God among diverse cultures" or, more precisely, "the theological and practical study of how and why people of diverse cultures praise and glorify the true and living God as revealed in the Bible." The term finds its source in 2 Biblical Greek words. "Ethno," from the Greek word "ethne" meaning 'peoples' or 'people groups' and "[[doxology]]," from the Greek word "doxos" meaning 'glory' or 'praise.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''"Genre-busting"''' is a term used occasionally in reviews of written work, music and visual art and refers to the author or artist's ability to cross over two or more established styles. For instance, in writing, to combine the horror [[genre]] with a [[Western (genre)|western]] or [[hard-boiled]] detective story with [[science fiction]]. In music the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification.

The sound of the term calls to mind other uses of "buster" such as "crime buster", "[[Gangbusters]]", "[[Ghostbusters]]", "[[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Dambusters]]", etc.

Creative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category. So genre-busting within the publishing world has become a type of [[literary fiction]]. The publisher [[Atticus Books]] has gone so far as to declare, on their website: ''"We specialize in genre-busting literary fiction—i.e., titles that fall between the cracks of genre fiction and compelling narratives that feature memorable main characters."''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://atticusbooksonline.com/about |title=Atticus Books (about) |publisher=atticusbooksonline.com |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Video Movie Guide 1998'' stated in its foreword, "In past years, reviews in VMG have been broken down into genre categories. Now, by popular demand, we are listing all movies together in alphabetical order.... So many movies today mix genres... and there are no clear-cut categories anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Mick|last2=Porter|first2=Marsha|title=Video Movie Guide 1998|date=October 1997|isbn=978-0345424235|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed in ''Mustard'' comedy magazine in 2005, writer [[Alan Moore]] said: "I mean, this is probably a bad thing to say to someone from a comedy magazine, but I don't like genre. I think that genre was made up by some spotty clerk in [[WH Smiths]] in the 1920s to make his worthless fucking job a little easier for him: "it'd be easier if these books said what they were about on the spine."" going on to say: "In the novel I'm writing, Jerusalem, there's an awful lot of funny stuff, and there's supernatural stuff; there's stuff in the prologue that's as good as [[Stephen King]] and it's just a description of my brother walking through a block of flats. It's horror. And there's social history, there's political stuff. Why not mix it all together? Because that's what life is actually like. We laugh, we cry, you know, we buy the t-shirt." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.mustardweb.org/04/page15.htm |title=The Mustard Interview |publisher=mustardweb.org |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac Dudley Fletcher''' (1844 – 1917) was a US businessman, art collector and museum benefactor.

He had the mansion built that is called today the [[Harry F. Sinclair House]]. He was president of Barrett Manufacturing Company and acquired a large art collection which he bequeathed to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3253700.pdf.bannered.pdf|format=PDF|title=1918 museum bulletin describing the bequeathed collection|website=Metmuseum.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Frick library, he owned work by "David, Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Reynolds, and Rubens, Alexander H Wyant, Corot and Daubigny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=7443|title=Fletcher, Isaac Dudley, 1844-1917|website=Research.frick.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "work by David" referred to the ''[[Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes (Marie-Denise Villers)|Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes]]'', which at the time of the bequest in 1917 was still attributed to Jacques-Louis David, but since 1995 has been attributed to [[Marie-Denise Villers]].

Besides the collection itself, the bequest included a large sum of money to start a fund for the purchase of art. According to the 1994 Museum guidebook, several of the paintings listed were purchased through the ''Fletcher Fund'', most notably the ''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=zoM2KmG_ndgC&amp;pg=PA169|title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide|first1=Philippe De|last1=Montebello|date=28 August 1994|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=28 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is an [[industrial symbiosis]] network located in [[Kalundborg]], [[Denmark]], in which companies in the region collaborate to use each other's by-products and otherwise share resources.

The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is the first full realization of industrial symbiosis.&lt;ref name=Chertow2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chertow|first=Marian|title=Industrial symbiosis: literature and taxonomy|journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|year=2000|volume=25|pages=313–337|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collaboration and its environmental implications arose unintentionally through private initiatives, as opposed to government planning, making it a model for private planning of eco-industrial parks.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; At the center of the exchange network is the [[Asnæs Power Station]], a 1500MW [[Coal power plant|coal-fired power plant]], which has material and energy links with the community and several other companies.  [[Waste heat|Surplus heat]] from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby [[fish farm]], whose [[sludge]] is then sold as a [[fertilizer]].  [[Steam]] from the power plant is sold to [[Novo Nordisk]], a [[pharmaceutical]] and [[enzyme]] manufacturer, in addition to [[Statoil]] power plant.  This reuse of [[Waste heat|heat]] reduces the amount [[thermal pollution]] discharged to a nearby [[fjord]].  Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's [[sulfur dioxide]] [[scrubber]] contains [[gypsum]], which is sold to a [[wallboard]] manufacturer.  Almost all of the manufacturer's [[gypsum]] needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of [[open-pit mining]] needed.  Furthermore, [[fly ash]] and [[Clinker (waste)|clinker]] from the power plant is used for road building and [[cement]] production.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld"/&gt; These exchanges of waste, water and materials have greatly increased environmental and economic efficiency, as well as created other less tangible benefits for these actors, including sharing of personnel, equipment, and information.&lt;ref name=Chertow2 /&gt;

==History==
The Kalundborg Industrial Park was not originally planned for industrial symbiosis. Its current state of waste heat and materials sharing developed over a period of 20 years. Early sharing at Kalundborg tended to involve the sale of waste products without significant pretreatment.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt;  Each further link in the system was negotiated as an independent business deal, and was established only if it was expected to be economically beneficial.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt;

The park began in 1959 with the start up of the [[Asnæs Power Station]]. The first episode of sharing between two entities was in 1972 when Gyproc, a plaster-board manufacturing plant, established a pipeline to supply gas from [[Tidewater Petroleum|Tidewater Oil Company]]. In 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completed a district heating distribution network within the city of Kalundborg, which utilized waste heat from the power plant.&lt;ref name="Industrial Green Book" &gt;National Research Council (1998). The Ecology of Industry: Sector and Linkages. Washington DC: The National Academies Press. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the facilities in Kalundborg have been expanding, and have been sharing a variety of materials and waste products, some for the purpose of industrial symbiosis and some out of necessity, for example,  freshwater scarcity in the area has led to water reuse schemes. In particular, 700,000 cubic meters per year of cooling water is piped from Statoil to Asnaes per year.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt;

A timeline of the creation of the industrial park:
* 1959 The [[Asnæs Power Station]] was started up
* 1961 Tidewater Oil Company constructed a pipeline from [[Tissø|Lake Tissø]] to provide water for its operation
* 1963 Tidewater Oil Company's oil refinery is taken over by [[Esso]]
* 1972 Gyproc establishes plaster-board manufacturing plant. A pipeline from the refinery to the Gyproc facility is constructed to supply excess refinery gas
* 1973 The [[Asnæs Power Station]] is expanded. A connection is built to the Lake Tissø-Statoil pipeline
* 1976 [[Novo Nordisk]] starts delivering biological sludge to neighboring farms
* 1979 [[Asnæs Power Station]] starts supplying [[fly ash]] to cement manufacturers in northern [[Denmark]]
* 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completes a district heating distribution network within the city that utilizes waste heat from the power plant
* 1982 [[Novo Nordisk]] and the [[Statoil]] refinery complete construction of steam supply pipelines from the power plant. By purchasing process steam from the power plant, the companies are able to shut down inefficient steam boilers
* 1987 The [[Statoil]] refinery completes a pipeline to supply its [[effluent]] cooling water to the power plant for use as raw boiler feed water.
* 1989 The power plant starts using waste heat from its salt cooling water to produce trout and turbot at its local fish farm
* 1989 [[Novo Nordisk]] enters into agreement with Kalundborg municipality, the power plant, and the refinery to connect to the water supply grid from Lake Tissø
* 1990 The [[Statoil]] refinery completes construction of a sulphur recovery plant. The recovered sulphur is sold as raw material to a sulfuric acid manufacturer in [[Fredericia]]
* 1991 The [[Statoil]] refinery commissions the building of a pipeline to supply biologically treated refinery [[effluent]] water to the power plant for cleaning purposes, and for [[fly ash]] stabilization
* 1992 The [[Statoil]] refinery commissions the building of a pipeline to supply [[flare gas]] to the power plant as a supplementary fuel
* 1993 The power plant completes a stack [[flue gas]] desulfurization project. The resulting calcium sulphate is sold to Gyproc, where it replaces imported natural [[gypsum]]&lt;ref name="Industrial Green Book" /&gt;

== The Symbiosis ==
The relationships among the firms comprising the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park form an [[industrial symbiosis]]. Generally speaking, the actors involved in the symbiosis at Kalundborg exchange material wastes, energy, water, and information.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Domenech|first=Teresa|author2=Michael Davies|title=Structure and morphology of industrial symbiosis networks: The case of Kalundborg|journal=Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences|year=2011|volume=10|pages=79–89|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kalundborg network involves a number of actors, including a power station, two big energy firms, a plaster board company, and a soil remediation company. Other actors include farmers, recycling facilities, and fish factories that use some of the material flows.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies" /&gt;  [http://www.kalundborg.dk/Erhverv/Erhvervsudvikling/%20Kalundborg_EU-kontor.aspx Kalundborg Municipality] plays an active role. Additionally, other actors, such as Novoren, a recycling and urban land field firm, are formally part of the network but do not contribute
tangibly in the exchange.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies" /&gt;

=== Partners ===
[[File:Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park Symbiosis Map.jpg|thumb|A flowchart to show the material sharing between entities in the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park]]
The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park today includes nine private and public enterprises, some of which are some of the largest enterprises in Denmark.&lt;ref name="Kalundborg Symbiosis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalundborg Symbiosis|title=Partners|url=http://www.symbiosis.dk/en/partnere|accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enterprises are:
* [[Novo Nordisk]] - Danish company and largest producer of insulin in the world
* [[Novozymes]] - Danish company and largest enzyme producer in the world
* [http://www.gyproc.ie/ Gyproc] - French producer of gypsum board
* [http://www.kalundborg.dk/Forside.aspx Kalundborg Municipality]
* [[DONG Energy|Dong Energy]] - owner of Asnaes Power Station, the largest power plant in Denmark
* [http://www.rgs90.dk/ RGS 90] - Danish soil remediation and recovery company
* [[Statoil]] - Norwegian company which owns Denmark's largest oil refinery
* [http://www.karanoveren.dk/ Kara/Novoren] - Danish waste treatment company
* [http://www.kalundborgforsyning.dk/ Kalundborg Forsyning A/S] - water and heat supplier, as well as waste disposer, for Kalundborg citizens&lt;ref name="Kalundborg Symbiosis" /&gt;

=== Material Exchanges ===
[[File:Matrix of Kalundborg Exchanges.jpg|thumb|This matrix shows which actors in the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park interact with each other.]]
There are currently over thirty exchanges of materials among the actors of Kalundborg.&lt;ref name=Municipality&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalundborg Municipality|title=Kalundborg Symbiosis|url= http://www.kalundborg.dk/Erhverv/Erhvervsudvikling/Kalundborg_Symbiosis.aspx |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Asnaes Power Station is at the heart of the network.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenfeld|first=John |author2=Nicholas Gertler|title=Industrial Ecology in Practice:  The Evolution of Interdependence at Kalundborg|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|year=1997|volume=1|pages=67–79 |doi=10.1162/jiec.1997.1.1.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power company gives its steam residuals to the Statoil Refinery, meeting 40% of its steam requirements,&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; in exchange for waste gas from the refinery. The power plant creates electricity and steam from this gas.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt;  These products are sent to a fish farm and Novo Nordisk, who receive all of their required steam from Asnaes,&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; and a heating system that supplies 3500 homes.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; These homeowners pay for the underground piping that supplies their heat, but receive the heat reliably and at a low price.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; Fly ash from Asnaes is sent to a cement company, and gypsum from its desulfurization process is sent to Gyproc for use in gypsum board.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; Two-thirds of Gyproc's gypsum needs are met by Asnaes.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt;  Statoil Refinery removes sulfur from its natural gas and sells it to a sulfuric acid manufacturer, Kemira.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; The fish farm sells sludge from its ponds as fertilizer to nearby farms, and Novo Nordisk gives away its own sludge, of which it produces 3,000 cubic meters per day.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; The sludge is to be refined for biogas for the power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://ing.dk/artikel/cirkulaer-oekonomi-restaffaldet-enzym-insulinproduktion-skal-baade-bruges-biogas-goedning |title=Restaffaldet fra enzym- og insulinproduktion skal både bruges til biogas og gødning |date=24 March 2017|publisher=[[Ingeniøren]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water reuse schemes have also been developed within Kalundborg. Statoil pipes 700,000 cubic meters of cooling water per year to Asnaes, which purifies it and uses it as "boiler feed-water."&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; Asnaes also uses approximately 200,000 cubic meters of Statoil's treated wastewater per year for cleaning.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; The 90&amp;nbsp;°C residual heat from the refinery is not used for district heating due to taxes. Instead, [[heat pump]]s are used with the 24&amp;nbsp;°C waste water as a heat reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://ing.dk/artikel/professor-kalundborg-kombiner-spildvarme-varmpepumper-192757 |title=Professor til Kalundborg: Kombinér spildvarme og varmpepumper |date=27 January 2017|publisher=[[Ingeniøren]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Savings and Environmental Impacts==
[[File:Wastes avoided at Kalundborg.jpg|thumbnail|right|Annual wastes avoided in Kalundborg as of 1997]]
[[File:Savings from Kalundborg.jpg|thumbnail|right|Annual resource savings in Kalundborg as of 1997]]

Since its start over 25 years ago, Kalundborg has been operating successfully as an eco-industrial park. One of the main goals of industrial symbiosis is to make goods and services that use the least-cost combination of inputs. These relationships were formed on an economic and environmental basis.&lt;ref name="Desrochers"&gt;Desrochers, Pierre (2001). "Cities and Industrial Symbiosis: Some Historical Perspectives and Policy Implications." Journal of Industrial Ecology 5.4 : 29-44. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, there are over thirty exchanges occurring in Kalundborg. While Kalundborg does operate using trades between various firms in the vicinity, it itself is not self-sufficient or contained to the industrial park. There are many trades that occur with companies outside of this park region.&lt;ref name="Desrochers" /&gt;

All of these exchanges have contributed to water savings, and savings in fuel and input chemicals. Wastes were also avoided through these interchanges. For example, in 1997, Asnaes (the power station) saved 30,000 tons of coal (~2% of throughput) by using Statoil (large oil refinery) fuel gas. And 200,000 tons of fly ash and clinker were avoided from Asnaes landfill.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt; These resources savings and waste avoidances, documented before 1997, are illustrated in the tables to the right.

A study in 2002 showed that these exchanges also contributed to more than 95% of the total water supply to the power plant. This is up from 70% in 1990.  So, the system is becoming more comprehensive in its ability to save groundwater, however, there is still room for improvement. Out of the 1.2 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of wastewater discharged from Statoil (the refinery), only 9000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; were reused at the power plant.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"&gt;Jacobsen, Noel Brings (2006). "Industrial Symbiosis in Kalundborg, Denmark: A Quantitative Assessment of Economic and Environmental Aspects." Journal of Industrial Ecology 10.1-2: 239-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent numbers show a vast improvement, when comparing to the numbers from 1997, in resource savings. Data from around 2004 show annual savings of 2.9 million cubic meters of ground water, and 1 million cubic meters of surface water. Gypsum savings are estimated around 170,000 tons, and sulfur dioxide waste avoidance is estimated around 53 Tn. These numbers are mostly estimations. Aspects of the eco-industrial park have changed, and there are many levels to consider when doing these calculations. All together though, these interchanges have shown annual savings of up to $15 million (US), with investments around $78.5 million (US). The total accumulated savings is estimated around $310 million (US).&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies"/&gt;

==As a Model==
Kalundborg was the first example of separate industries grouping together to gain competitive advantage by material exchange, energy exchange, information exchange, and/or product exchange. The very term,  [[Industrial symbiosis|Industrial Symbiosis]] (IS) was first defined by a station manager in Kalundborg as "a cooperation between different industries by which the presence of each…increases the viability of the others, and by which the demands of society for resource savings and environmental protection are considered" .&lt;ref&gt;Chertow, Marian R (2007). ""Uncovering" Industrial Symbiosis." Journal of Industrial Ecology 11.1: 11-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalundborg's success helped generate interest in industrial symbiosis. Developed nations such as the United States began to formulate incentives for corporations to implement materials exchange with other corporations. Industrial and political circles began to look into the implementation of [[eco-industrial park]]s  (EIPs). Specifically, the United States worked to put into service several planned EIPs. The U.S President's Council on Sustainable Development in 1996 proposed fifteen eco-industrial parks to pursue the idea of industrial symbiosis. These parks were created by grouping diverse stakeholders with common material flows together, with added governmental incentives to encourage materials exchange. The goal of these planned EIPs was to test if the industrial symbiosis that worked so well in Kalundborg could be replicated. The Council on Sustainable Development also defined 5 major characteristics of a successful EIP to help guide EIP development. These characteristics include: (1) some form of material exchange between multiple separate entities, (2) industries within close proximity to each other, (3) cooperation between plant management of the different corporations, (4) an existing infrastructure for material sharing that does not require much retooling, and (5) "anchor" tenants (large corporation with resources to support early implementation). Devens Regional Enterprise Zone is a good example of a successful EIP in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lowitt, Peter C (2008). "Devens Redevelopment: Emergence of a Successful Eco-Industrial Park in the United States." Journal of Industrial Ecology 12.4: 497-500. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalundborg became an attractive topic in academia as well because of the obvious sustainability advantages of industrial symbiosis. Research conducted on planning and implementation of eco-industrial parks revealed interesting results. Experts argued over the idea of "planned parks" versus "self organized parks". Research showed systematic failure of forced or planned EIPs. Most successful EIPs originate from industrial symbiosis that occurs naturally during industry life, much like the Kalundborg case. This conclusion served to deflate the momentum that the success of Kalundborg generated. Organizations began to recognize the difficulties associated with forcing eco-industrial parks to coalesce and abandoned the idea.

'''Law and development''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] study of law and economic and [[social development]].  It examines the relation between law and development and analyzes how to use law as an instrument to promote economic and social development.

In the 1960s, some American organizations such as the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] and the [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the law reform in [[developing countries]]. Legal scholars from leading American law schools wrote many articles discussing the contribution of law reform to economic development.  This was called the law and development movement. However, after only one decade, both key involved scholars and former [[Ford Foundation]] officials declared this movement failed.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek &amp; Galanter (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumably failed law and development revived in the 1980s, with the proliferation of law reform projects based on neoliberal ideals. These projects supported liberal reforms such as privatization and trade liberalization, with the emphasis on the rule of law. Substantial investments were made on these projects by international development agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, and other public agencies and private foundations, but these law reform projects were criticized for being ineffective or causing adverse impacts on development in many places in the world. 

The cause of the failure in the first and second law and development movements is that the law reform projects were developed and implemented without sufficient understanding of the mechanism by which LFIs impact economic and social development, which is affected by various socio-economic factors on the ground. &lt;ref&gt;Lee (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.lawanddevelopment.net The Law and Development Institute] was set up in 2009 to promote studies in law and development and develop a comprehensive analytical model for law and development, and the [http://www.degruyter.com/ldr Law and Development Review] was launched in 2008 as the only peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to law and development.

'''Sylvie Merzeau''' (commonly called '''Louise Merzeau''', 8 November 1963 – 15 July 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dicen-idf.org/louise-merzeau-nous-a-quittes/|title=Louise Merzeau nous a quittés|publisher=Dicen-IDF|language=French|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[France|French]] academic, university [[professor]] at the [[Paris Nanterre University]] (specializing on [[communication studies]]) and a [[photographer]].

Merzeau was a trustee of [[Wikimedia France]] between 2015 and 2017.

== Biography ==
Louise Merzeau is a former student of the [[École normale supérieure de lettres et sciences humaines|École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud]] (L1982 promotion) and a qualified teacher of contemporary literature (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/louise-merzeau|title=CV HAL : Louise Merzeau|last=HAL|website=cv.archives-ouvertes.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://affordance.typepad.com//mon_weblog/2017/07/salut-louise.html|title=Salut Louise.|website=affordance.info|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral thesis "From scriptural to index: text, photography, document" in 1993 was written under supervision of [[Nicole Boulestreau]]. She passed her [[habilitation]] to conduct research in 2011 on the subject of the concept of memory in the age of internet. In 2016, she becomes a university professor at Paris-Nanterre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret du 15 décembre 2016 portant nomination, titularisation et affectation (enseignements supérieurs)|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000033624003&amp;categorieLien=id|accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a co-director of the Nanterre research laboratory Dicen-IDF and member of the e.laboratory on Human Trace Complex System Digital Campus UNESCO.

Merzeau's research was inspired by the concept of [[mediology]] designed by [[Régis Debray]] and was primarily about the relations between culture and technology, in particular, on the technological, institutional, and sociological aspects of memory. She has designed the concept of hypersphere to extend the list of [[Médiasphère|mediaspheres]] initially proposed by Debray, to characterize sociological and technical ecosystems associated with the development of the internet. She was the chief co-editor of the journal ''[[Les cahiers de médiologie]]'' during several years.

Merzeau also focused on the question of traces - that she developed with researchers like [[Béatrice Galinon-Mélénec]] - and on [[numerical identity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.archimag.com/archives-patrimoine/2016/09/13/louise-merzeau-memoire-pensee-oubli|title=Louise Merzeau : "Il n'y a pas de mémoire sans une pensée de l'oubli"|work=Archimag|access-date=2017-07-27|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the idea of an [[identity mediation]] and a presence which cannot be reduced to an accumulation of calculated traces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.franceculture.fr/conferences/bibliotheque-publique-dinformation/facebook-twitter-instagram-fictions-de-soi|title=Facebook, Twitter, Instagram : fictions de soi|website=France Culture|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/du-grain-moudre/reseaux-sociaux-sommes-nous-tous-des-big-brothers|title=Réseaux sociaux : sommes-nous tous des Big Brothers ?|work=France Culture|access-date=2017-07-27|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, her work concentrated on behavior in numerical environments and the conditions of a numerical culture. In a conference on "The User's intelligence" for example, employing the theories of usage and the stakes of digital literacy, she seeks to demonstrate, from the user to the consumer and the content producer, the multiplicity of the user's role. In the article "Copy and paste",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merzeau|first=Louise|date=|title=Copier-coller.|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/727080/filename/Merzeau-Copier-coller.pdf|journal=M ́edium : Transmettre pour Innover, Ed. Babylone, 2012, pp.312-333.|volume=|pages=312–333|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Merzeau proposes a vision that aims at overcoming the simple notions of plagiarism and theft associated to this practice. The notion of paste and copy should not be forbidden: a new learning process of copying as a way of thinking could lead to knowledge, therefore underlying the importance of a pedagogical frame. The copy and paste could be a solution to the commercial logics of the web. This conception is to be put in relation with her engagement in the movement of common goods, to which she participates through the Savoirscom1 collective group, which fights for the user's rights against the risks of informational enclosure,. On this subject, she has opened an axe called "numerical common goods" in the university master's "Cultural industries and numerical environments" at the Paris Nanterre university.

In March 2015, Sylvie directed in collaboration with Lionel Barbe and Valérie Schafer the publication of a collective book on [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2016/01/11/wikipedia-un-objet-scientifique-non-identifie_4845331_1650684.html|title=Wikipédia, " un objet scientifique non identifié "|last=par)|first=David Larousserie (propos recueillis|date=2016-01-11|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-07-26|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research switches to the notion of editorialisation, that she developed with researchers like [[Marcello Vitali-Rosati]] of the University of Montréal and [[Gérard Wormser]] of the journal [[Sens Public]]. This notion centers the question of traces on writing processes seen as collective interaction and technical contexts.

Louise Merzeau is also involved in [[web archiving]] through the workshops on methodological research of legal web deposits at [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]], where she supervised scientifical aspects from 2010 to her death.

She also has an activity of numeric and [[creative photography]]. She became a member of the scientifical council of [[Wikimedia France]] in 2015, and was coopted in as a member of the board of trustees in May 2017.

'''Macroecology''' is the subfield of [[ecology]] that deals with the study of relationships between organisms and their [[natural environment|environment]] at large spatial scales to characterise and explain statistical patterns of abundance, distribution and diversity.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  The term was coined by [[James Brown (ecologist)|James Brown]] of the [[University of New Mexico]] and Brian Maurer of [[Michigan State University]] in a 1989 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown J.H. &amp; Maurer B.A. (1989) Macroecology: the division of food and space among species on continents. [[Science (journal)|Science]], 243, 1145-1150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroecology approaches the idea of studying [[ecosystem]]s using a "top down" approach.  It seeks understanding through the study of the properties of the system as a whole; Kevin Gaston and Tim Blackburn make the analogy to seeing the forest for the trees.&lt;ref name = "Gaston&amp;Blackbun"&gt;Gaston, K.J. and T.M. Blackburn. 2000. ''Pattern and Process in Macroecology''.  Blackwell Science. {{ISBN|0-632-05653-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroecology examines how global development in climate change affect [[wildlife]] populations. Classic ecological questions amenable to study through the techniques of macroecology include questions of [[species richness]], [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]], the [[species-area curve]], range size, body size, and [[abundance (ecology)|species abundance]].  For example, the relationship between abundance and range size (why species that maintain large local population sizes tend to be widely distributed, while species that are less abundant tend to have restricted ranges) has received much attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first= J.H.| title= Macroecology| year= 1995| publisher= University of Chicago Press| isbn= 0-226-07614-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Madi (disambiguation)}}

'''Madí''' (or MADI; also known as Grupo Madí or Arte Madí) is an international abstract (or concrete) art movement initiated in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946 by the Hungarian-Argentinian artist and poet [[Gyula Kosice]], and the Uruguayans [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] and [[Rhod Rothfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Madí: Nelson Di Maggio, curador de retrospectiva sobre Carmelo Arden Quin|url=http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2010/11/made-in-madi/|publisher=La Diaria|accessdate=14 June 2012|author=Riccardo Boglione|date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement focuses on creating [[concrete art]] (i.e., non-representational [[geometric abstraction]]) and encompasses all branches of art (the plastic and pictorial arts, music, literature, theater, architecture, dance, etc.). The artists in the Madí movement consider the concrete, physical reality of the art medium and play with the traditional conventions of [[Western art history|Western art]] (for instance, by creating works on irregularly-shaped canvases).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention "Concrete Invention."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. Web. 30 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork of Madí movement appeared in eight issues of its magazine, ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'', published between 1947 and 1954.

== Historical Context ==
The Madí art movement formed as a reaction to the major concrete art movement in Argentina at the time, known as the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI), whose art was perceived by the Madí group as being too strict in their method of creating concrete art, resulting in a lack of expression in their artworks. 

Operating under the rule of Colonel [[Juan Perón|Perón]], whose time in power was characterized by a volatile political climate, the Madí artists used their art to make statements with social and political implications. One of the most overt criticisms made by the Madí movement criticized cultural authorities in the ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'' magazine'','' commenting "[t]he last submission to the Venice Biennial has signified for Argentina a blunt negation of the new [artistic] values. We invite competent authorities to stop and compare the true current of contemporary plastic arts with the submissions that today put us [our country] half a century behind", which vaguely attack the aesthetic choices of certain cultural officers under Perón. According to [[Pérez-Barreiro]], Madí and Concrete art (referring to the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI)) are the artistic parallel(s) of the political phenomenon of [[Peronism]]. These artists were also seen as combining modern art with Communist ideology. Some scholars, including Barreiro, saw the government was an outspoken critic against concrete art as a whole, whereas others such as [[Andrea Giunta]] assert that the Madí and Concrete groups were not victimized under Perón's regime; rather, they "coexisted on its margins".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The political regime of Perón made use of both linguistic and visual images for propaganda purposes. This is seen in his use of an image, "the shirtless workers" (los descamisados), as an alternative to the concept of the working class. This image had strong connections and connotations with the male worker, shirtless and, unrealistically, without much affliction. In a speech given October 17th, 1946 at Plaza de Mayo, Perón addressed the workers in speeches as "mis queridos descamisados" (my loving shirtless workers). At this speech, he declared October 17th the "Day of the Shirtless Workers" and stated "I don’t want to govern over men but over their hearts, because mine beats in unison with the heart of each shirtless worker, which I interpret and love above all things.” The use of representations to create propaganda opened up a clear target for the Madí artists to oppose.

== Origin of the name ==
Gyula Kosice, who also operated under the pseudonym Raymundo Rasas Pèt, has explained that the name for the movement is derived from the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] motto in the [[Spanish Civil War]], "''Madrí, Madrí, no pasarán''" ("Madrid, Madrid, they will not make it in", i.e., the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist forces]] will not invade Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;[http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml "Entrevista a Gyula Kosice"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629170755/http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml |date=29 June 2012 }}, ''Ñusleter Cultura'', 12 de agosto de 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is most typically understood as an acronym for ''Movimiento, Abstracción, Dimensión, Invención'' (Movement, Abstraction, Dimension, Invention).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
A Madí work is non-figurative and non-representational; it has a cut-out or irregularly-shaped form, which takes away the viewer's perception of spatial depth that a rectangular frame provides; its colors are flat and sharply defined; it is often three-dimensional and sometimes articulated and/or mechanical; and it is playful in spirit. Madí artists were concerned with creating artworks that were autonomous with functions that naturally transcend the physical features that constitute the work. Introducing elements of transformation and ambiguity were techniques commonly employed by these artists to avoid representation as well as avoid the fixity of representations. In painted works, some artists would intentionally lower the legibility of the design.

The incorporation of unusual materials into artworks is seen throughout the art movement movement; this includes Plexiglas, fluorescent tubes, neon lights, water, metal, and other materials. An example of this is seen in [[Gyula Kosice|Kosice's]] first hydraulic piece, ''La arquitectura del agua: Hidro-escultura (The Architecture of Water: Hydro-Sculpture)'', which utilized light and water interaction.

Madí artists sought to combat representational forms because this art reflected and perpetuated class-based social organizations. They believed that representational images "forced others to relate to concepts, connotations, and feelings which were superfluous to the object itself... which enticed individuals into supporting class-based organizations". The Concrete art they produced was meant to have a reality that was self-contained. In other words, the reality of the art ended in the object. In the minds of the Madí artists, "Concrete art was worthy as a contribution to social liberation" because it helped its audience grasp true reality while standing against the concepts, connotations and feelings associated with art. To state this differently, exposing people to what is actually reality allows people to eventually confront myths perpetuated by the bourgeois that has suppressed revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Madí is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946. Today, the MADI movement has over 60 members — painters, sculptors, architects and poets — working in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Japan, [[Argentina]] and the United States. One prominent figure behind this fifty years of artistic creation is [[Carmelo Arden Quin]].

== The Madí Manifesto ==
The Madí Manifesto was created to defend the importance of invention in the light of limitations imposed on concrete art by the excessive rationalism of European concrete art. This strictness of form in concrete art was also demonstrated by the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI). The manifesto also called for "the integration of the nonorthogonal framework into representational space".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geometric Abstraction: Latin American Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection|last=Bois|first=Yve-Alan|publisher=Harvard University Art Museums|year=2001|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Madí Dictionary ==
In written works, artists "disrupted the construction of semantically coherent structures" to avoid attaching meaning to the art and the possibility of representation. The Madí created a dictionary that accomplished the opposite of what a normal dictionary does in that it confused and distorted the meanings of words and made up words. The following excerpt is from the Madí dictionary, which demonstrates a correct grammatical structure that relates ideas that are impossible to interpret meaningfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is an example of this incoherent construction which prevents interpretation:&lt;blockquote&gt;M               &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Maclode: Upward hill. / Slope to insinuate land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meril: Kidnapping of flat centimeters. / ''Madícional'' [‘Madí-like’ or ‘of Madí origin’] opposition and resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Miogue: Account of events in which the authors of great answers participated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Molois: Site where the most varied adjectives are collected. / ''Fam''. Insult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Musver: About the manner to focus in photography the liveliest glare of a childhood memory. / Fixation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Macichud: Line of shade that emits a loosening of gray beams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;N&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nandy: Arrangement for new personal cuño.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nem-Er: Record of instances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nigs: Opening that is left so that a cluster of enchanted powder emigrates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Novoh: Shooter that the riverside authority exercises to learn the coastal ruling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Selected Artists and Artworks ==
Representatives of the Madí movement, in addition to Kosice, Quin and Rothfuss, include [[Martín Blaszko]], [[Waldo Longo]], [[Juan Bay]], [[Esteban Eitler]], [[Diyi Laañ]], and [[Valdo Wellington]], among others.

== Why MADI? ==
To the question, "Why MADI?" Josee Lapeyrere, who met Arden Quin in 1962 and has since participated with her poem-objects in most of the events organized by the movement, replies: "MADI's goal is to be rigorous, inventive, gay and ludic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MADI internacional 50 años después: exposición del 7 de marzo al 3 de abril de 1996, Centro de Exposiciones y Congresos, Zaragoza|last=Osornio|first=Cesar Lopez|last2=Roitman|first2=Ibercaja|publisher=Ibercaja|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the importance to which they accord spiritual and imaginative games, even the most serious MADI artists can be described as playful. Already in 1795, Schiller focused on "the inborn playful nature of man" as an explanation for his production of art forms. In his essay, "[[Homo Ludens]]" ("Ludic Man") (1938), [[Johan Huizinga]] observed that, "Play reveals an aspiration to beauty. The terms we use to designate the elements of play are, for the most part, the same as those utilized in the aesthetic realm: beauty, tension, balancing, equilibrium, gradation, contrast, etc. Like art, play engages and delivers. It absorbs. It captivates, or, in other words, it charms. It is full of those two supremely noble qualities which man expresses through rhythm and harmony." The French art critic [[Dominique Jacquemin]] also remarks that, "It is possible that Arden Quin's passion for game playing led him to create MADI, the only remaining contemporary art movement which can pride itself in possessing both coherence and a truly international outlook."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2678">A '''memory institution''' is an organization maintaining a ''repository of public knowledge'', a generic term used about institutions such as libraries, archives, museums, [[sites and monuments record]]s (SMR), clearinghouses, providers of [[digital libraries]] and [[data aggregation]] services which serve as memories for given societies or mankind. Increasingly such institutions are considered as a part of a unified [[documentation science|documentation]]/[[information science]] perspective.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Lorcan Dempsey]] may have introduced the term into popular use in [[library and information science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dempsey |first=Lorcan |date=1999 |title=Scientific, Industrial, and Cultural Heritage: A Shared Approach |url=http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue22/dempsey/ |journal=Ariadne |volume=5 |issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others, such as Joan Schwarz, used it earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarz |first1=Joan M. |date=1995 |title="We make our tools and our tools make us": Lessons from Photographs for the Practice, Politics, and Poetics of Diplomatics |url=http://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12096/13082 |journal=Archivaria.

Helena Robinson (2012) criticized the term when she wrote, "[r]ather than revealing the essential affiliation between museums, libraries and archives, their sweeping classification as 'memory institutions' in the public sector and the academy oversimplifies the concept of memory, and marginalises domain-specific approaches to the cataloguing, description, interpretation and deployment of collections that lead museums, libraries and archives to engage with history, meaning and memory in significantly different ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Helena |date=2012 |title=Remembering Things Differently: Museums, Libraries and Archives as Memory Institutions and the Implications for Convergence |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09647775.2012.720188 |journal=Museum Management and Curatorship |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=413-429 |access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mesophile''' is an [[organism]] that grows best in moderate [[temperature]], neither too hot nor too cold, typically between {{convert|20|and|45|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Joanne M., Linda Sherwood, Christopher J. Woolverton, and Lansing M. Prescott. Prescott, Harley, and Klein's Microbiology. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is mainly applied to [[microorganism]]s.  Organisms that prefer extreme environments are known as [[extremophiles]]. Mesophiles have diverse classifications, belonging to two [[domain (biology)|domain]]s: [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and to [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Fungi]] of domain [[Eukaryote|Eucarya]].  Mesophiles belonging to the domain Bacteria can either be [[gram-positive]] or [[gram-negative]]. Gram-positive bacteria have a cell layer made of [[peptidoglycan]] and stains purple. Gram-negative bacteria also contains peptidoglycan, yet the layer is extremely thin and stains red or pink. Oxygen requirements for mesophiles are not just confined to [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]]. There are three basic shapes of mesophiles: [[coccus]], [[bacillus]], and [[spiral]].

==Habitat==
The habitats of mesophiles can include [[cheese]] and [[yogurt]]. They are often included during fermentation of [[beer]] and [[wine]] making.  Since normal human body temperature is 37 [[celsius|°C]], the majority of human [[pathogens]] are mesophiles, as are most of the organisms comprising the [[human microbiome]].

== Vs. extremophiles==
Mesophiles are the opposite of [[extremophile]]s. Extremophiles that prefer cold environments are termed  [[psychrophile|psychrophilic]], those preferring warmer temperatures are termed [[Thermophile|thermophilic or thermotropic]] and those thriving in extremely hot environments are [[hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]].
A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to classify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hao Zheng|author2=Hongwei Wu|title=Gene-centric association analysis for the correlation between the guanine-cytosine content levels and temperature range conditions of prokaryotic species|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|year=2010|volume=11|issue=Suppl 11|pages=S7|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-S11-S7|pmc=3024870|pmid=21172057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
All bacteria have their own optimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive. Many factors are responsible for a given organism's optimal temperature range, but evidence suggests that the expression of particular genetic elements ([[alleles]]) can alter the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the organism. A recently published study demonstrated that mesophilic bacteria could be genetically engineered to express certain alleles from psychrophilic bacteria, consequently shifting the restrictive temperature range of the mesophilic bacteria to closely match that of the psychrophilic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pankowski|first1=Jarosław A.|last2=Puckett|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=Nano|first3=Francis E.|title=Temperature Sensitivity Conferred by ligA Alleles from Psychrophilic Bacteria upon Substitution in Mesophilic Bacteria and a Yeast Species|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=15 March 2016|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1924–1932|doi=10.1128/AEM.03890-15|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/82/6/1924.short|issn=0099-2240|pmid=26773080|pmc=4784036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the less stable structure of mesophiles, it has reduced flexibility for [[protein synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vijayabaskar, Mahalingam S. et al. "Construction of Energy Based Protein Structure Networks: Application in the Comparative Analysis of Thermophiles and Mesophiles" Biophysical Journal, Volume 98 , Issue 3 , 387a&lt;/ref&gt; Mesophiles are not able to synthesize proteins in low temperatures. It is more sensitive to temperature changes, and the [[fatty acid]] composition of the [[membrane]] does not allow for much [[Membrane fluidity|fluidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = K.Y. | last2 = Torres | first2 = J. A. | year = 1993 | title = EFFECTS of TEMPERATURE and SOLUTE ON the MINIMUM WATER ACTIVITY FOR GROWTH and TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTIC of SELECTED MESOPHILES and PSYCHROTROPHS | url = | journal = Journal of Food Processing and Preservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 305–318 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-4549.1993.tb00733.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing the optimal temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C to 0&amp;nbsp;°C to 8&amp;nbsp;°C leads to a gradual decrease in protein synthesis. [[Cold-induced proteins]] (CIPs) are induced during low temperatures, which then allows [[Cold-shock domain|cold-shock proteins]] (CSPs) to synthesize. The shift back to the optimal temperature sees an increase, indicating that mesophiles are highly dependent on temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot, F., Hébraud, M., Junter, G.-A. and Jouenne, T. "Protein synthesis in Escherichia coli at 4°C. Electrophoresis." 2000, 21: 1625–1629. doi:10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(20000501)21:8&lt;1625::AID-ELPS1625&gt;3.0.CO;2-4&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen availability also affects microorganism growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, N. A. ; Stokes, J. L. " ROLE OF OXYGEN IN THE HIGH CELL YIELDS OF PSYCHROPHILES AND MESOPHILES AT LOW TEMPERATURES." The Journal of Bacteriology, 1963, Vol. 85(1), p.164 [Peer Reviewed Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two explanations for thermophiles being able to survive at such high temperatures whereas mesophiles can not. The most evident explanation is that thermophiles are believed to have cell components that are relatively more stable than the cell components of mesophiles which is why thermophiles are able to live at higher temperatures than mesophiles.&lt;ref name="Koffler 227–240"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koffler|first=Henry|date=2016-11-28|title=PROTOPLASMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MESOPHILES AND THERMOPHILES1|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=21|issue=4|pages=227–240|issn=0005-3678|pmc=180904|pmid=13488883}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A second school of thought, as represented by the writings of Gaughran (21) and Allen (3), believes that rapid resynthesis of damaged or destroyed cell constituents is the key to the problem of biological stability to heat."&lt;ref name="Koffler 227–240"/&gt;

==Oxygen requirements==
Due to the diversity of mesophiles, oxygen requirements greatly vary. [[Aerobic respiration]] requires the use of [[oxygen]] and anaerobic does not. There are three types of [[anaerobes]]. [[Facultative anaerobes]] grow in the absence of oxygen, using [[fermentation]] instead. During fermentation, sugars are converted to [[acids]], [[alcohol]], or [[gasses]]. If there is oxygen present, it will use aerobic respiration instead. [[Obligate anaerobe]]s cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. [[Aerotolerant anaerobe]]s can withstand oxygen.

==Roles==
Microorganisms play an important role in [[decomposition]] of organic matter and [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of [[nutrients]]. In [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] environments, the diversity of the [[ecosystem]] allows for the diversity of mesophiles. The functions of each mesophile rely on the surroundings, most importantly temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;Ferroni, G.D., Kaminski, J.S. "Psychrophiles, psychrotrophs, and mesophiles in an environment which experiences seasonal temperature fluctuations." Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 1980, 26:1184-1191, 10.1139/m80-198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacteria]] such as mesophiles and [[thermophile]]s are used in the [[cheesemaking]] due to their role in [[fermentation]]. "Traditional [[microbiologist]]s use the following terms to indicate the general (slightly arbitrary) optimum temperature for the growth of bacteria: [[psychrophile]]s (15–20 °C), [[mesophiles]] (30–37 °C), thermophiles (50–60 °C) and extreme thermophiles (up to 122 °C)".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark. "Mesophilic and Thermophilic Cultures Used in Traditional Cheesemaking." Cheese and Microbes. Washington: ASM Publishing. 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Both mesophiles and thermophiles are used in cheesemaking for the same reason; however, they grow, thrive and die at different temperatures. [[Psychrotrophic bacteria|Psychrotrophic]] bacteria contribute to dairy products spoiling, getting mouldy or going bad due to their ability to grow at lower temperatures such as in a refrigerator.

==Examples==
Some notable mesophiles include ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Other examples of [[species]] of mesophiles are ''[[Clostridium kluyveri]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas maltophilia]]'', ''[[Thiobacillus novellus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above.

===''Listeria monocytogenes''===
''Listeria monocytogenes'' is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to ''Bacillus'' and ''Staphylococcus''. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous [[flagella]]. ''L. monocytogenes'' motility is limited from 20&amp;nbsp;°C to 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=LISTERIA/&gt; At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for [[listeriosis]] which derives from contaminated food.&lt;ref name=LISTERIA&gt;Magalhã£Es, R. (2014). Listeria monocytogenes. 450-461.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
''Staphylococcus aureus'' was first identified in 1880.&lt;ref name=AUREUS/&gt; It is responsible for different infections stemming from an injury. The bacterium overcomes the body's natural mechanisms. Long lasting infections of ''S. aureus'' includes [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], and [[osteomyelitis]]. ''S. aureus'' is commonly contracted in hospital settings.&lt;ref name=AUREUS&gt;Todd, E. (2014). Staphylococcus Aureus. 530-534&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Escherichia coli''===
''Escherichia coli'' is a gram-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobic bacterium that does not produce [[spores]].&lt;ref name=COLI/&gt; The bacterium is a member of [[Enterobacteriaceae]]. It is capable of producing [[enterotoxins]] which are [[thermolabile]] or [[thermostable]].&lt;ref name=COLI&gt;Robinson, Richard K.. (2000). Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Volumes 1-3 - Escherichia Coli. Elsevier. Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt0051LGG3/encyclopedia-food-microbiology/escherichia-coli&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics of ''E. coli'' are that it is [[oxidase]]-negative, [[citrate]]-negative, [[methyl red|methyl-red]] positive, and [[Voges-Proskauer]]-negative. To sum up ''E. coli'', it is a [[coliform]]. It is able to use [[glucose]] and [[acetate]] as a carbon source for fermentation. ''E. coli'' is commonly found in the [[Digestive system|gut]] of living organisms.&lt;ref name=ROBINSON/&gt; ''E. coli'' has many capabilities such as being a [[host (biology)|host]] for [[recombinant DNA]] and being a pathogen.&lt;ref name=ROBINSON&gt;Robinson, Richard K.. (2000). Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Volumes 1-3 - Escherichia Coli. Elsevier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">The '''Ministry of Stories''' is a non-profit organisation in East London dedicated to helping children and young adults develop writing skills and to helping teachers inspire their students to write.

==Overview==
Located in [[Hoxton]], a district in the [[London Borough of Hackney]], England, The Ministry of Stories was founded in 2010 by the British author [[Nick Hornby]] and co-directors Lucy Macnab and Ben Payne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ministry of Stories offers magical writing classes|first=Ben|last= East|work=The National| date=30 October 2011|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/ministry-of-stories-offers-magical-writing-classes|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company provides mentoring and advice to young writers, relying on the work of volunteer writers, teachers and artists. The MoS aims to inspire young people to transform their lives through creative writing. The company works closely with schools, supporting teachers, but also provides one-to-one mentoring for young people to enjoy imaginative stories, improve language skills, increase abilities in communication, and develop social and educational confidence.&lt;ref name=stratton&gt;{{cite news|first=Allegra | last=Stratton |title=Nick Hornby opens Ministry of Stories to get Britain's kids writing again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/18/nick-hornby-ministry-stories|work=The Guardian|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2012, 5,000 young people have taken part in activities sponsored by the MoS. About 500 trained volunteers have contributed to the effort, as have writers including [[Joe Dunthorne]], [[David Nicholls (writer)|David Nicholls]] and [[Zadie Smith]], as well as actors [[Colin Firth]] and [[Emma Thompson]].&lt;ref name=curtis&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/nick-hornby-minister-of-stories-8381239.html|title=Nick Hornby: Minister of Stories|work=London Evening Standard| first=Nick|last= Curtis|date=4 December 2012|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Money Advice Service''' is an organisation established with cross [[Government]] party support, that provides free and impartial advice on money and financial decisions to people in the United Kingdom. It is an independent organisation whose statutory objectives are to enhance the understanding and knowledge of people about financial matters (including the UK financial system) and to enhance their ability to manage their own financial affairs.  The service provides free money advice and guidance online and by telephone.

The service was launched in April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK financial advice service launched|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12960667|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; superseding the Moneymadeclear-branded service provided by the [[Consumer Financial Education Body]]. Prior to 2010, the service had been a division of the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA). It was set up by the UK Government and is paid for by a statutory levy on the financial services industry.&lt;ref name=Milligan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Brian|title=Budget 2016: Money Advice Service to be abolished|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35820752|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic goals and direction of the Money Advice Service are set by a 12-member board. The board is appointed by, but acts independently of, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The service has an independent Chairman and board appointed by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA). The FCA’s appointments of the Chair and Chief Executive are subject to the approval of [[HM Treasury]].

In April 2012 the Money Advice Service took on additional responsibility for funding and improving the quality, consistency and availability of UK debt advice, a statutory function as set out in the [[Financial Services Act 2012]].

In March 2017 the Money Advice Service launched the new Standard Financial Statement (SFS), an initiative designed to bring greater consistency to the way organisations assess people’s finances when they are in debt.

The Money Advice Service also lead the work of a wide range of organisations across the public, private and voluntary sectors to develop the UK Financial Capability Strategy
a ten-year plan to address people’s skills and knowledge around money management, their attitudes and motivations that hold them back and their access to products and services.

In March 2016 [[HM Treasury]] announced that the service would become part of a new guidance body that would see the [https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en Money Advice Service], The [[Pensions Advisory Service]] and [[Pension Wise]] combine to form a new single guidance body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35820752|title=Money Advice Service to be abolished|last=Milligan|first=Brian|date=2016-03-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/financialguidanceandclaims.html Financial Guidance and Claims Bill] seeks to establish the new statutory body by [[Royal assent|Royal Assent]] from Autumn/Winter 2018.  The new guidance body will be accountable to Parliament, with responsibility for coordinating the provision of debt advice, money guidance, and pension guidance, ensuring that people across the UK are able to seek the help and advice they need to manage their finances.

The Bill entered the [[House of Lords]] for its first reading on 22 June 2017 and moved to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for its first reading on 22 November 2017.

The [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/queens-speech-2017-background-briefing-notes Queen's Speech of June 2017] announced that the new single body would be funded through existing levies on pension schemes and the financial services industry.

The '''Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology''', ('''POST''') is the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s in-house source of independent, balanced and accessible analysis of public policy issues related to science and technology.&lt;ref name="POST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/ |title=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; POST (rather distinctively) serves BOTH Houses of Parliament (the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and equally the [[House of Lords]]) as a joint establishment, through output that is apolitical and of widely acclaimed value to Parliamentarians of all parties. Thorough quality-control ensures that [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and [[Peerage|Peers]] can have confidence in its analyses should they wish to cite them in debate. These principles are reflected in the structure of [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#The POST Board|POST’s Board]] with members from the Commons and Lords together with distinguished scientists and engineers from the wider world.


==History==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Year !! Event
|-
| 1980s || Office first suggested
|-
| 1989 || POST launched (with charitable funding). Among other support, the UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development raised funds to provide POST with its first in-house environmental specialist adviser.
|-
| 1992 || POST was adopted as Parliamentary body by both Houses of the UK Parliament and subjected to five year reviews.

The UK Parliament made POST a permanent institution in 2001, after Dr Ian Gibson MP, POST's Chairman, Lord Flowers - vice-Chairman and Professor David Cope, Director, presented evidence to the then House of Commons Administration Committee to support the decision, which was endorsed later by the House of Lords.
|}

Since 1939, a group of MPs and peers interested in science and technology, through the first parliamentary "All Party Group",   the UK Parliamentary and Scientific Committee&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceinparliament.org.uk/ |title=Parliamentary and Scientific Committee |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (P&amp;S), had encouraged UK Parliamentarians to explore the implications of scientific developments for society and public policy. As the UK economy became more dependent on technological progress, and the varied effects of technology (especially on the environment) became more apparent, it was felt that UK Parliament needed its own resources on such issues. Parliamentarians not only required access to knowledge and insights into the implications of technology for their constituents and society, but also needed to exercise their scrutiny functions over UK government legislation and administration. This thinking was also influenced by the fact that specialised parliamentary science and technology organisations already existed overseas.

P&amp;S members ([[Ian Lloyd (UK politician)|Sir Ian Lloyd MP]], [[Trevor Skeet|Sir Trevor Skeet MP]], [[Gerard Vaughan (British politician)|Sir Gerry Vaughan MP]], Lords [[Wayland Young, 2nd Baron Kennet|Kennet]], Gregson and [[Brian Flowers, Baron Flowers|Flowers]] among others) visited already established organisations in the US, Germany and France, and this reinforced their view that modern Parliaments needed their own ‘intelligence’ on science and technology-related issues. Initially they asked the then [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] to fund such services at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] but were asked first to demonstrate a real need. This led to the P&amp;S creating a charitable foundation to raise funds from P&amp;S members.

The parliamentary reaction was positive and led to the appointment of a first Director, Dr Michael Norton.  In 1989, POST was formally established as a charitable foundation, though not an internal part of Parliament.

POST had attracted more resources by 1992 and then recruited 3 [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Permanent staff|specialist science advisers]] and began its [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Fellows|fellowship]] programme with the [[UK research councils]].

In 1992 the House of Commons Information Committee, supported by the House of Lords, recommended that Parliament should itself fund POST for 3 years, and a subsequent review in 1995 extended this for a further 5 years. This was the result of POST demonstrating real interest and demand from MPs and peers.

POST's financial reliance on donations from bodies external to Parliament, even those as prestigious as the Royal Society, had always slightly compromised the perceived independence of the office.

From 1997 the chair of the POST board was appointed by government Whips. Since then, chairs have been [[Ian Gibson (politician)|Dr Ian Gibson MP]] 1997-2001, [[Phyllis Starkey|Dr Phyllis Starkey MP]] 2001-2005, and [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Officers|Dr Ashok Kumar MP]] 2005-2010. Dr Kumar died shortly before the UK 2010 General Election.  Since then, subject to parliamentary approval, the Chair of POST has been Adam Afiyie, MP.

In 1998 [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Officers|Professor David Cope]] took over as Director of POST. He guided the Office towards the goal of establishing POST as a permanent office of the UK Parliament - and dramatically expanded its staffing, wider links and more general recognition of its role as a special, distinctive, institution that the UK Parliament had agreed, enthusiastically, to endorse.

In 2001, both Houses decided that POST should indeed be established as a permanent [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] institution, funded exclusively by Parliament itself, through the two Houses, in a ratio of 70%/30%, Commons/Lords.

In 2009, POST celebrated its 20th anniversary with, among other events, a special conference, arranged by the Director, Prof Cope, on "Images of the Future".  The keynote participants were the Hon. Bart Gordon, Chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology and Dr Jim Dator of the University of Hawaii Futures Research Centre, along with many other Members and staff of Parliaments across the world.

Because of the enthusiasm of Members of both Houses, POST had enjoyed a unique status within Parliament. It was from its inception attached administratively to the House of Commons COMMISSION (though always with its link to the House of Lords.)

This arrangement was intended specifically to distinguish the office and its functions from the Libraries of either House.  These conduct non peer-reviewed "studies", of varying quality.  POST - on the other hand - was expected to provide proactive analysis and options, freed from the immediate pressure of political or administrative expectations, trying to embrace futures thinking, and above all, to subject all its work to the most critical peer review analysis.

POST'S Director, Prof David Cope, returned to Cambridge University in 2012 and Dr. Chris Tyler was appointed by parliamentary authorities to a reduced role, which saw the fundamental rationale of POST as a "science and technology assessment" institution increasingly changed to one which more engaged with the ongoing debate on "science policy".

POST, from its foundation, had always been an institution "of", rather than "for" - science and technology -in other words - it did not in any way lobby for more public funds for scientific or technological research.  Dr Tyler, however, was closely involved with the "Campaign for Science and Engineering" - a UK body which does so lobby.  On appointment, he did not immediately resign his role in any lobbying body, and this continued seriously to undermine his perceived independence while head of POST.

Dr. Tyler left POST in 2017 for a secondary position at University College London.

The Acting Directorship of POST was taken over by a longstanding staff member, Dr Chandrika Nath, who was totally immune from any such lobbying role. In 2018, in a reconfirmed acknowledgement of POST's immutable science and technology assessment role, she was appointed Executive Director of the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the highly prestigious intergovernmental organisation.

Dr. Grant Hill-Cawthorne (University of Sydney) became Head of POST from May 2018.  

==Activities==

===Science and Technology in Parliament===
Most parliamentarians do not have a scientific or technological background but science and technology issues are increasingly integral to public policy. Parliamentarians are bombarded daily with lobbying, public enquiries and media stories about science and technology. These cover diverse areas such as medical advances, environmental issues and global communications. POST helps parliamentarians examine such issues effectively by providing information resources, in depth analysis and impartial advice. POST works closely with a wide range of organisations involved in science and technology, including [[Select committee (Westminster system)|select committees]], [[All-Party Parliamentary Group|all-party parliamentary groups]], [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government departments]], scientific societies, [[Think tank|policy think tanks]], business, academia and research funders.

===POST's aim===
POST's aim is to inform parliamentary debate through:
*Publishing POSTnotes (short briefing notes) and longer reports. POSTnotes can be downloaded from the publications section of the POST website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/publications/ POST Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Both focus on current science and technology issues and aim to anticipate policy implications for parliamentarians.
*Supporting select committees, with informal advice, oral briefings, data analyses, background papers or follow-up research. Committees may approach POST for such advice at any stage in an inquiry.
*Informing both Houses on public dialogue activities in science and technology.
*Organising discussions to stimulate debate on a wide range of topical issues, from small working groups to large lectures.&lt;ref name="Seminars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/ |title=POST Events |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Horizon-scanning to anticipate issues of science and technology that are likely to impact on policy

===How POST works===
A parliamentary board guides POST's choice of subjects. A team of advisers conduct analyses, drawing on a wide range of external expertise. All reports and POSTnotes are externally peer reviewed, and scrutinised by the board before publication.

POST's work falls into four topical areas:
*Biological Sciences and Health
*Physical Sciences and ICT
*Environment and Energy
*Social Sciences

===International activities===
POST is a member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] network, which brings together parliamentary organisations throughout Europe sharing information and working on joint projects.&lt;ref name="EPTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eptanetwork.org/|title=European Parliamentary Technology Assessment |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; POST also liaises with science and technology organisations across the world.

Between November 2005 to 2009, POST, collaborating with four of its sister organisations - at the [[Folketing|Danish]], [[States-General of the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Flemish Parliament|Flemish]] and [[Bundestag|German]] Parliaments - provided [[technology assessment]] services to the [[Science and Technology Options Assessment]] unit of the [[European Parliament]], in [[Brussels]] and [[Strasbourg]].

====POST Africa Programme====
From 2001 POST received a growing number of requests for advice from parliamentarians in developing countries. It became clear that a real need existed to strengthen capacity in developing country parliaments. In 2005, POST held discussions on this issue with the Gatsby Foundation,&lt;ref name="Gatsby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatsby.org.uk/ |title=The Gatsby Charitable Foundation |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a special initiative to assist African Parliaments, and other organisations in their countries, in building parliamentary capacity to handle policy issues related to science and technology. At a time when there is growing awareness of the importance of science and technology in decision making, as demonstrated by, for example, the focus on science, technology and innovation at the [[African Union]] summit meeting in January 2007, this programme continues to contribute towards the overall objective of ensuring that parliaments have the capacity to scrutinise decision making processes and act as the national fora for discussion and debate on the broad implications of issues with a basis in science and technology. By sharing information and best practice with overseas parliaments and assemblies, the programme supports one of the primary objectives of the House: to promote public knowledge and understanding of the work and role of Parliament through the provision of information and access.

==The POST Board==
(Appointed 2010)

The POST Board oversees POST's objectives, outputs and future work programme. It meets quarterly. The Board comprises:
* 14 parliamentarians drawn from the House of Commons (10) and the House of Lords (4), roughly reflecting the balance of parties in Parliament.
* Leading non-parliamentarians from the science and technology community.
* Representatives of the House of Lords and the Department of Information Services of the House of Commons.

===Officers===
*Chairman: [[Adam Afriyie|Adam Afriyie MP]]
*Vice-Chairman: [[Robert Winston|Professor the Lord Winston]]
*Head: Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne

===House of Lords===
*Lord Oxburgh, KBE, PhD, FRS
*[[Simon Haskel, Baron Haskel|Lord Haskel]]
*Lord Patel, KT, FMedSci, FRSE

=== Externals ===
*Professor Frances R. Balkwill, OBE
*Professor Sarah Whatmore, FBA
*Paul Martynenko, FBCS
*Professor Sir Bernard Silverman, FRS, FAcSS

===''Ex Officio'' Board Members===
*Penny Young, [[The House of Commons Librarian]] and Managing Director Research &amp; Information, House of Commons
*Nicolas Besly, Clerk of Select Committees, House of Lords
*Edward Potton, Head of Science and Environment Section, House of Commons Library
*Lynn Gardner, Principal Clerk, Committee Office, House of Commons
*Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne, Head of POST

==POST staff==

===Permanent staff===

'''Plymouth Marine Laboratory''' (abbreviated as '''PML''') in the city of [[Plymouth]], [[England]], is an independent collaborative centre of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC). PML's Chairman is Admiral Sir [[James Burnell-Nugent]] and PML's Chief Executive is Prof. Stephen de Mora.

== Research and Capability ==
Research activity at PML broadly investigates global-scale issues of [[climate change]] and [[sustainability]]. PML's core capabilities are centred around [[biogeochemistry]] and [[systems science]], [[ecosystem health]] and [[human health]], and [[sustainable development]] and [[biodiversity]]. It has particular capacity around [[Earth observation]], [[ecosystem model|ecosystem modelling]], [[microbial ecology]], [[Colors_of_biotechnology#Blue_biotechnology|Blue biotechnology]], [[socioeconomics]] and [[science advice|policy advice]].

Specific research activities include the monitoring of [[ocean acidification|ocean acidity]] and its effects on [[coral]]s and [[shellfish]], and this information is reported to the UK government. As part of its research into sustainability, PML uses technology such as [[biochemical engineering|photo-bioreactors]] to cultivate [[algae]] that could be used in the production of [[biofuel]]s or in the treatment of waste water. Aside from its environmental research, PML also works alongside the [[Boots Group]] to investigate the use of algae in skin-care products, since these organisms utilise [[sunscreen]]-like compounds to protect themselves from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestrda.org.uk/what-we-do/business-growth/inward-investment/casestudy/viewCaseStudy.asp?id=25|title=The Plymouth Marine Laboratory|publisher=[[South West of England Regional Development Agency|South West England RDA]]|accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within its Seawater Hall, PML contains an in-house, fully contained, algal scale-up pilot plant. This contains a 550L biofence photobioreactor and a 1200L [[raceway pond]] system, as well as a range of smaller [[bubble column reactor]] systems at 3.5L and 11L capacity for smaller scale algal production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=ML|last2=Warwick|first2=J|last3=Terry|first3=A|last4=Allen|first4=MJ|last5=Napier|first5=JA|last6=Sayanova|first6=O|title=Towards the Industrial Production of Omega-3 Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids from a Genetically Modified Diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=14 December 2015|volume=10|issue=12|pages=e0144054|pmid=26658738|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144054|pmc=4681182}}&lt;/ref&gt; These facilities are regularly used to generate dried algal biomass on the scale of grams to hundreds of grams. This algal innovation centre also investigates a range of downstream processing techniques for algal harvesting. In addition to large-scale investigations, PML also has a Single Cell Genomics facility: a dedicated clean room environment for single cell isolation, equipped with a high speed [[Atomic Force Microscope]], cell-sorting [[flow cytometry]] capabilities and a number of liquid-handling machines.

PML has a wholly owned trading subsidiary, PML Applications Ltd., which has been created to facilitate the exploitation and application of PML research and its products and to provide a more appropriate interface for working with end users, industrial and commercial partners.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

== History ==
The Plymouth Marine Laboratory was founded in 1988, mainly due to the recommendations of a House of Lords Report. It was formed by drawing some elements of the Laboratory of the [[Marine Biological Association]] (MBA) with the NERC [[Institute for Marine Environmental Research]] (IMER).

On 1 April 2002, PML changed from being a wholly owned NERC research centre to an independent organisation with [[Charitable organization|charitable]] status.

[[File:PROUTlogo.gif|thumb|180px|Progressive Utilization Theory logo]]
'''Progressive Utilization Theory''' (Prout), also known by the acronym '''PROUT''', is a [[socioeconomic]] and political theory developed by philosopher and spiritual leader [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]].&lt;ref name="Crovetto2008" /&gt;{{r|"Crovetto2011"}} The theory is based on his holistic outlook of life.{{r|:7|:0}} It is a system of governance&lt;ref name="Skrbina" /&gt; that is inspired by [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] thought, as well as Sarkar's own ideas. It aims to be [[Economic progressivism|economically progressive]] and improve [[Social change|social development]].{{r|:7|p=1}} The theory is in line with Sarkar's [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] values which aim to provide "proper care" to every being on the planet, including  humans, animals and plants.{{r|:1}}

== History ==
By 1959, Sarkar had developed the ideas of Prout. In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book ''Ananda Sutram'', published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti.{{r|Irving}}

In 1968, Sarkar founded the organisation "Proutist Block of India" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.{{r|fukui|p=357}} The PBI was soon superseded by "Proutist Universal" (PU), which primarily consists of five federations (students, intellectuals, farmers, labour, and youth).{{When|date=May 2018}} 

The theory has not achieved widespread implementation.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}} Cooperative communities have been established by [[Ananda Marga]] in an attempt to provide ideal models for the society outlined in Prout.&lt;ref name=Ellwood/&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}}

==Theory==
=== Overview ===
Prout proposes an [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] system as an alternative to [[communism]] and [[capitalism]], taking ideas from both.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; Under the system [[Tangible property|material goods]] would be [[common ownership|common property]] and [[Distribution (economics)|distributed]] in a rational and equitable way to maximize the physical, mental, and spiritual development of all people.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Onwuka /&gt; The distribution intends to guarantee food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care (what the theory regards as minimum requirements for humans).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;

Prout advocates a three-tiered approach to [[industrial organization]]. Key industries and [[public utilities]] would be [[nonprofit organization]]s. Decentralized industry run by [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] unions would provide people's minimum necessities. The majority of economic transactions would be through producers' and consumers' [[cooperative]]s.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Incentives for people serving society would be funded via surpluses.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

At the political level, Prout rejects [[nationalism]]. Instead, there would be locally governed self-sufficient socioeconomic zones and a [[world government]].&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inayatullah/&gt; There would be a world [[constitution]] and a [[bill of rights]] for animals and plants, as well as humans.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Law of social cycle and governance ===
{{main|Law of social cycle}}
Prout takes account of Sarkat's [[law of social cycle]]. It sees the [[social order]] as consisting of four [[Social class|classes of people]] that cyclically dominate society: ''shudras'' (workers), ''kshatriyas'' (warriors), ''vipras'' (intellectuals) and ''vaishyas'' (acquisitors).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

However, Prout does not seek the abolition of these four classes, as it sees them as "... not merely as a power configuration, but as a way of knowing the world, as a paradigm, episteme or deep structure if you will."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It considers that any person can be worker, warrior, intellectual or acquisitive minded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell, volume 4|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, these different class or psychologies, are not seen as static or mutually exclusive. The theory sees them as evolving over an individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Prout see the four classes as connected to cyclic processes across time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; That when a class of people struggle and rise to power they cause a revolution in the physical and mental world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The theory then see the newly powerful class becoming corrupt.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To prevent any social class from clinging to political power and exploiting the others, a "spiritual elite" sadvipras (etymologically sad – true, vipra – intellectual) would determine who will hold political leadership.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Prout theorises that the first sadvipras would come from disgruntled middle-class intellectuals and warriors.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; 

Sadvipras would be organized into [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] boards which would be governed by a Supreme Board.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; They would be responsible for the application of force necessary to change the order of dominance within the social order. It is envisioned that large amounts of force, akin to [[revolution]], may be necessary.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Neohumanism ===
{{main|Neohumanism}}
The Prout theory is inline with Sarkar's Neohumanism philosophy. The philosophy is a reinterpretation of [[humanism]]{{r|bio|:0}} integrating the idea of unity of all life. In it all living beings belong to a universal family deserving equal care and respect.{{r|:1}}



=== The five fundamental principles ===
In 1962, Sarkar formally outlined Prout in sixteen [[aphorism]]s (see Chapter 5 of ''Ananda Sutram''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ananda Sutram|last=Anandamurti|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1962|isbn=8172520271|location=Jamalpur|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The last five aphorisms (5:12-16) are commonly referred to as the five fundamental principles of Prout. These five principles are deemed to be fundamental because it would be difficult to get a clear understanding of Prout without comprehending the underlying concepts of these principles, the interrelationship of the principles, and their respective areas of application.

The five aphorisms from Ananda Sutram translate into English as follows:&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles for a Balanced Economy: An Introduction to the Progressive Utilization Theory|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|publisher=PROUT Research institute|year=2012|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There should be no accumulation of wealth without the permission of society.
# There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of the crude, subtle, and causal resources.
# There should be maximum utilization of the physical, mental, and spiritual potentialities of the individual and collective beings.
# There should be a well-balanced adjustment among the crude, subtle, and causal utilizations.
# Utilizations vary in accordance with time, space, and form; the utilizations should be progressive.
An initial glimpse of these five principles first appeared in Sarkar's earlier work, ''Idea and Ideology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idea and Ideology|last=Anandamurtii|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The market ===
As far as Prout's values and goals differ from those of [[capitalism]] and [[communism]],&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/HOH/HOH-8.pdf|title=Panimatzalam’s Voice of Transformation: An Indigenous Mayan Writing Project for Youth Activism|last=Oppenheim|first=Matt|date=|website=North Arizona University|page=144|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in Power|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|publisher=Proutist Bloc India|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so does its [[Economic system|economic structure]]. Following a close analysis of the two systems, Prout’s propounder argues that these philosophies are "anti-human“ in the sense that they encourage people to relentlessly pursue material attainment, like name, fame, etc. 

Another criticism of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] and capitalism in general is the centralization of economic power in the hands of the rich leads to the exploitation of the masses and ultimately to the denegeration of society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in a Nutshell part 12|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prout claims that both capitalism and communism have been built on shaky foundations, and identifies weaknesses to a point where a new market system is required.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He heavily critiqued communism, indicating that one of the reasons the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s experiment with communism did not work, causing the eventual implosion of their political structure, is that the sovietic central planning committees ([[Gosplan]]) had too much economic decision and cohersion power in the federation (see [[Marxism–Leninism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrosraffa.org/public/bb6ba675-6bef-4182-bb89-339ae1f7e792.pdf|title=An analysis of the Soviet economic growth from the 1950’s to the collapse of USSR|last=Serrano|first=Franklin|last2=Mazat|first2=Numa|date=|website=Centros Raffa|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/inactive/command.pdf|title=Are Command Economies Unstable? Why did the Soviet Economy Collapse?|last=Harrison|first=Mark|date=|website=University of Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Sarkar observed aspects of [[Economic planning|market planning]] that help to create and sustain a healthy economy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing a new economy|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|last2=Sevaergrah|first2=Caroline|publisher=Inner World Books|year=2016|isbn=9781881717539|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Proutist thought considers that planning allows the market to protect its stakeholders from the meanderings of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economics]] where profit-motive speaks highest.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf|title=Self-Reliant Regional proutist development|last=Ghista|first=Dhanjoo|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|date=|website=Prout.org|page=7|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he stresses that a planning committee at a national level should only outline the broader aspects of economic development, leaving the details to be resolved by planning bodies at a local level where problems are best understood and more easily dealt with.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/block-level-planning/|title=Block-level planning|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[diseconomies of scale]]). Consequently, this kind of top-down planning will leave communities, enterprises and ultimately workers with a significant level of freedom to decide their own economic future (see [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planning]]).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Prout also claims that the [[nationalization]] of enterprises is inefficient due to the larger costs and amount of bureaucracy necessary to keep state-controlled industries running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Society part 1|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/12/economist-explains-1|title=Why nationalisation has fallen out of favour in Britain|last=|first=|date=|work=The economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there are some industries that should be nationalized, operating on a "no-profit, no-loss" principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell volume 4 part 21|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key industries vital for the prosperity of society (such as transportation, energy or hospitals), claims Sarkar, should be run by the immediate government as they are too large of operations to be run conveniently by private business men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Concerning wealth distribution among the population, Prout argues for an "optimal inequality" where the wage gap between the richer strata of society is substantially subsided.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Richard B. Freeman|Richard Freeman]], a Harvard economist, points out income inequality comes from the monopoly of power and other activities with "negative consequences" in terms of social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/edsall-just-right-inequality.html|title=Just Right Inequality|last=Thomas|first=Edsall|date=2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Prout is not in favour of total income equality, claiming that in a society where material motivation to work is absent, the willingness to strive for financial success and to thrive in the creative development of industry and society will be lost in its citizens. Therefore, Sarkar argues for the implementation of a policy allowing the most meritous in society to receive added perks for the added benefits they bring to society. It is thus theorized that the communist‘s motto of from [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]] cannot work in the real world. Prout proposes instead a minimum and maximum wage, roughly attributed according to the value the work of each person brings to society. We see examples of attempts in this direction in companies like [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] or [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]].

Regarding neo-liberalism, Sarkar throws a new light to the concept of Adam Smith's [[invisible hand]], where individual producers acting self-interest benefit the community as a whole. Prout claims that, unchecked, societies economic elite will disrupt the just circulation of material wealth within society. The market will then require regulatory measures so as to create a functional economic system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Economic democracy ===
In relation to democracy, Prout argues that political democracy is not enough to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.online.southcentral.edu/students/instructors/MFMyROSEarticle.pdf|title=Living Wage and Optimal Inequality in a Sarkarian Framework|last=Friedman|first=Mark|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roar Bjonnes]], a known Proutist, states, "Unless we have deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change – we will never be able to solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that political democracy is not enough." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout, therefore, advocates an [[economic democracy]] where the decision-making power for the economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic democracy is not a new term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proutist Economics: Discourses on Economic Liberation|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1992|isbn=9788172520038|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, Prout argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike [[capitalism]], where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a Proutistic society it should be based on necessity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The third requirement of economic democracy is the [[decentralization]] of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worker and Community: Response to Industrialization in a Nineteenth Century American City, Albany, New York, 1850-1884|last=Greenberg|first=Brian|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=978-0-88706-046-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) for the development of the region and not merely for export.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In summary, Prout advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout claims this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Small Is Beautiful|last=Schumacher|first=E.F.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1973|isbn=978-0-06-091630-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.

Prout rests upon the concept of a tiered economic structure in which the production and distribution of goods is performed according to three distinctive business models.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned [[cooperative]]s, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large-scale key industries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of production, cooperative workers and consumers will be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A few problems solved part 9|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga publications|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, key industries vital to the development of the country and of strategic importance&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/prouts-3-tiered-economic-system/?wpdmdl=1652|title=PROUT’s Three-Tiered Enterprise System|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=2015|website=PROUT institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are too complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourses on PROUT|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees that some people have economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.

In a Prout system there would be no privately owned corporations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Socio-economic units ===
A socio-economic unit, or Samaj in [[Sanskrit]], is the Proutist materialization of the collective effort to create a strong and resilient local [[community]], built on strong feelings of [[solidarity]] and [[Self-concept|self-identity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are a few criteria that Sarkar outlined in order to build a working and cohesive socio-economic unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In sum, a unit should have common social and economic conditions, geographical potentialities, cultural legacy and language.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Similar to [[Bioregionalism|bioregions]], their purpose is to facilitate cooperative development, moving towards a decentralized economy, where these units are economically independent and self-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Self Reliant Regional Proutistic Development|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|last1=Ghista|first1=Dhanjoo|publisher=Prout Research Institute|year=1991|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though still guided by national and federal guidelines and laws, they should prepare its own economic plan.

Aiming to achieve maximum efficiency in the utilization of local resources, they propose to make trade across borders more balanced and mutually beneficial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In Prout these socio-economic units would also create the necessary balance in the world's trade in so much as independently run and self-reliant communities would not need the resources from more developed economic powers seeking to exploit them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;


=== Progress ===
From Prout's perspective, a progressive society cannot solely be measured by the wealth of a nation or it’s GDP levels. Prout recognizes the benefits of material progress, but deems them insufficient indicators of the development of human society.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT - A New Paradigm for Development|last=Logan|first=Ronald|publisher=Ananda Seva Publications|year=2005|isbn=1892345048|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that even though progress as its interpreted by society today has its advantages, there are negative side effects that, if unchecked, bring more harm than good. Ronald Logan, author of ''A new Paradigm of Development,'' reminds its readers that even though auto and air traffic enables us to travel at increasing speeds, bringing great convenience to travelers and commuters, it also brings air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, accidental deaths, alienation from nature, etc.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Presented with this quasi-paradoxical situation, Prout offers a concept of progress as a society that transcends material and technological development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moving along the lines of the [[triple bottom line]] that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, Prout advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a "fourth bottom line",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neohumanist will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the [[summum bonum]] of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.

Prout acknowledges that the well-being of individuals lies in the development of the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2011/11/what-is-progress/|title=What is Progress|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multifarious [[disease]]s that affect our body and mind, and even if we stay free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change over time is its transcendental nature, the "supra-emotional values" intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

"The deepest truths of life are an eternal fountain of inspiration. Spiritual, transpersonal development is a process of expanding one's consciousness to link with the Infinite, to reach a state of deep peace and happiness."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2012/10/a-new-definition-of-social-progress|title=A new definition of social progress|last=|first=|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Abraham Maslow|Maslownian]] perspective, Sarkar defends the need to meet physical and mental needs before being able to engage in a journey to find that transcendental nature of the world.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The five fundamental principles stem from this idea that society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self-discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.

==Criticism==
Prout is a relatively unknown theory.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  [[Johan Galtung]] claimed Prout is unlikely to make it into the western education system: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"P. R. Sarkar was a great thinker and a great practitioner. I have chosen to honor him as a great macrohistorian, focusing on his theory of Social Cycles and their implications for world unity and peace… But, given the ethnocentrism of the USA and Europe, Sarkar will not easily make it into textbooks or courses about civilization"'' ''–'' Johan Galtung &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist [[Paul Erdman]], in the [[Los Angeles Times]] , described Prout as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"a strange mixture of voodoo historical theories and sound economic analysis"''&lt;ref name="Erdman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ravi Batra]] was one of the first economists that used the ideas of Prout in his bestseller ''[[The Great Depression of 1990]]''. In time, the theory attracted attention of people like [[Johan Galtung]], founder of the UN Institute for Peace studies who claimed that ''"Sarkar’s theory is far superior to [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith’s]] or that of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]."'' &lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Some thinkers have proclaimed the pertinence that this theory has in the context of our modern world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Who|date=May 2018}} In the foreword of ''After Capitalism: Prout’s Vision for a New World'' political philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote, ''"Alternative visions are crucial at this moment in history. Prout’s cooperative model of economic democracy, based on cardinal human values and sharing the resources of the planet for the welfare of everyone, deserves our serious consideration."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the same book historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote, ''"After Capitalism is refreshingly original. It is spiritual and utopian while remaining grounded in reality. Its analysis is intelligent and its vision inspiring."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Leonardo Boff]], Brazilian theologian and writer, has summed up what he considers to be the importance of Prout: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"The exceptional importance of the Prout system resides in two fundamental points: its completeness and its viability. The entire system comes from a correct understanding of the human being, personal and collective, and authentic human development…" ''&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

According to a description by Terry Irving and [[Rowan Cahill]], Prout "envisages a decentralised, community-based world economy of self-sufficiency for the poor; economic democracy; small business; and limits on the accumulation of wealth."&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; [[Sohail Inayatullah]] stated that the philosophy "attempts to balance the need for societies to create wealth and grow with the requirements for distribution."&lt;ref name=Inayatullah /&gt; [[David Skrbina]] characterized Prout as a "model of social development... which advocates a 'small is beautiful' approach to society."&lt;ref name=Skrbina /&gt;  Economics instructor Mark Friedman places Sarkar's economic thought in the tradition of Monsignor [[John A. Ryan]], [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Herman Daly]] in Sarkar's incorporation of spiritual values into economic goals.&lt;ref name=Friedman /&gt;

It has been characterized as a form of "progressive socialism"&lt;ref name=Ellwood /&gt; as well as a "socialist theory".&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt; 

Hans Despain noted, in [[Monthly Review]], that there are similarities between Prout and the theories of [[David Schweickart]], [[Gar Alperovitz]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]]. Particularly the focus on economic democracy and co-operatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/its-the-system-stupid/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reading law''' is the method by which persons in [[common law]] countries, particularly the [[United States]], entered the [[Practice of law|legal profession]] before the advent of [[law school]]s. This usage specifically refers to a means of entering the profession (although in England it is still customary to say that a university undergraduate is "reading" a course, which may be law or any other). ''Reading the law'' consists of an extended [[internship]] or [[apprenticeship]] under the [[Tutor|tutelage]] or [[Mentorship|mentoring]] of an experienced [[lawyer]].  A small number of U.S. jurisdictions still permit this practice today.&lt;ref name="Adwar"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-become-an-attorney-without-law-school-2014-7 |title = There's A Way To Become An Attorney Without Setting Foot In Law School |publisher = ''[[Business Insider]]'' |first = Corey |last = Adwar |date = July 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==History==

===United States===

In [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]], as in [[History of the British Isles|Britain]] in that day, law schools did not exist at all until [[Litchfield Law School]] was founded in 1773. Within a few years following the [[American Revolution]], some universities such as the [[College of William and Mary]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] established a "Chair in Law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Albert J. |last = Harno |title = Legal Education in the United States: A Report Prepared for the Survey of the Legal Profession |year = 1953 |page = 23 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the holder of this position would be the sole purveyor of legal education for the institution, and would give lectures designed to supplement, rather than replace, an apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harno|1953|p= 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as a handful of law schools were established, they remained uncommon in the United States until the late nineteenth century. Most people who entered the legal profession did so through an [[apprenticeship]] which incorporated a period of study under the supervision of an experienced attorney. This usually encompassed the reading of the works considered at the time to be the most authoritative on the law, such as [[Edward Coke]]'s ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', and similar texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harno|1953|pp=19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholastic independence of the law student is evident from the following advice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] to a young man in 1855:

{{quote|If you are absolutely determined to make a lawyer of yourself the thing is more than half done already. It is a small matter whether you read with any one or not. I did not read with any one. Get the books and read and study them in their every feature, and that is the main thing. It is no consequence to be in a large town while you are reading. I read at New Salem, which never had three hundred people in it. The books and your capacity for understanding them are just the same in all places. [...] Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other one thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Frederick James |last = Allen |title = The Law as a Vocation |year = 1919 |page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reading law to become an attorney would be the norm, until the 1890s, when the [[American Bar Association]] (which had been formed in 1878) began pressing states to limit admission to the Bar to those persons who had satisfactorily completed several years of post-graduate institutional instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harno|1953|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[James F. Byrnes]] became the last (July 8, 1941) Justice appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] who had never attended college or law school, and he was the penultimate appointee who had been admitted to practice by reading law. Byrnes was followed by [[Robert H. Jackson]], who was commissioned just three days later (July 11, 1941) and had also been admitted to the practice of law by reading, although he had attended a law school for less than one year (instead of the customary three to four years, and had not graduated).

===Canada===

Unlike their U.S. counterparts, early lawyers of [[Canada]] did get some legal training, but not within a higher institution like a school. Following [[English language|English]] tradition, early Canadian lawyers trained by "learning law" through another lawyer. To practice fully, these legal students ([[articled clerk]]) are required to pass a bar exam and be admitted to the bar.

Reading law was also used in [[Ontario]] to train lawyers until 1949. People training to become lawyers need not attend school, but they were asked to apprentice or article with a practicing lawyer. Changes in the late 1940s ended the practice.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |first = Philip James |last = Sworded |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=86Gb7BB20aUC&amp;lpg=PA181 |title = An Introduction to Canadian Law |year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], civil law required formal education; and in [[Nova Scotia]], lawyers were trained by attending university.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

==Modern practice==
A small number of jurisdictions still permit this.  In the states of [[California]],&lt;ref name="Adwar"/&gt; [[Vermont]],&lt;ref name="Adwar"/&gt; [[Virginia]],&lt;ref name=va-reader&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/reader/reader.html |title = Law Reader Program |year = 2010 |accessdate = January 6, 2010 |publisher = Virginia Board of Bar Examiners }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]],&lt;ref name=wa-rule6&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wsba.org/~/media/Files/Licensing_Lawyer%20Conduct/Admissions/Special%20Admissions/APR%206%20Rules%20and%20Regulations.ashx=Rule%206%20Law%20Clerk%20Program |title = Rules and Regulations Governing the Washington Law Clerk Program |year = 2002 |accessdate = March 4, 2007 |publisher = Washington State Bar Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; an applicant who has not attended law school may take the bar exam after reading law under a judge or practicing attorney for an extended period of time. The required time varies. Exact rules vary as well; for example, Virginia does not allow the reader to be gainfully employed by the tutoring lawyer, while Washington requires just that. The State of [[New York (state)|New York]] requires that applicants who are reading law must have at least one year of law school study&lt;ref name=ny-bar-rule520&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nybarexam.org/Rules/Rules.htm#520.4 |title = New York Rules of the Court of Appeals for the Admission of Attorneys |year = 2000 |accessdate = January 20, 2011 |publisher = New York State Board of Bar Examiners }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maine]] requires applicants to have completed at least two-thirds of a law degree.&lt;ref name=maine-bar&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mainebarexaminers.org/PDF/MBAR0109.pdf |title = Maine Bar Admission Rules |year = 2009 |accessdate = January 20, 2011 |publisher = Maine Board of Bar Examiners |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055410/http://www.mainebarexaminers.org/PDF/MBAR0109.pdf |archivedate = July 27, 2011 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such persons are sometimes called [[country lawyer]]s or county-seat lawyers.  In 2013, 60 people became lawyers this way as opposed to 84,000 via law schools.&lt;REF name="Adwar"/&gt;

[[File:Repair Cafe by Ilvy Njiokiktjien.jpg|thumb|280px|Repair café Amsterdam-West]]
A '''repair café''' is a meeting in which people repair household electrical and mechanical devices, computers, bicycles, clothing, etc. They are organised by and for local residents. Repair cafés are held at a fixed location where tools are available and where they can fix their broken goods with the help of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wackman|first1=John|title='Repair Café' Gets Stuff Fixed|url=http://www.rethinklocal.org/blog/2013/07/repair-cafe-gets-stuff-fixed/|website=Rethink Local website|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives are to reduce waste, to maintain repair skills and to strengthen [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-85913052.html Global Village: Warum eine neue Bewegung aus den Niederlanden Toaster und Bügeleisen repariert ]" [[Der Spiegel]], 26 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www1.wdr.de/themen/ratgeber/repaircafe114.html Mehr reparieren, weniger konsumieren] [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], 29 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sz-WohLQyQ Repair Cafe nu ook doorgedrongen in Duitsland]" [[heute]], 26 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2012/07/201271654749156813.html Dutch group mends broken items for free]" [[Al Jazeera]], 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nieuws.vtm.be/binnenland/2013010832354-repareren-weer Repareren is weer in]" [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]], 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.brusselnieuws.be/artikel/repair-cafe-verhuist-naar-elzenhof-opent-cafe-molenbeek Repair Café naar Elzenhof]" Brusselnieuws, 3 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept was devised by Martine Postma in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Sally McGrane, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/world/europe/amsterdam-tries-to-change-culture-with-repair-cafes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; An Effort to Bury a Throwaway Culture One Repair at a Time]" [[The New York Times]], 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2009, the first Repair Café was held at Fijnhout Theater, [[Amsterdam-West]]. On 2 March 2010, the Repair Café Foundation was set up. The foundation was formed to support local groups around the world in setting up their own Repair Cafés.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/17/how-to-set-up-your-own-repair-cafe | date = 17 September 2014 | accessdate = 14 November 2016 | first1 = Katherine | last1 = Purvis | first2 = Nell | last2 = Card | first3 = Lucy | last3 = Palmer | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = How to set up your own repair café}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of Repair Cafés has grown quickly. In March 2016 Postma registered more than 1,000 Repair Cafés worldwide, 327 in the Netherlands, 309 in Germany, 22 in the UK, 21 in the US, 15 in Canada, four Australia and one in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319022011/http://repaircafe.org/bezoeken Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 19 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017 the number of Repair Cafés climbed over 1,200, in March 2018 the number reached 1,500 in 33 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170130020242/https://repaircafe.org/en/visit/ Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the first [[International Repair Day]] was announced. It is intended to be an annual event, taking place on the third Saturday of October each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voicemag.uk/blog/3325/dialogues-and-debates-ugo-vallauri|title=Dialogues and Debates: Ugo Vallauri|work=Voice Magazine|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection==
In 2017, the Repair Café Foundation developed an online tool - the [http://RepairMonitor.org RepairMonitor] - enabling volunteers to collect and share repair data via a central database. In March 2018, information about almost 4,000 repairs had been entered into this system, aiming to promote reparability and durability of products.   

==3D printing of broken parts==
Some repair cafés have begun to use 3D printers for replicating broken parts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hbvl.be/cnt/aid1565685/repair-cafe-maakt-onvindbare-wisselstukken-met-3d-printer Repair café maakt onvindbare wisselstukken met 3D-printer]" [[Het Belang van Limburg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Broken pieces of domestic appliances may be able to be pieced or glued back together, after which they can be scanned with a [[3D scanner#Hand-held laser scanners|3D scanner]]. Examples of 3D scanners include David Starter-Kit, [[3D Systems]] Sense, [[MakerBot]] Digitizer, Fuel 3D, Microsoft [[Kinect]], and [[Asus]] Xtion.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Microsoft Kinect and Asus Xtion can be used together with ReconstructMe software for 3D scanning&lt;/ref&gt; Once the physical object is scanned, the 3D model is rendered. It can be converted to a .stl or .obj format and revised using [[geometry processing]] software such as makeprintable, netfabb, [[MeshLab]], Meshmixer, [[Ultimaker|Cura]], or [[Slic3r]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Cura and Slic3r have some fixup tools, despite being mainly a slicer program&lt;/ref&gt; It is printed using a [[3D printer client]], creating a physical part using the 3D printer. The complete process takes some time to complete.

To reduce the time needed in the repair café, people might choose to use a pre-made part from a website with 3D models (skipping the scanning step),&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Examples of such websites are [[Thingiverse]], [[CGTrader]], [[GrabCAD]], and Google [[3D Warehouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; or make the 3D model themselves by taking many photographs of the part and using something like [[Autodesk 123D|123D Catch]], and/or choose (in the event the repair café does not have its own 3D printer) to have the 3D ''model'' made in the repair café, but printed using a 3D printer elsewhere. Alternatively a 3D printing service like [[Ponoko]], [[Shapeways]], and others can be used, and a person then return to the repair café to have the new part fitted to the broken equipment.

A '''repair kit''' or '''service kit''' is a set of items used to repair a device, commonly comprising both tools and spare parts. Many kits are designed for vehicles, such as cars, boats, airplanes, motorbikes, and bicycles, and may be kept with the vehicle in order to make on-the-spot repairs. Some are considered essential safety equipment, and may be included [[survival kit]]s. In the military, personnel crossing large water bodies in aircraft may be equipped with a raft and raft repair kit. Other kits, such as those for watch repair or specific engine components, are used by professionals. Depending on the type, a repair kits may be included when buying a product, or may be purchased separately.

==Examples==

Road vehicles often include basic tools and spare parts which commonly fail. A bicycle repair kit, for example, normally contains tools as well as patches and glue to repair a punctured tire. Other kits that include patches and glue are used to fix holes in fabric items such as inflatable boats and tents.

Watercraft normally contain both safety equipment and repair kits as part of their emergency equipment.

Some automobiles, such as the [[Mitsubishi i-MiEV]], have an optional repair kit available. The [[Mercedes-Benz OM604 engine]] has an optional repair kit to help replace seals. The 1905 [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Gale Model A]] came with a repair kit.

In aerospace, kits have been developed for repairing the thermal protection tiles on the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system#Early tile repair plans|Space Shuttle]] and to fix space suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/22144-russian-progress-launch-spacesuit-repair.html|title=Russian Cargo Ship Launches Spacesuit Repair Kit to Space Station|work=Space.com|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionals who repair and maintain electronic equipment may have a kit containing a soldering iron, wire, and components such as transistors and resistors.

In medicine, a repair kit consisting of a plug and plastic mesh may be used during [[inguinal hernia surgery]].

A particular trade may use a repair kit as part of normal work, such as in watch repair and at automobile repair shops.

The '''Rome Consensus for a Humanitarian Drug Policy''' is a framework for dialogue and cooperation that commits 114 National Societies of [[Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent]] from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the [[Americas]] and [[Europe]] to promote and implement humanitarian approaches to [[drug policy]]. The Rome Consensus aims at raising the profile of drug policy to the forefront of social concerns, hinging formulation and implementation of drug control on [[public health]] concerns. 

The foundation text of the Rome Consensus reinforces the Red Cross - Red Crescent movement’s engagement in drug policy. In a nutshell, within the Rome Consensus Declaration National Societies: 
* Recognize the need for a new humanitarian, realistic, public health and socially based drug policy; 
* Establish a new commitment to a humanitarian drug policy based on reason and compassion that generates action, free from [[ideology]], force, [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]];
* Commit the strength of the Red Cross - Red Crescent Movement provided by its auxiliary role to national governments on [[humanitarian assistance]], to actively encourage the formulation and implementation of a humanitarian drug policy that saves lives and alleviates human suffering.

[[The Global Media Centre]] handles their media outreach.

==Chairs of the Rome Consensus==
[[The International Council on Security and Development (ICOS)]] co-chairs the Rome Consensus for a Humanitarian Drug Policy together with the [[Italian Red Cross]].

The '''Stupa No.2''' at [[Sanchi]], also called '''Sanchi II''', is one of the oldest existing Buddhist [[stupa]]s in India, and part of the Buddhist complex of Sanchi. It is of particular interest since it has the earliest known important displays of decorative reliefs in India, probably anterior to the reliefs at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]], or the reliefs of [[Bharhut]].&lt;ref name="Bell 15"&gt;Didactic Narration: Jataka Iconography in Dunhuang with a Catalogue of Jataka Representations in China, Alexander Peter Bell, LIT Verlag Münster, 2000 [https://books.google.com/books?id=77hHrXX4COgC&amp;pg=PA15 p.15ff]&lt;/ref&gt; It displays what has been called "the oldest extensive stupa decoration in existence".&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;"The railing of Sanchi Stupa No.2, which represents the oldest extensive stupa decoration in existence, (and) dates from about the second century B.C.E"  Constituting Communities: Theravada Buddhism and the Religious Cultures of South and Southeast Asia, John Clifford Holt, Jacob N. Kinnard , Jonathan S. Walters, SUNY Press, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PnnG8sclrdYC&amp;pg=PA197 p.197]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stupa number II at Sanchi is therefore considered as the birthplace of [[Jataka]] illustrations.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

==Foundation==
[[File:Sanchi map with Stupa 2.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Sanchi hill, with Stupa 2 at the extreme left, to the west.]]
Stupa No. 2 is located in the Buddhist complex of [[Sanchi]]. It was probably founded later than the Great Stupa (Stupa number 1) at Sanchi, but it contained reliquaries dated to the [[Mauryan Empire]] period (323-185 BCE), and it was the earliest to receive decorative reliefs, about a century earlier than Stupa Nb 1.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt; 

One of the key indicators to date Sanchi Stupa No.2 has been the similarity of its architectural motifs with those of [[Heliodorus pillar]], which is datable to circa 113 BCE due to its establishment during the rule of [[Indo-Greek]] [[Antialcidas]], as well as similarities of the [[paleography]] of the inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India, Julia Shaw, 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 p.88ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stupa is located outside of the main complex of Sanchi, about 300 meters to the west, on the slope of Sanchi hill.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"&gt;Monuments Of Sanchi Vol.1, John Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.532798 p.79ff]&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in a lower position than Stupa 1 because the relics it contained, are those of church dignitaries from the time of [[Ashoka]], who were considered as worthy of a lower position than the Buddha himself in Stupa number 1, or his disciples in Stupa number 3.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt;

==Relics==
[[File:Sanchi Stupa No 2 relics.jpg|thumb|Some of the relics found in Stupa Nb 2.]]
The Stupa contained a relic box with four small caskets of [[steatite]] inside, containing human bones. An inscription in early [[Brahmi]] was found on the relic box, mentioning that it contained "the relics of all teachers, including Kasapagota and Vachi-Suvijayita".&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt; Besides, ten saints were mentioned on the caskets, who either participated to the [[Third Buddhist Council]] held under [[Ashoka]], or were sent as emissaries to the [[Himalayas]] to preach the Buddhist doctrine. Among them is a "Mogaliputa",who may be [[Mogaliputa Tissa]], who presided the Third Buddhist Council, but this is disputed.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt;

==Content of the reliefs==
Typically, the earliest medallions at Sanchi are dated to 115 BC, while the more extensive pillar carvings are dated to around 80 BC,&lt;ref name="Shaw 90"&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, C. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD, by Julia Shaw, Left Coast Press, 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 p.90]&lt;/ref&gt; or almost a century later than the first ones, around 15 BCE.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt;

===Early period (circa 115 BCE)===
These reliefs from the early period of Sanchi II (circa 115 BCE) are the earliest known examples of Indian stone reliefs.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw 90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw 88"&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, C. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD, Julia Shaw, Left Coast Press, 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 p.88ff]&lt;/ref&gt; 

;First Jatakas
[[File:Sanchi Stupa number 2 KSP 3638.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The relief of the horse-headed ogress in Sanchi Stupa No.2.]]
One relief of a horse-headed woman, similar to [[:File:Bodh Gaya Jataka.jpg|another one]] at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] of [[Bodh Gaya]], is thought to be the first known representation of a [[Jataka]] (a story of a previous life of the Buddha), the Padakusalamanava Jataka, in which a horse-headed ogress falls in love with one of her preys, and the [[Bodhisattva]] (the future Buddha) is born of their union.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

[[File:Sunga railings detail.jpg|thumb|Sunga period railings were initially blank (left: Sanchi Great Stupa), and only started to be decorated circa 115 BCE with Stupa No.2 (right).&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;]]
These first attempts at narrative art are [[aniconic]], as they do not represent the Buddha directly, but only his appearance in previous lives, or his symbols.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

These are altogether 455 medallions and half-medallions, or which 293 consist in lotus flowers, and 126 in a lotus with another motif. Only 36 of the medallions have another subject.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt; For the first time, clearly Buddhist themes are represented, particularly the four events in the life of the Buddha that are: the Nativity, the Enlightenment, the First Sermon and the Decease.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA149 p.149]&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors consider these reliefs as the prelude (the "[[prolegomenon]]") of the iconography of the reliefs in [[Bharhut]] (100-80 BCE) and of the later and much more evolved depictions on the toranas of the Great Stupa in Sanchi (1st century BCE/CE).&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

====Influence from the northwest==== 
It is thought that the earliest reliefs from the last quarter of the 2nd century BCE were produced by craftsmen from the area of [[Gandhara]] in northwestern Indian, a central [[Indo-Greek]] region,&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt; because they left mason's marks in [[Kharoshthi]] (a script used around the area of Gandhara), as opposed to the local [[Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt; This seems to imply that these foreign workers were responsible for some of the earliest and sometimes quite foreign motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, by [[Amalananda Ghosh]], BRILL [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&amp;pg=PA295 p.295]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the first reliefs at Stupa II, in 115 BCE, the embassy of [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]] from the [[Indo-Greek]] king of [[Taxila]] named [[Antialkidas]], visited the court of the [[Sungas]] king [[Bhagabhadra]] in [[Vidisha]], about 6&amp;nbsp;km away from Sanchi. In Vidisha, Heliodorus established the [[Heliodorus pillar]] in a dedication to [[Vāsudeva]]. This would indicate that relations between the Indo-Greeks and the Sungas had improved by that time, that people traveled between the two realms, and also that the Indo-Greeks readily followed Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Indian History and Civilization, Sailendra Nath Sen, New Age International, 1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA170 p.170]&lt;/ref&gt;

At Dura the oriental tradition is so strong that even Heracles is represented fighting with upraised club a rampant lion; and it is of special interest to note that this same oriental scene of hero fighting rampant lion occurs on the sculptures of the railing pillars of Stupa II at Sanchi in India. The motif was, therefore, widespread and might be called a stock scene in the Parthian repertoire." (Berytus: Archaeological Studies p.291)&lt;/ref&gt;.

;Floral designs
The vast majority of the oldest medallions and half-medallions (293 out of 455) simply consist in a lotus motif. And 126 additional medallions and half medallions represent a lotus with another motif. Some motifs take on Hellenistic decorative forms.

;Buddhist symbols
Parmi les médaillons, les symboles purement Bouddhistes sont assez rares, bien qu'apparaissent par endroit les motifs de [[triratna]], de [[palmette]] (visible déjà dans le [[:File:Pataliputra Palace capital by L A Waddell 1895.jpg|Châpiteau de Pataliputra]], 3ième siècle av. J.-C.), au milieu des multiples motifs de lotus.

Among the medallions, purely Buddhist symbols are quite rare, although the motifs of [[triratna]]s, [[palmette]]s (already visible in the [[Pataliputra capital]], 3rd century BCE), appear in places, in the middle of multiple lotus motifs.

===Later period (circa 15 BCE)===
About a century later, some more descriptive reliefs were added, and often superimposed on the earlier ones, which clearly show the evolution of Buddhist during the intervening period.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt; This time, the reliefs are much more Buddhist in character, and are contemporary with the reliefs on the [[torana]] gateways of the Great Stupa at Sanchi.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

The panel shows a realistic lion, except for its manes, which are in the shape of small round curls, not unlike those of the Buddha. The lion is more standing upright than thrusting forward, but this may be due to lack of space. The hunter or hero wears non-Indian clothes—boots, a skirt till his knees, a kind of T-shirt and a helmet—, which might indicate a foreign hero or story. Theoretically, the story line of this panel may be based on the Greek Heracles myth as well." in [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ3quxh9gsgC&amp;pg=PA357 Animals in Stone: Indian Mammals Sculptured Through Time by Alexandra Anna Enrica van der Geer].&lt;/ref&gt;.

But for a few details, the figure, possibly depicting a Saka, strongly recalls the members of a drinking couple in a toilet-tray in the British Museum: same tunic, same chevron pattern on the sleeves (and, in the toilet tray, also on the "solar" motif framing the couple), a very similar hair treatment, and eyelids in strong relief, a detail which is not found on other human figures on the same vedika." in [https://www.academia.edu/36161223/Problems_of_Chronology_in_Gandhāran_Art_Proceedings_of_the_First_International_Workshop_of_the_Gandhāra_Connections_Project_University_of_Oxford_23rd-24th_March_2017 Problems of Chronology in Gandhāran Art: Proceedings of the First International Workshop of the Gandhāra Connections Project, University of Oxford, 23rd-24th March, 2017, {{p.|130}}]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Science and Civilisation in China''''' (1954–[2016]) is a series of books initiated and edited by British [[biochemist]], [[historian]] and [[sinologist]] [[Joseph Needham| Joseph Needham, Ph.D]] (1900–1995). Needham was a well-respected scientist before undertaking this encyclopedia and was even responsible for the "S" in [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/20/archives/joseph-needham-the-real-thing.html|title=Joseph Needham, the Real Thing|last=Boston|first=Richard|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with the [[history of science and technology in China]]. To date there have been seven volumes in twenty-seven books. The series was on the Modern Library Board's [[Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction|100 Best Nonfiction]] books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Library, 1999. [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnonfiction.html 100 Best Nonfiction."]&lt;/ref&gt; Needham's work was the first of its kind to praise Chinese scientific contributions and provide their history and connection to global knowledge in contrast to eurocentric historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=Stefan Gaarsmand|date=2013|title=Chinese Influences or Images?: Fluctuating Histories of How Enlightenment Europe Read China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2013.0076|journal=Journal of World History|volume=24|issue=3|pages=623–660|doi=10.1353/jwh.2013.0076|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Needham—along with an international team of collaborators—initiated the project to study the science, technology, and civilisation of ancient China. This project produced a series of volumes published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The project is still  continuing under the guidance of the Publications Board of the [[Needham Research Institute]] (NRI), chaired by [[Christopher Cullen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nri.cam.ac.uk/science.html|title=Science and Civilisation in China|publisher=Needham Research Institute|accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 3 of the encyclopedia was the first body of work to describe Chinese improvements to [[cartography]], [[geology]], [[seismology]] and [[mineralogy]]. It also includes descriptions of nautical technology, sailing charts, and wheel-maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779676|title=Science and civilisation in China|last=1900-1995,|first=Needham, Joseph,|others=Wang, Ling, 1917-1994., Métailie, Georges., Huang, H. T.|isbn=052105799X|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=779676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Needham's transliteration of [[Chinese characters]] uses the [[Wade-Giles]] system, though the aspirate apostrophe (e.g., ''ch'i'') was rendered 'h' (viz. ''chhi''; traditional Chinese: 氣; Mandarin Pinyin: ''[[qì]]''). However, it was abandoned in favor of the [[pinyin]] system by the NRI board in April 2004, with Volume 5, Part 11 becoming the first to use the new system.&lt;ref&gt;volume 5, part 11, page xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Joseph Needham with Chinese History and Sciences scholars, 1988.jpg|thumb|Joseph Needham, in 1988, surrounded by Chinese History and Sciences scholars.]]

=== Development ===
[[Joseph Needham]]’s interest in the history of Chinese science developed while he worked as an Embryologist at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=880 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Needham had already published works relating to the history of science, including his 1934 book titled ''[[A History of Embryology]]'', and was open to expanding his historical scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Gregory |title=Joseph Needham-A Publication History |journal=Chinese Science |date=1997 |issue=14 |page=92 |url=https://www-jstor-org.oca.ucsc.edu/stable/pdf/43290409.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham’s first encounter with Chinese culture occurred in 1937 when three Chinese medical students arrived to work with him at the Cambridge Biochemical Laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winchester |first1=Simon |title=The man who unveiled China |journal=Nature |date=2008 |volume=454 |issue=7203 |page=409 |url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham’s interest in Chinese civilization and scientific progress grew as a result and led him to learn Chinese from his students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two of those students,[[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]], and [[Lu Gwei-djen]], would later become his collaborators on ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brook |first1=Timothy |title=The Sinology of Joseph Needham |journal=Modern China |date=1996 |volume=22 |issue=3 |page=341 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com.oca.ucsc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/009770049602200304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, China’s eastern universities were forced to relocate to the west as a result of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winchester|first1=Simon|date=2008|title=The man who unveiled China|url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7203|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese academics sought the help of the British government in an effort to preserve their intellectual life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1942, Needham was selected and appointed as a diplomat by the British government and tasked with traveling to China and assessing the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=880 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his three years there, Needham discovered that the Chinese had developed techniques and mechanisms which were centuries older than their European counterparts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Needham became concerned with the exclusion of China in the history of science and began to question why the Chinese ceased to develop new techniques after the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Publication ===
Armed with his new-found knowledge, Needham returned to Cambridge in 1948 and began working on a book with one of the Chinese medical students he met in Cambridge, [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]], who was now a professor at a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=883 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he planned on releasing only one volume of his findings through the Cambridge University Press, but later changed his mind and proposed up to eleven volumes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1954, Needham published the first volume of ''Science and Civilisation in China'', which was well received and was followed by other volumes which focused on specific scientific fields and topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Gregory |title=Joseph Needham-A Publication History |journal=Chinese Science |date=1997 |issue=14 |page=93 |url=https://www-jstor-org.oca.ucsc.edu/stable/pdf/43290409.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham, along with his collaborators, was personally involved in all of the volumes of Science and Civilization, up until Needham’s death in 1995.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After Needham’s death, Cambridge University established an institution named after Needham, The [[Needham Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winchester |first1=Simon |title=The man who unveiled China |journal=Nature |date=2008 |volume=454 |issue=7203 |page=411 |url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of the institution continue Needham’s work and have published 8 additional volumes of ''Science and Civilisation in China'', since his death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Summaries==
There have been two summaries or condensations of the vast amount of material found in ''Science and Civilisation''. The first, a one-volume [[popular history]] book by [[Robert K. G. Temple|Robert Temple]]  entitled ''The Genius of China'', was completed in a little over 12 months to be available in 1986 for the visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] to China. This addressed only the contributions made by China and had a "warm welcome" from Joseph Needham in the introduction, though in the ''Beijing Review'' he criticized that it had "some mistakes ... and various statements that I would like to have seen expressed rather differently".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|journal=Beijing Review|url=http://www.robert-temple.com/articles/beijing_review.pdf|title=East-West: Bridging the Scientific Chasm|author=Ling Yuan|date=Mar 23, 1987|accessdate=2011-02-06}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A second was made by [[Colin Ronan]], a writer on the history of science, who produced a five volume condensation ''The Shorter Science and Civilisation: An abridgement of Joseph Needham's original text'', between 1980 and his death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Colin Ronan|title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980–95}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These volumes cover:
# China and Chinese science
# Mathematics, astronomy, meteorology and the earth sciences
# Magnetism, nautical technology, navigation, voyages
# Mechanical engineering, machines, clockwork, windmills, aeronautics
# Civil engineering, roads, bridges, hydraulic engineering

==Reception==

=== Criticism from Scholars ===
''Science and Civilisation in China '' is highly regarded among scholars because of its extensive comparative coverage of Chinese innovations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Finlay, Robert. "China, the West, and World History in Joseph Needham's Science and Civilisation in China." ''Journal of World History'', vol. 11 no. 2, 2000, pp. 265-303. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/jwh.2000.0035&lt;/ref&gt; Needham spent a large amount of time translating, and decoding primary sources for ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of his efforts helped to confirm that scientific advancements, and analytical ingenuity were abundant in [[China]] in early modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, Peter C."Joseph Needham's Problematic Legacy." ''Technology and Culture'', vol. 47 no. 1, 2006, pp. 175-178. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/tech.2006.0092&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, beginning with his first volume, some scholars in the [[Science|scientific]], [[history of science]], and [[sinology]] fields criticized Needham’s work for being too comparative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his work, Needham wrote that numerous Chinese inventions ended up in the west, including the [[Compass|magnetic compass]], and the [[Clock|mechanical clock]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Needham also wrote that once these inventions reached [[Europe]], they had a great impact on social life, and helped to stimulate the economy, as well as usher in the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other scholars criticized his [[Marxism|Marxist]] background, his understanding of Chinese culture, and his methodology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dr. of History Roger Hart wrote "A Post-Needham Critique" in an East Asia journal accusing Needham of attributing scientific achievements to Chinese civilization in contrast to evidence by exaggerating claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Roger|date=1999|title=Beyond Science and Civilization: A Post-Needham Critique|jstor=43150558|journal=East Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine|volume=16|pages=88–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor of Volume 6, [[Nathan Sivin]] and Needham's research collaborator [[Lu Gwei-djen]] include updated research to support some of Needham's claims. However, Sivin is critical of Needham suggesting more research is required citing his assumptions of Taoisms' role in promoting scientific feats in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199920082-0006|title=The Needham Question|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|date=2013-04-22|website=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Acclaim ===
Needham's ''Science and Civilisation in China'' did not receive criticism from scholars in other fields of study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Groff Conklin]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1955 said that Vol. 1 "presents a richly patterned tapestry of the development of civilization in the Far East", and that "it is for everyone who is intrigued by the unknown, whether future (science fiction) or past (scientific history)".&lt;ref name="conklin195503"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Jonathan Spence]] wrote in a 1982 [[The New York Times|New York Times]] article "this work is the most ambitious undertaking in Chinese studies during this century".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/books/the-china-the-west-knew-nothing-about.html|title=THE CHINA THE WEST KNEW NOTHING ABOUT|last=Spence|first=Jonathan|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times obituary for Needham stated that those educated in China hail Dr. Needham's encyclopedia and compare him to [[Charles Darwin]] in terms of importance regarding scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/27/obituaries/joseph-needham-china-scholar-from-britain-dies-at-94.html|title=Joseph Needham, China Scholar From Britain, Dies at 94|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Arun Bala, the author of ''[[The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science]],'' Needham postulates that scientific knowledge may evolve to more closely resemble Chinese philosophical views of nature; signifying his belief in Chinese inherent wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bala|first=Arun|date=2006|title=The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230601215|doi=10.1057/9780230601215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Needham Question ==

=== Origins ===
After his extensive research of Chinese innovations, [[Joseph Needham]] became concerned with the question: Why did modern science stop developing in China after the 16th century?&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Needham believed this was due to [[China]]’s sociopolitical system which was not affected by Chinese inventions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[China]] did not have a structure in which merchants could profit off of their inventions, unlike the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once Chinese inventions reached [[Europe]], they revolutionized their sociopolitical system, which used the inventions to dominate political rivals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Needham, Chinese innovations, such as [[gunpowder]], the [[compass]], [[paper]], and [[printing]], helped transform European [[Feudalism]] into [[Capitalism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the end of the 15th century, [[Europe]] was actively financing scientific discoveries, and nautical exploration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[paradox]] of this conclusion was that [[Europe]] surpassed [[China]] in scientific innovations, using Chinese technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Re-formulation ===
After several volumes of ''Science and Civilisation in China'' had been published, Needham was questioned about his theory of the origin of science in the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Needham, troubled by past criticism and dismissal of his work as [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, declined to publicly state his relationship to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, in Needham’s work ''[[The Grand Titration]],'' he re-framed his question as: ''“why, between the first century BC and the fifteenth century AD, Chinese civilization was much more efficient than occidental in applying human natural knowledge to practical human needs”''&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. “Science and Society in East and West.” In ''The Grand Titration: Science and Society in East and West''. By Joseph Needham, 190–217. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1969a.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformulation of the question, changed the narrative of ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initially, the question centered around [[China]]’s failure to develop scientifically after the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The focus shifted towards an examination of China’s accomplishments prior to development in Europe, this focus was addressed throughout ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199920082/obo-9780199920082-0006.xml#obo-9780199920082-0006-bibItem-0003|title=The Needham Question|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|date=|website=Oxford Bibliographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued Debate ===
Needham's attempt to uncover the reasoning behind China's rise and fall as an elite scientific and technologically advanced nation has been expounded upon and debated for decades including [[Justin Yifu Lin]]'s [[University of Chicago Press|University of Chicago]] journal article "The Needham Puzzle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|date=January 1995|title=The Needham Puzzle: Why the Industrial Revolution Did Not Originate in China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/452150|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=43|issue=2|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/452150|issn=0013-0079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Tilden Blodgett''' (1823 – 4 November 1875) was a [[New York City]] art collector who was instrumental in founding the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

He was active in the [[American Civil War]] and organized the NYC [[Union League Club]] and the [[Sanitary Fair]] to raise funds for the wounded. He founded the newspaper ''[[The Nation]]'' and was a leader in establishing the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He was a founding member of the committee to form the Met in 1869 and was its first chairman. He had been on the selection committee for the American works to be presented at the French exhibition of 1867 and thus felt he knew enough to purchase pictures for the young museum while abroad in 1870.

He purchased a total of 174 pictures which he financed together with [[John Taylor Johnston]] and about half of this "1871 purchase" is still in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2011/today-in-met-history-march-28 Today in MET History]], museum blog in 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|Iṣṭa-devatā in the Hindu context|Iṣṭa-devatā}}
'''Yidam''' {{bo|ཡི་དམ}} is a type of deity associated with tantric or [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] said to be manifestations of [[Buddhahood]] or enlightened mind. During personal meditation (''sādhana'') practice, the yogi identifies their own form, attributes and mind with those of a yidam for the purpose of transformation.&lt;ref name="PrincetonDic"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Buswell |first1=Robert E. |authorlink1=Robert Buswell Jr.|last2=Lopez |first2=Donald S. |authorlink2=Donald S. Lopez, Jr. |date=2013|title=The Princeton dictionary of Buddhism|page= |location=Princeton and Oxford|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-15786-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yidam is sometimes translated by the terms "meditational deity" or "tutelary deity". Examples of yidams include the meditation deities Chakrasamvara, Kalachakra, Hevajra, Yamantaka, and Vajrayogini, all of whom have a distinctive iconography, mandala, mantra, rites of invocation and practice.

In Vajrayana, the yidam is one of the [[Three Roots|three roots]] of the "inner" refuge formula and is also the key element of [[Vajrayana#Deity yoga|Deity yoga]] since the 'deity' in the yoga is the yidam.

==Etymology==
Yidam is said to be a contraction of Tib. ''yid-kyi-dam-tshig'',&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Sarah. "The Dharma Dictionary." Buddhadharma Magazine, Spring 2005. [http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2005/spring/dharma_dictionary.html Dharma Dictionary: Yidam].&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[[samaya]] of mind"- in other words, the state of being indestructibly bonded with the inherently pure and liberated nature of mind.

The [[Sanskrit]] word '''{{IAST|iṣṭadevatā}}''' or '''{{IAST|iṣṭadevaḥ}}''' a compound of ''iṣṭa'' (desired, liked, reverenced) + ''devatā'' (a [[deity]] or divine being) is a term associated with yidam in many popular books on Buddhist Tantra but has not been attested in any Buddhist tantric text in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;where the Hindus take the Istadeva for an actual deity who has been invited to dwell in the devotee's heart, the Yidams of Tantric Buddhism are in fact the emanations of the adepts own mind. "''The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet: A Practical Guide to the Theory, Purpose, and Techniques of Tantric Meditation'' by John Blofeld. Penguin:1992.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Three Roots==
The yidam appears as one of the [[Three Roots]] in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57062-920-4|pages=327 n.51}} Simmer-Brown cites evidence that Three Roots is a Tibetan Buddhist formulation from the time of Padmasambhava.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Inner' refuge formulation. The [[iconography]] of the yidam may be 'peaceful', 'wrathful' (Tibetan ''tro wa'') or 'neither peaceful or wrathful' (Tibetan:'' shi ma tro''), depending on the practitioner's own nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmo|first=Tenzin|title=Reflections on a Mountain Lake:Teachings on Practical Buddhism|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=2002|pages=229–231|isbn=1-55939-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yidam represents awakening and so its appearance reflects whatever is required by the practitioner in order to awaken. The guru will guide the student as to which yidam is appropriate for them and then [[Wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|initiation]] into the [[mandala]] of the Ishta-deva is given by the [[guru]], so that [[Deity Yoga]] practices can be undertaken. In essence, the [[mindstream]] of the guru and the yidam are indivisible. The yidam is considered to be the root of success in the practice.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==In East Asian Buddhism==
The Vajrayana traditions of China, Korea and Japan, while smaller and less prominent than Indo-Tibetan tantric Buddhism, are characterized in part by the utilization of yidams in meditation, though they use their own terms. One prominent ishta-devata in East Asian vajrayana is '''[[Marici (Buddhism)|Marici]]''' (Ch: ''Molichitian'', Jp: ''Marishi-ten''). In the [[Shingon]] tradition of Japan, prominent yidam include the "five mysteries of Vajrasattva," which are '''[[Vajrasattva]]''' (Jp. ''Kongosatta''), '''Surata/Ishta-vajrinī''' (Jp. ''Yoku-kongonyo''"慾金剛女"), '''Kelikilā-vajrinī''' (Jp. ''Shoku-kongonyo''"触金剛女"), '''Kāmā/Rāga-vajrinī''' ((Jp. ''Ai-kongonyo''"愛金剛女"), and '''Kāmesvarā/Mana-vajrinī''' ((Jp. ''Man-kongonyo''"慢金剛女").&lt;ref&gt;''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia'' by Richard Payne, Wisdom Publications: 2005. {{ISBN|0-86171-487-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yidam in Nepalese Newar Buddhism==
The principal yidam in the [[Newar]] Vajrayana tradition of Nepal are [[Chakrasamvara]] and [[Vajravarahi]].&lt;ref name="Dina Bangdel 2003. p. 32"&gt;Dina Bangdel, "Tantra in Nepal," ''The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art'' Serindia Publications: 2003. {{ISBN|1-932476-01-6}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In that tradition, three components are essential to a temple complex: a main shrine symbolizing [[Svayambhu Mahachaitya]]; an exoteric shrine featuring [[Buddha Shakyamuni]] and other buddhas and bodhisattvas; and an esoteric shrine dedicated to the yidam, to which only initiates may be admitted.&lt;ref name="Dina Bangdel 2003. p. 32"/&gt;

==Working definition==
According to ''The Tonglen and Mind Training Site'' which discusses [[Tonglen]] and [[Ngöndro]], Yidam is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Visualized representative of your enlightened energy, or Buddha-nature. Tricky concept for Westerners; closest concept might be that of a patron saint in Catholicism, except that a yidam is not a historical figure and is not necessarily supposed to 'exist' in the same way human beings do. Other related concepts might be a totem or power animal in the Native American tradition, or even the fairy godmother in children's tales.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://lojongmindtraining.com/glossary.aspx Lojong Mind Training: Yidam] (accessed: December 6, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Exegesis==
During the (meditation) practice of the [[generation stage]], a practitioner ([[sadhaka]]) establishes a strong familiarity with the Ishta-deva (an enlightened being) by means of visualization and a high level of concentration. During the practice of the [[completion stage]], a practitioner focusses on methods to actualize the transformation of one's own mindstream and body into the meditation Deity by meditation and yogic techniques of energy-control such as [[Kundalini yoga|kundalini]] ([[tummo]] in Tibetan). Through these complementary disciplines of generation and completion one increasingly perceives the pervasive [[Buddha nature]].

Judith Simmer-Brown summarises: &lt;blockquote&gt;
... a yidam, a personal meditational deity, a potent ritual symbol simultaneously representing the mind of the guru and lineage of enlightened teachers, and the enlightened mind of the tantric practitioner. Recognizing the inseparability of these two is the ground of tantric practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala|year=2001|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Berzin]] (1997: unpaginated) in discussing Buddhist [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] commitment and [[bodhisattva vows]] frames a caution to [[sadhana]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
More specifically, this commitment means not taking ultimate refuge in gods or spirits. Buddhism, particularly in its Tibetan form, often contains ritual ceremonies, or pujas, directed toward various Buddha-figures or fierce protectors in order to help dispel obstacles and accomplish constructive purposes. Performing these ceremonies provides conducive circumstances for negative potentials to ripen in trivial rather than major obstacles, and positive potentials to ripen sooner rather than later. If we have built up overwhelmingly negative potentials, however, these ceremonies are ineffective in averting difficulties. Therefore, propitiating gods, spirits, protectors or even Buddhas is never a substitute for attending to our karma&amp;nbsp;– avoiding destructive conduct and acting in a constructive manner. Buddhism is not a spiritual path of protector-worship, or even Buddha-worship. The safe direction of the Buddhist path is working to become a Buddha ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander (1997). ''Taking the Kalachakra Initiation: Part III: Vows and Closely Bonding Practices.'' Source: [http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/published_books/kalachakra_initiation/pt3/kalachakra_initiation_06.html Taking the Kalachakra Initiation] (accessed: July 14, 2016). NB: Originally published as
Berzin, Alexander. Taking the Kalachakra Initiation. Ithaca, Snow Lion, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the [[Vajrayana]] practices of Tibetan Buddhism, 'safe direction', or '[[refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]]' is undertaken through the [[Three Roots]], the practitioner relying on an Ishta-deva in [[Deity Yoga]] as a means of becoming a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].

===Common yidams===
Some common yidams include [[Hayagriva]], [[Vajrakilaya]] (Dorje [[Phurba]]), [[Samputa]], [[Guhyasamaja]], [[Yamantaka]], [[Hevajra]], [[Kurukulla]], [[Cakrasamvara]], [[Vajrayogini]], and [[Kalachakra]]. Also, other enlightened beings such as the regular forms of the Buddhas, [[Bodhisattva]]s, [[Padmasambhava]], certain [[Dharmapala]]s, [[Dakini]]s, Wealth Deities, and [[yab-yum]] representations, among others, can also be practiced as a yidam.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Avalokiteshvara]], [[Tara (Buddhist)|Tara]], [[Manjusri]], [[Hevajra]] and consort [[Nairatmya]], [[Heruka]]-Chakrasamvara and consort [[Vajravarahi]], etc. are frequently chosen as yidams, but any deity of the [[tantric Buddhism|tantric]] pantheon may be adopted as such.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The yidam is used as a means or a goal of transformation towards full enlightenment. According to certain traditions, the Ishtadevas are considered as the emanation of the adept's own [[mind]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
