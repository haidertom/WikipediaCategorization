[[File:Alice Springs Desrt Park Kangaroo.jpg|thumb|A kangaroo at the Alice Springs Desert Park]]
The '''Alice Springs Desert Park''' is an [[environmental education]] facility in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]].

It is sited on {{Convert|1300|ha|acre|0}}, with a core area of {{Convert|52|ha|acre|0}}. It is an institutional member of the [[Zoo and Aquarium Association]] (ZAA) and [[Botanic Gardens Conservation International]] (BGCI).

The park contains native animals and plants representative of [[central Australian]] [[desert]] environments, and contributes to their [[conservation ethic|conservation]] through research programs as well as through public education. It offers people the opportunity to experience the variety of the deserts of central Australia, exploring the inter-relationships between the plants, animals and people.

The area is culturally important to the local [[Arrernte people]]. Much of the work of the park is under the auspices of their ''apmereke-artweye'' (decision-makers) and ''kwertengerle'' (caretakers) - people once known as the park's traditional owners.&lt;ref name="park_values"/&gt;&lt;ref name="park_relationship_to_land"/&gt;

==Exhibits and facilities==

The park contains three separate walk-through desert habitat areas accessed through a {{Convert|1.6|km|0|sing=on}} trail: Desert Rivers, Sand Country, and Woodland. In addition, it has a Nocturnal House and a Nature theatre. The entrance area includes an exhibition center, rest rooms, and cafe.&lt;ref name="frommers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="park_map"/&gt;

;Desert Rivers

In this habitat, visitors walk through dry river beds,and areas that have been flooded, and past swamps and water holes. The plants here include river red gums, coolibah trees, aquatic plants, and reeds. Animals in this habitat include finches, cockatoos, water birds, frogs, and fish. Demonstrations here show how the aboriginal people use this habitat to harvest food and medicine.&lt;ref name="park_desert_rivers"/&gt;

;Sand Country

This exhibit is a re-creation of the sandy desert including clay, gypsum, and salt pans.&lt;ref name="park_map"/&gt;

;Nocturnal house
[[File:A232, Alice Springs Desert Park, Alice Springs, Australia, thorny devil, 2007.JPG|thumb|right|[[Thorny dragon]], also known as thorny devil (''Moloch horridus'')]]
The Nocturnal House is located between the Sand Country and Woodland habitats, and is home to many Central Australian reptiles, invertebrates, birds, and mammals that are active during the night. The collection includes some reptiles that may be active during the day but difficult to find in the desert.&lt;ref name="park_map"/&gt;&lt;ref name="park_nocturnal_house"/&gt;

;Woodland

The Woodland habitat includes enclosures for [[kangaroo]]s and [[emu]]s.&lt;ref name="park_map"/&gt; Visitors can walk among the kangaroos in their exhibit area.&lt;ref name="frommers"/&gt;

;Nature Theatre

Presentations at the Nature Theatre show visitors some of the animals that might be seen while walking through the park, including demonstrations with free-flying birds of prey.&lt;ref name="park_nature_theatre"/&gt;

;Aboriginal Survival

Presentations at the park, include information on Aboriginal Survival one focusing on water gathering and another on food gathering.  The food gathering presentation is particularly focused on the Arrernte People and includes information on sex roles, with the distinct jobs of men and women.  Information on kinship focuses on Arrernte Skin names and the rules for relations ships built around the skin name groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Relationships|url=http://www.alicespringsdesertpark.com.au/kids/culture/relationships.shtml|publisher=Alice Springs Desert Park

== Rationale ==
Traditional node-link methods for visualizing networks deteriorate in terms of legibility when dealing with large networks, due to the proliferation of edge crossings amassing as what are disparagingly termed 'hairballs'.&lt;ref name="KrzywinskiBirol2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krzywinski|first1=M.|last2=Birol|first2=I.|last3=Jones|first3=S. J.|last4=Marra|first4=M. A.|title=Hive plots--rational approach to visualizing networks|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=13|issue=5|year=2011|pages=627–644|issn=1467-5463|doi=10.1093/bib/bbr069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kosara | first = Robert | title = Graphs Beyond the Hairball | date = 2012-02-01 | url = https://eagereyes.org/techniques/graphs-hairball | accessdate = 2015-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BioFabric is one of a number of alternative approaches designed explicitly to tackle this scalability issue,&lt;ref name="KrzywinskiBirol2011" /&gt; choosing to do so by depicting nodes as lines on the horizontal axis, one per row; edges as lines on the vertical axis, one per column, terminating at the two rows associated with the endpoint nodes. As such, nodes and edges are each provided their own dimension (as opposed to solely the edges with nodes being non-dimensional points). BioFabric exploits the additional degree of freedom thus produced to place ends of incident edges in groups. This placement can potentially carry semantic information, whereas in node-link graphics the placement is often arbitrarily generated within constraints for aesthetics, such as during force-directed graph drawing, and may result in apparently informative artifacts.

Edges are drawn (vertically) in a darker shade than (horizontal) nodes, creating visual distinction. Additional edges increase the width of the graph.

Both ends of a link are represented as a square to reinforce the above effect even at small scales. Directed graphs also incorporate arrowheads.

== Development ==
The first version, 1.0.0, was released in July 2012. Development work on BioFabric is ongoing. An open source R implementation was released in 2013, ''RBioFabric'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/wjrl/RBioFabric |title=GitHub: wjrl/RBioFabric |last=Longabaugh |first=William |date= 2013-07-01 |accessdate=2015-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for use with the igraph package,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igraph.org/r/ |title=igraph R package |author=The igraph core team |accessdate=2015-03-07 |quote=Install and start using the igraph R package }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently described on the project weblog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biofabric.blogspot.co.uk/2013_07_01_archive.html |title=Combing the hairball: July 2013 |last=Longabaugh |first=William |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2015-03-07 |quote=Commentary about BioFabric (www.BioFabric.org), a new way to visualize networks. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossi and Magnani&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Rossi | first1 = Luca |  last2 = Magnani | first2 = Matteo | doi  = 10.1016/j.chaos.2014.12.022 | journal = Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals | title =Towards effective visual analytics on multiplex and multilayer networks | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077914002422 | volume = 72 | pages = 68–76 | year = 2015| arxiv = 1501.01666 | bibcode = 2015CSF....72...68R }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | title=Towards effective visual analytics on multiplex and multilayer networks | date= 7 Jan 2015 | eprint=1501.01666| last1 = Rossi | first1 = Luca |  last2 = Magnani | first2 = Matteo | class=cs.SI}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed ''ranked sociograms'', which is a BioFabric-like presentation where the node ordering is based upon a ranking metric. This approach attaches semantic meaning to the length of the edge lines, and can be used to visualize the [[assortativity]] or dissortativity of a network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10903">'''Canntaireachd''' ({{IPA-gd|ˈkʰãũn̪ˠt̪ɛɾʲəxk|pron}}; {{langnf||Scottish Gaelic|"chanting"}}) is the ancient [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highland]] method of notating ''[[pibroch|Piobaireachd]]'', also spelt ''[[Pibroch]]'', referred to more generally as ''[[pibroch|Ceol Mòr]]'' (literally the "big music"), an art music genre primarily played on the Great Highland Bagpipes. These long and complex theme and variation tunes were traditionally transmitted orally by a combination of definite vocable syllables. In general, the [[vowel]]s represent the notes, and [[consonant]]s the grace notes, but this is not always the case, as the system has inconsistencies and was not fully standardized.

Pipers have used musical [[staff notation]] to read and write pibroch tunes since the early nineteenth century. Many of the early staff notated scores for modern pibroch published by Angus MacKay and authorised by the Piobaireachd Society are now considered by scholars to have been oversimplified, with standardisations of time signatures and editing out of ornamental complexities, when tunes are compared with versions in earlier manuscripts such as the ''Campbell Canntaireachd''. The practice of canntaireachd singing remains the preferred means for many pipers to convey the musicality and pacing of pibroch performance when teaching or rehearsing a tune.

Canntaireachd was first written down at the end of the 18th century in the ''Campbell Canntaireachd'' by Colin Cambell of Nether Lorn, Argyll. While his vocable system had its origins in chanted notation, the ''Campbell Canntaireachd'' is now considered to have been intended as a written documentation of the music, to be read rather than sung. Nevertheless, Cambell's Nether Lorn Canntaireachd was adopted by the Piobaireachd Society in their publications and has become the most commonly used vocable system. Another related system of Canntaireachd was published by Niel McLeod of Gesto, reputedly taken down from the chanted singing of John MacCrimmon, one of the last practicing members of that esteemed piping family. The MacArthur family of pipers are reported to have had their own oral form of Canntaireachd system that was not documented. A further variety of Canntaireachd and distinct collection of pibroch tunes was sourced from Simon Fraser, whose family emigrated to Melbourne in the 19th century. It is assumed that different lineages of pipers developed distinct forms of Canntaireachd that were variations on a broadly similar system of sung vocable notation. This informal oral variation continues today in the practices of experienced piping musicians and teachers.

William Donaldson, in ''The Highland Pipe and Scottish Society 1750-1950'' states:

:"In its written form, canntaireachd provided the basis of the indigenous notational system and it was brought to its most developed form by Colin Mór Campbell of Nether Lorn in Argyll, at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th Century. Although Campbell's work was almost immediately superseded by a form of staff notation adapted specifically for the pipe, and remained unpublished and unrecognised until well into the 20th Century, it remains an important achievement and gives valuable insight into the musical organisation of Ceòl Mór"

==Explanation of ''canntaireachd''==
(Please note that the following sections use the convention of indicating standard notes by capital letters between quotation marks, and ''canntaireachd'' notes by lower case letters in italics, i.e. "A" is not the same as ''a''. In a couple of cases, [[solfege]] is also used.)

===Explanation of table===
The table given is based on the advice of Charles Bannatyne of Salsburgh, Holyhead. Some of the notes resemble each other very closely, but the changes used are indicated, and the pronunciations are given approximately in brackets.

The [[key note]] "Low A" is always represented in this notation by ''in'', probably a contraction of ''An Dàra Aon'', the second one, to distinguish the key note from the first note on the [[chanter]]—"low G". "High A" is always ''i'', but in a ''canntaireachd'', it is often denoted by a preceding  ''l'', thus ''liu'', and so confusion is avoided. "Low A" is either ''in'', ''en'', ''em'', or simply ''n'' after some notes. The alternatives seem to have been used for the sake of euphony.

"D" note is ''a'' and "B" note is ''a'', but the qualifying effect of the [[grace note]]s — "high G" represented by ''h'', and "D" represented by ''d'' or ''h'' (the latter a contraction of "''a’ chorrag''", the Gaelic name for the finger playing "D") prevents any confusion.

The note "E" is represented by ''i''. At the beginning of most of the MacCrimmon tunes and variations is ''l'', which gives the keynote. It stands for "E" ([[soh]]), the dominant of the "low A" (doh). Where it does not occur, the tune will be found to start with a word like "hien", which denotes "E" with "High G" grace note, and then "low A".

The vowel for "F" note is ''ie'', and it is always made certain by the grace note ''d'' or ''h''.

"High G" is ''u'', often distinguished by a preceding ''h''.

"High A" is often ''vi'' to distinguish it from the "E" note. When "F" succeeds  "high A" in a tune, the word is often ''vie''.

====Grace notes====
Regarding [[grace notes]], ''h'' the aspirate, qualifies all notes down to "low A", but often where ''ha'' obviously means "B" note, it must be concluded that it should be written ''cha'' (xa). Similarly ''ho ho'' should be ''ho cho'' (ho xo). The letter ''d'' is used, as is ''t'' to denote both "High G" and "D" grace notes, but an examination of the notation word, makes a mistake unlikely, thus ''dieliu'' means "F" with "high G" grace note, and then "high A" and "G". ''Tihi'' means two "E"s played with two "G" grace notes. ''T'' and ''d'' resemble each other very closely in Gaelic, but the context in ''canntaireachd'' makes it always easy to see whether "high G" grace note or "D" is meant. It is necessary to explain the compound grace note systems. ''Dr'' is doubling of "low G" by a touch of "D" grace note, and open "low A", and so on, over the whole scale. The letters ''dr'' are obviously a contraction of ''dà uair'', two times, or twice. ''Trì'' means doubling of "low G" by "D" grace note, and as "A" is opened, double "E" by "F" and "E" and open "E". This is a "''Crunluath''" form. ''Tro'' is the same, at first, but the doubling of "E" is done with the grips from ''o'' or the "C" note. This is "''Crunluath-a-mach''" (outer "''crunnluath''"). These examples will make the rest easy. In many tunes where the ''tr'' type appears, it obviously when translated should only have been a ''dr'' type, this confusion being only to the similarity of ''d'' and ''t'' in Gaelic.

The shake on "high A" is ''vivi''. The other shakes are represented by ''rr'', according to from where the beats and shakes are taken. This seems to be a contraction of "''gearradh''" meaning a "shake". A simple touch of a note before opening is always represented by a single ''r''. For instance, such a word as ''radin'' signifies that "B" is to be touched with "Low G" (''lùdag'') before opening; ''-din'' is "low A" with "D" grace note. ''Ho radin'' is the "C" note ''o'' with "high G" grace note keeping the ''ra-'' below "D" note, also an "A" note.

====Rules for the Grace note scheme====
1 – All grace notes and grace note types are forestrokes, that is they occur before the notes they embellish. They are "appoggiaturas" or "[[semiquaver]]" notes, or "Caciaturas" or demi-semi-quaver notes, which predominate.

2 – All grace notes in canntaireachd are represented by consonants.

3 – All compound forms are made by combining single forms.

4 – All leading or scale notes are represented by vowels.

5 – All note forms with ''m'' or ''n'' in them contain "low A".

6 – Grace notes ''h'' and ''d'' are qualifying or modulating grace notes.

7 – Doublings are represented by ''dr'', triplings by ''tr'', compound types by combinations of these.

8 – Open doublings above "D" are represented by ''dir'', such as ''dirie'', where the note is doubled by itself, and the note above it. ''Dr'' represents closed doublings, and ''dir'' open doublings.

====Grace note forms defined====
Grace note forms consist of single, double, and compound:
*The single group includes all simple forms, together with the "''dà-lugh''" variation form.
*The double group includes the single and double types of "''trì-lugh''" and "''ceithir-lugh''".
*The single type of "''trì-lugh''" is composed of three "low A"s graced by "G", "D" and "E" gracenotes, and it precedes the note embellished. An example of this is "hininindo", the syllable ''do'' being "C" graced by "D". This type is called "''fosgailte''" (open), and is opposed by the double or closed form, represented by such a form as ''hindirinto''. The latter is called "''a-steach''" (inside), which is taken to a type like ''hodorito'', which is said to be "''a-mach''" (outside), as the grips are taken from the note played. The types last named are also "''breabach''" (kicking) forms, having a "kick” note at the finish. The "''crùn-lugh''" or "''ceithir-lugh''" forms are also "''fosgailte''", "''a-mach''" and "''a-steach''". The word ''hadatri'' is "''a-steach''" when opposed to "hadatri" which is "''a-mach''".

''Hiodratatiriri'' is a pure "''cliabh-lugh''"—the chest or creel of fingers, because every finger on the chanter is engaged in some way, either acting or acted on. In bagpipe music, the variations are all named from the acting fingers, and the old pipers counted their time from the number of fingers engaged in the several parts of the tune. ''Chin-drine'' may be taken as an example of the "''leum-lugh''", the jump of the fingers. This is "low A", played by "D" grace note, then "G" doubled by "D", "low A" then opened, and "F" rapidly opened from it. ''Hiriri'' is an example of a beat form. The playing of two "low A"s by touching "low G" twice with the little finger is ''ririn'', or ''rurin''. The prosodic quality of the syllables, together with the spacing and punctuation, give the time and rhythm of the tunes.

A '''clearance cairn''' is an irregular and unstructured collection of [[fieldstone]]s which have been removed from arable land or pasture to allow for more effective [[agriculture]] and collected into a usually low mound or [[cairn]]. Commonly of [[Bronze Age]] origins, these cairns may be part of a cairnfield (a collection of closely spaced cairns) where some cairns might be funerary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durham-pa.gov.uk/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PGlossary?readform&amp;GLOSSARY=clearance+cairns Keys to the Past Glossary.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68614 English Heritage Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912124019/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68614 |date=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearance cairns are a worldwide phenomenon wherever organised agriculture has been practised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clearance+cairns&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QVXw2Um-V9&amp;sig=XnLom3YjVvZ4GYAOFhlh0JiwEeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Clearance cairns in Palestine.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of clearance ==
[[File:AncientPlough.jpg|thumb|left|Single-handled [[ard_(plough)|ard]]]]
[[File:Mouldboard plough.JPG|thumb|A reconstructed mould board plough.]]
By removing large and moderate size stones from the surface and sub-surface, ploughing can take place with much less potential damage taking place to the plough blade. Stones also prevent the growth of plants where they physically block access to the soil and their removal allows for a greater surface area for crops to grow and to allow for plants to grow to their full potential; Stones also increase drainage and may therefore deprive plants of moisture. Stones were removed from fields to allow for the efficient use of hand tools, animal powered machines on such fields in the past and for tractors, etc. in more recent times. Some prehistoric clearance cairns may also contain burials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timetrail.warwickshire.gov.uk/searchglossary.aspx?term=clearance%20cairn Warwickshire Time Trail]&lt;/ref&gt; A few clearance cairns may have been additionally created as boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/cairns_moor.htm The Cairns of Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; As ploughing developed and specialised the greater depth tilled and the increased power of mechanised [[ploughing]] resulted in more and larger stones being brought to the surface and these too had to be removed.
[[File:Bellfield walled garden.JPG|thumb|A typical [[walled garden]] where the stone acts as a slow release radiator]]
Field clearance cairns sometimes survive long after cleared fields have fallen out of use and are often the only surviving evidence of past agricultural activity in areas of woodland, upland areas, etc.  The existence of these cairns was once regarded as suggesting pastoral farming.  Many now consider them the result of arable or mixed agricultural exploitation enabling ploughing or hand tillage to work more efficiently.

=== Heat radiation ===
The possibility exists that the stone piles were built in the middle of the enclosures, with an additional purpose of maximising the effects of daytime radiance; the holding in of heat caught during the day, and its release at night would increase the temperature of the field very slightly. This effect would encourage crop growth and reduce the risk of frost.&lt;ref name="Archaeology of Pembrokeshire"&gt;[http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/geo/research/carningli/archaeology.htm Archaeology of Pembrokeshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508151602/http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/geo/research/carningli/archaeology.htm |date=2009-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walled gardens produce the same effect.

== Creation ==
[[File:Eglinton mound feature.JPG|thumb|A mound associated with a bog-wood and a clearance cairn at [[Eglinton Country Park]].]]
[[File:Bog-wood Eglinton.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bog-wood]] associated with a clearance cairn.]]
Many clearance stones were used in the construction of defensive structures, houses, farm buildings, walls, drainage ditches, road metalling, etc. Where permanent clearance cairns were formed it was predominately on waste land, such as steep slopes, edges of woodland, field corners, and around earth-fast boulders.

The amount of stone which needed to be cleared from fields depended upon the local geology, glacial deposits, glacial erratics, etc. Many cairns are mainly composed of stones which could have been carried by a single person who would have followed the plough as it turned up small boulders, etc.
Some surviving cairns are of considerable antiquity as field clearance has been practised since the beginnings of agriculture in the Stone Age, such as at the [[Gardberg site]] in [[Vestre Slidre]], [[Oppland]], [[Norway]]. A [[Bronze Age]] origin for clearance cairns is more common.&lt;ref name="Archaeology of Pembrokeshire"/&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Plough marks 2.JPG|thumb|Ard or plough-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn]]
[[File:Plough marks.JPG|left|thumb|Ard-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn at [[Eglinton Country Park]]]]
[[File:Mechanised clearance cairn.JPG|thumb|A clearance cairn formed using mechanised extraction]]
[[File:Recent Clearance Cairn.JPG|left|thumb|A recent clearance cairn devoid of lichen and moss growth]]
Cairns may be discrete, in large groups (cairnfields) or as linear formations—linear cairns. Many stones in clearance cairns show plough-marks or [[Ard (plough)|ard-marks]] at various angles to each other, typical of the Bronze Age ploughing methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/cladh-hallan/cladh-hallan02.html Ard-marks at Cladh Hallan]&lt;/ref&gt; These ard-marks indicate that the boulders were obstructing the ploughing process and were in situ for some time before removal.

Other items such as  [[bog-wood]] and grubbed out tree stumps were sometimes added to the cairns as a result of tree felling and the process of creation of pasture from woodland. Bog-wood stumps and trunks can be thousands of years old, are darker in colour due to the [[tannin]]s from the peat and do not show typical wood decomposition characteristics due to their preservation within peat bogs. The absence of saw marks indicates felling using axes, providing further information about the age of the wood involved.

Some clearance cairns are linear in form. Many of the smaller cairns were probably created by family groups, whilst larger ones would have required organised labour.&lt;ref name="Cairns1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clearance+cairns&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QVXw2Um-V9&amp;sig=XnLom3YjVvZ4GYAOFhlh0JiwEeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Construction of cairns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairnfields have on occasions been confused with various other classes of monuments, such as round barrow cemeteries and groups of [[round barrow]]s, stone [[hut circle]]s, [[ring cairn]]s, or [[burnt mound]]s. In general round barrows are larger, more regular, and may contain visible traces of a cist or kerb; stone hut circles have distinct entrances; ring cairns have a hollow centre; and burnt mounds contain a high proportion of fire-crazed stones of rather smaller size than appear in the average clearance cairns within cairnfields.

Natural deposits such as so called 'clitter agglomerates',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm Clitter cairns.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605235806/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; moraines can also on occasion look rather similar to groups of clearance cairns, but their context, position and regular form usually betrays their true origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm Monument Class descriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605235806/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearance cairn material is often heterogeneous, typically consisting of both edged and rounded small stones, sometimes mixed with sand, clay or silt, lifted from the field nearby. Agricultural and clearance cairns are sometimes located on slopes, whilst burial cairns rarely are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514268024/html/c589.html Burial Cairns in Finland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearance cairns constructed using mechanised methods with horse or motor powered assistance may appear superficially similar, however the stones are generally much larger and they are more randomly tipped rather than hand placed.

== Natural history ==
Due to the age and 'abandoned' state of many clearance cairns they are often good sites for the growth and survival of lichens, mosses, ferns and other plants; the actual species being dependent on the rock type. Cairns are relatively undisturbed and emulate old walls for the micro-habitats they produce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723055822/http://www.brrhoen.de/en/23-plants Plants on cairns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape history ==
In some areas which are now unproductive moorland, aerial photographs show the presence of numerous prehistoric clearance cairns and associated dwellings such as hut-circles. This clear evidence of previous ancient habitation and cultivation shows that the climate worsened until the farmers were forced to move to lower ground.&lt;ref name="Wickham-Jones"&gt;Wickham-Jones, C. R. (2009), ''The Landscape of Scotland''. Stroud : The History Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-1484-3}}. pp. 48 – 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stone carrying ==
[[Lifting stone|Stone carry]] or the stone walk is a traditional Scottish athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition; the competitors pick up two heavy stones with iron handles, and carry the pair as far as they can. The sport may have grown out of the act of clearing stones from fields to create pastures and arable land.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">'''Mental state''' is generally a literary or legal term, and is only used in [[psychiatry]] or [[psychology]] as the mental state examination, where  it refers to the condition of someone's mind. Here there is an assessment of thought processes, memory, mood, [[cognitive]] state, and energy level. Where a mental state is shared by a large proportion of the members of a group or society, it can be called a collective mental state. [[Gustave Le Bon]] proposed that mental states are passed by [[Infectious disease|contagion]], while [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote of [[war fever]] in his work ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1922), a perfect example of the collective mental state. [[Franz Borkenau]] wrote of collective madness, while many writers have discussed [[collective depression]]. [[Psychosis]] can be passed from one individual to another as induced psychosis or ''folie à deux'', but rarely involves more than two people. Where the mental state involves a large population, it is more appropriate to use plain English rather than psychiatric or psychological terminology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">"'''Common prostitute'''" is a term used in [[English law]] related to [[prostitution]]. The term was first used in the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]]. The term continued to be used in the [[Street Offences Act 1959]] which maintained the illegality of street prostitution. Section 1 stated: "It shall be an offence for a common prostitute to loiter or solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Street+Offences+Act+1959%2c&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=1127916&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SortAlpha=0  Street Offences Act 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was widely regarded as archaic, stigmatising, and offensive, and a number of failed attempts had been made since the 1920s to enact new legislation which would replace the wording with a solicitation law that applied to both sexes equally, and did not create an offence that could only be committed by a special class of person.
 
In 2007 the government announced that it would introduce new legislation which would eliminate the use of the term, and replace it with new language which would apply equally to males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''conservation and restoration of totem poles''' is a relatively new topic in the field of [[Art Conservation and Restoration|art conservation]]. Those who are custodians of [[totem pole]]s include [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities, [[museum]]s, [[Cultural Heritage Center|cultural heritage centers]], parks or [[national park]]s, camp grounds or those that belong to individuals. Conservation activities include the historical research and context of totem poles, studying materials and manufacture, performing assessments, documentation and treatments. This field can pertain to [[conservator-restorer]]s, Native Americans, [[museum curator|curators]], [[collection manager]]s, [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[park ranger]]s and city planners.

==History==
In the field of [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|Conservation of Cultural Heritage]], the [[totem pole]] is categorized as a wooden object. Although totem poles are generally identified as wooden objects, there are more complex ideologies associated with them. Totem poles "are more than works of art; they embody the culture of the Native peoples of the Pacific Northwest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Todd|first1=Andrew|title=Painted Wood: History and Conservation.|journal=Painted Memory, Painted Totems|date=1998|pages=410–428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, conservators must regard the communities from which the poles originated prior to performing any type of assessment or conservation treatment. Totem poles can pose ethical issues in the practice of conservation. These issues may be; spiritual or ceremonial that concern their original communities, or related to provenance. "In recent years more attention has been focused on understanding the perspective of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture in regards to totem poles, especially by conservators. Instead of approaching the conservation of a totem pole with mere intellect some have turned to understanding the spiritual and ceremonial significance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhyne|first1=Charles S.|title=Changing Approaches to the Conservation of Northwest Coast Totem Poles|journal=Tradition and Innovation: Advances in Conservation Contributions to the Melbourne Congress|date=October 10, 2000|pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In [[Anthropology|anthropological]] terms, totem poles are visible proof of family lineages".&lt;ref name="PaintedWoodPP400-411"&gt;Todd (1998). pp. 400-411.&lt;/ref&gt; The Totem Pole began being collected by many anthropologists and museums in the late 1800s and early 1900s, thus removing them from their original contexts. Many totem poles originate from Alaska and Canada. Over the last decade, the care and conservation of poles has been a newly developing subject as many museums around the world now hold poles within their collections. In order for conservators to understand the care needed for poles, they must study the methods by which they have been created.

==Materials used for manufacture==
Totem poles are made from [[Western Red Cedar]] and are made from one large cedar log. Poles are carved by hand, using tools such as an axe, [[chisel]]s, gouges and [[adze]]s. Poles can take anywhere between 6 months up to a year to complete. The time to complete a pole can depend on the size of the pole, the amount of time spent and the experience of the carver. Totem poles can either be painted or unpainted. If painted, paints can either be manufactured or made from mineral pigments. The traditional colors used include red, black, yellow, green and blue. "The red was obtained from [[hematite]], the black from graphite and carbon and green/blue from various copper ores".&lt;ref name="PaintedWoodPP400-411" /&gt;

==Agents of deterioration==
Totem poles can be either displayed outdoors or indoors. Agents of deterioration that can impact totem poles are direct sunlight, moisture, fire, infestation, pollutants, fluctuating temperatures, [[relative humidity]] and theft and vandalism. Outdoor poles that are exposed to agents of deterioration are affected year round by rain, pollutants, infestation and biological growth and light. The areas where totem poles originate from have a heavy annual accumulation of rainfall. "Therefore, the major problem of outdoor totem poles is deterioration at the paint-wood surface"&lt;ref&gt;Todd (1998). p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; When it rains, the moisture can become trapped in the space between the paint and the wood and can cause deterioration. Direct sunlight can cause paint colors to fade and [[patina]]. Fluctuating temperatures, weather and [[relative humidity]] can cause the pole to crack or check. When it rains, the pole can absorb moisture and then the pole swells. "Because wood always remains hydroscopic: it absorbs moisture into its cell walls as relative humidity rises and releases water back into the atmosphere as relative humidity falls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Kostanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-56098-174-9 |pages=115–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption and releasing of moisture back into the atmosphere can cause the wood to shrink and swell which causes the cracking and checking of wood.

Because totem poles are created from an organic material they can be a place of habitat for many diverse species. They can become an ideal home for many insects such as wasps, bees, carpenter ants or termites. In addition, poles make great homes for birds as many nests have been found at the top of poles. Biological growth can develop on the exterior or interior of poles. "Biological growth has contributed to structural deterioration of the wood".&lt;ref&gt;Todd (1998). p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of biological growth can include moss, [[lichen]]s, root systems and plants.

Over the past decade some totem poles have been known to be stolen while on display outdoors. An 18-foot pole was stolen from a park in West Seattle, Washington by a man who had the vision of installing it in his front yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flandro |first1=Carly |title=Tracking the Tale of the Stolen Totem Pole |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/tracking-the-tale-of-the-stolen-totem-pole/ |accessdate=20 November 2015 |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pole was later recovered, along with another pole that was stolen from a nearby town and erected again back in the park. In addition to being looted, poles have been vandalized. On May 17, 1977, entrance poles to the Tulalip Indian Reservation in the State of Washington were cut down with a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vandals Cut Totem Poles |publisher=Marysville Globe |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation treatments==
Prior to performing any conservation work, a condition assessment is performed. During an assessment the conservator identifies the materials used for the object and how the object was constructed. "In assessing the condition of a piece, it is also important to consider the factors that may have contributed to its present condition-former use, cultural modifications, previous environments, prior treatments, as well as storage and/or display conditions".&lt;ref name="ConservationConcernsP140"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bachmann |editor1-first=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=978-1-56098-174-9 |pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an assessment, time "may be spent photographing, taking condition notes, measuring cracks and probing the wood with an ice pick".&lt;ref name="Carlee"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carlee |first1=Ellen |title=Totem Pole Maintenance |url=https://ellencarrlee.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/totem-pole-maintenance/ |website=Ellen Carlee Conservation |publisher=Wordpress |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the assessment, a treatment plan is developed. The treatment plan will depend on the plan or outcome of the pole such as indoor exhibition, storage our outdoor display. "Decisions about appropriate treatments and methods of preservation for individual artifacts therefore should be made by a conservator in consultation with experts in the culture".&lt;ref name="ConservationConcernsP140" /&gt; Conservation goals for totem poles can include stabilization of materials such as wood, paint or loose joints, removal of biological growth, surface cleaning, application of a water or insect repellents, removal of decayed wood, stabilizing of totem at base and in some cases the removal of the totem pole. Conservators who perform treatments on a pole document any work performed via photographs or written notes. A surface cleaning is a common treatment by conservators. The surface cleaning is generally performed with a low-suction vacuum, soft brushes, mild detergent and soft sponges. Cleanings are important for removing any dirt, grime, grease, pollution or dust from the pole's surface. It is recommended by conservators to start at the top and work your way down. Scaffolding or a lift is used with taller poles.

Another treatment done by conservators is the removal of biological growth. Conservators often use scrapers such as popsicle sticks or bamboo skewers to scrape off the surface. Sometimes poles may have trees, roots or grass growing inside of them. In this situation, "it is probably better to cut the growth off flush with the wood, since pulling out big roots can cause more damage and create empty space for water to pool".&lt;ref name=Carlee/&gt;

Another example of a treatment often performed by conservators is the consolidation of the pole's surface which can be performed in a variety of methods. In a paper presented at the 42nd annual [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute of Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works]] discusses the utilization of Butvar B-98 and Paraloid B-72 as the selected adhesives for consolidating splinters and detached fragments. Another method for consolidating wood is with the use of [[epoxy]]. Epoxy is a method for adhering smaller fragments of wood or larger wood fragments such as wings, beaks or fins of animals. "Epoxy repairs are difficult to reverse without harming the wood, and skill and experience are required to select and apply epoxies, bulking agents and tinting products".&lt;ref name=Carlee/&gt; Materials used to consolidate paint surfaces are Acryloid B-72 in acetone which is applied with a brush. Last, a necessary and common treatment is an insect treatment. A product often used by conservators for infestation is Bora-care. This product is ingested by insects and impedes their ability to digest and thus starves them to death.

==Maintenance==
If one is the custodian of a pole, it is recommended to develop a maintenance plan. It is preferable to have the maintenance performed by a professional conservator. "The maintenance of a pole can include the removal of vegetation and an application of a water repellent. During a maintenance routine check, the stability of the base of the pole is tested. The base of the pole is checked for rot and decay and can be done with a resistograph. "The resistograph uses a very fine drill bit 20" long which gives graphic chart readings as it penetrates the wood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheetz |first1=Ron |title=Preservation Assessment of Totem Poles |journal=Totem Bight State Historical Park |date=May 11–21, 2008 |page=7 in 1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing the density of the base is important to ensure the safety of the public so the pole does not fall down. In addition to checking for decay and stability, any loose fragments can be repaired or removed. Last, any type of insect or biological growth can be documented and treated. Photographs and documentation help keep track of the condition of the pole throughout the years.

==Preventative conservation== 
It is difficult to mitigate against agents of deterioration such as rain, sunlight or fluctuating temperatures when a pole is displayed outdoors. It is important to follow a strict maintenance program to minimize future deterioration. The management of moisture is important for preservation. One method that has been used to prevent absorption of water at the end grain of the wood is through the fabrication of a custom fitting cap. Caps can be made with copper sheeting or sheet lead. One concern conservators have posed with the use of caps, is the potential of moisture getting trapped underneath. Poles that were capped in Sitka Historical Park in Sitka, Alaska "were found in much better condition than the poles that were not capped".&lt;ref name=Carlee/&gt;

It is recommended that if poles are stored or displayed indoors, then they should have minimal exposure to direct lighting sources. Many museums install [[UV filter]]s when poles are on display indoors. Other recommendations for indoor storage include a climate-controlled environment, no food or beverages in the vicinity of any poles, a 24-hour security system and having active security guards on duty. Last, museums typically have a barrier between the visitor and the object on display. Continual touching of a pole can cause irreversible damage such as the absorption of skin oil into the wood.

==Restoration== 
There have been previous cases where restoration of a totem pole takes place in lieu of the preservation of existing materials. Restoration practices can include the replacement of wood or repainting. Many cases of the repainting of poles most often occurred only when the original paint patterns were known. It is also recommended if any type of repainting or replacement of fragments of the pole is to take place, it should involve the consulting with the appropriate Native carver or carvers.

}}
'''Cosmeston Medieval Village''' is a "living history" medieval village near [[Lavernock]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] not far from [[Penarth]] and [[Cardiff]] in south [[Wales]]. Based upon remains discovered during a 1980s [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig in the grounds of [[Cosmeston Lakes Country Park]], it is a re-creation of 14th century peasant life in [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages]].

The reconstructed village regularly plays host to groups of [[historical reenactment|reenactors]], who camp in authentic tents around the outskirts of the village, and perform displays of [[medieval warfare|historical combat]] for the public.

==History==

===Early medieval===
The original Cosmeston village grew around a [[fortified manor house]] constructed sometime around the 12th century by the De Costentin family, who were among the first [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman invasion of Wales|invaders of Wales]] in the early 12th century following [[William the Conqueror]]'s invasion of neighbouring England in 1066. It is unlikely that the manor house at the site was a substantial building and there is documentary evidence that by 1437 the manor house had already fallen into total ruin. Its precise site has just been located. The village would have consisted of a number of small stone round houses, or crofts, with [[thatching|thatched]] roofs, as depicted in the current reconstruction, and the village population would have been between 50 and 100 people at most, including children.

The de Costentin family originated on the Cotentin peninsula in northern [[France]]. They were the first lords of the manor and they called the village Costentinstune, which over time became known as Cosmeston. They built the original manor house and, perhaps, a few dwellings or small farms, but for the next two centuries it appears that little further development occurred.

===Later medieval period===
Around 1316 the manor passed into the hands of the de Caversham family, also of [[Normans|Norman]] descent.

The buildings that have been excavated so far seem to be from the 14th century. It would appear that the de Caversham family brought a more designed approach to the development of the community and a better regulated and more compact settlement began to develop during their stewardship of the village.

There is little sign that the village continued to develop much past the later [[middle ages]]. Unusually, no Norman church was ever established in the immediate area, so by 1824 all that remained of Cosmeston village were four isolated crofts and the Little Cosmeston Farmhouse as shown on the [[Marquis of Bute]]'s detailed maps of the time. It is quite possible that the majority of the villagers were wiped out during the [[Black Death]] plague of the 1340s or the later outbreaks, leaving Cosmeston a [[Deserted medieval village]].

In addition to the plague, the villagers would have had to combat other difficulties. The land is low-lying and at the mercy of the many water sources that now feed the Cosmeston Lake. There is substantial evidence of drainage dykes, but even they would have struggled to keep the arable land free from waterlogging and constant flooding. Additionally the period was one of permanent political upheaval with intermittent resistance and armed conflict between several local Welsh leaders.  In January 1316, for instance, [[Llywelyn Bren]] attacked [[Caerphilly Castle]], and for the next two months there was conflict and devastation throughout the Glamorgan region.

===Modern history===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Cosmeston Medieval Village.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmeston village]] --&gt;
By the 20th century all evidence of the village had vanished and local residents had no idea of its previous existence. When the Snocem Concrete works and the Cosmeston limestone quarry closed in 1970, the land was developed under [[Countryside Commission]] funding as a [[country park]]. During the landscaping of the new country park the [[earthworks (archaeology)|first evidence]] of the medieval village was unearthed and an [[excavation (archaeology)|archeological exploration]] was undertaken.

The resulting heritage reconstruction has been described as the best representation of a medieval village currently available in Britain. In addition to being open to the general public, the village accepts school tours and archeological groups, together with staging of special events and [[medieval reenactment|re-enactment]]s throughout the year.

===The present===
Cosmeston has been used as a film location for many productions, including a 2014 episode of the hit BBC TV drama series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' and ''[[Galavant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishfilmcommission.org.uk/uk-based-abc-series-galavant-to-premiere-on-sunday|title=British Film Commission - Galavant to premiere on Sunday|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named after the English biochemist Herbert Grace Crabtree, the '''Crabtree effect''' describes the phenomenon whereby the yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', produces [[ethanol]] (alcohol) in aerobic conditions and high external [[glucose]] concentrations rather than producing biomass via the [[TCA cycle|tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle]], the usual process occurring aerobically in most yeasts e.g. ''[[Kluyveromyces]] spp''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''.''

'''''Dataflow''''' is a term used in [[computing]] which has various meanings depending on application and the context in which the term is used. In the context of [[software architecture]], data flow relates to [[stream processing]] or [[reactive programming]].

==Software architecture==
Dataflow is a software paradigm based on the idea of disconnecting computational actors into stages (pipelines) that can execute concurrently. Dataflow can also be called [[stream processing]] or [[reactive programming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathanbeard.io/blog/2015/09/19/streaming-and-dataflow.html A Short Intro to Stream Processing]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been multiple data-flow/stream processing languages of various forms (see [[Stream processing]]). Data-flow hardware (see [[Dataflow architecture]]) is an alternative to the classic [[Von Neumann architecture]]. The most obvious example of data-flow programming is the subset known as [[reactive programming]] with spreadsheets. As a user enters new values, they are instantly transmitted to the next logical "actor" or formula for calculation.

[[Distributed data flow]]s have also been proposed as a programming abstraction that captures the dynamics of distributed multi-protocols. The data-centric perspective characteristic of data flow programming promotes high-level functional specifications and simplifies formal reasoning about system components.

==Hardware architecture==
{{main|Dataflow architecture}}
Hardware architectures for dataflow was a major topic in [[Computer architecture]] research in the 1970s and early 1980s. [[Jack Dennis]] of [[MIT]] pioneered the field of static dataflow architectures. Designs that use conventional memory addresses as data dependency tags are called static dataflow machines. These machines did not allow multiple instances of the same routines to be executed simultaneously because the simple tags could not differentiate between them. Designs that use [[Content-addressable memory]] are called dynamic dataflow machines by [[Arvind (computer scientist)|Arvind]]. They use tags in memory to facilitate parallelism.
Data flows around the computer through the components of the computer. It gets entered from the input devices and can leave through output devices (printer etc.).

==Concurrency==
A dataflow network is a network of concurrently executing processes or automata that can communicate by sending data over ''channels'' (see [[message passing]].)

In [[Kahn process networks]], named after [[Gilles Kahn]], the processes are ''determinate''. This implies that each determinate process computes a [[continuous function]] from input streams to output streams, and that a network of determinate processes is itself determinate, thus computing a continuous function. This implies that the behavior of such networks can be described by a set of recursive equations, which can be solved using [[fixed point theory]]. The movement and transformation of the data is represented by a series of shapes and lines.

'''Eucrites''' are [[achondrite|achondritic]] stony [[meteorite]]s, many of which originate from the surface of the [[asteroid]] [[4 Vesta]] and as such are part of the [[HED meteorite]] clan. They are the most common achondrite group with well over 100 distinct finds at present.

Eucrites consist of [[basalt]]ic rock from the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of [[4 Vesta]] or a similar parent body. They are mostly composed of [[Calcium|Ca]]-poor [[pyroxene]], [[pigeonite]], and [[Calcium|Ca]]-rich [[plagioclase]] ([[anorthite]]).&lt;ref&gt;B. Mason: Meteorites. John Wiley, New York 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on differences of chemical composition and features of the component crystals, they are subdivided into several groups:&lt;ref&gt;Mittlefehldt, McCoy, Goodrich and Kracher: Non-chondritic Meteorites from Asteroidal Bodies, In: Reviews in Mineralogy Vol. 36, Planetary Materials, Mineralogical Society of America, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Non-cumulate eucrites''' Are the most common variety and can be subdivided further:
** '''Main series eucrites''' formed near the surface and are mostly, though not exclusively,  [[regolith]] [[breccia]]s [[lithification|lithified]] under the pressure of overlying newer deposits.
** '''Stannern trend eucrites''' are a rare variety.
** '''Nuevo Laredo trend eucrites''' are thought to come from deeper layers of 4 Vesta's crust, and are a transition group towards the cumulate eucrites.
* '''Cumulate eucrites''' are rare types with oriented crystals, thought to have solidified in magma chambers deep within [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]'s crust.
* '''Polymict eucrites''' are [[regolith]] [[breccia]]s consisting of mostly eucrite fragments and less than one part in ten of [[diogenite]], an arbitrary dividing line from the [[howardite]]s, which are related in structure. They are comparably rare.

==Etymology==
Eucrites get their name from the Greek word ''eukritos'' meaning "easily distinguished". This refers to the silicate minerals in them, which can be easily distinguished because of their relatively large grain size. 

Eucrite is also a now obsolete term for [[bytownite]]-[[gabbro]], an [[igneous rock]] formed in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The term was used as a rock type name for some of the [[Paleogene]] igneous rocks of [[Geology of Scotland|Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, D. S. (1982) ''Igneous Rocks of the British Isles'', Chichester, John Wiley, page 536.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunications]], a '''field strength meter''' is an instrument that measures the [[electric field strength]] emanating from a [[transmitter]].

==The relation between the electric field and the transmitted power==

In ideal free space, the [[field strength in free space|electric field strength]] produced by a [[transmitter]] with an [[isotropic radiator]] is readily calculated.&lt;ref&gt; ''Reference Data for Radio Engineers'', Howard W.Sams Co.Inc.,{{ISBN|0-672-21218-8}}, p 27-7&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{E} = \frac{ \sqrt{30 \cdot P}}{d}&lt;/math&gt; 

where
:'''E''' is the electric field strength in volts per meter
:'''P''' is the [[transmitter power output]] in watts
:'''d''' is the distance from the radiator in meters

The factor &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{30} &lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{Z_0}{4\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_0=119.9169832\pi&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[impedance of free space]]. &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the symbol for [[ohm]]s.

It is clear that [[electric field strength]] is inversely proportional to the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. However, this relation is impractical for calculating the [[field strength]] produced by terrestrial transmitters, where reflections and [[attenuation]] caused by objects around the transmitter or receiver may affect the electrical field strength considerably.

==Field strength meter== 
Field strength meter is actually a simple receiver. After a [[Tuner (electronics)|tuner]] circuit, the signal is detected and fed to a [[microammeter]], which is scaled in '''dBμ'''. The frequency range of the tuner is usually within the terrestrial broadcasting bands. Some FS meters can also receive satellite ([[TVRO]] and RRO) frequencies. Most modern FS meters have [[audio frequency|AF]] and [[Composite video|VF]] circuits and can be used as standard receivers. Some FS meters are also equipped with printers to record received field strength.

==Antennas==
When measuring with a field strength meter it is important to use a calibrated antenna such as the standard antenna supplied with the meter. For precision measurements the antenna must be at a standard height.  A value of standard height frequently employed for VHF and UHF measurements is {{convert|10|m}}.  Gain correction tables may be provided with the meter, that take into account the change of [[antenna gain]] with [[radio frequency|frequency]].

==Minimum field strength criteria==
The [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] defines the minimum field strength for satisfactory reception. These are shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;K.H.Kaltbeitzer: ''Technical Monograph 3104'', EBU Technical Centre, 1965, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; (Band II is reserved for FM radio broadcasting and the other bands are reserved for [[TV transmitter|TV broadcasting]].)

Sir '''Peter Francis Lewis Bourgeois''' [[Royal Academy|RA]] (November 1753 – 8 January 1811) was a British  [[landscape art|landscape]] and history painter, and court painter to king [[George III of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Redgrave, Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Redgrave|chapter=Bourgeois, Sir Francis|title=A dictionary of artists of the English school|year=1878|pages=49–50|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t3613cq79;view=1up;seq=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SIR FRANCIS BOURGEOIS, R.A.|journal=The Art Journal|year=1891|volume=43|pages=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbghAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA344}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an art dealer and collector in association with [[Margaret Desenfans|Margaret]] and Noel Desenfans, and with them founded [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] in London.  

==Biography==
Bourgeois was born in London in November 1753 (or, according to Royal Academy records, in 1756). He was the son of Isaac Emanuel Bourgeois, a prosperous emigre Swiss watchmaker, and Elizabeth Bourgeois (née Gordon or Garden). He had a sister. In 1768, when he was fifteen, his mother died and he and his sister were abandoned by their father. Some time afterwards he was taken into the protection of Noel Joseph Desenfans, a writer who had come from France to Britain in 1769.

Bourgeois studied painting as a pupil of [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. In 1776, at the age of 23, Bourgeois made a tour of Europe. When in Warsaw he met bishop [[Michal Jerzy Poniatowski]], primate of Poland and brother of the Polish king, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanislaw II]].

In the same year his protector Noel Desenfans married Margaret Morris, an heiress and sister of the Swansea industrialist, [[Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet|John Morris]]. By the 1780s Margaret and Noel Desenfans were collecting pictures and discreetly dealing. Bourgeois lived with them at their house in Charlotte (now Hallam) Street, London.

In December 1787 Bourgeois was elected an Associate of the [[Royal Academy]] and was elected a full member on 11 February 1793, when he donated a landscape painting as his diploma work.

In 1791 Bourgeois's friend, Michal Poniatowski visited London to commission Bourgeois to paint a portrait of king [[Stanisław II August Poniatowski|Stanislaw]] (now in [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]). For this Bourgeois was presented with the Polish medal "Merentibus", for which George III allowed him to use the title of 'Sir' in Britain. While in London Poniatowski asked Noel and Margaret Desenfans and Bourgeois to assemble a royal collection for Poland. During the next five years Bourgeois joined Margaret and Noel Desenfans touring Europe and buying pictures and continued his own painting In 1794 he was appointed landscape-painter to George III.

The collection assembled for King Stanislaw included works by Vernet, Rembrandt, Veronese and others. In 1795 Desenfans was appointed Polish consul general in London; but a few months later Stanislaw was forced to abdicate and the dealers were left with the collection. Their attempts to sell it to Alexander I of Russia or the [[British Government]] proved unsuccessful and in 1799 Desenfans published a ''Plan''&lt;ref&gt;N. J. Desenfans, ''A Plan, Preceded By A Short Review Of The Fine Arts, To Preserve Among Us, And To Transmit To Posterity, The Portraits Of The Most Distinguished Characters ... Also, To give Encouragement to British Artists, and to enrich and adorn London with some Galleries of Pictures, Statues ... Without any Expence to Government'' (1799)&lt;/ref&gt; for establishing some national galleries in Britain, of which the collection might form a basis, and in 1802 he exhibited the collection in London with a sale ''Catalogue''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Descriptive Catalogue (With Remarks And Anecdotes Never Before Published In English) Of Some Pictures Of The Different Schools, Purchased For His Majesty The Late King Of Poland; Which will be exhibited early in 1802 ... By Noel Desenfans ...'' (2nd. ed., 2 vols. 1802)&lt;/ref&gt; The collection remained unsold. Bourgeois shared the Desenfans' wish that the collection should be exhibited publicly, and when he died in 1811 he left it to [[Dulwich College]] with £10,000 to build a public gallery.  [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] - one of the first public art galleries anywhere in Britain was founded. The gallery was designed by Sir [[John Soane]], who also designed the attached mausoleum, in which  Bourgeois, Margaret Desenfans and Nöel Desenfans rest in sealed coffins (visible on request).

A portrait of Bourgeois by [[William Beechey]] is in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] and another by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]] is at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]. [[George Dance the Younger]] made a pencil portrait of him, and he is included in H. Singleton's ''The Royal Academicians in general assembly 1795'' (at the Royal Academy of Arts, London).

Family members of Francis Bourgeois included Victor H. Bourgeois (1864&amp;ndash;1935) and Louise Forget-Bourgeois (1830&amp;ndash;1914).

A '''garden square''' is a type of [[communal garden]] in an urban area wholly or substantially surrounded by buildings and, commonly, continues to be applied to public and private parks formed after such a garden becomes accessible to the public at large. The archetypal garden square is surrounded by tall [[terraced houses]] and other types of [[townhouse]]. It is subtly distinguished from a public-access version throughout the existence of the square &amp;ndash; the [[town square]].  Due to its inherent private history it may have a pattern of dedicated [[footpath]]s and tends to have considerably more plants than hard surfaces and/or large monuments. 

==Propagation==
{{see also|Town square}}
At their conception in the early 17th century each such garden was a private [[commons|communal amenity]] for the residents of the overlooking houses akin to a garden [[courtyard]] within a palace or community. Such community courtyards date back to at least [[Ur]] in 2000 BC where two-storey houses were built of fired brick around an open square. [[Kitchen]], working, and public spaces were located on the ground floor, with private rooms located upstairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YvpfndOKwGgC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Tim McNeese (1999), ''History of Civilization - The Ancient World'', Lorenz Educational Press, p. 10] {{ISBN|9780787703875}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The conversion of many during the 20th century into public parks renders those garden squares a subset of town squares, that is those with a garden square heritage. Some remain private &amp;mdash; they may open intermittently or regularly &amp;mdash; but many today are open to the public at least during part of every day, serving as small parks.

==Occurrence==
===Europe===
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
====United Kingdom====
London is famous for them; they are described as one of the glories of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7881665/Court-denies-couple-use-of-garden-square.html "Court denies couple use of garden square"], Martin Evans, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 10 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were built or rebuilt during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, at the height of [[Georgian architecture]], and are surrounded by [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|elegant townhouses]]. Large projects, such as the [[Bedford Estate]], included garden squares in their development. The [[Notting Hill]] and [[Bloomsbury]] neighbourhoods both have many garden squares, with the former mostly still restricted to residents, and the latter open to all.  Other UK cities prominent in the Georgian era such as [[Edinburgh]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Bristol]] and [[Leeds]] have several garden squares.

Householders with access to a private garden square are commonly required to pay a maintenance levy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/councilanddemocracy/counciltax/gardensquarelevies.aspx Council tax and garden square levies], [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the charge is set annually by a garden committee. 

Sometimes private garden squares are opened to the public, such as during Open Garden Squares Weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensquares.org/ Open Garden Squares Weekend], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
=====In Paris=====
Privately owned squares which survived the decades after the [[French Revolution]] and 19th century [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]] include the [[Place des Vosges]] and [[Square des Épinettes]] in Paris. It was a fashionable and expensive square to live in during the 17th and 18th centuries, and one of the central reasons that [[Le Marais]] district became so fashionable for French nobility.  It was inaugurated in 1612 with a grand ''[[carrousel]]'' to celebrate the engagement of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] to [[Anne of Austria]] and is a prototype of the residential squares of European cities that were to come. What was new about the ''Place Royale'' as it was known in 1612 was that the house fronts were all built to the same design, probably by [[Baptiste du Cerceau]].

In town squares, similarly green but publicly accessible from the outset, is the [[Square René Viviani]]. Gardens substantially cover a few of the famous ''Places'' in the capital; instead the majority are paved and replete with profoundly hard materials such as [[Place de la Concorde]].  Inspired by ecological interests and a 21st century focus on pollution mitigation, an increasing number of the Places in Paris today many have a focal tree, or surrounding raised flower beds/and or rows of trees such as the [[Place de la République]].  

The enclosed garden terraces (''French: jardins en terrain'') and courtyards (''French: cours'') of some [[List_of_palaces#France|French former palaces]] have resulted in redevelopments into spaces equivalent to garden squares.  The same former single-owner scenario applies to at least one garden square in London ([[Squares_in_London#West_and_southwest|Coleridge Square]]).

=====Outside of Paris=====
Grandiose instances of garden-use town squares are a part of many French cities, others opt for solid material town squares.  

===Belgium===
The Square de Meeûs and Square Orban are notable examples in Brussels. 

===Ireland===
Dublin has several Georgian examples, including [[Merrion Square]].

====United States====
[[Rittenhouse Square]] in the [[Center City, Philadelphia]] encases a public garden, one of the five original open-space parks planned by William Penn and his surveyor Thomas Holme during the late 17th century. It was first named Southwest Square.

Nearby [[Fitler Square]] is a similar garden square named for late 19th century Philadelphia mayor Edwin Henry Fitler shortly after his death in 1896. The Square, cared for through a public private partnership between the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Fitler Square Improvement Association.

In [[Boston]] tens of squares exist, some having a mainly residential use.

'''Generación de la Ruptura''' ('''Breakaway Generation''') is the name given by art critic [[Teresa del Conde]]&lt;ref&gt;Teresa del Conde, “La aparición de la Ruptura”, en ''Un siglo de arte mexicano 1900-2000'', Italia, CNCA, INBA, Landucci Editores, 1999, pp. 187-212.&lt;/ref&gt; to the generation of Mexican artists against the established [[Mexican muralism|Mexican School of Painting, more commonly called Mexican muralism]] post [[World War II]]. It began with the criticisms of [[José Luis Cuevas]] in the early 1950s, followed by others who thought the established art had become dogmatic, formulaic and nationalistic and the artists too deferential to the government. This new generation of artists was not bound by a particular artistic style but was more interested in personal rather than social issues and influenced by a number of international trends in art such as [[Abstract expressionism]]. Early reaction to them was strong and negative but by the end of the 1950s, they had succeeded in having their art shown in the major venues of Mexico. The Generación de la Ruptura had influence on other arts in Mexico, such as literature but it did not end the production of murals in Mexico with social and nationalist purposes.

==Mexican muralism as antecedent==
From the 1920s to the beginning of the 1950s, the dominant painting style was what it is academically known as the ''Escuela Mexicana de la Pintura'' (Mexican School of Painting) also popularly known as "Mexican muralism." Mexican muralism came up to be from the convergence of the ideals of then-Mexico’s painters and the need of a post [[Mexican Revolution]] government to promote their ideas.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social ideals pursued the glorification of Mexico's mestizo identity.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The main representatives of this movement were [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

==Rise of the Generación de la Ruptura==
[[Image:Chivo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chivo ([[Goat]]) by [[Francisco Toledo]]]]
Despite the opposition from established artistic and official circles, the young generation of the post-WWII era continued to challenge the status quo. They named themselves the ''"Joven Escuela de Pintura Mexicana"'' (Young School of Mexican Painting) but in the end the name “Generación de la Ruptura” (The Breakaway Generation) stuck.&lt;ref name="decadencia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=1609&amp;id_seccion=6419&amp;id_subseccion=1416&amp;id_documento=540 |title=El Movimiento Muralista Mexicano La Decadencia |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Mexican Muralist Movement – The Decline |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209235510/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=1609&amp;id_seccion=6419&amp;id_subseccion=1416&amp;id_documento=540# |archive-date=2012-12-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early exhibitions of their art were mostly ignored by cultural authorities making it difficult for these artists to pursue their art.&lt;ref name="diceque"&gt;{{cite news |title=Felguérez dice que su generación no es de ruptura, sino de apertura universal |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2012/362340/6/felguerez-dice-que-su-generacion-no-es-de-ruptura-sino-de-apertura-universal.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Felguérez says that his generation is not of rupture but of universal opening }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruptura artists were a diverse group, not united by a single artistic movement but only by the belief that "muralism" had run its course.&lt;ref name="decadencia"/&gt; The "Ruptura" criticized old Mexican muralism as being chauvinistic, dogmatic, Manichean, stuck with old formulas, simplistic and being too deferential towards government. For the "Ruptura" artists, muralism had evolved into a nationalistic cult.&lt;ref name="grenier"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grenier |first= Yvon |year=2006 |title=The Politics of Art and Literature in Latin America |journal=Canadian Journal of Latin American &amp; Caribbean Studies |volume=31 |issue=62 |pages=245–258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lilia Carrillo's "Girl in Kitchen".jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lilia Carrillo]]'s "Girl in Kitchen"]]
Historically, the development of art in Mexico has always been intertwined with Europe since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. Many of the old muralist school artist had studied and worked in Europe before their careers in Mexico and the same holds true for the many of ''"Generación de la Ruptura"'' artists. The latter generation were influenced by the various then-new European movements such as Abstract expressionism and [[Cubism]] which rose out of social movements and philosophies of the mid 20th century in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistaunam"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.revistadelauniversidad.unam.mx/1805/pdfs/94-102.pdf |title= Arte entre dos continentes |author= Roberto García Bonilla |work=Revista de la Universidad |publisher=[[UNAM]] |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Art between two continents |accessdate=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''"Ruptura"'' artists abandoned nationalism in favor of internationalism and universalism. Manuel Felguérez says that the aim of the ''"Generación de la Ruptura"'' was not really to “discard” Mexican art but rather to universalize Mexican art.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;

However, the Mexican government controlled many venues where art could be promoted and it was directly censured by the ruling [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] party.&lt;ref name="decadencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amistad"&gt;{{cite news |title= La amistad reúne a generación de la Ruptura |author= Virginia Bautista |url= http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=especial-comunidad-expresiones&amp;cat=60&amp;id_nota=816894 |newspaper=Excélsior |location=Mexico City |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Friendship reunites the Generación de la Ruptura }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's only in the late 1950s into the 1960s when these artists began to exhibit their art at large venues such as the [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]].&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;

The members of this generation of artists include native-born Mexicans and immigrants, many of which were refugees from World War II. Along with José Luis Cuevas, these include Francisco Corzas, [[Fernando García Ponce]], [[Roger Von Gunten]], [[Edmundo Aquino]], [[Francisco Toledo]], [[Arturo Rivera]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Alberto Gironella]], [[Ricardo Martínez]], [[Arnaldo Coen]], [[Lilia Carrillo]], [[Vlady]], [[Manuel Felguérez]], [[Gastón González César]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Generación de la Ruptura]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} [[Myra Landau]], [[Gilberto Aceves Navarro]], [[Gustavo Arias Murueta]], [[Luis López Loza]], Luis Almeida, [[Peggy Espinosa]], [[Adolfo Falcón]], [[Efraín Herrero]], [[Rafael López Castro]], [[Bernardo Recamier]] and [[Pablo Rulfo]]. Of the foreign born Ruptura painters, the most important was [[Vicente Rojo Almazán|Vicente Rojo]] from [[Cataluña]] who reshaped Mexican graphic arts.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistaunam"/&gt;

==Influence of the movement==
The movement had influence in other areas such as literature, with authors such as Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Juan García Ponce and [[Jorge Ibargüengoitia]].&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt; Since the 1950s, the muralism tradition has waned, but it has not ended. While most mural painting in Mexico still has a certain nationalistic purpose, stylistic elements from the Ruptura have been integrated.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;

In addition, literary figure Juan García Ponce was a defender of the movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[José Luis Cuevas]] is considered as the leading artist of the ''"Ruptura"'' (Breakaway) as he was an early and very outspoken critic of the social-realist aesthetics of the Mexican muralist tradition.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Jose Luis Cuevas: un viaje hacia el interior |first= Juan |last= Rodriguez |newspaper=La Opinión |location=Los Angeles |date=September 15, 1995 |page=8E |language=Spanish |trans-title=Jose Luis Cuevas: a voyage to the interior }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite book |title= Performing Mexicanidad : Vendidas y Cabareteras on the Transnational Stage |first= Laura G. |last= Gutiérrez |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX, USA |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-292-72208-8 |page=157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main critiques focus on how the "Muralists" depict the Mexican social composition and lifestyle and how much their works were actually influenced by then-government patronage.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sjsu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gallery.sjsu.edu/mexican_amerixan_tradition/muralists/cuevas.html |title= Jose Luis Cuevas |publisher= San José State University Digital Art Lobby |accessdate= June 2, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121201143020/http://gallery.sjsu.edu/mexican_amerixan_tradition/muralists/cuevas.html# |archive-date= 2012-12-01 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the status quo and his aggressive art style caused extreme reactions towards his work and his own person, including violent public outcries to his work, written insults, personal threats and even a machine-gun attack to his home.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sjsu"/&gt; This has earned him the nickname of ''"l'enfant terrible"'' ("Bad Boy") of Mexican fine arts&lt;ref name="rendiran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Rendirán homenaje al artista plástico José Luis Cuevas |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/832149.html |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=February 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 2, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Will render homage to fine artista José Luis Cuevas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Museo José Luis Cuevas |author= |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/mexico/mexico-city/34335/museo-jose-luis-cuevas/attraction-detail.html |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=June 2, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro Coronel]] was born in Zacatecas achieving fame in the 1950s. His paintings were based on human figures, landscapes or objects with geometrical and colorful presentation.

Günther Gerzo was an abstract painter geometrism insert. All his paintings are large planes of color with geometric shapes. His paintings were very emotional.

Vlady is the pseudonym of a Russian painter, who lived in Cuernavaca, Mexico. He created a new painting technique called impasto. This technique consists of putting big globs of paint on top of another to create the illusion of depth.

[[Remedios Varo]] was a surrealist, not an abstract painter. The kind of painting that she created was based on her wild hallucinations.

[[Alberto Gironella]] was an innovator of his time. His work was so characteristic of him that created a new style called assembly.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This style consisted in creating a work with other parties. He worked with a Spanish theme, because of his background.

[[Mathias Goeritz]] was born in Germany and although it is recognized as an architect and sculptor, studied at the Bauhaus, his inspiration comes from the drawings and art from other artists. His projects are famous such as the Friendship Road to the Olympics in Mexico, held in 1968, the "Big Dipper" at the Palace of Sports and "Satellite Towers" in Mexico.

[[Myra Landau]] (born December 5, 1926) is an artist and painter involved in art research and the first to paint on raw linen. Though born in Bucharest, Romania, , she is known largely for her work while living in Brazil and Mexico. She was married to Miguel Salas Anzures ( head of fine arts, INBA ) who made possible to other ways of artistic expressions and not only the traditional and official art.

[[Gustavo Arias Murueta]] is a Mexican artist dedicated to oil painting, printmaking and drawing. Arias Murueta collaborated with other artists in the realization of a collective mural to support student demands during the 1968 Uprising in Mexico. The mural was a work performed on makeshift corrugated zinc sheets covering the ruins of the monument to Miguel Alemán Valdés .

Vicente Rojo Almazan, was born in Barcelona in 1932. In 1949 he came to Mexico where he studied painting and typography and performed for more than forty years an extensive work as a painter, sculptor, graphic designer and set designer. He has also collaborated in founding publishers, cultural supplements and other applications. In 1991 he received the National Prize for Art and Design Prize Mexico .

'''Haldane's dilemma''' is a limit on the speed of beneficial [[evolution]], first calculated by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1957, and clarified further by later commentators. 

== Substitution cost ==

In the introduction to ''The Cost of Natural Selection'' Haldane writes that it is difficult for breeders to simultaneously select all the desired qualities, partly because the required genes may not be found together in the stock; but, writes Haldane,&lt;ref name=Haldane&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldane | first1 = J.B.S. | year = | title = The Cost of Natural Selection | url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane2.pdf| journal = J. Genet | volume = 55 | issue = 511–524| page = 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;especially in slowly breeding animals such as cattle, one cannot cull even half the females, even though only one in a hundred of them combines the various qualities desired.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, the problem for the cattle breeder is that keeping only the specimens with the desired qualities will lower the reproductive capability too much to keep a useful breeding stock.

Haldane states that this same problem arises with respect to natural selection. [[Genetic correlation|Characters that are positively correlated]] at one time may be negatively correlated at a later time, so simultaneous optimisation of more than one character is a problem also in nature. And, as Haldane writes&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]n this paper I shall try to make quantitative the fairly obvious statement that natural selection cannot occur with great intensity for a number of characters at once unless they happen to be controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In faster breeding species there is less of a problem. Haldane mentions the [[peppered moth]], ''Biston betularia'', whose variation in pigmentation is determined by several [[alleles]] at a single gene.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;ref name="majerus1998"&gt;Majerus, M.E.N. (1998) ''[[Melanism: Evolution in Action]]''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these alleles, "C", is dominant to all the others, and any '''CC''' or  '''Cx''' moths are dark (where "x" is any other allele). Another allele, "c", is recessive to all the others, and '''cc''' moths are light. Against the originally pale [[lichen]]s the darker moths were easier for birds to pick out, but in areas, where pollution has darkened the lichens, the '''cc''' moths had become rare. Haldane mentions that in a single day the frequency of '''cc''' moths might be halved.

Another potential problem is that if "ten other independently inherited characters had been subject to selection of the same intensity as that for colour, only &lt;math&gt;(1/2)^{10}&lt;/math&gt;, or one in 1024, of the original genotype would have survived." The species would most likely have become extinct; but it might well survive ten other selective periods of comparable selectivity, if they happened in different centuries.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== Selection intensity ==

Haldane proceeds to define the ''intensity of selection'' regarding "juvenile survival" (that is, survival to reproductive age) as &lt;math&gt;I = \ln (s_0/S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of those with the optimal genotype (or genotype) that survive to reproduce, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient for the entire population. The quotient of deaths &lt;math&gt;1-S&lt;/math&gt; for the entire population would have been &lt;math&gt;1-s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if all genotypes had survived as well as the optimal, hence &lt;math&gt;s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths due to selection. As Haldane mentions, if &lt;math&gt;s_0 \approx S&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;I \approx s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; – since ln(1) = 0.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== The cost ==

Haldane writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall investigate the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation. One or more genes are rare because their appearance by mutation is balanced by natural selection. A sudden change occurs in the environment, for example, pollution by smoke, a change of climate, the introduction of a new food source, predator, or pathogen, and above all migration to a new habitat. It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the new environment, and its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection. But meanwhile, a number of deaths, or their equivalents in lowered fertility, have occurred. If selection at the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus is responsible for &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; of these deaths in any generation the reproductive capacity of the species will be &lt;math&gt;\prod \left( 1- d_i \right)&lt;/math&gt; of that of the optimal genotype, or &lt;math&gt;\exp \left ( -\sum d_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; nearly, if every &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is small. Thus the intensity of selection approximates to &lt;math&gt;\sum d_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparing to the above, we have that &lt;math&gt;d_i = s_{0i} - S&lt;/math&gt;, if we say that &lt;math&gt;s_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths for the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is again the quotient of deaths for the entire population.

The problem statement is therefore that the [[allele]]s in question are ''not'' particularly beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows for more than one gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.

The total cost of substitution of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; gene is the sum &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; of all values of &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; over all generations of selection; that is, until fixation of the gene. Haldane states that he will show that &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; depends mainly on &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;, the small frequency of the gene in question, as selection begins – that is, at the time that the environmental change occurs (or begins to occur).&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

Let '''A''' and '''a''' be two alleles with frequencies &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation. Their relative fitness is given by&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|-
| width=100 | Genotype
| width=70 | '''AA'''
| width=70 | '''Aa'''
| width=70 | '''aa'''
|-
| Frequency
| &lt;math&gt;p_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2p_nq_n&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;q_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Fitness
| 1
| &lt;math&gt;1 - \lambda K&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 - K&lt;/math&gt;
|}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

If λ = 0, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''AA''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''AA''' ('''A''' dominant), and if λ = 1, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''aa''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''aa''' ('''A''' recessive). In general λ indicates how close in fitness '''Aa''' is to '''aa'''.

The fraction of selective deaths in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation then is

: &lt;math&gt;d_n = 2\lambda Kp_nq_n + Kq_n^2 = Kq_n[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n]&lt;/math&gt;

and the total number of deaths is the population size multiplied by

: &lt;math&gt;D =  K \sum_0^\infin q_n \; [2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n].&lt;/math&gt;

== Important number 300 ==
Haldane approximates the above equation by taking the continuum limit of the above equation.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt; This is done by multiplying and dividing it by dq so that it is in integral form

:&lt;math&gt; dq_n=-Kp_n q_n[\lambda + (1-2 \lambda  )q_n ] &lt;/math&gt;
substituting q=1-p, the cost (given by the total number of deaths, 'D', required to make a substitution) is given by

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}{(1 - q)[\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}dq = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{\lambda(1 - 2\lambda)}{\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q}\right]dq.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming λ &amp;lt; 1, this gives

: &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda - (1 - 2\lambda) p_0}{\lambda}\right)\right] \approx \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda}{\lambda}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the last approximation assumes &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; to be small.

If λ = 1, then we have

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{2 - q}{(1 - q)^2} = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{1}{(1 - q)^2}\right]dq = p_0^{-1} - \mbox{ ln } p_0 + O(\lambda K).&lt;/math&gt;

In his discussion Haldane writes that the substitution cost, if it is paid by juvenile deaths, "usually involves a number of deaths equal to about 10 or 20 times the number in a generation" – the minimum being the population size (= "the number in a generation") and rarely being 100 times that number. Haldane assumes 30 to be the mean value.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

Assuming substitution of genes to take place slowly, one gene at a time over ''n'' generations, the fitness of the species will fall below the optimum (achieved when the substitution is complete) by a factor of about 30/''n'', so long as this is small – small enough to prevent extinction. Haldane doubts that high intensities – such as in the case of the peppered moth – have occurred frequently and estimates that a value of ''n'' = 300 is a probable number of generations. This gives a selection intensity of &lt;math&gt;I = 30/300 = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;.

Haldane then continues:&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of loci in a vertebrate species has been estimated at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at most of them are very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number 300 of generations is a conservative estimate for a slowly evolving species not at the brink of extinction by Haldane's calculation. For a difference of at least 1,000 genes, 300,000 generations might be needed – maybe more, if some gene runs through more than one optimisation.

== Origin of the term "Haldane's dilemma" ==
Apparently the first use of the term "Haldane's dilemma" was by palaeontologist [[Leigh Van Valen]] in his 1963 paper "Haldane's Dilemma, Evolutionary Rates, and Heterosis".

Van Valen writes:&lt;ref name=VanValen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Valen | first1 = Leigh | year = 1963 | title = Haldane's Dilemma, evolutionary rates, and heterosis | url = | journal = Amer. Nat | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 185–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Haldane (1957 [= ''The Cost of Natural Selection'']) drew attention to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.&lt;ref name=VanValen/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, since a high number of deaths are required to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane's model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are ''N'' such genes, then the reproductive capacity of the species will be lowered to 0.9&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; times the original capacity. Therefore, if it is necessary for the population to fix more than one gene, it may not have reproductive capacity to counter the deaths.

In 1967 J. A. Sved found that the dilemma was based on wrong calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O'Donald |first=Peter |date=1969 |title=" Haldane's dilemma" and the rate of natural selection |journal=Nature |volume=221 | issue = 5183  |page=815 |pmid=5675622 |doi=10.1038/221815a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">An '''interface control document''' ('''ICD''') in [[systems engineering]] 
&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolter J. Fabrycky]], [[Benjamin S. Blanchard]] (2005). ''Systems Engineering and Analysis''. Prentice-Hall, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and [[software engineering]], provides a record of all interface information (such as drawings, diagrams, tables, and textual information) generated for a project.&lt;ref&gt;DATA ITEM DESCRIPTION, Interface Control Document (ICD), DI-SESS-81248B (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  The underlying interface documents provide the details and describe the interface or interfaces between [[subsystems]] or to a [[system]] or [[subsystem]].

== Overview ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}
An ICD is the umbrella document over the system interfaces; examples of what these interface specifications should describe include:
* The inputs and outputs of a single system, documented in individual SIRS{{explain|date=February 2018}} and HIRS{{explain|date=February 2018}} documents, would fall under "The Wikipedia Interface Control Document."
* The interface between two systems or subsystems, e.g. "The Doghouse to Outhouse Interface" would also have a parent ICD.
* The complete interface protocol from the lowest physical elements (e.g., the mating plugs, the electrical signal voltage levels) to the highest logical levels (e.g., the level 7 [[application layer]] of the [[OSI model]]) would each be documented in the appropriate interface requirements spec and fall under a single ICD for the "system".

The purpose of the ICD is to control and maintain a record of system interface information for a given project. This includes all possible inputs to and all potential outputs from a system for some potential or actual user of the system.  The internal interfaces of a system or subsystem are documented in their respective interface requirements specifications, while human-machine interfaces might be in a [[system design]] document (such as a [[software design document]]){{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

Interface control documents are a key element of [[systems engineering]] as they control the documented interface(s) of a system, as well as specify a set of interface versions '''that work together''', and thereby bound the requirements.

== Characteristics ==
An [[application programming interface]] is a form of interface for a software system, in that it describes how to access the functions and services provided by a system via an interface. If a system producer wants others to be able to use the system, an ICD and interface specs (or their equivalent) is a worthwhile investment.

An ICD should only describe the detailed interface documentation itself, and not the characteristics of the systems which use it to connect.  The function and logic of those systems should be described in their own requirements and design documents as needed (there are DIDs for all of these).  In this way, independent teams can develop the connecting systems which use the interface specified, without regard to how other systems will react to data and signals which are sent over the interface.  For example, the ICD and associated interface documentation must include information about the size, format, and what is measured by the data, but not any ultimate ''meaning'' of the data in its intended use by any user.

An adequately defined interface will allow one team to test its implementation of the interface by simulating the opposing side with a simple communications simulator.  Not knowing the business logic of the system on the far side of an interface makes it more likely that one will develop a system that does not break when the other system changes its business rules and logic.  (Provision for limits or sanity checking should be pointedly avoided in an interface requirements specification.) Thus, good modularity and abstraction leading to easy maintenance and extensibility are achieved.

== Criticism ==
Critics of requirements documentation and systems engineering in general often complain of the over-emphasis on documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler

ICDs are often used where subsystems are developed asynchronously in time, since they provide a structured way to communicate information about subsystems interfaces between different subsystem design teams.

'''Joseph Rykwert''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 1926) is Paul Philippe Cret Professor Emeritus of Architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and one of the foremost architectural historians and critics of his generation. He has spent most of his working life in the United Kingdom and America. Rykwert is the author of many influential works on architecture, including ''The Idea of a Town'' (1963), ''On Adam's House in Paradise'' (1972), ''The Dancing Column'' (1996) and ''The Seduction of Place'' (2000). All his books have been translated into several languages.

== Biography ==
The son of Elizabeth Melup and Szymon Rykwert, Rykwert was born in [[Warsaw]] in 1926 and moved to England in 1939, on the eve of the second World War. Rykwert was educated at Charterhouse and then at the [[Bartlett School of Architecture]] ([[University College, London|University College]], London) and the [[Architectural Association]] in London. His first academic posts were lecturing at Hammersmith School of Arts &amp; Crafts and subsequently at the [[Ulm School of Design]] from 1958, and then as Librarian and Tutor at the [[Royal College of Art]] from 1961 to 1967 where he obtained his PhD He was appointed Professor of Art at the newly created [[University of Essex]], a post he held from 1967 until 1980, when he moved to Cambridge first as [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] and then as Reader in Architecture. Here Rykwert continued his influential master's programme, taught with the architectural critic [[Dalibor Vesely]]. In 1988 Rykwert was appointed as the Paul Philippe Cret Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, a post he held until 1998; he is now Emeritus Professor.

Joseph Rykwert has lectured or taught at many major schools of architecture throughout the world and has held visiting appointments at Princeton, the Cooper Union, New York, Harvard Graduate School of Design, the [[University of Sydney]], of Louvain, the Institut d'Urbanisme, Paris, the [[Central European University]] and others: in 1998–99 he was a British Academy visiting professor at the University of Bath. He has held senior fellowships at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts, Washington, and the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. In 1984 Rykwert was appointed Chevalier dans l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He holds honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh (1995), the University of Cordoba, Argentina (1998), the University of Bath (2000), of Toronto (2005) Rome (20005) and Trieste (2007), and is a member of the Italian Accademia di San Luca and the Polish Academy. In 2000 he was awarded the Bruno Zevi prize in architectural history by the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|Biennale of Venice]], and in 2009 the Gold Medal Bellas Artes, Madrid. He has been president of the international council of architectural critics (CICA) since 1996, and is the recipient of the 2014 [[Royal Gold Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Wainwright: [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/sep/18/riba-gold-medal-joseph-rykwert "RIBA awards Royal Gold Medal to architectural historian Joseph Rykwert"], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2014 Birthday Honours]] for services to architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60895 |date=14 June 2014 |page=b10 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016 he received an honorary degree in [[pedagogy]] at the [[University of Bologna]].

== Works ==
Joseph Rykwert's preoccupations are many, but some particular themes stand out. His work is fundamentally concerned with the origin of architectural ideas and, having experienced displacement himself at an early age, with our sense of 'place'. In ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World'' (first published in 1963 and in two subsequent editions), rather than accept the archaeologists’ viewpoint of the ancient city as an outcome of practical settlement needs, Rykwert broke new ground in understanding the ancient town as a product of sacred and symbolic rituals. The book served as a timely critique of post-war New Town developments. In ''On Adam’s House in Paradise: The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History'' (1972 and subsequent editions) Rykwert examined the persistent idea that architecture could be returned to a lost state of accord with nature, an accord symbolised by the fabled idea that Adam had built a house in Eden. In ''The First Moderns: The Architects of the Eighteenth Century'' (1980), Rykwert traced the origins of many modern ideas that are commonly assumed to be recent inventions (such as optics and perspective). The book is not a conventional history of style, but rather one of ideas and culture. Frances Yates explained this novelty of approach in ''The Times Literary Supplement'': ‘The range of Rykwert's learning is enormous. History of gardens, Chinese influences, festival architecture, all contribute to the overflowing wealth. Great figures in the history of thought and science — Bacon, Newton, Vico — are seen from new angles....This is no superficial history of styles, no conventional history of ideas. It invigorates both through the attempt at a new kind of history of architecture.’ In ''The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture'' (1996) Rykwert turned his attention to the origins of the architectural Orders, and more recently in ''The Seduction of Place: The History and Future of Cities'' (2000) to the question of how to make successful urban spaces and forms in cities today.

Throughout his career Rykwert has been preoccupied with the work of the Renaissance architect [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. In 1955 Rykwert published an annotated edition of Leoni's 1756 translation of Alberti's treatise, entitled ''The Ten Books of Architecture, by L.B. Alberti'', and this was followed in 1989 with a new translation from Latin, entitled ''On the Art of Building in Ten Books'' (published with [[Robert Tavernor]] and [[Neil Leach]]). In 1994 Rykwert co-curated (with [[Robert Tavernor]] and Anne Rykwert) an international exhibition on Alberti's work, held at the Palazzo Te in Mantua. Alberti's overlapping interest in architectural theory and practice, and his conception of the architect as a philosopher and student of many arts, led Rykwert to identify him as representing the model architect for an age where the role of the designer is in danger of being reduced to that of a businessman or technocrat. The conception of architecture as a product of inter-related disciplines and as a sister to other visual arts informs Rykwert's latest book, ''The Judicious Eye: Architecture Against the Other Arts'', published in 2008.

Joseph Rykwert married his second wife, Anne, during his time in Essex, and she has been a collaborator on notable works including the international Alberti exhibition and a book on the Adam brothers. Rykwert’s teaching has influenced several generations of architects and historians. Sir James Stirling commented on ''The First Moderns'', for example, that it was: ‘An erudite lead into my favourite period (early nineteenth century) with amazing revelations on the architectural heroes of the time.’ Many of Rykwert’s former pupils have gone on to have significant careers in their own right, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]], Shams Naga, Eric Parry, [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], [[Mohsen Mostafavi]], [[Robert Tavernor]], [[Vaughan Hart]] and [[David Leatherbarrow]]. Many university departments of architecture in the United Kingdom or America employ members of staff who were taught by Rykwert.

Unlike many architectural historians before him, Joseph Rykwert has not been concerned with architectural style or the classical language ''per se'', but rather with the meaning of a particular design that should always find its own appropriate expression. Throughout his work he has been concerned with practice as much as with theory, and with the ways in which buildings are actually designed and made.

The '''''Journal of Political Ecology''''' is an annual [[open access]] [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[political ecology]]. It was established in 1994 as one of the first open access journals in the social sciences, by James B. Greenberg and Thomas K. Park ([[University of Arizona]]), to experiment with online formats and to showcase new work in the emerging field of political ecology. The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Simon P.J. Batterbury ([[Lancaster University]] and [[University of Melbourne]]) and Casey Walsh ([[University of California, Santa Barbara]]). There is an international editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Masthead.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Unlike the majority of academic journals it is produced free of charge for readers and authors using voluntary academic labour, and its website is hosted at the University of Arizona library. There is no journal budget and editorial work is voluntary. JPE is abstracted and indexed in [[Scopus]], and the number of articles published, and citation index, has risen substantially since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecologiapolitica.info/?p=3564&lt;/ref&gt; The journal publishes Eric Wolf Prize papers submitted by early career scholars to the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] annual meetings in the United States. The journal is a founding member of the ''Free Journal Network'' &lt;ref&gt;https://freejournals.org/ Free Journal Network&lt;/ref&gt; that supports and lobbies for quality open access publishing.

==Scope==
The scope of the journal is research into the linkages between [[political economy]] and [[human impact on the environment]], particularly where there are inequalities in access to resources, or an increase in vulnerability, as a result of resource use or assertion of political power. Articles must address some aspect of this relationship, framed in political ecology, and topics have ranged from [[mining]] and [[indigenous peoples of Oceania]], to drug production in [[Lesotho]], [[marine protected area]] management in Vietnam, the [[sandalwood]] trade in [[East Timor]], environmental pollution in post-communist countries, water consumption and management in the United States West and Mexico, and the plight of [[Adivasi]] peoples living in national parks in India. Special issues are occasionally published, for example ''Ecologies of Hope'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Volume20/Volume_20.html |title=Journal of Political Ecology |publisher=University of Arizona Library |date=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by S. Ravi Rajan and Colin Duncan in 2013, ''Non-capitalist political ecologies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Volume21/Volume_21.html |title=Journal of Political Ecology |publisher=University of Arizona Library |date=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Brian Burke and Boone Shear and ''Degrowth, Culture and Power'' edited by Lisa Gezon and Susan Paulson in 2017.

The four most important research areas covered by the 145 articles published as of late 2014 were 1) Food and agricultural issues 2) social aspects of conservation 3) fishing issues and 4) mining and social struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Batterbury, S.P.J. 2015. Doing political ecology inside and outside the academy. In Bryant, R. (ed.) ''International Handbook of Political Ecology''. Edward Elgar. Pp. 27-43&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kavli Prize''' was established in 2005 through a joint venture between the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]], and [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|The Kavli Foundation]]. The main objective for the Prize is to honor, support and recognize scientists for outstanding scientific work in the fields of [[astrophysics]], [[nanoscience]] and [[neuroscience]] and award three international prizes every second year. The Kavli Prize was awarded the first time in Oslo, 9 September 2008.  The Prizes were presented by [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway]].  Each of the three Kavli Prizes consists of a gold medal, a scroll, and a cash award of US $1,000,000.

==Selection committees==

The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters appoints the three Prize Committees consisting of leading international scientists after receiving recommendations made by the following international academies and equivalent scientific organisations:

*[[Chinese Academy of Sciences|The Chinese Academy of Sciences]]
*[[French Academy of Sciences|The French Academy of Sciences]]
*[[Max Planck Society|The Max Planck Society (Germany)]]
*[[United States National Academy of Sciences|The National Academy of Sciences (US)]]
*[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]
*[[The Royal Society|The Royal Society (UK) ]]

These distinguished panels of international scientist’s reviews and recommend the prize winners on basis of a nomination process. The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters administer the selection process and announce the prize winners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6268">[[File:BabbageKeyValueCard.tiff|thumb|350px|A tabular data card proposed for Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]] showing a key–value pair, in this instance a number and its base-ten logarithm.]]
A '''key-value database''', or '''key-value store''', is a data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing [[associative array]]s, a [[data structure]] more commonly known today as a ''dictionary'' or ''[[hash table]]''. Dictionaries contain a [[Collection (abstract data type)|collection]] of ''[[Object (computer science)|objects]]'', or ''[[Record (computer science)|records]]'', which in turn have many different ''[[Field (computer science)|fields]]'' within them, each containing data. These records are stored and retrieved using a ''key'' that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to quickly find the data within the [[database]]. 
[[File:KeyValue.PNG|thumb|300x300px]]
Key-value databases work in a very different fashion from the better known [[relational database]]s (RDB). RDBs pre-define the data structure in the database as a series of tables containing fields with well defined [[data type]]s. Exposing the data types to the database program allows it to apply a number of optimizations. In contrast, key-value systems treat the data as a single opaque collection, which may have different fields for every record. This offers considerable flexibility and more closely follows modern concepts like [[object-oriented programming]]. Because optional values are not represented by placeholders or input parameters, as in most RDBs, key-value databases often use far less [[computer memory|memory]] to store the same database, which can lead to large performance gains in certain workloads.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Performance, a lack of standardization and other issues limited key-value systems to niche uses for many years, but the rapid move to [[cloud computing]] after 2010 has led to a renaissance as part of the broader [[NoSQL]] movement. Some [[graph database]]s are also key-value databases internally, adding the concept of the relationships (''[[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]'') between records as a first class data type.

==Types and notable examples==
Key-value databases can use [[consistency model]]s ranging from [[eventual consistency]] to [[serializability]]. Some support ordering of keys. Some maintain data [[In-memory_database|in memory (RAM)]], while others employ [[solid-state drive]]s or [[hard disk drive|rotating disks]].

[[Redis]] was the most popular implementation of a key-value database as of August 2015, according to [[DB-Engines ranking]].&lt;ref&gt;http://db-engines.com/en/ranking&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of key-value database is [[Oracle NoSQL Database]]. Oracle NoSQL Database provides a key-value paradigm to the application developer. Every entity (record) is a set of key-value pairs. A key has multiple components, specified as an ordered list. The major key identifies the entity and consists of the leading components of the key. The subsequent components are called minor keys. This organization is similar to a directory path specification in a file system (e.g., /Major/minor1/minor2/). The “value” part of the key-value pair is simply an uninterpreted string of bytes of arbitrary length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbjournal.ro/archive/12/12.pdf  "Oracle NoSQL Database"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unix system provides [[dbm]] (database manager) which is a library originally written by [[Ken Thompson]]. Also ported to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] OS platforms, provided through programming languages such as [[Perl#Windows|Perl for Win32]]. The dbm manages associative arrays of arbitrary data by use of a single key (a primary key). Modern implementations include [[sdbm]] and [[GNU dbm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6671">A '''leaching model''' is a [[hydrology|hydrological]] model by which the leaching with [[irrigation]] water of dissolved substances, notably salt, in the soil is described depending on the hydrological regime and the [[soil]]'s properties. &lt;br&gt;
The model may describe the process (1) in time and (2) as a function of amount of water applied. &lt;br&gt;
Leaching is often done to [[Land improvement|''reclaim'']] [[saline soil]] or to ''conserve'' a favorable salt content of the soil of irrigated land &lt;ref name="Hoorn"&gt;J.W. van Hoorn and J.G. van Alphen (2006), Salinity control. In: H.P. Ritzema (Ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, p. 533-600, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as all irrigation water contains salts.

==Leaching curves==
[[File:saltleaching.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 1. Experimental data of Chacupe pilot area]]
The leaching process in a [[salty soil]] to be reclaimed is illustrated in the leaching curves of figure 1, derived from data of the Chacupe pilot area, [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Alva, J.G. van Alphen, A. de la Torre, L. Manrique, 1976. Problemas de Drenaje y Salinidad en la Costa Peruana. ILRI bulletin 16 (Spanish). International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the [[soil salinity]] in terms of [[electrical conductivity]] (EC) of the soil solution with respect its initial value (ECi) as a function of amount of water percolating through the soil. The top-soil leaches quickly. The salinity of the deeper soil first increases due to the salts leached from the top-soil, but later it also decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Case study leaching (Chacupe). Data from CENDRET/SUDRET project, Peru, 1968 -1974. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/chacupe.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaching efficiency==
[[File:leachingeff.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Figure 2. Principle of leaching efficiency]]
[[File:SALTMOD4.JPG|thumb|250px|Figure 3. Leaching curves and calibration of leaching efficiency]]
Owing to irregular distribution of salt in the soil or to irregularity of the [[soil structure]] (figure 2), the ''leaching efficiency'' (E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) can be different from unity.

Soils with a low leaching efficiency are difficult to reclaim. In the [[Tagus|Tagus delta]], [[Portugal]], the leaching efficiency of the dense [[clay]] soil was found as low as 0.10 to 0.15.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Vanegas Chacon, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict desalinization in the Leziria Grande Polder, Portugal. Thesis. Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The soil could not be developed for intensive [[agriculture]] and was used for rearing of bulls in coarse natural [[pasture]].

The [[clay]] soil in the [[Nile|Nile delta]], [[Egypt]], on the other hand has a much better leaching efficiency of 0.7 to 0.8. In figure 3, leaching curves are shown for different leaching efficiencies, as assumed in the ''leaching model'' [[SaltMod]] &lt;ref&gt;SaltMod: description of principles, user manual and examples of application. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/saltmod.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  with data from the Mashtul pilot area. The observed values of [[soil salinity]] correspond best to a leaching efficiency of about 0.75.&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan and M.A.Senna, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict drainage and salinity control in the Nile delta. In: Annual Report 1989, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands, p. 63-74.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure illustrates the calibration process of leaching efficiency, which parameter is difficult to measure directly.

==Leaching requirement==
The ''leaching requirement'' may refer to:
* The total amount of water required to bring the [[soil salinity]] from an initially high value down to an acceptable value in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown. From figure 1 it is seen that 800&amp;nbsp;mm of water (or 8000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ha) is required to bring the soil salinity down to 60% of its original value in the soil layer at 40 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm depth. When the salinity must be less than 60%, extrapolation of the leaching curve, the use of a ''leaching equation'' (see below) or a leaching model like [[SaltMod]] is necessary to obtain a reliable estimate of the additional leaching requirement.
* The annual amount of [[percolation]] water (i.e. the extra amount of irrigation water on top of the crop consumptive use) required to conserve an acceptable salt balance of the soil  in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown. The ratio
::F&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Perc/Irr, where Perc = amount of required percolation water, and Irr = total amount of irrigation water,
:is called ''leaching fraction'',&lt;ref name="Hoorn" /&gt; see also below.

==Leaching equation==
The downward limb of the leaching curves, as in figure 3, can be described with the leaching equation:&lt;ref name="Hoorn" /&gt;
*Ct = Ci + (Co - Ci) exp (-E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.T.Qp/Ws)
where C = salt concentration, Ct = C in the soil at time T, Co = C in the soil at time T=0, Ci = C of the irrigation water, E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = leaching efficiency, Qp = average percolation rate through the soil, and Ws = water stored in the soil at [[field capacity|field saturation]].

==Leaching fraction==
To conserve an acceptable [[Soil salinity control|salt balance]] of the soil  in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown, the leaching fraction must be at least:&lt;ref&gt;L.A.Richards (Ed.), 1954. Diagnosis and improvement of saline and alkali soils. USDA Agricultural Handbook 60. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=10158&amp;page=2 On internet]&lt;/ref&gt;
*F&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Ci/Cs
where Ci = salt concentration of the irrigation water, and Cs is the acceptable salt concentration of the soil moisture at [[field capacity]] in accordance with the salt tolerance of the crops to be grown.

A '''marine thruster''' is a device for producing directed [[hydrodynamic thrust]] on a marine [[vehicle]]. The thrust direction may be fixed or steerable.
Examples of marine thrusters include [[screw propeller]]s, [[Voith-Schneider propellers]], [[Pump-jet|waterjets]], [[ducted propeller]]s, tunnel [[bow thrusters]] and stern thrusters, [[azimuth thrusters]], [[rim-driven thruster]]s, [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] and [[submersible]] drive units.
Marine thrusters may be used for [[propulsion]], [[Maneuver (ship control)|maneuvering]] and [[Steering#Watercraft steering|steering]], [[Attitude control (submersibles)|attitude control]] and [[dynamic positioning]].

The failure or fracture of a product or component as a result of a single event is known as '''mechanical overload'''. It is a common [[failure mode]], and may be contrasted with [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], [[rupture (engineering)|rupture]], or [[stress relaxation]]. The terms are used in [[forensic engineering]] and [[structural engineering]] when analysing product failure. Failure may occur because either the product is weaker than expected owing to a [[stress concentration]], or the applied load is greater than expected and exceeds the normal [[tensile strength]], [[shear strength]] or [[compressive strength]] of the product.

==Examples==
{{Mechanical_failure_modes}}

Examples include the many components which fail in [[car crash]]es, [[train crash]]es, and [[airplane crash]]es as a result of [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] loading. The problem for the investigator is to determine which failures have been caused by the crash, and which may have caused the crash. It usually involves examining the broken parts for signs of [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack growth or other damage to the part which cannot be attributed to the crash itself. For very large [[structural failure]]s such as the collapse of bridges, it is necessarily a long and tedious process of sifting through the broken parts.

A '''microbiologist''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μῑκρος}}) is a [[scientist]] who studies [[microscopic]] life forms and processes. This includes study of the growth, interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[fungi]], and some types of parasites and their vectors.&lt;ref name=BLSwhat&gt;{{cite web|title=What Microbiologists Do |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-2 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most microbiologists work in offices and/or research facilities, both in private [[biotechnology]] companies as well as in [[academia]]. Most microbiologists specialize in a given topic within [[microbiology]] such as [[bacteriology]], [[parasitology]], [[virology]], or [[immunology]].

[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], often considered to be the first [[list of microscopists|microscopist]] and microbiologist&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Lane|Lane, Nick]] (6 March 2015). "The Unseen World: Reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) 'Concerning Little Animal'." ''Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci''. 2015 Apr; 370 (1666): 20140344. [doi:10.1098/rstb.2014.0344]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Duties ==
Microbiologists generally work in some way to increase scientific knowledge, or to utilize that knowledge in a way that improves outcomes in medicine or some industry. For many microbiologists, this work includes planning and conducting experimental research projects in some kind of [[laboratory]] setting.&lt;ref name=BLSwhat/&gt; Others may have a more administrative role, supervising scientists and evaluating their results. Microbiologists working in the medical field, such as [[clinical microbiology|clinical microbiologists]], may see patients or patient samples and do various tests to detect [[pathogen|disease-causing organisms]].&lt;ref name=BLSwhat/&gt;

For microbiologists working in academia, duties include performing research in an academic laboratory, writing [[grant (money)|grant proposals]] to fund research, as well as some amount of teaching and designing courses.&lt;ref name=ASM&gt;{{cite web|title=Careers in Microbiology |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |url=https://www.asm.org/images/Membership/Careers_Website/Membership/Careers_in_Microbiology_PRINT_Letter_size.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbiologists in industry roles may have similar duties except research is performed in industrial labs in order to develop or improve commercial products and processes. Industry jobs may also include some degree of sales and marketing work, as well as regulatory compliance duties. Microbiologists working in government may have a variety of duties, including laboratory research, writing and advising, developing and reviewing regulatory processes, and overseeing grants offered to outside institutions.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt; Some microbiologists work in the field of [[patent law]], either with national patent offices or private law practices. Here duties include research and navigation of [[intellectual property]] regulations.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt; Clinical microbiologists tend to work in government or hospital laboratories where their duties include analyzing clinical specimens to detect microorganisms responsible for disease. Some microbiologists instead work in the field of [[science outreach]], where they develop programs and material to educate students and non-scientists and stimulate interest in the field of microbiology.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt;

== Education ==
Entry-level microbiology jobs generally require at least a [[bachelor's degree]] in microbiology or a related field.&lt;ref name=BLShow&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become a Microbiologist |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-4 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These degree programs frequently include courses in [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[statistics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[genetics]], followed by more specialized courses in sub-fields of interest. Many of these courses have laboratory components to teach trainees basic and specialized laboratory skills.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

Higher-level and independent jobs generally require a [[Ph.D.]] as well as several years experience as a microbiologist. This often includes time spent as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] wherein one leads research projects and prepares to transition to an independent career. Postdoctoral researchers are often evaluated largely based on their record of published [[academic paper]]s, as well as recommendations from their supervisors and colleagues.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

In certain sub-fields of microbiology, [[license]]s or [[certification]]s are available or required in order to qualify for certain positions. This is true for clinical microbiologists, as well as those involved in food safety and some aspects of pharmaceutical/medical device development.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

== Job outlook ==
Microbiologists will continue to be needed to advance basic science knowledge and to contribute to development of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products.&lt;ref name=BLSoutlook&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Outlook |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-6 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, job prospects vary widely by job and location.

In the United States, the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] predicts that employment of microbiologists will grow 4 percent from 2014 (22,400 employed) to 2024 (23,200 employed). This represents slower growth than the average occupation, as well as slower growth than life scientists as a whole (6 percent projected).&lt;ref name=BLSoutlook/&gt;

{{Sexual orientation}}
[[Sexual orientation]] is an enduring pattern of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexual]] attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite [[sex]] or [[gender]],&lt;!-- NOTE: "Sex" and "gender" are not always the same thing; for example, "sex" may refer to "biological sex" (being male or female), while "gender" may refer to a person's gender identity of being a man or a woman; therefore, like the Heterosexuality, Homosexuality and Bisexuality articles, we have included both in the lead. --&gt; the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx|archivedate=August 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808032050/http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmPsychiAssn-Sexual orientation"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|accessdate=January 1, 2013|url=http://healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx|archivedate=July 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080052/http://www.healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate causes and mechanisms of sexual orientation development in humans remain unclear and many theories are speculative and controversial. However, advances in [[neuroscience]] explain and illustrate characteristics linked to sexual orientation. Studies have explored structural neural-correlates, functional and/or cognitive relationships, and developmental theories relating to sexual orientation in humans.

== Developmental neurobiology ==
Many theories concerning the development of sexual orientation involve fetal neural development, with proposed models illustrating prenatal hormone exposure, maternal immunity, and developmental instability. Other proposed factors include genetic control of sexual orientation. No conclusive evidence has been shown that environmental or learned effects are responsible for the development of non-heterosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="number6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.03.002 |title=The neurodevelopment of human sexual orientation |year=2005 |last1=Rahman |first1=Q |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=29 |pages=1057–66 |pmid=16143171 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, [[sexual dimorphisms]] in the brain and behavior among vertebrates were accounted for by the influence of gonadal steroidal [[androgens]] as demonstrated in animal models over the prior few few decades. The prenatal androgen model of homosexuality describes the neuro-developmental effects of fetal exposure to these hormones.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt; In 1985, Geschwind and Galaburda proposed that homosexual men are exposed to high androgen levels early in development and proposed that temporal and local variations in androgen exposure to a fetus's developing brain is a factor in the pathways determining homosexuality.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt;  This led scientists to look for somatic markers for prenatal hormonal exposure that could be easily, and non-invasively, explored in otherwise endocrinologically normal populations. Various somatic markers (including [[Digit ratio|2D:4D finger ratios]], [[Evoked potential#Auditory evoked potential|auditory evoked potentials]], fingerprint patterns and eye-blink patterns) have since been found to show variation based on sexual orientation in healthy adult individuals.&lt;ref name="number6"/&gt;

Other evidence supporting the role of [[testosterone]] and prenatal hormones in sexual orientation development include observations of male subjects with [[cloacal exstrophy]] who were sex-assigned as female during birth only later to declare themselves male. This supports the theory that the prenatal testosterone surge is crucial for gender identity development. Additionally, females whose mothers were exposed to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) during pregnancy show higher rates of bi- and homosexuality.&lt;ref name="number11"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swaab DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation |journal=Gynecological Endocrinology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=301–12 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15724806 |doi=10.1080/09513590400018231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research directions ==
As of 2005, research directions included:&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt; 
* finding markers for sex steroid levels in the brains of fetuses that highlight features of early neuro-development leading to certain sexual orientations
* determine the precise neural circuitry underlying direction of sexual preference
* use animal models to explore genetic and developmental factors that influence sexual orientation
* further population studies, genetic studies, and serological markers to clarify and definitively determine the effect of maternal immunity
* neuroimaging studies to quantify sexual-orientation-related differences in structure and function in vivo
* neurochemical studies to investigate the roles of sex steroids upon neural circuitry involved in sexual attraction

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21816">'''PenTile matrix''' is a family of patented [[subpixel]] matrix schemes used in [[Electronic visual display|electronic device displays]]. PenTile is a trademark of [[Samsung]]. PenTile matrices are used in [[AMOLED]] displays.

These [[pixel geometry|subpixel layouts]] are specifically designed to operate with proprietary [[algorithms]] for [[subpixel rendering]] embedded in the display driver, allowing [[plug and play]] compatibility with conventional [[RGB]] (Red-Green-Blue) stripe panels.

==History==
[[File:Subpixel rendering RG-B-GR alternated geometry.png|73px|thumb|right|Prototypic five subpixel repeat cell geometry of PenTile Matrix (magnified diagram).]]
"PenTile Matrix" (a [[neologism]] from [[wiktionary:penta-|penta-]], meaning "five" in Greek and [[tile]]) describes the geometric layout of the prototypical subpixel arrangement developed in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Oren|url=http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2007/06/pentile_matrix_.html|title=Pentile Matrix: 50% Flat Panel Power Saving Now, More to Come|accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout consists of a [[quincunx]] comprising two [[red]] subpixels, two [[green]] subpixels, and one central [[blue]] subpixel in each unit cell. It was inspired by [[biomimicry]] of the human [[retina]] which has nearly equal numbers of L and M type [[cone cell]]s, but significantly fewer S cones. As the S cones are primarily responsible for perceiving blue colors, which do not appreciably affect the perception of [[luminance]], reducing the number of blue subpixels with respect to the red and green subpixels in a display does not reduce the image quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=082320106&amp;ETOC=RN&amp;] Brown Elliott, C.H., "Reducing Pixel Count without Reducing Image Quality", ''Information Display Magazine'', December, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This layout is specifically designed to work with and be dependent upon subpixel rendering that uses only one and a quarter subpixel per pixel, on average, to render an image. That is, that any given input pixel is mapped to either a red-centered logical pixel, or a green-centered logical pixel.

PenTile was invented by Candice H. Brown Elliott, for which she was awarded the [[Society for Information Display]]'s Otto Schade Prize in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Information Display Magazine|url=http://informationdisplay.org/IDArchive/2014/MarchApril/HonorsandAwards.aspx|title=2014 SID Honors and Awards|accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was licensed by the company Clairvoyante from 2000 until 2008, during which time several prototype PenTile displays were developed by a number of Asian [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD) manufacturers. In March 2008, Samsung Electronics acquired Clairvoyante's PenTile IP assets. Samsung then funded a new company, Nouvoyance, Inc. to continue development of the PenTile technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nouvoyance|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/news-031908.html|title=Press Release: Samsung Electronics Acquires Clairvoyante's IP Assets|accessdate=2010-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AdQjPotT?url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/news-031908.html|archivedate=2012-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PenTile RGBG==
[[File:Nexus one screen microscope.jpg|thumb|Magnified image of the [[AMOLED]] screen on the Google [[Nexus One]] smartphone using the RGBG system of the PenTile matrix family.]]
PenTile RGBG layout used in [[AMOLED]] and [[Plasma display|plasma]]&lt;ref name="PenTile OLED Resolution Measurement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/samsung-pn51f5500/4505-6482_7-35757117.html|accessdate=July 23, 2013|title=Samsung F5500 series plasma review|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; displays uses green pixels interleaved with alternating red and blue pixels. The [[human eye]] is most sensitive to green, especially for high resolution luminance information. The green subpixels are mapped to input pixels on a one-to-one basis.  The red and blue subpixels are subsampled, reconstructing the chroma signal at a lower resolution.  The luminance signal is processed using adaptive subpixel rendering filters to optimize reconstruction of high spatial frequencies from the input image, wherein the green subpixels provide the majority of the reconstruction.  The red and blue subpixels are capable of reconstructing the horizontal and vertical spatial frequencies, but not the highest of the diagonal.  Diagonal high spatial frequency information in the red and blue channels of the input image are transferred to the green subpixels for image reconstruction.  Thus the RG-BG scheme creates a color display with one third fewer subpixels than a traditional RGB-RGB scheme but with the same measured luminance [[display resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/files/pdf/measuring-pentile-display-resolution-vesa-standards.pdf|accessdate=March 6, 2012|title=Measuring Display Resolution with Contrast Modulation Methodology|publisher=Nouvoyance|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714202910/http://www.nouvoyance.com/files/pdf/measuring-pentile-display-resolution-vesa-standards.pdf|archivedate=July 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samsungsmd.com/eng/text/AMOLED/ET-1-1-2.jsp|title=Visual(=Pentile) Technology|author=Samsung Mobile Display|accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the [[Bayer filter]] commonly used in [[digital camera]]s.

==PenTile RGBW==
[[File:RGBW PenTile image.jpg|thumb|Magnified image of the RGBW unit.]]PenTile RGBW technology, used in LCD, adds an extra subpixel to the traditional red, green and blue subpixels that is a clear area without color filtering material and with the only purpose of letting [[backlight]] come through,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence W for [[white]]. This makes it possible to produce a brighter image compared to an RGB-matrix while using the same amount of power, or produce an equally bright image while using less power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PenTile RGBW Technology, What does it do?|author=Nouvoyance|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology-what.html|accessdate=2010-03-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AdQjrxPg?url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology-what.html|archivedate=2012-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PenTile RGBW layout uses each red, green, blue and white subpixel to present high-resolution [[luminance]] information to the human eyes' red-sensing and green-sensing [[cone cell]]s, while using the combined effect of all the color subpixels to present lower-resolution [[chrominance|chroma]] (color) information to all three cone cell types. Combined, this optimizes the match of display technology to the biological mechanisms of human vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nouvoyance|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology.html|title=PenTile RGBW Technology|accessdate=2010-03-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210131836/http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology.html|archivedate=2010-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout uses one third fewer subpixels for the same resolution as the RGB stripe (RGB-RGB) layout, in spite of having four color primaries instead of the conventional three, using subpixel rendering combined with [[metamerism (color)|metamer]] rendering.  Metamer rendering optimizes the energy distribution between the white subpixel and the combined red, green, and blue subpixels: W &lt;&gt; RGB, to improve image sharpness.

The display driver chip has an RGB to RGBW color vector space converter and [[gamut mapping]] algorithm, followed by metamer and [[subpixel rendering]] algorithms.  In order to maintain [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] color quality, to avoid simultaneous contrast error between saturated colors and peak white brightness, while simultaneously reducing backlight power requirements, the display backlight brightness is under control of the PenTile driver engine.&lt;ref name="Brown Elliott 2008"&gt;Brown Elliott, Candice, Chapter 12, "Image Reconstruction on Color Subpixelated Displays", ''Mobile Displays: Technology and Applications'', Wiley, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-470-72374-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the image is mostly desaturated colors, those near white or [[grey]], the backlight brightness is significantly reduced, often to less than 50% peak, while the LCD levels are increased to compensate.  When the image has very bright saturated colors, the backlight brightness is maintained at higher levels. The PenTile RGBW also has an optional high brightness mode that doubles the brightness of the desaturated color image areas, such as black&amp;white text, for improved outdoor view-ability.

==Controversy==
An ongoing controversy regarding the definition or measurement of resolution of color subpixelated flat panel displays led many people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.phonearena.com/news/Super-AMOLED-Plus-vs-Super-AMOLED-to-the-PenTile-matrix-and-back_id18700|title = Super AMOLED Plus vs Super AMOLED: to the PenTile matrix and back|date = 12 May 2011|accessdate = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.anandtech.com/show/5000/galaxy-nexus-pentile-discussion-confirmed|title = Confirmed: Galaxy Nexus Includes PenTile|date = October 21, 2011|publisher = AnandTech|last = Klug, Inofuentes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?p=1039152206|title = Forum Thread: iPhone 5 is officially the worlds most powerful phone}}&lt;/ref&gt; to question the resolution claims of PenTile display products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nexus One "Resolution" Debate Continues|author=DisplayBlog|url=http://www.displayblog.com/2010/04/01/nexus-one-resolution-debate-continues/|accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists have noted that in "''just about every flat-panel TV in existence, each pixel is composed of one red, one green, and one blue subpixel (RGB), all of uniform size''".&lt;ref name="PenTile OLED Resolution Measurement"/&gt; In traditional flat-panel screens, the resolution is defined by the number of red, green, and blue subpixels, in groups of three, in an array in each axis. As a result, each pixel or group of subpixels can render any colour on the screen, regardless of neighbouring pixels. This is not the case with PenTile screens. 

The Video Electronics Standards Association ([[VESA]]) method of measuring and defining resolution in color displays is to measure the contrast of line pairs, requiring a minimum of 50% [[Contrast (vision)|Michelson contrast]] for displays intended for rendering text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icdm-sid.org/|title=International Committee for Display Metrology|author=Society for Information Display|accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers of PenTile displays use this VESA criterion for contrast of line pairs to calculate the resolutions specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PenTile Technology Whitepapers|author=Nouvoyance|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/files/pdf/measuring-pentile-display-resolution-vesa-standards.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714202910/http://www.nouvoyance.com/files/pdf/measuring-pentile-display-resolution-vesa-standards.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the RGBG layout the alternate red and blue subpixels are 'shared' or sub-sampled with neighboring pixels. Due to the one third lower subpixel density on PenTile displays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology.html|title=Display Design and the Human Vision System|author=Nouvoyance|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210131836/http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology.html|archivedate=2010-02-10|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pixel structure may be more visible when compared to RGB stripe displays with the same pixel density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonedog.com/2011/07/18/motorola-droid-3-review-by-taylor/|title=Motorola DROID 3 Review by Taylor|author=Taylor Martin|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DX2-DX-NS-SCREENS.jpg|title=Comparison of Pentile vs RGB stripe|author=Droid-Life|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of subpixels for a given resolution has led some journalists to describe the use of PenTile as "shady practice"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/2/2916098/htc-one-s-review|title=HTC One S review|last=Savov|date=April 2, 2012|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "sort of cheating".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff-review.com/2012-04/display-shootout-htc-one-x-vs-galaxy-nexus-vs-ipad-3/|title=Display shootout: HTC One X vs. Galaxy Nexus (vs. iPad 3) screen comparison|last=Philippides|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

For a given size and resolution specification the PenTile screen can appear grainy, pixelated, speckled, with blurred text on some saturated colors and backgrounds when compared to RGB stripe color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How PenTile Displays Are Brighter But Not Always Better|author=Tested Blog|url=http://www.tested.com/news/pentile-vs-real-stripe-amoled-displays-whats-different/1868/ |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is understood to be caused by the restriction of the number of subpixels that may participate in the image reconstruction when colors are highly saturated to primaries. In the RGBW case, this is caused as the W subpixel will not be available in order to maintain the saturated color.  In the RGBG case, this effect will occur when the color boundary is primarily red or blue, as the fully populated (one green per pixel) sub-pixel cannot contribute. For all other cases, text and especially full color images are effectively reconstructed.&lt;ref name="Brown Elliott 2008" /&gt; 

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The PenTile layout reduces the number of subpixels needed to create a specified resolution. Consequently it is possible to achieve an HD resolution on a PenTile AMOLED screen at lower cost than other technologies, and most reviewers note that 720p resolution displays (such as [[Samsung Galaxy S III]]) make the PenTile effect less obvious than lower resolution PenTile displays ([[Droid Razr]]). The second advantage is lower power consumption: the [[HTC One S]]'s use of a PenTile display makes it more energy efficient and thinner than equivalent LCD screens, giving it better battery life than the [[HTC One X]]'s IPS LCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2012/05/30/htc-one-s-review/ |title=HTC One S review |publisher=MobileSyrup.com |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Molen |first=Brad |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/04/05/htc-one-x-vs-one-s/ |title=HTC One X vs. One S: which phone is The One for you? |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2012-04-05 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boxall |first=Andy |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/the-samsung-galaxy-s-iii-has-a-pentile-display-what-is-it-and-why-should-you-care/ |title=The Samsung Galaxy S III has a PenTile display: What is it, and why should you care? |publisher=Digital Trends |date=2012-05-04 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vlad Savov |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/2/2916098/htc-one-s-review |title=HTC One S review |publisher=The Verge |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PenTile AMOLED screen is also cheaper than an RGB stripe AMOLED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sakr |first=Sharif |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/11/03/nokia-lumia-800-review/ |title=Nokia Lumia 800 review |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most PenTile displays use rectangular grids of alternating green and blue/red pixels. However the [[Samsung Galaxy S4]] uses a PenTile Diamond Pixel array, where the green pixels are oval and repeat in a single line, while red and blue pixels are larger and alternate between the lines of green, ensuring more uniform colours with fewer aberrations compared to the earlier generation PenTile display on the Galaxy S III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2013/05/01/samsung-galaxy-s4-review-video/ |title=Samsung Galaxy S4 Review (Video) |publisher=MobileSyrup.com |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
PenTile displays for smartphones have received a mixed reception. For instance the [[Motorola Atrix 4G]]'s display had "inaccurate colours and poor viewing angles, not to mention practically unreadable text at its furthest zoom". Also in a comparison between the original [[Droid Razr]] and the cheaper [[RAZR V]], the RAZR V's TN TFT LCD (a low-end LCD, compared to the higher-end [[IPS panel]] LCD) was found to be much crisper than the Droid Razr's Super AMOLED Advanced PenTile despite both screens using the same 'resolution'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/review-motorola-razr-v|title=Review: Motorola RAZR V|date=|publisher=Neowin|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/12/11/revisited-the-motorola-atrix/|title=Revisited: the Motorola Atrix|date=2011-12-11|publisher=MobileSyrup.com|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public relations''' ('''PR''') is the practice of managing the spread of [[information]] between an individual or an [[organization]] (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the [[General public|public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Grunig|first1=James E|last2=Hunt|first2=Todd|title=Managing Public Relations|location=Orlando, FL|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1984|edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations may include an organization or [[individual]] gaining [[publicity|exposure]] to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Seitel|first=Fraser P.|title=The Practice of Public Relations. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall|year= 2007|edition= 10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiates it from [[advertising]] as a form of [[marketing communications]]. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than [[marketing]] or advertising. But now advertising is also a part of greater PR Activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306758|title=#10 Important Trends in PR that You Can't Afford to Ignore|last=Singh|first=Honey|date=2017-12-29|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What You Need to Get a Job in Public Relations After College - AfterCollege|url = http://blog.aftercollege.com/2014/need-get-job-public-relations-college/#sthash.m6uq8xLi.dpuf|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization, its [[leadership]], products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, [[businesses]] and [[companies]], [[government]], and [[official|public officials]] as [[public information officer|PIOs]] and [[nongovernmental organizations]], and [[nonprofit organizations]]. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Career Overview: Public Relations - Wetfeet.com|url = https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-public-relations|accessdate = 2015-09-28|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150929184702/https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/career-overview-public-relations|archive-date = 29 September 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organisation's target [[audience]], the [[mass media|media]], relevant trade media, and other [[opinion leadership|opinion leaders]]. Common responsibilities include designing communications campaigns, writing [[press release|news releases]] and other content for [[news]], working with the [[News media|press]], arranging interviews for company spokespeople, writing [[speech]]es for company leaders, acting as an organisation's [[spokesperson]], preparing clients for [[press conferences]], media interviews and speeches, writing [[website]] and [[social media]] content, managing company reputation ([[crisis management]]), managing [[internal communications]],  and marketing activities like brand awareness and event management &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Rubel|first= Gina F.|title= Everyday Public Relations for Lawyers|location=Doylestown, PA|edition=  1st|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-9801719-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each of the company's many stakeholders. The public relations professional must know how to effectively address those concerns using the most powerful tool of the public relations trade, which is publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Roos, Dave.

== Definitions ==
[[Ivy Lee]], the man who turned around the [[Rockefeller]] name and image, and his friend, [[Edward Bernays|Edward Louis Bernays]], established the first definition of public relations in the early 1900s as follows: "a management function, which tabulates public attitudes, defines the policies, procedures and interests of an organization... followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdhyJ_n1HFkC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=a+management+function,+which+tabulates+public+attitudes,+defines+the+policies,+procedures+and+interests+of+an+organization...+followed+by+executing+a+program+of+action+to+earn+public+understanding+and+acceptance.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tyoaqRfdcA&amp;sig=fyUEmNuDbztwXb891AgOkadYm3U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi71fbm2fTRAhVDylQKHajTAggQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20management%20function,%20which%20tabulates%20public%20attitudes,%20defines%20the%20policies,%20procedures%20and%20interests%20of%20an%20organization...%20followed%20by%20executing%20a%20program%20of%20action%20to%20earn%20public%20understanding%20and%20acceptance.&amp;f=false|title=PR 2.0: New Media, New Tools, New Audiences|last=Breakenridge|first=Deirdre|date=2008-03-26|publisher=FT Press|isbn=9780132703970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the [[United Transit Commission]], he said "I have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what I do."&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; In 1948, historian Eric Goldman noted that the definition of public relations in Webster's would be "disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field."&lt;ref name="twoway"&gt;{{cite book

According to Bernays, the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public’s consciousness. Furthermore, he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "The New Propagandists," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1978, the World Assembly of Public Relations Associations defined the field as &lt;blockquote&gt;"the art and [[social science]] of analyzing [[fad|trends]], predicting their consequences, counseling organizational leaders and implementing planned programs of action, which will serve both the organization and the [[public interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jensen Zhao.

[[Public Relations Society of America]], a professional trade association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-470-14492-3|title=Special Events: The Roots and Wings of Celebration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yxPHPj5CPMC&amp;pg=PA436}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined public relations in 1982 as: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/AboutPRSA/PublicRelationsDefined/Old%20Definition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145356/http://www.prsa.org/AboutPRSA/PublicRelationsDefined/Old%20Definition|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-04|title=PRSA's Old Definition of Public Relations|first=Keith|last=Trivitt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011 and 2012, the PRSA solicited crowd supplied definitions for the term and allowed the public to vote on one of three finalists. The winning definition stated that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/business/media/public-relations-a-topic-that-is-tricky-to-define.html |author= Stuart Elliot| title=Public Relations Defined, After an Energetic Public Discussion|date=March 1, 2012|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public relations can also be defined as the practice of managing [[communication]] between an organization and its publics.&lt;ref&gt;Grunig, James E. and Hunt, Todd. Managing Public Relations. (Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1984), 6e. Public relations is what you do with what you know and what other think about what you say.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations is to speak out its advocacy  in public, and it builds up a talking platform to achieve its goals and protect the interests of people.&lt;ref name="good"&gt;{{cite web|last1=CPRS|title=CPRS {{!}} What is Public Relations?|url=http://www.cprs.ca/Aboutus/whatisPR.aspx|website=www.cprs.ca|accessdate=16 April 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417072546/http://www.cprs.ca/Aboutus/whatisPR.aspx|archive-date=17 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of public relations}}
Public relations is not a phenomenon of the 20th century, but rather has historical roots. Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations profession. However, academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations, during the settling of the [[New World]] and during the movement to abolish slavery in England. Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the [[United Kingdom]] for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924.

Propaganda was used by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars, which led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector. Most historians believe public relations became established first in the US by [[Ivy Lee]] or [[Edward Bernays]], then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the [[Marshall plan]].

The second half of the 1900s is considered the professional development building era of public relations. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. [[The Cluetrain Manifesto]], which predicted the effect of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.

== Tactics ==
Public relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual, usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance, primarily to the media. Public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders. According to Dr. Jacquie L’Etang from Queen Margaret University, public relations professionals can be viewed as "discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing [[rhetorical]] strategies to achieve managerial aims."&lt;ref name="L'Etang2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacquie|last=L'Etang|title=Public Relations in Britain: A History of Professional Practice in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEuTTo4lpTYC|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2 September 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-4106-1081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific public relations disciplines include:
* Financial public relations – communicating financial results and business strategy
* [[Consumer]]/[[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] public relations – gaining publicity for a particular product or service
* [[Crisis communication]] – responding in a crisis
* [[Internal communications]] – communicating within the company itself
* [[Government relations]] – engaging government departments to influence public policy
* [[Media relations]] – a public relations function that involves building and maintaining close relationships with the news media so that they can sell and promote a business.
*Celebrity public relations− promotion of a celebrity to various media publications and outlets 
*In-house public relations – maintaining communication between entertainment networks/production companies and the media
* Food-centric relations – communicating specific information centered on foods, beverages and wine.

Building and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual’s audiences has a central role in doing public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Phillips|year=2006|title=Towards relationship management: Public relations at the core of organizational development|journal=Journal of Communication Management|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, C. (2009) [http://www.igi-global.com/bookstore/Chapter.aspx?TitleId=36662 Strategising impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital]. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field, they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset, especially for those in media relations.

Within each discipline, typical activities include [[pseudo-event|publicity events]], speaking opportunities, [[press releases]], [[newsletters]], [[blog]]s, [[social media]], press kits, and outbound communication to members of the press. Video and audio news releases (VNRs and ANRs) are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content.

=== Audience targeting ===
A fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the [[target audience]] and to tailor messages to be relevant to each audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Target audience|title=Key concepts in public relations|page=227|first1=Bob|last1=Franklin|first2=Mike|last2=Hogan|first3=Quentin|last3=Langley|first4=Nick|last4=Mosdell|first5=Elliot|last5=Pill|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-2318-7|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages. These messages however should be relevant to each other, thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme. Audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems: low visibility, lack of public understanding, opposition from critics, and insufficient support from funding sources.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ronald D.

On the other hand, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Stakeholder Approach Revisited|first=R Edward|last=Freeman|year=2004|publisher=Rainer Hampp Verlag|volume=5|issue=3|journal=Zeitschrift für Wirtschafts- und Unternehmensethik}}&lt;/ref&gt; All audiences are stakeholders (or presumptive stakeholders), but not all stakeholders are audiences. For example, if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease, the [[charitable organization|charity]] and the people with the disease are stakeholders, but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money. Public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations, market positioning, and branding. They are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Mark. "Climate Change and Public Relations."

=== The Publics in Public Relations ===
The public is any group whose members have a common interest or common values in a particular subject, such as political party. Those members would then be considered stakeholders, which are people who have a stake or an interest in an organization or issue that potentially involves the organization or group they're interested in. The Publics in Public Relations are:

-'''''Traditional Publics''''': Groups with which you have an on-going and long term relationship with, this may include; Employees, Media, Governments, Investors, and Customers&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/660088137|title=Public relations : a values-driven approach|last=David.|first=Guth,|date=2012|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|others=Marsh, Charles, 1955-|isbn=9780205811809|edition= 5th|location=Boston|oclc=660088137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-'''''Non-Traditional Publics''''': Groups that are typically unfamiliar with your organization and you have not had a relationship with but may become traditional publics due to changes in the organization, in society or if a group changing event occurs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Latent Publics''''': A group whose values have come into contact with the values of your organization but whose members haven't yet realized it; the members of that public are not yet aware of the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Aware Publics''''': A group of members who are aware of the existence of a commonality of values or interests with your organization, but have not organized or attempted to respond to that commonality.

-'''''Intervening Publics''''': Any public that helps you send a message to another public, could be the media or someone with stature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Primary Publics:''''' If a public can directly affect your organization's pursuit of its values-driven goals. This publics would include media, employees, government, shareholder, financial institutions, and the immediate community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Secondary Publics''''': Have high interest in the company such as the primary publics but will not be directly affected by decisions of the organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Internal Publics''''': People within your organization&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''External Publics''''': People outside of your organization&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Domestic Publics''''': Those within your country&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''-International Publics''''': Those outside of your country and when communicating with this publics you must be weary of that areas culture, beliefs, values, ethic, and other valuable cultural difference as to not offend anyone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Messaging ===
Messaging is the process of creating a consistent story around: a product, person, company, or service. Messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will instill doubt in their purchasing choices, or other decisions that affect the company. Brands aim to have the same problem statement, industry viewpoint, or brand perception shared across sources and media.

=== Social media marketing ===
{{Main|Digital marketing}}
Digital marketing is the use of [[Internet]] tools and technologies such as [[search engines]], Web 2.0 social bookmarking, [[new media]] relations, [[blogging]], and [[social media marketing]]. Interactive PR allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public, customers and prospects.

PR practitioners have always relied on the media  such as TV, radio, and magazines, to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically to a target audience. Social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal, it is also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades. Lister et al. said that "Digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place".&lt;ref&gt;Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I., &amp; Kelly, K. (2009). New media: A critical introduction. (2nd ed.). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
PR professionals are well aware of the fact that digital technology is used in a practically different way than before. For instance, cellphones are no longer just devices we use to talk to one another. They are also used for online shopping, dating, learning and getting the most up to date news around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tapscott, D. (2009). Grown up digital: How the net generation is changing your world. New York: McGraw hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

As digital technology has evolved, the methods to measure effective online public relations effectiveness have improved. The Public Relations Society of America, which has been developing PR strategies since 1947, identified 5 steps to measure online public relations effectiveness. 
# ''Engagement'': Measure the number of people who engaged with an item (social shares, likes and comments). 
# ''Impressions'': Measure the number of people who may have viewed an item.
# ''Items'': Measure any content (blog posts, articles, etc.) that originally appeared as digital media.
# ''Mentions'': Measure how many online items mention the brand, organization, or product.
# ''Reach'': Measure how far the PR campaign managed to penetrate overall and in terms of a particular audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/Intelligence/BusinessCase/MeasurementStandarization/#.VdZtN1WrTmE|title=PR Measurement Standardization: Moving Toward Industry Agreement: PRSA|first=Arthur|last=Yann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other techniques ===
[[Litigation public relations]] is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its effect on the client’s overall [[reputation]] (Haggerty, 2003).

== Ethics ==
Public relations professionals both serve the public's interest and private interests of businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, and governments. This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values. This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"&gt;Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein, " Introduction: Towards a Definitional Framework for Responsible Advocacy," in Ethics in Public Relations, Responsible Advocacy, ed. Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein (USA: Sage Publications, Inc. 2006), ix.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA) responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics "advocacy" – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"/&gt;

The field of public relations is generally highly un-regulated, but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations.&lt;ref name="Marshall2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Tim|title=Ethics – Who needs them?|journal=Journal of Communication Management|volume=7|issue=2|year=2002|pages=107–112|issn=1363-254X|doi=10.1108/13632540310807313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]], the Public Relations Society of America, and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code. Still, [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]]'s 2003 semi-annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1108/13632540510621498|title = Can the professionalisation of the UK public relations industry make it more trustworthy?| journal=Journal of Communication Management| volume=9| pages=56–64|year = 2005|last1 = Tobin|first1 = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations people are growing increasingly concerned with their company’s marketing practices, questioning whether they agree with the company’s social responsibility. They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy-making role. On the other hand, marketing people are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Kermani, Faiz and Alan Needham. Marketing and Public Relations. Marlow: Institute of Clinical Research, 2006. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott Cutlip, the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum, but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Scott|last=Cutlip|author-link=Scott Cutlip|year=1994|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations: A History|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-0-8058-1464-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Relation Code of Ethics: ===
The Public Relation Student Society of America has established a set of fundamental guidelines that people within the public relations professions should practice and use in their business atmosphere. These values are:

'''''Advocacy''''': Serving the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for the clientele. This can occur by displaying the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate.

'''''Honesty''''': Standing by the truth and accuracy of all facts in the case and advancing those statements to the public.

'''''Expertise''''': To become and stay informed of the specialized knowledge needed in the field of Public Relations. Taking that knowledge and improving the field through development, research, and education. Meanwhile professionals also build their understanding, credibility, and relationships to understand various audiences and industries.

'''''Independence''''': Provide unbiased work to those that are represented while being accountable for all actions.

'''''Loyalty''''': Stay devoted to your client while remembering you have a duty to still serve the public interest.

'''''Fairness''''': Honorably conduct business with any and all clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, media, and general public. Respecting all opinions and right of free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prsa.org/ethics/code-of-ethics/|title=Code of Ethics - Public Relations Society of America|work=Public Relations Society of America|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spin ===
{{Main|Spin (public relations)}}
Spin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public, but since the 1990s has shifted to describing a "polishing of the truth."&lt;ref name="Safire96"/&gt; Today, spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/spin|title=spin|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are.&lt;ref name="Safire96"&gt;Safire, William
(1996) [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html?scp=19&amp;sq=spin%20definition&amp;st=cse ''The Spinner Spun'']&lt;/ref&gt; Within the field of public relations, spin is seen as a derogatory term, interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donhalepr.com/?p=163 Spin Doctor a Derogatory Term That Needs to Go, Dilenschneider Says]. Don Hale PR. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.prnewswire.com/2012/02/17/dear-gracie-is-flack-a-four-letter-word/ Dear Gracie: Is ‘Flack’ a Four-Letter Word? | Beyond PR]. Blog.prnewswire.com (2012-02-17). Retrieved on 2013-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called "spin doctors."

In Stuart Ewen’s ''PR! A Social History of Spin'', he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless. Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force. He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages.&lt;ref&gt;W. Timothy Coombs and Sherry J. Holladay, "Does Society Need Public Relations? Criticisms of Public Relations" in It’s Not Just PR: Public Relations in Society, (Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2007), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions ([[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]), the so-called "[[non-denial denial]]," phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, [[euphemism]]s for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news.

=== Negative ===
{{see also|Negative campaigning}}
Negative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR) and in some earlier writing "Black PR", is a process of destroying the target's reputation and/or [[corporate identity]]. The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else, who may pose a threat to the client's business or be a political rival. DPR may rely on [[IT security]], [[industrial espionage]], [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], and [[competitive intelligence]]. Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target, producing misleading facts to fool a competitor.&lt;ref&gt;Wattenberg, Martin P. (22 Aug. 1996).

=== Politics and civil society ===
In ''Propaganda'' (1928), Bernays argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/EdwardLBernays-Propaganda Edward Bernays ''Propaganda'' (1928) p. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; In public relations, [[lobby groups]] are created to influence government policy, corporate policy or [[public opinion]], typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization.

In fact, Bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives, by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the ‘mental processes and social patterns of the masses,’ which include our behavior, political and economic spheres or our morals.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues. However, in practice, it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence. This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an ‘invisible government’ to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base, it is known as a [[front group]].&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Viggo Jakobsen, ''Focus on the CNN Effect Misses the Point: The Real Media Impact on Conflict Management is Invisible and Indirect'', Journal of Peace Research, vol.37, no.2. Institute of Political Science, University of Copenhagen (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Front groups are a form of [[astroturfing]], because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests. They create a fake grass-roots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public, when they actually serve their sponsors.

Politicians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views, policies, and even personalities to their best advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the Record: Politics, Politicians and Power|first=Laurie|last=Oakes|page=191|year=2010|publisher=Hachette Australia|isbn=978-0-7336-2700-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''reliability theory of aging''' is an attempt to apply the principles of [[reliability theory]] to create a [[mathematical model]] of [[senescence]]. The theory was published in Russian by [[Leonid A. Gavrilov]] and Natalia S. Gavrilova as ''Biologiia prodolzhitelʹnosti zhizni'' in 1986, and in English translation as ''The Biology of Life Span: A Quantitative Approach'' in 1991.{{r|gav|rayl}}

One of the models suggested in the book is based on an analogy with the reliability theory. The underlying [[hypothesis]] is based on the (previously suggested) premise that humans are born in a highly defective state. This is then made worse by environmental and mutational damage; exceptionally high [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] due to the extremely high number of low-reliable components (e.., [[cell (biology)|cell]]s) allows the organism to survive for a while.{{r|ieee}}&lt;ref name=gg2001/&gt;

The theory suggests an explanation of two aging phenomena for higher organisms: the [[Gompertz law]] of exponential increase in mortality rates with age and the "late-life mortality plateau" (mortality deceleration compared to the Gompertz law at higher ages).&lt;ref name=gg2001&gt;Gavrilov, Gavrilova (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book criticizes a number of hypotheses known at the time, discusses drawbacks of the hypotheses put forth by the authors themselves, and concludes that regardless the suggested mathematical models, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"Conclusion" section of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9262">[[Image:Weraroa novae zelandiae.jpg|150 px|Right|thumb|''Weraroa novae-zelandiae'', a secotioid form of the bluing ''[[Psilocybe]]'']]

'''Secotioid''' fungi are an intermediate growth form between mushroom-like [[hymenomycete]]s and closed bag-shaped [[gasteroid fungi|gasteromycetes]], where an evolutionary process of '''gasteromycetation''' has started but not run to completion.  Secotioid fungi may or may not have opening caps, but in any case they often lack the vertical [[geotropism|geotropic]] orientation of the [[hymenophore]] needed to allow the spores to be dispersed by wind, and the [[basidiospores]] are not forcibly discharged or otherwise prevented from being dispersed (e.g. gills completely inclosed and never exposed as in the secotioid form of ''[[Lentinus tigrinus]]'')—note—some mycologists do not consider a species to be secotioid unless it has lost [[ballistospory]].&lt;ref name="Hibbett_1994"/&gt;

==Explanation of secotioid development and gasteromycetation==

Historically [[agarics]] and [[boletes]] (which bear their spores on a [[hymenium]] of gills or tubes respectively) were classified quite separately from the [[gasteroid fungi]], such as [[puff-balls]] and [[truffles]], of which the spores are formed in a large mass enclosed in an outer skin.  However, in spite of this apparently very great difference in form, recent mycological research, both at microscopic&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; and molecular&lt;ref name=Hibbett/&gt; level has shown that sometimes species of open mushrooms are much more closely related to particular species of gasteroid fungi than they are to each other.  Fungi which do not open up to let their spores be dispersed in the air, but which show a clear [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] relation to agarics or boletes, constitute an intermediate form and are called '''secotioid'''.&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt;

The word is derived from the name of the genus ''[[Secotium]]'', which contains such species.&lt;ref name=Conard/&gt;

On a microscopic scale, secotioid fungi do not expel their spores forcibly from the basidium and so the spores are statismospores.  Like gasteroid fungi, secotioid ones rely on animals such as rodents or insects to distribute their spores.

It seems that sometimes it can be disadvantageous for a mushroom to open up and free its spores in the usual way.  If this development is aborted, a secotioid form arises, perhaps to be followed eventually by an evolutionary progression to a fully gasteroid form.  This type of progression is called '''gasteromycetation''' and seems to have happened several times independently starting from various genera of "normal" mushrooms.  This means that the secotioid and also the gasteroid fungi are [[polyphyletic]].  According to the paper by Thiers,&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; in certain climates and certain seasons, it may be an advantage to remain closed because moisture can be conserved in that way.

There is a spectrum of secotioid species ranging from the open form to the closed form in the following respects:
*there may be an evident stipe, or there may be only a remnant consisting of a column of non-fertile tissue,
*if there is a stipe the edge of the cap may separate from it (partially opening), or may not,
*there may be recognizable gills (though oriented in all directions and very convoluted), or the fertile interior may be uniform like the [[gleba]] of gasteroid fungi, and
*the spore-bearing tissue may be above ground ([[epigeous]]), or underground ([[wikt:hypogeous|hypogeous]]), or partly buried.

The adjective "'''sequestrate'''" is sometimes used as a general term to mean "either secotioid or gasteroid".

==Examples==

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b11 168-5.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Cross-section of ''Hymenogaster tener'']]
For example, the secotioid genus ''[[Hymenogaster]]'' has been shown to be closely related to agaric genera such as ''[[Hebeloma]]'', which were formerly placed in family [[Cortinariaceae]] or [[Strophariaceae]].  This is found by DNA analysis and also indicated on a microscopic scale by the resemblance of the spores and basidia.  According to a current classification system, ''Hebeloma'' now belongs to family [[Hymenogastraceae]], and is considered more narrowly related to the closed ''[[Hymenogaster]]'' fungi than, for instance, to the ordinary mushrooms in genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt;

A similar case is the well-known "Deceiver" mushroom ''[[Laccaria laccata]]'' which is now classified in the ''[[Hydnangiaceae]]'', ''Hydnangium'' being a gastroid genus.

''[[Cortinarius]]'' is a very widespread genus of agarics, but also contains some secotioid species, such as ''C. leucocephalus'', ''C. coneae'' and ''C. cartilagineus''.

Secotioid genus ''Nivatogastrium'' corresponds to agaric genus ''[[Pholiota]]''&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; and provides a vivid example of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Nivatogastrium/&gt;

It has been found that a change in a single locus of a gene of the gilled mushroom ''[[Lentinus tigrinus]]'' causes it to have a closed fruiting body.  This suggests that the emergence of a secotioid species may not require many mutations.&lt;ref name=Hibbett/&gt;

''[[Gastroboletus]]'' is a secotioid [[bolete]] genus where the fruiting bodies may or may not open, but in any case the tubes are not aligned vertically as in a true bolete.&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt;

''[[Agaricus deserticola]]'' is a secotioid species of ''[[Agaricus]]'' (the genus of common cultivated mushrooms) which at one time was placed in the genus ''Secotium''. Similarly, ''[[Agaricus inapertus]]'' was formerly known as ''Endoptychum depressum'' until [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis revealed it to be closely aligned with ''Agaricus''.&lt;ref name=Vellinga2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vellinga EC |author2=de Kok RPJ |author3=Bruns TD. |title=Phylogeny and taxonomy of ''Macrolepiota'' (Agaricaceae) |journal=Mycologia |year=2003 |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=442–56 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0095/003/0442.htm |doi=10.2307/3761886 |pmid=21156633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simultaneous communication''', '''SimCom''', or '''sign supported speech''' ('''SSS''') is a technique sometimes used by [[deaf]], hard-of-hearing or hearing [[sign language]] users in which both a spoken language and a manual variant of that language (such as [[English language|English]] and [[manually coded English]]) are used simultaneously. While the idea of communicating using two modes of language seems ideal in a hearing/deaf setting, in practice the two languages are rarely relayed perfectly. Often the native language of the user (usually spoken language for the hearing person and sign language for the deaf person) is the language that is strongest, while the non-native language degrades in clarity. In an educational environment this is particularly difficult for deaf children as a majority of teachers who teach the deaf are hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/LAADCtwo3.html|title=Language Attitudes in the American Deaf Community|website=gupress.gallaudet.edu|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from surveys taken indicate that communication for students is indeed signing (about 2/3 of the population of students), and that the signing leans more toward English rather than ASL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newell|first=William|last2=Stinson|first2=Michael|last3=Castle|first3=Diane|last4=Mallery-Ruganis|first4=Dominique|last5=Holcomb|first5=Barbara Ray|date=2013-10-02|title=Simultaneous Communication: A Description by Deaf Professionals Working in an Educational Setting|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507083|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=391–414|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0023|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History/overview ==
[[Manual communication]], including simultaneous communication, has existed for a while in the United States, but gained traction in the 70's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Madeline M.|date=2013-10-02|title=Simultaneous Communication: The State of the Art &amp; Proposals for Change|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507082|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=333–390|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0019|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of using signing with children has been a tumultuous one, with many swings between discouraging the use of signed languages and focusing on [[oralism]], to the current push of [[bilingualism]] in Deaf schools. Ultimately, the majority of schools pushed the signed language they used to focus on English, resulting in the birth of a language that combined spoken language (English) with a manual language. The historical use of SC in schools has been stormy, with professionals (both researchers and teachers alike) on either side of the debate on whether the language is useful or not.

== Studies/research ==

===Positive approaches===

According to a study done in 1984, it was found that compared with haphazard instruction involving no language approach whatsoever, Total Communication was proved to be beneficial when combined with the correct approach.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Mark T.|last2=Calderon|first2=Rosemary|last3=Kusché|first3=Carol|date=1984-01-01|title=Early Intervention Using Simultaneous Communication with Deaf Infants: The Effect on Communication Development|jstor=1129972|journal=Child Development|volume=55|issue=2|pages=607–616|doi=10.2307/1129972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study entitled "Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication|first1=Robert L|last1=Whitehead|first2=Nicholas|last2=Schiavetti|first3=Douglas J|last3=MacKenzie|first4=Dale Evan|last4=Metz|date=1 May 2004|publisher=|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=37|issue=3|pages=241–253|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 [[Hearing loss|hearing impaired]] individuals were asked to audit the audio samples of 4 hearing sign language experts who had produced recordings of a Simultaneous Communication (SC) sample and a Speech Alone (SA) sample. The 12 hearing impaired individuals were asked to then determine which speech produced was clearer. After listening to both audio samples, hearing impaired listeners agreed that both SC and SA were intelligible, which is supported by previous research. Since the intelligibility of the speech was kept on par with English grammar, the study results indicate that SC is a positive tool to use with [[Hearing loss|Deaf]] and [[Hearing loss|Hard of Hearing]] children as a language model and for Deaf/Hard of Hearing adults to keep using.

Another study showed the difference between a control group, families who participated in an intervention program that offered services such as classes on Total Communication, private teachers for the child and a deaf adult who came to the families house, and another group of families who used TC, but did not have as much intervention as the control group. The results showed that intervention did work, and that it positively correlated with the communication skills show by the control group's children. The children showed advanced cognitive skills, including comprehension and expression, specifically related to time.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Negative approaches ===

A study done in 1990 titled "The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom"&amp;nbsp;by Dennis Cokely reviewed research done previously that supported the use of Total Communication (SimCom) in the classroom. However, the study pointed out several restrictive factors that several research tests had not approached. One of the tests administered only compared SimCom, the [[Rochester Method]] and speech reading with voice ([[lip reading]]), omitting the option of ASL as a means of communication. The 1990 study addressed this issue by comparing SimCom, Sign Alone and Interpretation to see which was the most effective. The results from the comparison showed that signing alone as a way for students to understand information given was the most effective and SimCom was the least effective. Overall, Sign Alone and Interpretation was most effective in all areas of the test, proving that SimCom was a struggle for teachers and students alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cokely|first=Dennis|date=2013-10-02|title=The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507084|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=415–442|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0027|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; When working with two separate modes of communication, the one that comes naturally for the user will be the more prominent mode. A study conducted in 1998 showed that signing and speaking at the same time results in a slower approach to instruction than if just one modality was used to express language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Constructing Simultaneous Communication: The Contributions of Natural Sign Language"|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%22Constructing_Simultaneous_Communication:_The_Contributions_of_Natural_Sign_Language%22&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sky-Map.org''' (or '''WikiSky.org''') is a [[wiki]] and interactive sky [[map]] that covers more than half a billion celestial objects. Users can view the whole star sky at once and zoom in to view areas in greater detail. WikiSky includes many stars, galaxies, constellations, and planets, but it is still in development. Users can also edit information about different stars by writing articles, adding Internet links, uploading images, or create a special interest group for a specific task. The website, although still available for users to visit, has not shown much activity since 2010.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Software==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2013}}
Users may browse the sky in several surveys, including [[GALEX]], [[Digitized Sky Survey|DSS]], and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]]. In either mode, the user can access the name and a brief description of visible objects. This can be used to access more detailed information, including articles and different photo images.

Sky-Map.org also has its own API so that code can be written to access maps, objects’ information and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] data. The API that has more functionality than the interactive part of the website currently uses.

{{sociology}}

'''Sociology of architecture''' is the sociological study of  the [[built environment]] and the role and occupation of architects in modern societies.

Architecture is basically constituted of the aesthetic, the engineering and the social aspects. The built environment which is made up of designed spaces and the activities of people are inter-related and inseparable. It is for us to understand this interrelationship and put it down appropriately on paper.
[[Social organization|Social institutions]] are many and these social institutions sometimes need functional spaces to allow the people using the building to benefit from all aspects of both, the purpose of what inhabits the building and by the varied structure and organized flow of communication. The way the buildings are designed to fulfill the needs of these social institutions /social requirements can be said to be the compliance of social aspects in architecture.

==Cultural sociology==
Architecture is the visual shape ("Gestalt") of society. And within that, all the various building types (architecture of consumption, of mobility, of the political and religious, as well as factories, prisons, cinema buildings, etc.) could become objects of architectural sociology. For example: how a specific architecture 'expresses' the structure and principles of a given society.

==Classical sociology of architecture==
Such [[Social research|sociological analysis]] of architecture can be found in the classic authors of sociology in [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Norbert Elias]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Siegfried Kracauer]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Karel Teige]] and others.

==Sociology of architectonic artifacts==
The sociology of technology offers approaches to a sociology of (architectonic) artifacts. Initially, this sociology is interested in technical matters. While buildings (as art and technic) are not in the core of this discipline. The perspective of architecture as artifact would be the question of 'interactions' between architecture and subject: how a very specific architecture suggests certain ways, movements, perceptions.

==Urban sociology and sociology of space==
The term "[[social space]]" is used by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and others (in contrast to architecture or built environment) in a more abstract sense: as social constituted spatial structures. [[Georg Simmel]] founded such a [[sociology of space]] and always watched the architecture of society.

Simmel unfolded also an [[urban sociology]] (his articles were read in [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]]): in his question of the specific ways of life in big cities ( "Big cities and life of spirit", 1903). Urban sociology primarily deals with social structures ''within'' the city: their points are for instance processes of segregation, urbanization and the decline of cities. Recently, there is a research focus on "differences of cities", which will be more associated with a sociology of architecture. [[Ronald Daus]] is introducing new concepts in this area, studying the history of extra-[[Europe]]an [[Megacities]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2651">'''Spectrophilia''' is [[sexual attraction]] to [[ghost]]s or [[sexual arousal]] from images in [[mirror]]s, as well as the alleged phenomenon of sexual encounters between [[ghost]]s and [[human]]s.

==Spectrophilia as a fetish==
Spectrophilia is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] that is classified as the [[paraphilia]] in which one is attracted to ghosts or spirits. Spectrophiliacs fantasize about ghosts and often imagine scenarios involving sexual events between themselves or others and spirits.

==Succubus and Incubus==
In western folklore, the [[succubus]] is a demon or evil spirit who takes on a female human form to seduce men. The succubus most commonly seduces men through intercourse. The succubus is said to take semen from the male for use in impregnating a woman. 

The counterpart of the succubus is the [[incubus]]. The incubus is a demon that is said to take on a male human form. The incubus, much like the succubus, is said to seduce women into sex with the objective of impregnating the woman with its semen.&lt;ref name="csicop1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Stollznow|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/paranormal_paramours |title=CSI &amp;#124; Paranormal Paramours |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that succubi and incubi are spirits or ghosts that have sexual intercourse with men and women classifies the phenomenon as spectrophilia.

==Spectrophilia in folklore==
Many cultures have [[folklore]] involving spirits having sexual relations with humans, including [[Arab culture|Arabic]], [[Greek culture|Greek]], [[Hindu culture|Hindu]], and [[Celts|Celtic]] culture.

==Evidence==
No scientific evidence has been documented on the phenomenon of spectrophilia, though it has become a frequently talked-about subject among [[Ghost hunting|ghost hunters]], including [[Ghost Adventures]] and the [[Travel Channel]]'s show titled ‘Ghostly Lovers’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/Video/who-are-these-ghostly-lovers-11635 |title=Who are these ghostly lovers? : Video |publisher=Travel Channel |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern fiction==
Several films have dealt with the concept, among them ''[[The Entity]]'' (1981), ''[[Ghost_(1990_film)|Ghost]]'' (1990) , Dusk Maiden Of Amnesia (2008) and ''[[It Follows]]'' (2014).

'''Spectroscopy''' {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɛ|k|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|s|k|ə|p|i}} is the study of the interaction between [[matter]] and electromagnetic [[radiation]].&lt;ref name="em-spec" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herrmann |first=R. |author2=C.

Later the concept was expanded greatly to include any interaction with radiative energy as a function of its wavelength or [[frequency]]. Spectroscopic data are often represented by an [[emission spectrum]], a plot of the response of interest as a function of wavelength or frequency.

== Introduction ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Spectroscopy and spectrography are terms used to refer to the measurement of radiation intensity as a function of wavelength and are often used to describe [[experimental]] spectroscopic methods. Spectral measurement devices are referred to as [[spectrometers]], [[spectrophotometers]], [[spectrograph]]s or [[spectral analyzer]]s.

Daily observations of [[color]] can be related to spectroscopy. [[Neon lighting]] is a direct application of [[atomic spectroscopy]]. Neon and other [[noble gases]] have characteristic emission frequencies (colors). Neon lamps use collision of electrons with the gas to excite these emissions. [[Inks]], [[dyes]] and [[paints]] include chemical compounds selected for their spectral characteristics in order to generate specific colors and hues. A commonly encountered [[Emission spectrum|molecular spectrum]] is that of [[nitrogen dioxide]]. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a characteristic red absorption feature, and this gives air polluted with nitrogen dioxide a reddish-brown color. [[Rayleigh scattering]] is a spectroscopic scattering phenomenon that accounts for the color of the sky.

Spectroscopic studies were central to the development of [[quantum mechanics]] and included [[Max Planck]]'s explanation of [[blackbody radiation]], [[Albert Einstein]]'s explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] and [[Niels Bohr]]'s explanation of [[atomic structure]] and spectra. Spectroscopy is used in [[physical chemistry|physical]] and [[analytical chemistry]] because [[atoms]] and [[molecules]] have unique spectra. As a result, these spectra can be used to detect, identify and quantify information about the atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is also used in [[astronomical spectroscopy|astronomy]] and [[remote sensing]] on Earth. Most research [[telescopes]] have spectrographs. The measured spectra are used to determine the chemical composition and [[physical property|physical properties]] of [[astronomical objects]] (such as their [[temperature]] and [[velocity]]).

== Theory ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
One of the central concepts in spectroscopy is a [[resonance]] and its corresponding resonant frequency. Resonances were first characterized in mechanical systems such as [[pendulums]]. Mechanical systems that vibrate or oscillate will experience large amplitude oscillations when they are driven at their resonant frequency. A plot of amplitude vs. excitation frequency will have a peak centered at the resonance frequency. This plot is one type of spectrum, with the peak often referred to as a [[spectral line]], and most spectral lines have a similar appearance.

In quantum mechanical systems, the analogous resonance is a coupling of two quantum mechanical [[stationary state]]s of one system, such as an [[atom]], via an oscillatory source of energy such as a [[photon]]. The coupling of the two states is strongest when the energy of the source matches the energy difference between the two states. The energy &lt;math&gt;(E)&lt;/math&gt; of a photon is related to its frequency &lt;math&gt;(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], and so a spectrum of the system response vs. photon frequency will peak at the resonant frequency or energy. Particles such as [[electron]]s and [[neutron]]s have a comparable relationship, the [[de Broglie relations]], between their kinetic energy and their wavelength and frequency and therefore can also excite resonant interactions.

Spectra of atoms and molecules often consist of a series of spectral lines, each one representing a resonance between two different quantum states. The explanation of these series, and the spectral patterns associated with them, were one of the experimental enigmas that drove the development and acceptance of quantum mechanics. The [[hydrogen spectral series]] in particular was first successfully explained by the [[Bohr model|Rutherford-Bohr quantum model]] of the hydrogen atom. In some cases spectral lines are well separated and distinguishable, but spectral lines can also overlap and appear to be a single transition if the [[density of states|density of energy states]] is high enough. Named series of lines include the [[principal series|principal]], [[sharp series|sharp]], [[diffuse series|diffuse]] and [[fundamental series]].

== Classification of methods ==
[[File:A Taste of ESPRESSO.jpg|thumb|A huge diffraction grating at the heart of the ultra-precise [[ESPRESSO]] spectrograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Taste of ESPRESSO|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1537a/|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Spectroscopy is a sufficiently broad field that many sub-disciplines exist, each with numerous implementations of specific spectroscopic techniques. The various implementations and techniques can be classified in several ways.

===Type of radiative energy===
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}
The types of spectroscopy are distinguished by the type of radiative energy involved in the interaction. In many applications, the spectrum is determined by measuring changes in the intensity or frequency of this energy. The types of radiative energy studied include:
* [[Electromagnetic radiation]] was the first source of energy used for spectroscopic studies. Techniques that employ electromagnetic radiation are typically classified by the wavelength region of the spectrum and include [[microwave spectroscopy|microwave]], [[terahertz spectroscopy and technology|terahertz]], [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared]], [[near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared]], [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet-visible]], [[x-ray spectroscopy|x-ray]], and [[gamma spectroscopy|gamma]] spectroscopy.
* Particles, because of their [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], can also be a source of radiative energy. Both [[electron spectroscopy|electron]] and [[neutron spectroscopy|neutron]] spectroscopy are commonly used. For a particle, its [[kinetic energy]] determines its wavelength.
* [[Spectrogram|Acoustic spectroscopy]] involves radiated pressure waves.
* [[Dynamic mechanical analysis]] can be employed to impart radiating energy, similar to acoustic waves, to solid materials.

===Nature of the interaction===
The types of spectroscopy also can be distinguished by the nature of the interaction between the energy and the material. These interactions include:&lt;ref name="em-spec"&gt;{{cite book | author=Crouch, Stanley | author2=Skoog, Douglas A. | title=Principles of instrumental analysis | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole | location=Australia | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-495-01201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Absorption spectroscopy]]: Absorption occurs when energy from the radiative source is absorbed by the material. Absorption is often determined by measuring the fraction of energy transmitted through the material, with absorption decreasing the transmitted portion.
* [[Emission spectroscopy]]: Emission indicates that radiative energy is released by the material. A material's [[blackbody spectrum]] is a spontaneous emission spectrum determined by its temperature. This feature can be measured in the infrared by instruments such as the atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mariani | first1=Z. | last2=Strong | first2=K. | last3=Wolff | first3=M. | last4=Rowe | first4=P. | year=2012 | title=Infrared measurements in the Arctic using two Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometers | journal=Atmos.

A. | bibcode=2012AMT.....5..329M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission can also be induced by other sources of energy such as [[flame spectroscopy|flames]] or sparks or electromagnetic radiation in the case of [[fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence]].
* [[Elastic scattering]] and [[reflectivity|reflection]] spectroscopy determine how incident radiation is reflected or scattered by a material. [[Crystallography]] employs the scattering of high energy radiation, such as x-rays and electrons, to examine the arrangement of atoms in proteins and solid crystals.
* [[Impedance spectroscopy]]: Impedance is the ability of a medium to impede or slow the transmittance of energy. For [[optics|optical]] applications, this is characterized by the [[index of refraction]].
* [[Inelastic scattering]] phenomena involve an exchange of energy between the radiation and the matter that shifts the wavelength of the scattered radiation. These include [[Raman scattering|Raman]] and [[Compton scattering|Compton]] scattering.
* [[Coherent spectroscopy|Coherent]] or resonance spectroscopy are techniques where the radiative energy couples two quantum states of the material in a [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] interaction that is sustained by the radiating field. The coherence can be disrupted by other interactions, such as particle collisions and energy transfer, and so often require high intensity radiation to be sustained. [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is a widely used resonance method, and [[ultrafast laser spectroscopy]] is also possible in the infrared and visible spectral regions.

===Type of material===
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}
Spectroscopic studies are designed so that the radiant energy interacts with specific types of matter.

====Atoms====
[[Atomic spectroscopy]] was the first application of spectroscopy developed. [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy]] and [[atomic emission spectroscopy]] involve visible and ultraviolet light. These absorptions and emissions, often referred to as atomic spectral lines, are due to [[Atomic structure#Energy levels|electronic transitions]] of outer shell electrons as they rise and fall from one electron orbit to another. Atoms also have distinct x-ray spectra that are attributable to the excitation of inner shell electrons to excited states.

Atoms of different elements have distinct spectra and therefore atomic spectroscopy allows for the identification and quantitation of a sample's elemental composition. [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered new elements by observing their emission spectra. Atomic absorption lines are observed in the solar spectrum and referred to as [[Fraunhofer lines]] after their discoverer. A comprehensive explanation of the [[Hydrogen spectral series|hydrogen spectrum]] was an early success of quantum mechanics and explained the [[Lamb shift]] observed in the hydrogen spectrum, which further led to the development of [[quantum electrodynamics]].

Modern implementations of atomic spectroscopy for studying visible and ultraviolet transitions include [[flame emission spectroscopy]], [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]], [[Glow discharge#Use in analytical chemistry|glow discharge spectroscopy]], [[microwave induced plasma]] spectroscopy, and spark or arc emission spectroscopy. Techniques for studying x-ray spectra include [[X-ray spectroscopy]] and [[X-ray fluorescence]].

====Molecules====
The combination of atoms into molecules leads to the creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states ([[electron paramagnetic resonance]]), [[rotational spectroscopy|molecular rotations]], [[molecular vibration]], and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei and typically lead to spectra in the microwave and millimeter-wave spectral regions. Rotational spectroscopy and microwave spectroscopy are synonymous. Vibrations are relative motions of the atomic nuclei and are studied by both infrared and [[Raman spectroscopy]]. Electronic excitations are studied using visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as [[fluorescence spectroscopy]].

Studies in molecular spectroscopy led to the development of the first [[maser]] and contributed to the subsequent development of the [[laser]].

====Crystals and extended materials====
The combination of atoms or molecules into crystals or other extended forms leads to the creation of additional energetic states. These states are numerous and therefore have a high density of states. This high density often makes the spectra weaker and less distinct, i.e., broader. For instance, blackbody radiation is due to the thermal motions of atoms and molecules within a material. Acoustic and mechanical responses are due to collective motions as well.
Pure crystals, though, can have distinct spectral transitions, and the crystal arrangement also has an effect on the observed molecular spectra. The regular [[lattice structure]] of crystals also scatters x-rays, electrons or neutrons allowing for crystallographic studies.

====Nuclei====
Nuclei also have distinct energy states that are widely separated and lead to [[gamma ray]] spectra. Distinct nuclear spin states can have their energy separated by a magnetic field, and this allows for [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]].

==Other types==

==History==
{{Main|History of spectroscopy}}

The history of spectroscopy began with [[Isaac Newton]]'s optics experiments (1666–1672). Newton applied the word "spectrum" to describe the rainbow of colors that combine to form white light and that are revealed when the white light is passed through a prism. During the early 1800s, [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] made experimental advances with dispersive spectrometers that enabled spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique. Since then, spectroscopy has played and continues to play a significant role in chemistry, physics, and astronomy.

* "In 1672, in the first paper that he submitted to the [[Royal Society]], Isaac Newton described an experiment in which he permitted sunlight to pass through a small hole and then through a prism. Newton found that sunlight, which looks white to us, is actually made up of a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow."&lt;ref name="open-astro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cnx.org/content/col11992/latest/ | title=OpenStax Astronomy | author1=[[Andrew Fraknoi]] | author2=[[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] | date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "In 1802, [[William Hyde Wollaston]] built an improved spectrometer that included a lens to focus the Sun’s spectrum on a screen. Upon use, Wollaston realized that the colors were not spread uniformly, but instead had missing patches of colors, which appeared as dark bands in the [[spectrum]].  Later, in 1815, German physicist [[Joseph Fraunhofer]] also examined the solar spectrum, and found about 600 such dark lines (missing colors), which are now known as [[Fraunhofer lines]], or [[Absorption lines]]."&lt;ref name="open-astro"/&gt;

This article is about the concept in biology. For the concept in physics, see [[Symmetry breaking]].

'''Symmetry breaking''' is the process by which uniformity is broken, or the number of points to view invariance are reduced, to generate a more structured and improbable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Rong|author2=Bruce Bowerman |title=Symmetry Breaking in Biology|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2010|volume=2|issue=3|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003475|pmid=20300216|pages=a003475|pmc=2829966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, symmetry breaking is the event where symmetry along a particular axis is lost to establish a polarity.  [[Cell polarity|Polarity]] is a measure for a biological system to distinguish poles along an axis.  This measure is important because it is the first step to building complexity.  For example, during organismal development, one of the first steps for the embryo is to distinguish its [[Ventral#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal-ventral axis]].  The symmetry-breaking event that occurs here will determine which end of this axis will be the ventral side, and which end will be the dorsal side.  Once this distinction is made, then all the structures that are located along this axis can develop at the proper location.  As an example, during human development, the embryo needs to establish where is ‘back’ and where is ‘front’ before complex structures, such as the spine and lungs, can develop in the right location (where the lungs is placed ‘in front’ of the spine).  This relationship between symmetry breaking and complexity was articulated by [[P.W. Anderson]].  He speculated that increasing levels of broken symmetry in many-body systems correlates with increasing complexity and functional specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Philip W.|title=More is Different|journal=Science|year=1972|volume=177|issue=4047|pages=393–396|doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393|pmid=17796623}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a biological perspective, the more complex an organism is, the higher number of symmetry-breaking events can be found.  Without symmetry breaking, building complexity in organisms would be very difficult.

The importance of symmetry breaking in biology is also reflected in the fact that it’s found at all scales.  Symmetry breaking can be found at the macromolecular level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Fei|title=The Signaling Mechanisms Underlying Cell Polarity and Chemotaxis|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=4|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002980|pmid=20066099|pages=a002980|pmc=2773618}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at the subcellular level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Jonathan|title=Cellular Polarity in Prokaryotic Organisms|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=6|pmid=20457568|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003368|pages=a003368|pmc=2882128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and even at the tissues and organ level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=James W.|title=Remodeling epithelial cell organization: Transitions between front-rear and apical-basal polarity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a000513|pages=a000513|pmc=2742086}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It’s also interesting to note that most asymmetry on a higher scale is a reflection of symmetry breaking on a lower scale.  Cells first need to establish a polarity through a symmetry-breaking event before tissues and organs themselves can be polar.  For example, one model proposes that left-right body axis asymmetry in vertebrates is determined by asymmetry of [[Cilium|cilia]] rotation during early development, which will produces a constant, unidirectional flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babu|first=Deepak|author2=Sudipto Roy |title=Left–right asymmetry: cilia stir up new surprises in the node|journal=Open Biology|year=2013|volume=3|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznetsov|first1=A.

this itself seems to be controlled from the macromolecular level by the cytoskeleton.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are several examples of symmetry breaking that are currently being studied.  One of the most studied examples is the cortical rotation during ''Xenopus'' development, where this rotation acts as the symmetry-breaking event that determines the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing embryo.  This example is discussed in more detail below.
&lt;br&gt;Another example that involves symmetry breaking is the establishment of dendrites and axon during [[neuron]] development, and the PAR protein network in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''. It is thought that a protein called shootin-1 determines which outgrowth in neurons eventually becomes the axon, at it does this by breaking symmetry and accumulating in only one outgrowth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toriyama|first=Michinori|author2=Tadayuki Shimada |author3=Ki Bum Kim |author4=Mari Mitsuba |author5=Eiko Nomura |author6=Kazuhiro Katsuta |author7=Yuichi Sakumura |author8=Peter Roepstorff |author9=Naoyuki Inagaki  |title=Shootin1: A protein involved in the organization of an asymmetric signal for neuronal polarization|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|year=2006|volume=175|issue=1|pages=147–157 |doi=10.1083/jcb.200604160 |pmid=17030985 |pmc=2064506}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PAR protein network works under similar mechanisms, where the certain PAR proteins, which are initially homogenous throughout the cell, break their symmetry and are segregated to different ends of the zygote to establish a polarity during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Motegi|first=Fumio|author2=Geraldine Seydoux |title=The PAR network: redundancy and robustness in a symmetry-breaking system|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|year=2013|volume=368|issue=1629|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0010|pages=20130010|pmc=3785961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cortical Rotation==
'''Cortical rotation''' is a phenomenon that seems to be limited to ''Xenopus'' and few ancient [[Teleostei|teleosts]], however the underlying mechanisms of cortical rotation have conserved elements that are found in other [[chordate]]s.  Research in this area is on-going and changes to the model described below are to be expected.
In fact, the origin of asymmetry in cell division, cell polarity and the mechanism that breaks the symmetry continue to be topics of intense research.  Since the early 1990s, many discoveries have been made leading to a sound model of the mechanism for symmetry breaking.  This article will focus solely on symmetry breaking in the ''[[Xenopus]]'' embryo, an animal model that has wide application.

A sperm can bind a ''Xenopus'' egg at any position of the pigmented animal hemisphere; however once bound this position then determines the dorsal side of the animal.  The dorsal side of the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] is always directly opposite the [[sperm]] entry point.  The reason being the sperm's [[centriole]] acts as an organizing center for the egg’s [[microtubule]]s. While this observation has been known for quite some time, the question of how all of this works is more complicated.  The molecular mechanisms driving dorsal-ventral asymmetry are a fine example of simplicity and complexity inherent in biology.

==Molecular mechanisms==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Xenopus cortical rotation.jpg|thumb|Schematic of ''Xenopus'' embryo showing some of the molecular mechanisms during cortical rotation.  The sperm centriole acts as a (-) end organizer for microtubules in the cytoplasm of the embryo.  The microtubules grow outward toward the plus end and interact with an area of the embryo call the cortex, which has microtubules that organize (+ end) in the direction of the cortical rotation.  The cortex and cytoplasm are differentiated by density, as the cytoplasm contains the dense yolk of the embryo.
During cortical rotation, microtubules are linked via kinesin motors to elements within the cortex (which are linked to the plasma membrane) and the movement along the microtubules allow the kinesin motors to physically shift the cortex.  This alone does not explain dorsal-ventral axis development, as it has been shown to occur without polymerized microtubules, thus movement of these dorsal-determining elements can occur independent of the cortical microtubule array.  These elements, a signalosome which incompasses Dsh, Wnt 11 (mRNA), β-catenin (mRNA), Fz-7, GSK3, likely occur together in vessicles. VegT acts with Wnt 11 at the dorsal side to activate Xnr1 and Nodal genes that propagate development. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
A series of experiments utilizing UV irradiation, cold temperature and pressure (all of which cause microtubule depolymerization) demonstrated that without polymerized microtubules cortical rotation did not occur and resulted in a mutant ventral phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerhart J, Danilchik M, Doniach T, Roberts S, Rowning B, Stewart R |title=Cortical rotation of the ''Xenopus'' egg: consequences for the anteroposterior pattern of embryonic dorsal development |journal=Development |volume=107 |issue=Suppl |pages=37–51 |year=1989 |pmid=2699856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study also revealed that mutant phenotype could be rescued (returned to normal) by physically turning the embryo, thus mimicking cortical rotation and demonstrating that microtubules were not the determinant of dorsal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(80)90082-2 |vauthors=Scharf SR, Gerhart JC |title=Determination of the dorsal-ventral axis in eggs of ''Xenopus laevis'': complete rescue of UV-impaired eggs by oblique orientation before first cleavage |journal=Dev. Biol. |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=181–98 |date=September 1980 |pmid=7409319 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0012-1606(80)90082-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From this it was hypothesized that there were other elements within the embryo being moved during cortical rotation.

To identify these elements, researchers looked for mRNA and protein that demonstrated localization to either the vegetal pole or the dorsal side of the embryo to find candidates.  The early candidates for the determinant were β-catenin and disheveled (Dsh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heasman J, Crawford A, Goldstone K, Garner-Hamrick P, Gumbiner B, McCrea P, Kintner C, Noro CY, Wylie C |title=Overexpression of cadherins and underexpression of beta-catenin inhibit dorsal mesoderm induction in early ''Xenopus'' embryos |journal=Cell |volume=79 |issue= 5|pages=791–803 |year=1994 |pmid=7528101 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90069-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.146.2.427 |vauthors=Miller JR, Rowning BA, Larabell CA, Yang-Snyder JA, Bates RL, Moon RT |title=Establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis in ''Xenopus'' embryos coincides with the dorsal enrichment of dishevelled that is dependent on cortical rotation |journal=J.

The Dsh protein was fused to a GFP and tracked during cortical rotation, it was observed to be in vesicles that were couriered along microtubules to the dorsal side.  This led researchers to look into other candidates of the Wnt pathway.  Wnt 11 was found to be located specifically at the vegetal pole prior to cortical rotation and is moved to the dorsal side where it activates the [[wnt signaling pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tao Q, Yokota C, Puck H, Kofron M, Birsoy B, Yan D, Asashima M, Wylie CC, Lin X, Heasman J |title=Maternal wnt11 activates the canonical wnt signaling pathway required for axis formation in ''Xenopus'' embryos |journal=Cell |volume=120 |issue= 6|pages=857–71 |year=2005 |pmid=15797385 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  VegT, a T-box transcription factor, is localized to the vegetal cortex and upon cortical rotation is released in a gradient fashion into the embryo to regulate mesoderm development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang J, King ML |title=''Xenopus'' VegT RNA is localized to the vegetal cortex during oogenesis and encodes a novel T-box transcription factor involved in mesodermal patterning |journal=Development |volume=122 |issue=12 |pages=4119–29 |date=December 1996 |pmid=9012531 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9012531}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VegT activates Wnt expression, so while not acted on or moved during cortical rotation, it is active in dorsal-ventral axis formation.

The question still remains, how are these molecules being moved to the dorsal side?  This is still not completely known, however evidence suggests that microtubule bundles within the cortex are interacting with kinesin (plus-end directed) motors to become organized into parallel arrays within the cortex and this motion of the motors is the cause of the rotation of the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marrari Y, Rouviere C, Houliston E |title=Complementary roles for dynein and kinesins in the ''Xenopus'' egg cortical rotation |journal=Dev Biol |volume=271 |issue= 1|pages=38–48 |year=2004 |pmid=15196948 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.03.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also unclear is whether Wnt 11 is the main dorsal determinant or is β-catenin also required, as these two molecules have both been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for dorsal development.  This along with all of the other factors are important for activating Nodal genes that propagate normal dorsoventral development.

'''TimeLogic''' is the [[bioinformatics]] division of [[Active Motif, Inc.]] The company is headquartered in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], [[California]]. TimeLogic develops [[FPGA]]-accelerated tools for biological [[Sequence alignment|sequence comparison]] in the field of high performance bioinformatics and biocomputing.

==History==
TimeLogic was founded in 1981 by James W. (Jim) Lindelien and developed one of the first commercial [[Hardware acceleration|hardware-accelerated]] tools for bioinformatics, an FPGA-accelerated version of the [[Smith-Waterman]] algorithm. TimeLogic's DeCypher systems have expanded to provide accelerated implementations of the ubiquitous bioinformatics algorithms [[BLAST]], [[Smith-Waterman]], and [[HMMER]] using [[field programmable gate array]] (FPGA) technology.

In 2003, TimeLogic was acquired by [[Active Motif]],&lt;ref name="GenomeWeb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genomeweb.com/reagent-firm-active-motif-acquires-timelogic |title=Reagent Firm Active Motif Acquires TimeLogic |author=GenomeWeb staff reporter |date=26 August 2003 |work=[[GenomeWeb]] |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a biotechnology reagent company started by [[Invitrogen]] co-founder Joseph Fernandez.

In 2008, TimeLogic formed a partnership with [[Biomatters]] to integrate [[Geneious|Geneious Pro]] with the accelerated algorithms on DeCypher systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=TimeLogic’s latest FPGA technology to be coupled with Geneious Server | date=January 18, 2011 |url=http://www.geneious.com/default,1341,timelogics_latest_fpga_technology_to_be_coupled_with_geneious_server.sm?section=geneious&amp;pageid=1118 |accessdate=20 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, TimeLogic formed a partnership with [[Bielefeld University]]'s Center for Biotechnology (CeBiTec) to jointly develop accelerated computational tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Active Motif and the CeBiTec Form Partnership to Jointly Develop Computational Tools for TimeLogic Corporation's FPGA-Based Hardware Accelerated Bioinformatics Platform |date=November 14, 2011 |url=http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/content/view/246/1/ |accessdate=1 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214162857/http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/content/view/246/1/ |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''values''' embodied in [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; are identified in order to assess significance, prioritize resources, and inform [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] decision-making. It is recognised that values may compete and change over time, and that heritage may have different meanings for different [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].

==Origins==
[[Alois Riegl]] is credited with developing [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s concept of 'voicefulness' into a systematic categorization of the different values of a [[monument]]. In his 1908 essay ''Der moderne Denkmalkultus'' (The modern cult of monuments) he describes historical value, artistic value, age value, commemorative value, use value, and newness value. Riegl demonstrates that some of these values conflict and argues that they may be culturally [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage |author=Stanley Price, Nicholas ''et al.'' (edd.) |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |pages=18–21, 69–83 |ISBN=0-89236-398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charters and Conventions==
The [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] addresses cultural sites of outstanding universal value, from a [[History|historical]], [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[Science|scientific]], [[Ethnology|ethnological]] or [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective, and highlights the need for [[Authenticity (heritage)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide08-en.pdf |title=Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention |pages=13, 94) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussed in the 1964 [[Venice Charter]], values and the question 'why conserve?' are the focus of the 1979 [[Burra Charter]] (last revised 1999). Cultural significance is said to be 'embodied' in the fabric, setting, use, associations, and meanings of a place, and includes aesthetic, historic, scientific, social and spiritual values for past, present and future generations. In order to preserve such values a 'cautious approach' of [[minimum intervention]] is advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australia.icomos.org/wp-content/uploads/BURRA_CHARTER.pdf |title=Burra Charter (''vid.''

==Practice==
[[Significance assessment]] typically includes consideration of the rarity, representativeness, and communicative power of assets and their values. These are then managed in order to sustain and valorize that significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/folklore/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |title=The Subtle Power of Intangible Heritage: Legal and Financial Instruments for Safeguarding Intangible Heritage |pages=36f |author=Deacon, Harriet (et al.) |publisher=[[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|HSRC Press]] |year=2004 |ISBN=978-0-7969-2074-4 |access-date=16 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012222850/http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/folklore/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/publications/docs/conservationprinciplespoliciesandguidanceapril08web.pdf |title=Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance for the Sustainable Management of the Historic Environment |pages=21ff |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engagement with the economic value of heritage may help promote its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/pdf_publications/econrpt.pdf |title=Economics and Heritage Conservation |page=54 |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vietnamese calligraphy''' (Vietnamese Quốc ngữ: thư pháp Việt Nam, Hán Nôm: 書法越南) refers to the [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] traditions of Vietnam.  It can refer to calligraphic works using a variety of scripts, including [[Chinese characters]], [[Chữ nôm]], and the Latin-based [[Quốc ngữ]].  Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts.  However, due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc ngữ, modern Vietnamese calligraphy also uses Roman characters.

Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China.  As part of the East Asian cultural spheres, Classical Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. For example, during the [[Lý dynasty]], its style was very much similar to China’s [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), during the [[Trần dynasty]], it was influenced strongly by China’s [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960-1279) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1271-1368) dynasties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/life-style/350055/new-book-tells-story-of-vn-calligraphy.html#6ebrFO7wJy6J0uqO.97|title=New book tells story of VN calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|work=Vietnam News|access-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nonetheless, over time, Vietnam developed its own styles of calligraphy for writing both Classical Chinese and [[Chữ Nôm|Chữ nôm]]. In [[Lê dynasty|Later Le dynasty]], Vietnam developed a unique style of calligraphy which was called Nam tự (南字）by Phạm Đình Hổ (範廷琥) in his book Vũ Trung Tùy Bút (雨中隨筆)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vũ Trung Tùy Bút|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was first used in bureaucracy only, but later became popular in all writing purposes. It was also called Lệnh Thư (令書) in Việt Sử Toát Yếu (越史撮要) because of its bureaucratic characteristic at first&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Việt Sử Toát Yếu|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In modern times, calligraphy has been done frequently in the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ script, as Chữ nôm and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnamese neglect Han-Nom heritage|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/220749/vietnamese-neglect-han-nom-heritage.html|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quốc Ngữ calligraphy gained popularity during the [[Vietnamese poetry#New poetry movement|New Poetry]] and [[Vietnamese poetry#Free poetry movement|Free Poetry Movements]], due to the increasing popularity of using the Vietnamese vernacular, as well as influence from French literature.  Modern Vietnamese calligraphy is undoubtedly influenced by modern Latin [[cursive]], but is written using the [[ink brush|calligraphy brush]], rather than quill or reed pens as is done in Western calligraphy.  Much as Chinese calligraphy is used to write poems, festive banners, signage, and so on, Vietnamese calligraphy can also serve the same purpose today.
