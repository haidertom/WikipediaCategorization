'''Amdo Jampa''' (born 1911 in [[Jainca County|Chentsa]], [[Amdo]], [[Tibet]], died {{date|March 28, 2002}}, [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], [[China]]), also known as '''Jampa Tseten''', was a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] painter.

== Biography ==
[[File:Die drei großen religiösen Könige.jpg|thumb|''The Three Great Dharma Kings'' by Amdo Jampa, Drepung]]
Amdo Jampa was known for his photo-realistic style. He made famous portraits of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.&lt;ref name="TIN"&gt;[http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2002&amp;m=5&amp;p=24-2_5 Obituary of the painter Amdo Jampa], TIN, 22 May 2002 / no of pages: 3 {{ISSN|1355-3313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first Tibetan artists to study at a Chinese art college.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

He was a student of the Tibetan scholar and artist [[Gendün Chöphel]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

As a teenager, he became a monk at [[Drepung Monastery]] and study traditional Tibetan thangka painting. He left Drepung when he accompanied the Dalai Lama to [[Beijing]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

There, he studied traditional Chinese painting and Western painting techniques under the guidance of the Chinese teacher Li Zhongjin.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

When he came back in Lhasa in 1956, he was commissioned to paint in the Tagtu Mingyur Podrang new palace recently completed in the [[Norbulingka]]. His murals merged a traditional Tibetan style with a modern one. The innovation he introduced was that his portraits were easily recognisable.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

The [[Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama]], later asked Amdo Jampa a portrait, which he also realised in realist style.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Amdo Jampa travelled to India in the 1980s. He performed paintings for religious buildings for the Dalai Lama in [[Dharamshala]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

He returned to Lhasa, Tibet. According to Drangchar, a Tibetan magazine, he occupied the official positions of Chairman of the Tibet Fine Arts Association and Chief Research Officer of the Central Executive Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Museum of Cultural Artefacts. He opened an art school in Shol village, before the Potala Palace.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Amdo Jampa's paintings spread in Tibet and influenced Tibetan contemporary painting. 
Hence, before 1996 when the Chinese ban on Dalai Lama pictures, many monasteries had such a picture in the style of Amdo Jampa's famous painting of the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

According to Gonkar Gyatso, a Tibetan artist from Lhasa now in the UK, Amdo Jampa is the most important Tibetan modern artist. He was trained in the 1950s at thangka painting and he was the only one to perform original works different from traditional painting and had the support of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] for his creative work. His paintings were partly influenced by painters such as [[Vittore Carpaccio]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

For [[Jamyang Norbu]], Amdo Jampa was influenced by Gendun Choephel who travelled in India and knew Indian Buddhist and Hindu art as well as European art, as seen in his nudes and dancers. Like other Tibetan artists, Amdo Jampa did not produce anything during the [[Cultural Revolution]] years.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Even at an old age, Amdo Jampa walked every day around Lhasa, performing a ''[[Kora (pilgrimage)|kora]]''. He was survived by his wife, 2 daughters and 2 sons.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

}}  "An antipattern is just like a pattern, except that instead of a solution it gives something that looks superficially like a solution, but isn't one."&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by a book, ''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns]]'', which highlights a number of [[design pattern]]s in [[software development]] that its authors considered to be highly reliable and effective.

The term was popularized three years later by the book ''[[AntiPatterns]]'', which extended its use beyond the field of software design to refer informally to any commonly reinvented but bad solution to a problem. Examples include [[analysis paralysis]], [[cargo cult programming]], [[death march (software development)|death march]], [[groupthink]] and [[vendor lock-in]].

== Definition ==
According to the authors of ''Design Patterns'', there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:

# A commonly used process, structure, or pattern of action that despite initially appearing to be an appropriate and effective response to a problem, has more bad consequences than good ones.
# Another solution exists that is documented, repeatable, and proven to be effective.

==== Object-oriented programming ====
*[[Anemic domain model]]: The use of the [[domain model]] without any [[business logic]].  The domain model's objects cannot guarantee their correctness at any moment, because their validation and mutation logic is placed somewhere outside (most likely in multiple places). Martin Fowler considers this to be an anti-pattern, but some disagree that it is always an anti-pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/sapm/2014/02/04/the-anaemic-domain-model-is-no-anti-pattern-its-a-solid-design/|title = The Anaemic Domain Model is no Anti-Pattern, it’s a SOLID design|date = 4 February 2014|accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = SAPM: Course blog|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Cargo cult programming]]: Using patterns and methods without understanding why
*[[Coding by exception]]: Adding new code to handle each special case as it is recognized

I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c), the human compiler, at work. When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I'm using abstractions that aren't powerful enough— often that I'm generating by hand the expansions of some macro that I need to write.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Error hiding]]: Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message. This anti-pattern is also named ''Diaper Pattern''. Also can refer to erasing the [[Stack trace]] during exception handling, which can hamper debugging.

{{History of Greece}}
'''Archaic Greece''' was the period in [[History of Greece|Greek history]] lasting from the eighth century BC to the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|pp=1&amp;ndash;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Greek Dark Ages]] and succeeded by the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]]. The period began with a massive increase in the Greek population&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1980|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of significant changes which rendered the Greek world at the end of the eighth century as entirely unrecognisable as compared to its beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Anthony Snodgrass, the Archaic period in ancient Greece was bounded by two revolutions in the Greek world.  It began with a "structural revolution" which "drew the political map of the Greek world" and established the ''[[Polis|poleis]]'', the distinctively Greek city-states, and ended with the intellectual revolution of the Classical period.&lt;ref name="Snodgrass 1980 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1980|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archaic period saw developments in Greek politics, economics, international relations, warfare, and culture.  It laid the groundwork for the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], both politically and culturally.  It was in the Archaic period that the [[Greek alphabet]] developed, that the earliest surviving Greek literature was composed, that monumental sculpture and red-figure pottery began in Greece, and that the [[hoplite]] became the core of Greek armies.  In [[Athens]], the earliest institutions of the democracy were implemented under [[Solon]], and the reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] at the end of the Archaic period brought in Athenian democracy as it was during the Classical period.  In [[Sparta]], many of the institutions credited to the reforms of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] were introduced during the period, the region of [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenia]] was brought under Spartan control, [[helot]]age was introduced, and the [[Peloponnesian League]] was founded, making Sparta a dominant power in Greece.

==Historiography==
[[File:Gymnasion and Palaestra in Olympia 2010 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of ancient ruins.|The [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and [[palaestra]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the site of the ancient Olympic games.  The Archaic period conventionally dates from the first Olympiad.]]
The word "archaic" derives from the Greek word ''archaios'', which means "old". It refers to the period in ancient Greek history before the Classical. The period is generally considered to have lasted from the beginning of the eighth century BC until the beginning of the fifth century BC,&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the foundation of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in 776 BC and the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC forming notional start and end dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2009|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archaic period was long considered to have been less important and historically interesting than the Classical period, and was primarily studied as a precursor to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, Archaic Greece has come to be studied for its own achievements.&lt;ref name="Snodgrass 1980 13"/&gt; With this reassessment of the significance of the Archaic period, some scholars have objected to the term "archaic", due to its connotations in English of being primitive and outdated. No term which has been suggested to replace it has gained widespread currency, however, and the term is still in use.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 1"/&gt;

Much of our evidence about the Classical period of ancient Greece comes from written histories, such as Thucydides' [[History of the Peloponnesian War]].  By contrast, we have no such evidence from the Archaic period.  We have written accounts of life in the period in the form of poetry, and epigraphical evidence, including parts of law codes, inscriptions on votive offerings, and epigrams inscribed on tombs.  However, none of this evidence is in the quantity for which we have it in the Classical period.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What is lacking in written evidence, however, is made up for in the rich archaeological evidence from the Archaic Greek world.  Indeed, where much of our knowledge of Classical Greek art comes from later Roman copies, all of the surviving Archaic Greek art is original.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 6"&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources for the period are the traditions recorded by later Greek writers such as [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 5"/&gt;  However, these traditions are not part of any form of history as we would recognise it today; those transmitted by Herodotus he recorded whether or not he believed them to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Herodotus does not even record any dates before 480 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political developments==

Politically, the Archaic period saw the development of the [[polis]] (or city-state) as the predominant unit of political organisation. Many cities throughout Greece came under the rule of autocratic leaders, called "tyrants". The period also saw the development of law and systems of communal decision-making, with the earliest evidence for law codes and constitutional structures dating to the period. By the end of the Archaic period, both the Athenian and Spartan constitutions seem to have developed into their classical forms.

}}
The Archaic period saw significant urbanisation, and the development of the concept of the ''polis'' as it was used in Classical Greece.  By Solon's time, if not before, the word "polis" had acquired its classical meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2007|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the emergence of the polis as a political community was still in progress at this point,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2007|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; the polis as an urban centre was a product of the eighth century.&lt;ref name=Hall-43&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2007|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the polis did not become the dominant form of socio-political organisation throughout Greece in the Archaic period, and in the north and west of the country it did not become dominant until some way into the Classical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2007|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The urbanisation process in Archaic Greece known as "[[synoecism]]" &amp;ndash; the amalgamation of several small settlements into a single urban centre &amp;ndash; took place in much of Greece in the eighth century BC.  Both Athens and [[Argos]], for instance, began to coalesce into single settlements around the end of that century.&lt;ref name=Hall-43/&gt;  In some settlements, this physical unification was marked by the construction of defensive city walls, as was the case in [[Smyrna]] by the middle of the eighth century BC, and [[Corinth]] by the middle of the seventh century BC.&lt;ref name=Hall-43/&gt;

It seems that the evolution of the polis as a socio-political structure, rather than a simply geographical one, can be attributed to this urbanisation, as well as a significant population increase in the eighth century.  These two factors created a need for a new form of political organisation, as the political systems in place at the beginning of the Archaic period quickly became unworkable.&lt;ref name=Hall-43/&gt;

====Athens====
{{see also|History of Athens}}
Though in the early part of the Classical period [[Athens|the city of Athens]] was both culturally and politically dominant,&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2007 6"/&gt; it was not until the late sixth century BC that it became a leading power in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempted coup by [[Cylon of Athens]] may be the earliest event in Athenian history which is clearly attested by ancient sources, dating to around 636.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|pp=368&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, it seems that Athens' monarchy had already been ended and the [[eponymous archon|archonship]] had replaced it as the most important executive office in the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|pp=364&amp;ndash;5}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the archonship could only be held by members of the [[Eupatridae]], the families which made up Athens' aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest laws of Athens were established by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]], in 621/0;&lt;ref name="Cantarella 2005 239"&gt;{{harvnb|Cantarella|2005|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; his law on homicide was the only one to have survived to the Classical period.  Draco's law code aimed to replace private revenge as the first and only response of an individual to an offence committed against them.&lt;ref name="Cantarella 2005 239"/&gt;  The law code of Draco, however, failed to prevent the tensions between the rich and poor which were the impetus to Solon's reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 594/3 BC, [[Solon]] was appointed "[[archon]] and mediator".&lt;ref name=Andrewes-377&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what his reforms consisted of is uncertain.  He claimed to have taken up the ''horoi'' to set the land free, but the exact meaning of ''horoi'' is unknown;&lt;ref name=Andrewes-377/&gt; their removal seems, however, to have been part of the problem of ''hektemoroi'' &amp;ndash; another word whose meaning is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Solon was also credited with abolishing slavery for debtors,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishing limits on who could be granted Athenian citizenship.&lt;ref name=Andrewes-384&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solon instituted radical constitutional reform, replacing noble birth as a qualification for office with income.&lt;ref name=Andrewes-384/&gt;  The poorest &amp;ndash; called [[thetes]] &amp;ndash; could hold no offices, although they could attend the Assembly and the law courts, while the richest class &amp;ndash; the [[pentacosiomedimni]] &amp;ndash; were the only people eligible to become treasurer, and possibly archon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He set up the Council of the Four Hundred,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for discussing motions which were to come before the [[ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, Solon substantially reduced the powers of the archon by giving citizens the right of appeal; their case was judged by the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrewes|1982|pp=388&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sparta====
[[File:Altes Museum - Relief mit Heroen und Adoranten.jpg|thumb|''Relief with Heroes and Worshipers'', circa 540 BC, Chrysapha (east of [[Sparta]]).]]
{{see also|History of Sparta}}
Sparta's constitution took on the form it would have in the Classical period during the eighth century BC.&lt;ref name="Hammond 1982 329"&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1982|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thucydides]], the Spartan constitution was roughly four-hundred years old, which would place the semi-legendary lawgiver [[Lycurgus of Sparta]] as being active during the late 9th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, A. R. (1982). ''The Pelican History of Greece''. London: Penguin. pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great|last=Bury|first=J.

===Colonization===

{{see also|Greek colonies}}
[[File:Agrigente 2008 IMG 1935.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the [[Temple of Heracles, Agrigento]], Sicily, within the [[Valle dei Templi]], built in the late 6th century BC during the late Archaic period]]

In the eighth and seventh centuries BC, Greeks began to spread across the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=BoardmanHammond-xiii&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements.  These [[Greek colonies]] were not, as Roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right.&lt;ref name=BoardmanHammond-xiii/&gt;

Greeks settled outside of Greece in two distinct ways.  The first was in permanent settlements founded by Greeks, which formed as independent poleis.  The second form was in what historians refer to as ''emporia''; trading posts which were occupied by both Greeks and non-Greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods.  Examples of this latter type of settlement are found at [[Al Mina]] in the east and [[Pithekoussai]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Greek colonies were on [[Sicily]].  Many of these were founded by people from [[Chalcis]], but other Greek states, such as [[Corinth]] and [[Megara]] were also responsible for early colonies in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the eighth century BC, Greek settlements in southern Italy were also well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|pp=206&amp;ndash;207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventh century, Greek colonists expanded the areas that they settled.  In the west, colonies were founded as far afield as [[Marseille]]s. In the east, the north Aegean, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea all saw colonies founded.&lt;ref name=Antonaccio-207&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant coloniser in these parts was [[Miletus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, early colonies such as Syracuse and Megara Hyblaia began to themselves establish colonies.&lt;ref name=Antonaccio-207/&gt;

In the west, Sicily and southern Italy were some of the largest recipients of Greek colonisers.  Indeed, so many Greek settlements were founded in southern Italy that it was known in antiquity as [[Magna Graecia]] &amp;ndash; "Great Greece".  It has been observed that in the last quarter of the eighth century, new Greek settlements were founded in Sicily and southern Italy at an average rate of one every other year, and Greek colonists continued to found cities in Italy until the mid-fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonaccio|2007|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaic Greece from the mid-seventh century BC has sometimes been called an "Age of Tyrants".  The word ''τύραννος'' (''tyrannos'', whence the English "tyrant") first appeared in Greek literature in a poem of [[Archilochus]], to describe the Lydian ruler [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1998|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest Greek tyrant was [[Cypselus]], who seized power in Corinthe in a coup in 655 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was followed by a series of others in the mid-seventh century BC, such as [[Orthagoras of Sicyon|Orthagoras]] in [[Sicyon]] and [[Theagenes of Megara|Theagenes]] in Megara.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various explanations have been provided for the rise of tyranny in the seventh century BC.  The most popular of these explanations dates back to [[Aristotle]], who argued that tyrants were set up by the people in response to the nobility becoming less tolerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As there is no evidence from the time that the nobility were becoming increasingly arrogant during the period, modern explanations of seventh century tyranny have tried to find other reasons for unrest among the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Against this position, Drews argues that tyrannies were set up by individuals who controlled private armies, and that early tyrants did not need the support of the people at all,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1972|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Hammond suggests that tyrannies were established as a consequence of in-fighting between rival oligarchs, rather than between the oligarchs and the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1982|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recently historians have begun to question the existence of a seventh century "age of tyrants".  In the Archaic period, the Greek word ''tyrannos'', according to Victor Parker, did not have the negative connotations it had gained by the time Aristotle wrote his ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]''.  When Archilochus used the word tyrant, it was synonymous with ''[[anax]]'' (an Archaic Greek word meaning "king").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1998|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker dates the first use of the word ''tyrannos'' in a negative context to the first half of the sixth century, at least fifty years after [[Cypselus]] took power in Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1998|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the time of [[Thucydides]] that ''tyrannos'' and ''basileus'' ("king") were consistently distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|1998|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Greg Anderson has argued that Archaic Greek tyrants were not considered illegitimate rulers,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|pp=173&amp;ndash;174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be distinguished from any other rulers of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
[[File:Olympia_-_Temple_of_Hera_3.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Hera, Olympia|Temple of Hera]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] was built in the Archaic period, circa  590 BC]]
Greek population doubled during the eighth century, resulting in more and larger settlements than previously. This was part of a wider phenomenon of population growth across the Mediterranean region at this time, which may have been caused by a climatic shift that took place between 850 and 750, which made the region cooler and wetter. This led to the expansion of population into uncultivated areas of Greece and was probably also a driver for colonisation abroad.&lt;ref name="Morris 2009 66–67"&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from human remains shows that average age at death increased over the Archaic period, but there is no clear trend for other measures of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of houses gives some evidence for prosperity within society; in the eighth and seventh centuries, the average house size remained constant around 45–50 m², but the number of very large and very small houses increased, indicating increasing economic inequality. From the end of the seventh century, this trend reversed, with houses clustering closely around a growing average.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{main|Agriculture in ancient Greece}}
[[File:Cratère de Vix 0023.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Vix Krater]], an imported Greek wine-mixing bronze vessel found in the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]]/[[La Tène culture|La Tène]] grave of the "[[Vix, Côte-d'Or|Lady of Vix]]", [[Burgundy]], France, c. 500 BC]]
Not all arable land in Greece was yet under cultivation in the Archaic period. Farms appear to have been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements. They were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster. [[Crop rotation]] was practiced, alternating between [[legumes]] and [[cereals]] ([[barley]] and [[durum]]), and the land was left fallow every other year. Alongside these, farmers cultivated vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables as [[cash crop]]s for sale in local centres and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|pp=26–28}}; {{harvnb|van Wees|2009|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock were of secondary importance. Sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wees|2009|pp=450–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly, but were expensive to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses and large herds of cattle were the preserve of the mega-rich.

This pattern had probably developed before the beginning of the period and remained relatively consistent throughout it. The idea that it was preceded by a period of [[pastoralism]] and that agriculture only became dominant in the course of the Archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=27}}; {{harvnb|van Wees|2009|pp=450–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; No technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of [[manure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source for the practice of agriculture in the period is [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'', which gives the impression of very small subsistence holdings in which the owner performed most of the labour personally; close reading reveals that much of the produce is to be sold for profit, much of the work to be performed by slaves (''douloi'' or ''dmoes''), and much of the owner's time to be spent away from the farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wees|2009|pp=445–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves' labour was supplemented by labourers who worked for a wage, as [[sharecropping|sharecroppers]] (called ''[[hektemoroi]]'' at Athens), or to pay off debts; this practice seems to have increased in the eighth century as the growth of the population increased the number of workers available, and intensified in the seventh century with the development of legally enforced debts and the status of the labourers increasingly becoming a source of social strife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wees|2009|pp=451–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris 2009 66–67"/&gt;

===Trade===
By the late eighth century BC, the Archaic Greek world had become involved in an active trade network around the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was this trade network which was the source of the [[Orientalizing period|orientalizing influence on Greek art]] in the early part of the Archaic period.  Meanwhile, to the west, trade between Corinth and [[Magna Graecia]] in Southern Italy and Sicily was booming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern trade mainly involved the Greek islands, with [[Aegina]], for instance, acting as an intermediary between the east and the Greek mainland.&lt;ref name=Markoe-55&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  East Greek states would go on to become extremely prosperous through the sixth century due to the trade with Asia and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the mainland cities, those on the coast were the biggest recipients of trade from the east, especially Corinth.&lt;ref name=Markoe-55/&gt;

In the early part of the Archaic period, Athens does not seem to have been particularly actively involved in this eastern trade, and very few examples of eastern imports have been found in Athens from the eighth or early seventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|pp=55&amp;ndash;57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, nearby [[Euboea]] had trade-links with the east as early as the first half of the eighth century,&lt;ref name="Jeffery 1982 823"&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffery|1982|p=823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest pottery from the Greek islands found at [[Al Mina]] in modern Syria is from Euboea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffery|1982|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the sixth century, Greece was part of a trade network spanning the entire Mediterranean.  Sixth century Laconian pottery has been found as far afield as Marseilles and Carthage to the west, Crete to the south and Sardis to the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1979|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;Greece is too dry and warm for bread wheat, already in the Archaic period this was imported from the Black Sea. {{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=27}}; olive oil and wine particularly good trade&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Coinage===
{{main|Ancient Greek coinage#Archaic period}}
[[File:Aegina Stater achaic.jpg|thumb|left|Silver [[stater]] of [[Aegina]], 550–530 BC.]]
At the beginning of the Archaic period, coinage had not yet been invented. The Greeks measured the value of objects or fines using certain valuable objects, such as oxen, tripods, and metal spits, as [[unit of account|units of account]]. As in the Near East, precious metal [[bullion]] was used as a [[medium of exchange]], principally [[gold]] at first, but mainly [[silver]] by the beginning of the sixth century. The weight of this bullion (often known as [[hacksilber]]) was measured using standard units, named for their value in terms of metal spits (''obeloi'') and handfuls (''drachmai'') of metal spits; these terms would later be used as names for Greek coin denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kroll|2012|pp=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ATTICA, Athens. Circa 545-525-15 BC.jpg|thumb|The earliest coinage of [[Athens]], circa 545–525/15 BC]]
Coinage was invented in [[Lydia]] around 650 BC. It was quickly adopted by Greek communities in western Asia Minor, although the older system of bullion remained in use as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Konuk|2012|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island of [[Aegina]] began to issue its distinctive "turtle" coins before 550 BC, and from there coinage spread to Athens, Corinth and the [[Cycladic Islands]] in the 540s BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheedy|2012|pp=106, 110}}; {{harvnb|Van Alfen|2012|p=89}}; {{harvnb|Psoma|2012|p=166ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Italy and Sicily before 525 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutter|2012|p=128ff.}}; {{harvnb|Fischer-Bossert|2012|p=143ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thrace before 514 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Psoma|2012|p=157ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these coinages were very small and were mostly only used within the community that issued them, but the "turtles" of Aegina (from 530 or 520 BC) and the "owls" of Athens (from 515 BC) were issued in great quantity and exported throughout the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheedy|2012|p=107}}; {{harvnb|Van Alfen|2012|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The images on coins initially changed rapidly, but increasingly each community settled on a single image or set of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Konuk|2012|pp=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were the symbol or image of an important deity in the city or visual puns on the city's name,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the city of [[Phocaea]] issued coins depicting a seal (''phoke'', in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; but in many cases their meaning is obscure and may not have been chosen for any special reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spier|1990|pp=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Athens coin discovered in Pushkalavati.jpg|thumb|A late Achaic coin of [[Athens]] (circa 500/490–485 BC) discovered in [[Pushkalavati]] in [[Ancient India]]. This coin is the earliest known example of its type to be found so far east.&lt;ref name="CNG 199773"&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=199773 "A Truly International Currency", Triton XV, Lot: 1163, ATTICA, Athens], CNG Coins&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The reasons for the rapid and widespread adoption of coinage by the Greeks are not entirely clear and several possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, have been suggested. One possibility is the increased ease of commerce which coinage allowed. Coins were of standardised weights, which meant that their value could be determined without weighing them. Furthermore, it was not necessary for users of coinage to spend time determining whether the silver was pure silver; the fact that the coin had been issued by the community was a promise that it was worth a set value.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kroll|2012|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that coinage was adopted specifically to enable communities to make payments to their citizens, mercenaries and artisans in a transparent, fair and efficient way. Similarly, when wealthy members of the community were required [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|to contribute wealth]] to the community for festivals and the equipment of navies, coinage made the process more efficient and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1996|pp=267–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third possibility, that coinage was adopted as an expression of a community's independence and identity, seems to be anachronistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1996|p=261}}; in more detail: {{harvnb|Martin|1986|ch=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, the Archaic period is characterised by a shift towards representational and naturalistic styles.  It was the period in which monumental sculpture was introduced to Greece, and in which [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Development of vase painting|Greek pottery styles went through great changes]], from the repeating patterns of the late [[Geometric art|geometric period]] to the earliest [[Red-figure pottery|red figure vases]].  The early part of the Archaic period saw [[Orientalizing period|distinctive orientalizing influences]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in pottery and in sculpture.  The period was also an innovative period in Greek literature, with the development of the Greek alphabet, and the composition of the earliest surviving Greek poetry.

Life-size human sculpture in hard stone began in Greece in the Archaic period.&lt;ref name=Boardman-450&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was inspired in part by ancient Egyptian stone sculpture:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; the proportions of the [[New York Kouros]] exactly correspond to Egyptian rules about the proportion of human figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Greece, these sculptures best survive as religious dedications and grave markers, but the same techniques would have also been used to make cult images.&lt;ref name=Boardman-450/&gt;

The best-known types of Archaic sculpture are the [[kouros]] and [[kore (sculpture)|kore]], near life-size frontal statues of a young man or woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|pp=269–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were developed around the middle of the seventh century BC in the [[Cyclades]].&lt;ref name=Hurwit-274&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Probably the earliest kore produced was the [[Dedication of Nikandre]], which was dedicated to [[Artemis]] at her temple on [[Delos]] between 660 and 650 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; while kouroi began to be created shortly after this.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|pp=271–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some kouroi, such as the [[Colossus of the Naxians]] from around 600 BC, are known to represent Apollo,&lt;ref name=Hurwit-274/&gt; while the [[Phrasikleia Kore]] was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the seventh century around 650 BC when kore are widely introduced, Daedalic style made an appearance in Greek sculpture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashmole|first=Bernard|date=December 1936|title=Review: Daedalic Art|url=https://www.jstor.org.proxy.wm.edu/stable/705500|journal=The Classical Review|volume=50|pages=|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00078057}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style consisted most noticeably of a geometric pattern of female subjects' hair framing their face. On male sculptures they were often posed with one foot in front, as if in motion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over the course of the sixth century, kouroi from Attica become more lifelike and naturalistic.  However, this trend does not appear elsewhere in the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The genre began to become less common over the last part of the sixth century as the elites who commissioned kouroi declined in influence, and by around 480 kouroi were no longer made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The period saw a shift in the decoration of Greek pottery from abstract to figurative styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boardman|1982|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Greek Dark Ages]], following the fall of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]], Greek pottery decoration had been based around increasingly elaborate geometrical patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human figures first appeared on Greek pots in Crete in the early part of the ninth century BC, but did not become common on mainland Greek pottery until the middle of the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eighth century saw the development of the [[Orientalizing Period|orientalizing style]], which signalled a shift away from the earlier [[geometric style]] and the accumulation of influences derived from [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria]].  This orientalizing influence seems to have come from goods imported to Greece from the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the seventh century BC, vase painters in [[Corinth]] began to develop the [[black-figure pottery|black figure style]].  At the same time, potters began to use incisions in the clay of vases in order to draw outlines and interior detailing.&lt;ref name="Markoe-53"&gt;{{harvnb|Markoe|1996|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This adoption of incision, probably taken from eastern metalwork, allowed potters to show fine details of their decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|1998|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Archaic period drew to a close, [[red-figure pottery]] was invented in Athens, with the first examples being produced about 525 BC, probably by the [[Andokides painter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|pp=278&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the red-figure technique in Athens came at around the same time as the development of other techniques such as the [[white ground technique]] and [[Six's technique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hurwit|2007|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

{{main|Ancient Greek literature}}
The earliest extant Greek literature comes from the Archaic period.  Poetry was the predominant form of literature in the period.&lt;ref name=Power16-58&gt;{{harvnb|Power|2016|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside the dominant [[Greek lyric|lyric]] and [[epic poetry|epic]] traditions, [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]] began to develop in the archaic period, borrowing elements from the pre-existing genres of archaic Greek poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Power|2016|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the sixth century BC the first written prose in Greek literature appeared.&lt;ref name=Power16-58/&gt;

Though there would certainly have been a pre-existing literary tradition in Greece, the earliest surviving works are by [[Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homer's poetry, though it dates to around the time that the Greeks developed writing, would have been composed orally – the earliest surviving poetry to have certainly been composed in writing is that of [[Archilochus]], from the mid-seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast with the Classical period, in which the literary culture of Athens dominated the Greek world, Archaic poetic tradition was geographically spread out.  [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], for instance, were from Lesbos, while [[Pindar]] came from Thebes, and [[Alcman]] from Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kurke|2007|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
{{main|History of the Greek alphabet}}
After the end of the [[Mycenaean period]], the art of writing was lost in Greece: by the ninth century probably no Greeks understood the Bronze Age [[Linear B]] writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1980|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the ninth century BC, however, objects inscribed with [[Phoenicia]]n writing began to be brought into the Greek world, and it was from this [[Phoenician script]] that the [[Greek alphabet]] developed in the eighth century BC.  By the middle of the eighth century BC, pottery inscribed in Greek begins to occur in the archaeological record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known inscriptions in Greek tend to identify or explain the object on which they are inscribed.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 1982 831"&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffery|1982|p=831}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Possibly the earliest known Greek inscription is found on a jug from the first half of the eighth century BC, discovered in Osteria dell'Osa in Latium.&lt;ref name=Osborne09-104&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2009|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most early inscriptions were written in verse, though some from Ionia were in prose, influenced by the prose traditions of Ionia's eastern neighbours.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 1982 831"/&gt;  From the beginning of the seventh century, curses and dedications began to be inscribed on objects,&lt;ref name=Osborne09-104/&gt; and by the sixth century, surviving inscriptions include public records such as law codes, lists of officials, and records of treaties.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 1982 831"/&gt;

In the Archaic period, the most significant military development was the adoption of [[hoplite]] warfare by the Greek states.  This occurred in the early part of the seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2007|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[panoply]], or hoplite's armour, began to appear in the eighth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2007|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest known example comes from Argos in the late eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2007|loc=figure 5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the pieces which made up the panoply were all in use in Greece by the end of the eighth century, our first evidence for it being worn as a complete set of armour does not come until around 675 BC, where it is depicted on a Corinthian vase painting.&lt;ref name="Snodgrass 1965 110"&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1965|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adoption of the phalanx tactics which would be used by hoplites in the Classical period does not appear to have taken place until the mid-seventh century;&lt;ref name="Snodgrass 1965 110"/&gt; before this point, the older style of combat in which spears were thrown at the enemy before closing quarters was still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1965|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the naval sphere, the Archaic period saw the development of the [[trireme]] in Greece.  In the eighth century, Greek navies began to use ships with two banks of oars, and the three banked trireme seems to have become popular in the seventh century.&lt;ref name=Hunt-124&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|2007|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corinth was probably the first place in the Greek world to adopt the trireme in the mid seventh century BC.&lt;ref name=Hunt-124/&gt;  It was not until the mid-sixth century, however, that the trireme became the most popular design for Greek battleships, due to its expense.&lt;ref name=Hunt-124/&gt;  According to Thucydides, the period saw the first Greek naval battles; he dates the first to around 664 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snodgrass|1965|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art criticism''' is the discussion or evaluation of visual art.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gemtou|first=Eleni|title=Subjectivity in Art History and Art Criticism|journal=Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities|year=2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=2–13|url=http://rupkatha.com/V2/n1/SubjectivityinArtHistoryandArt%20Criticism.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art critics]] usually criticise art in the context of [[aesthetics]] or the theory of beauty.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marty.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/marty_kaplan/article/the_curious_case_of_criticism "The curious case of criticism."] ''Jewish Journal''.  23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of [[Art movement|artistic movements]] has resulted in a division of art criticism into different disciplines which may each use different criteria for their judgements.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; The most common division in the field of criticism is between historical criticism and evaluation, a form of art history, and contemporary criticism of work by living artists.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;

Despite perceptions that art criticism is a much lower risk activity than making art, opinions of current art are always liable to drastic corrections with the passage of time.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Critics of the past are often ridiculed for either favouring artists now derided (like the [[Academic art|academic painters]] of the late 19th century){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} or dismissing artists now venerated (like the early work of the [[Impressionists]]).&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rewald1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=James S.|title=Art History and the Problems of Criticism|journal=Daedalus|date=Winter 1960|volume=89|issue=1 – The Visual Arts Today|pages=253–263|jstor=20026565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art movements themselves were named disparagingly by critics, with the name later adopted as a sort of badge of honour by the artists of the style (e.g., [[Impressionism]], [[Cubism]]), with the original negative meaning forgotten.&lt;ref name="rewald1973"&gt;Rewald, John (1973).

Artists have often had an uneasy relationship with their critics. Artists usually need positive opinions from critics for their work to be viewed and purchased; unfortunately for the artists, only later generations may understand it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seenan|first=Gerard|title=Painting by ridiculed but popular artist sells for £744,800|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/20/arts.artsnews1|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art is an important part of being human and can be found through all aspects of our lives, regardless of the culture or times. There are many different variables that determine one's judgment of art such as aesthetics, cognition or perception. Art can be objective or subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form. It can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance. Art is a basic human instinct with a diverse range of form and expression. Art can stand-alone with an instantaneous judgment or can be viewed with a deeper more educated knowledge. Aesthetic, pragmatic, expressive, formalist, relativist, processional, imitation, ritual, cognition, mimetic and postmodern theories are some of many theories to criticize and appreciate art. Art criticism and appreciation can be subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form, or it can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Definition==
Art criticism has many and often numerous subjective viewpoints which are nearly as varied as there are people practising it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; It is difficult to come by a more stable definition than the activity being related to the discussion and interpretation of art and its value.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Depending on who is writing on the subject, "art criticism" itself may be obviated as a direct goal or it may include [[art history]] within its framework.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Regardless of definitional problems, art criticism can refer to the [[history of art|history of the craft]] in its essays and art history itself may use critical methods implicitly.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; According to art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], "The borders between art history and art criticism... are no more as firmly drawn as they once used to be. It perhaps began with art historians taking interest in modern art."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Art criticism includes a descriptive aspect,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; where the work of art is sufficiently translated into words so as to allow a case to be made.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of a work of art that follows the description (or is interspersed with it) depends as much on the artist's output as on the experience of the critic.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6" /&gt; There is in an activity with such a marked subjective component a variety of ways in which it can be pursued.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; As extremes in a possible spectrum,&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5" /&gt; while some favour simply remarking on the immediate impressions caused by an artistic object,&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; others prefer a more systematic approach calling on technical knowledge, favoured [[aesthetic theory]] and the known sociocultural context the artist is immersed in to discern their intent.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of art criticism}}
Critiques of art likely originated with the origins of art itself, as evidenced by texts found in the works of [[Plato]], [[Vitruvius]] or [[Augustine of Hippo]] among others, that contain early forms of art criticism.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Also, wealthy [[patron]]s have employed, at least since the start of [[Renaissance]], intermediary art-evaluators to assist them in the procurement of commissions and/or finished pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton E.|title=What Did the Renaissance Patron Buy?|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Summer 1998|volume=51|issue=2|pages=392–450|url=http://classroom.kleinisd.net/users/1243/docs/what_did_the_renaissance_patron_buy.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Renaissance Society of America|doi=10.2307/2901572|jstor=2901572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Alexander|title=Negotiating the Gift: Pre-Modern Figurations of Exchange|year=2003|pages=319–360|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/nagel_PDFs/Art_as_Gift_lq.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|chapter=Art as Gift: Liberal Art and Religious Reform in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Jonathan Richardson by Jonathan Richardson.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] coined the term 'art criticism' in 1719.]]
Art criticism as a genre of writing, obtained its modern form in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; The earliest use of the term art criticism was by the English painter [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] in his 1719 publication ''An Essay on the Whole Art of Criticism''. In this work, he attempted to create an objective system for the ranking of works of art. Seven categories, including drawing, composition, invention and colouring, were given a score from 0 to 18, which were combined to give a final score. The term he introduced quickly caught on, especially as the English middle class began to be more discerning in their art acquisitions, as symbols of their flaunted social status.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and England in the mid 1700s, public interest in art began to become widespread, and art was regularly exhibited at the Salons in Paris and the [[Summer Exhibition]]s of London. The first writers to acquire an individual reputation as art critics in 18th-century France were [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] with his ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'' (1718)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubos|first=Jean-Baptiste|title=Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture|year=1732|publisher=E.

The 18th-century French writer [[Denis Diderot]] greatly advanced the medium of art criticism. Diderot's "The Salon of 1765"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diderot|first=Denis|title=Essais sur la peinture|year=1795|publisher=François Buisson|location=Paris|pages=118–407|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_000033125010886956|editor=François Buisson|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first real attempts to capture art in words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morley|first=John|authorlink=John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|editor=Hugh Chisholm, Franklin Henry Hooper|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=DIDEROT, DENIS|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_08.djvu/222|accessdate=10 December 2012|edition=11th|year=1911|volume=8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Thomas E. Crow]], "When Diderot took up art criticism it was on the heels of the first generation of professional writers who made it their business to offer descriptions and judgments of contemporary painting and sculpture. The demand for such commentary was a product of the similarly novel institution of regular, free, public exhibitions of the latest art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Thomas E.|title=Diderot on Art, Volume I: The Salon of 1765 and Notes on Painting|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=x|editor=Denis Diderot|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in England an exhibition of the [[Society of Arts]] in 1762 and later, in 1766, prompted a flurry of critical, though anonymous, pamphlets. Newspapers and periodicals of the period, such as the ''[[London Chronicle]]'', began to carry columns for art criticism; a form that took off with the foundation of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.
In the 1770s, the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' became the first newspaper to systematically review the art featured at exhibitions.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:John Ruskin - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]], the preeminent art critic of 19th century England.]]
From the 19th century onwards, art criticism became a more common vocation and even a profession,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; developing at times formalised methods based on particular [[aesthetic theory|aesthetic theories]].&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a rift emerged in the 1820s between the proponents of traditional [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] forms of art and the new [[romanticism|romantic]] fashion. The Neoclassicists, under [[Étienne-Jean Delécluze]] defended the classical ideal and preferred carefully finished form in paintings. Romantics, such as [[Stendhal]], criticized the old styles as overly formulaic and devoid of any feeling. Instead, they championed the new expressive, Idealistic, and emotional nuances of Romantic art. A similar, though more muted, debate also occurred in England.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the prominent critics in England at the time was [[William Hazlitt]], a painter and essayist. He wrote about his deep pleasure in art and his belief that the arts could be used to improve mankind's generosity of spirit and knowledge of the world around it. He was one of a rising tide of English critics that began to grow uneasy with the increasingly abstract direction [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s landscape art was moving in.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the great critics of the 19th century was [[John Ruskin]]. In 1843 he published ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in which he robustly defended the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] from his critics, who charged Turner with being unfaithful to nature. Through painstaking analysis and attention to detail, Ruskin was able to demonstrate the very opposite, in what the art historian [[E. H. Gombrich]] called "the most ambitious work of scientific art criticism ever attempted." Ruskin became renowned for his rich and flowing prose, and later in life he branched out to become an active and wide-ranging critic, publishing works on architecture and [[Renaissance art]], including the ''[[Stones of Venice]]''.

[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''Salon of 1845'' art review shocked its audience with its ideas.]]
Another dominating figure in 19th-century art criticism, was the French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], whose first published work was his art review ''Salon of 1845'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Curiosités esthétiques: Salon 1845–1859|year=1868|publisher=M.

He tried to move the debate from the old binary positions of previous decades, declaring that "the true painter, will be he who can wring from contemporary life its epic aspect and make us see and understand, with colour or in drawing, how great and poetic we are in our cravats and our polished boots".&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

In 1877, [[John Ruskin]] derided ''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'' after the artist, [[James McNeill Whistler]], showed it at [[Grosvenor Gallery]]:&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Linda, ''After Whistler: The Artist and His Influence on American Painting.''

===Turn of the twentieth century===
[[File:Roger Fry self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Self portrait of [[Roger Fry]], described by the [[art historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]] as "incomparably the greatest influence on taste since [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]... In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry".&lt;ref&gt;IAN CHILVERS. "Fry, Roger." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists. 2003. Encyclopedia.com. 9 March 2009 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.Retrieved 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Towards the end of the 19th century a movement towards abstraction, as opposed to specific content, began to gain ground in England, notably championed by the playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. By the early twentieth century these attitudes formally coalesced into a coherent philosophy, through the work of [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, as art critic &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_artcritic.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Group Profiles &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/group.htm#bellc|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an art historian in the 1890s, Fry became intrigued with the new modernist art and its shift away from traditional depiction. His 1910 exhibition of what he called [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] art attracted much criticism for its iconoclasm. He vigorously defended himself in a lecture, in which he argued that art had moved to attempt to discover the language of pure imagination, rather than the staid and, to his mind, dishonest scientific capturing of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, ideas &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_ideas.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, modern art &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_modernart.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's argument proved to be very influential at the time, especially among the progressive elite. [[Virginia Woolf]] remarked that: "in or about December 1910 [the date Fry gave his lecture] human character changed."&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

Independently, and at the same time, [[Clive Bell]] argued in his 1914 book ''Art'' that all art work has its particular 'significant form', while the conventional subject matter was essentially irrelevant. This work laid the foundations for the [[formalism (art)|formalist]] approach to art.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tekiner|first=Deniz|title=Formalist Art Criticism and the Politics of Meaning|journal=Social Justice|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2 (104) – Art, Power, and Social Change|pages=31–44|jstor=29768369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Fry argued that "it’s all the same to me if I represent a Christ or a [[saucepan]] since it's the form, and not the object itself, that interests me." As well as being a proponent of [[formalism (art)|formalism]], he argued that the value of art lies in its ability to produce a distinctive aesthetic experience in the viewer. an experience he called "aesthetic emotion". He defined it as that experience which is aroused by significant form. He also suggested that the reason we experience aesthetic emotion in response to the significant form of a work of art was that we perceive that form as an expression of an experience the artist has. The artist's experience in turn, he suggested, was the experience of seeing ordinary objects in the world as pure form: the experience one has when one sees something not as a means to something else, but as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4XeRgAACAAJ|title=Art|author=Clive Bell|year=2010|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=9781770451858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Read]] was a champion of modern British artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] and became associated with Nash's contemporary arts group Unit One. He focused on the [[modernism]] of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and published an influential 1929 essay on the meaning of art in ''The Listener''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Paul Nash (1889–1946)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/paul-nash|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Ben Nicholson (1894–1982)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/ben-nicholson|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Henry Moore (1898–1986)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/henry-moore|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/barbara-hepworth|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the trend-setting ''Burlington Magazine'' (1933–38) and helped organise the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
As in the case of Baudelaire in the 19th century, the poet-as-critic phenomenon appeared once again in the 20th, when French poet [[Apollinaire]] became the champion of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Katharine |title=The Cubist Painters by Guillaume Apollinaire; Peter Read|journal=French Forum|date=Spring 2005|volume=30|issue=2|pages=139–141|jstor=40552391|doi=10.1353/frf.2005.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Timothy|title=Apollinaire and Cubism?|journal=Style|date=Summer 1988|volume=22|issue=2|pages=275–298|url=http://mlpa.nottingham.ac.uk/archive/00000033/01/Rec_Mathews.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, French writer and hero of the Resistance [[André Malraux]] wrote extensively on art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Derek|title=Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi}}&lt;/ref&gt; going well beyond the limits of his native Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudek|first=Antony|title=The Vocal Turn|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|year=2012|volume=10|issue=1|pages=64–65|doi=10.5334/jcms.1011210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction that the vanguard in Latin America lay in [[Mexican Muralism]] ([[José Clemente Orozco|Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]]){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} changed after his trip to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1958. After visiting the studios of several Argentine artists in the company of the young Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Buenos Aires [[Rafael Squirru]], Malraux declared the new vanguard to lie in [[Argentina]]'s new artistic movements.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Squirru, a poet-critic who became Cultural Director of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] in [[Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], during the 1960s, was the last to interview [[Edward Hopper]] before his death, contributing to a revival of interest in the American artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Gail|title=Edward Hopper : an intimate biography|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]]) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the [[New York Vanguard]].&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=The Art Story: Gallery – The Art of This Century Gallery|url=http://www.theartstory.org/gallery-art-of-this-century.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]] who functioned as critics as well.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-robert-motherwell-13286 |title=Oral history interview with Robert Motherwell, 1971 Nov. 24-1974 May 1 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Motherwell|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-motherwell-1673|publisher=Tate|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Chronology of the Artist's Life page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although New York and the world were unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury" /&gt; by the late 1940s most of the artists who have become household names today had their well established patron critics.&lt;ref name="oxfordart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Painters in Postwar New York City|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/public/page/benz/themes/PostwarNYC|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Barnett Newman, [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Abstract Expressionism|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-abstract-expressionism.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uima.uiowa.edu/mural/ Jackson Pollock, ''Mural'' (1943)] [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]], Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenberg55"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Clement|title=American-Type Painting|journal=[[Partisan Review]]|year=1955|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Abstract Expressionism: Painting Action and Colorfields|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/abstract-expressionism.html|work=Color Vision &amp; Art|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php|publisher=The Barnett Newman Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibitions – Adolph Gottlieb|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/home/content/exhibitions/special/gottlieb/gottlieb.html|publisher=The Jewish Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Hofmann: Biography|url=http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|publisher=The Estate of Hans Hofmann|accessdate=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129075738/http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de&amp;nbsp;Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Mark|author2=Annalyn Swan|title=When de Kooning Was King|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=8 November 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/10248/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Harold Rosenberg|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-rosenberg-harold.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas B. Hess]], the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Thomas B. Hess|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hess-thomas.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers" or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.:13&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, in 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] "became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Biennale of Venice. New York's two leading art magazines were not interested. ''Arts'' mentioned the historic event only in a news column and ''Art News'' (Managing editor: Thomas B. Hess) ignored it completely. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' printed feature articles".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/5750568&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]] wrote catalogue forewords and reviews and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Session at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pgs.: 240–241, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter to [[Sidney Janis]] on 9 April 1955: {{quotation|It is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, p.: 201, University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York [[Trotskyist]], [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordart"/&gt; As long time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; Artist [[Robert Motherwell]], well-heeled, joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Robert Motherwell, Master of Abstract, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/obituaries/robert-motherwell-master-of-abstract-dies.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement Greenberg proclaimed [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. Greenberg supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever "purer" and more concentrated in what was "essential" to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:154–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New,'' Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", Da Capo Press, 1959 pp.:23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Abstract Expressionism at the time was ''New York Times'' art critic [[John Canaday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=John Canaday|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-canaday-john.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] were also important postwar art historians who voiced support for Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|title=A Critic Turns 90; Meyer Schapiro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/magazine/a-critic-turns-90-meyer-schapiro.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Kristi|title=Remembering Leo Steinberg (1920–2011)|url=http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2011/03/15/remembering-leo-steinberg-1920-2011.html|work=The Chicago Blog|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early to mid sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Michael Fried|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-fried-michael.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Robert Hughes|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hughes-robert.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art criticism===
[[Feminist art criticism]] emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=N.paradoxa|date=September 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of art criticism.

==Today==

Art critics today work not only in print media and in specialist art magazines as well as newspapers. Art critics appear also on the internet, TV, and radio, as well as in museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="ntifotva"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Criticism|url=http://art.unt.edu/ntieva/pages/teaching/tea_comp_artcriticism.html|work=Comprehensive Art Education|publisher=North Texas Institute For Educators on the Visual Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gratza|first=Agnieszka|title=Frieze or faculty?

Art critics curate exhibitions and are frequently employed to write exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Art critics have their own organisation, a [[UNESCO]] non-governmental organisation, called the [[International Association of Art Critics]] which has around 76 national sections and a political non-aligned section for refugees and exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association of Art Critics|url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100031328|work=UNESCO NGO – db|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art blogs===
{{Main|Art blog}}

Since the early 21st century, online art critical websites and art blogs have cropped up around the world to add their voices to the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Tyler|title=Tyler Green|url=http://www.nyfa.org/level3.asp?id=283&amp;fid=6&amp;sid=17|work=In Their Own Words|publisher=New York Foundation for the Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Michael|title=The Death of Criticism or Everyone Is a Critic|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-kaiser/the-death-of-criticism-or_b_1092125.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these writers use [[social media]] resources like Facebook, Twitter, [[Tumblr]] and [[Google+]] to introduce readers to their opinions about art criticism.

The '''Hotel Casino de la Selva ''' (Forest Casino Hotel) was a hotel and casino located in the city of [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico. 
The main building was opened in 1931 as a hotel and casino, but from 1934 it was used only as a hotel.
Additions in the late 1950s included buildings designed by the architect [[Félix Candela]] that were roofed by reinforced concrete paraboloid shells.
The interior was decorated with murals by well-known Mexican and Spanish artists.
After the 1970s the hotel went into decline, and in 1994 was sold to a hotel chain that failed to pay taxes on the property.
It was seized by the Mexican government and was auctioned off in 2001 as a site for construction of a [[discount store]] and a [[hypermarket]].
After demolition had begun there was a public outcry, and eventually some parts of the murals were preserved.

==History==
===Initial construction (1931)===

Cuernavaca in the early 1930s held the homes of several former generals who later became presidents, [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]].
It was also often visited by foreigners, particularly Anglo-Saxons.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}
The first constitutional governor of [[Morelos]] state, Vicente Estrada Cajigal&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Vicente Estrada Cajigal|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;, authorized construction of a casino complex in Cuernavaca by the Compañía Hispanoamericana de Hoteles.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}
This was  a consortium of Mexican businessmen backed by President [[Abelardo L. Rodríguez]].{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}
[[Manuel Suárez y Suárez]], an [[Asturias|Asturian]] entrepreneur, was the building contractor.
The Casino de la Selva was inaugurated in 1931 near the train station.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}

The layout was relatively simple.
There was a large fountain at the entrance, then a main driveway between two blocks of rooms, one on each side.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}
The drive led to the main hall, used as the gaming room.
There was also an Olympic swimming pool, a pediment and some other facilities.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
The grounds contained bungalows set within the surrounding Amanalco Forest.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
Hundreds of the trees were at least 100 years old.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=17}}
Two of them were estimated to be over 1,000 years old.{{sfn|Goldberg|2008|p=67}}
The {{convert|10|ha}} site held springs and a wide variety of plant species. 
There was evidence of pre-Hispanic culture that could have dated to over 1500 years ago.{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=2}}
The pre-Columbian site was first excavated in the 1940s.{{sfn|Goldberg|2008|p=67}}

===Early years (1931–46)===
[[File:Manuel Suarez y Suarez sculpture.jpg|thumb|Detail of sculpture of Manuel Suárez at [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], Mexico City]]

The Casino de la Selva was briefly the most luxurious watering spot in the Americas until the Garci-Crespo Hotel opened in [[Tehuacán]] in 1934.{{sfn|Walsh|2018|p=141}}
However, the owners were unable to pay their debts to the state or to the builders.
Manuel Suárez was the main creditor and acquired the property in 1934.
That year the new president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] took office. 
One of his first decrees banned gambling in Mexico since he saw casinos as centers of vice.
Suárez retained the property but ran it purely as a hotel.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
Suárez and the Valencian architect [[Jesús Martí Martín]] founded the company Vías y Obras, which built facilities in the ports of [[Veracruz]], [[Acapulco]] and other cities. 
Suárez built the Hotel Mocambo in Veracruz, and was involved in other industries, including sugar mills.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}

In 1938 [[Malcolm Lowry]] moved to Cuernavaca to work on his novel ''[[Under the Volcano]]'', and described the hotel in the first chapter,{{sfn|Veitch|2006|p=128}}
{{quote|The Hotel Casino de la Selva stands on a slightly higher hill just outside the town, near the railway station. It is built far back from the main highway and surrounded by gardens and terraces which command a spacious view in every direction. Palatial, a certain air of desolate splendour pervades it. For it is no longer a Casino. You may not even dice for drinks in the bar. The ghosts of ruined gamblers haunt it. No one ever seems to swim in the magnificent Olympic pool. The spring-boards stand empty and mournful. Its jai-alai courts are grass-grown and deserted. Two tennis courts only are kept up in the season.{{sfn|Lowry|2000|loc=PT23–24}} }}

===Expansion (1946–70)===
In 1946 the Casino de la Selva was closed so that Vías y Obras could undertake various enlargements under the direction of Martí.
The two blocks of rooms were each given a second floor, and a French-style garden was laid out in the area between them.
New rooms were added to the main building.
Other additions included a large convention hall, a bowling alley and cafeteria, a walkway around the Olympic pool, two more pools and sandy areas to give a beach-like atmosphere.
The effect was much like the Hotel Mocambo.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
[[Félix Candela]] came to Mexico to escape the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] in Spain and worked for Vías y Obras from 1942 to 1947.
He helped the architect Martí in his renovation of the Casino de la Selva.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}

Candela is best known for his reinforced concrete shells, which he introduced to Mexico.
These are based on [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s, in which straight beams can be used to build a [[saddle roof]], and can cover large spans with minimal thickness.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
At the end of the 1950s the construction company of the brothers Félix, Antonio and Julia Candela built a dining room attached to an auditorium, and a non-denominational chapel in place of the fountain at the entrance, all with shell roofs.
Candela's pupil, the architect Juan Antonio Tonda&lt;sup&gt;([[:se:Juan Antonio Tonda Magallón|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;, designed the shells and about 30 bungalows in the south of the site and oversaw construction.
Later the chapel was converted to a nightclub, the Club Jano, and then the Discoteca Mambo.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}

[[File:Felix candela en Casino.jpg|thumb|Dining room in front of the auditorium]]
The dining room, the ''Salón de los Relojes'' (Salon of the Clocks), had a roof formed of five paraboloid sections with a large clock hanging from the central point where the arcs intersected showing the times of places around the world.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
The auditorium, reached via the ''Salón de los Relojes'', had a single hyperbolic paraboloid roof and contained the mural ''La farándula'' (Showbiz) by the Mexican artist [[Francisco Icaza]], a tribute to the German playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
After 1965 Suárez started various unfinished projects such as a monorail below the pools and a forum to hold large murals by [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].
Later this project was transferred to Mexico City where it became the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], leaving the building at the Casina de la Selva unfinished.
The result of these later works was increasing diversity of architectural styles and growing maintenance costs.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
Lilia Suárez, daughter of the owner, assumed management of the Casino de la Selva in 1966.{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}

===Decline and abandonment (1970–2001)===

From the 1970s until his death Suárez put most of his energy into the [[Hotel de México]] (now the [[World Trade Center Mexico City|World Trade Center]]) in the Federal District, a project that grew out of control. The Casino de la Selva was neglected and used only by foreign tourists.
Suárez died in 1987.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}
After this the hotel was used as a spa, and was sometimes rented for events such as wedding celebrations and graduations.
Cuernavaca continued to expand, but most development happened outside the city center, which had expanded to include the hotel.
A bus station was built beside the hotel and in 1991 the Plaza Cuernavaca shopping center opened to its east.
In 1994 Suárez's heirs sold the property to the Grupo Situr-Sidek, a hotel company.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}
The deed of sale does not seem to have included any stipulation that the murals were to be preserved.{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}
In 1996 the group defaulted on $63.7 million of taxes it owed to the Mexican government, and the Ministry of Finance seized the property.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}

The Hotel Casino de la Selva was abandoned for several years and deteriorated quickly.
The heritage authorities chose not to evaluate the property.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}
Ownership was transferred to the Fondo Bancario de Protección al Ahorro ([[Fobaproa]]: Bank Fund for the Protection of Savings).{{sfn|Laxer|Soron|2006|p=164}}
By 2001 the buildings had deteriorated badly, with murals crumbling from neglect, bat guano on interior walls, and litter and human excrement covering the floor of the main salon that held some of the finest murals.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
The buildings and over {{convert|4|ha}} of green land were sold in 2001 for 10 million pesos, well below market value.
The cultural wealth contained in the property was not declared.{{sfn|Laxer|Soron|2006|p=164}}

[[File:Mural de Reyes Meza.jpg|thumb|Fragmento of mural by the artist [[José Reyes Meza]] ]]
Suárez wanted the hotel to be a gathering place for intellectuals and artists, and commissioned various works of art for the walls and gardens.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
He hired Mexican and Spanish artists such as [[José Reyes Meza]] and [[Josep Renau]] to decorate the walls with murals showing Mexican history from the pre-Columbian period to the modern age.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}
The murals would cover an area of {{convert|600|m2}}.{{sfn|Casino de la Selva, golpe al patrimonio artístico}}
The hotel became the center of cultural activity in Cuernavaca and was visited by artists, writers and political activists.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}

The former gaming room in the main hall came to be called the Salón de los Murales.
The Spanish Republican artist [[Josep Renau]] painted a mural there of "La Hispanidad" a history of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the time of the [[Phoenicia]]ns to the conquest of America.
The other side of the room held a 1965 mural by [[José Reyes Meza]] that depicted indigenous culture in the [[Valley of Mexico]].
The hall also had a mural of ''The Apocalypse'' by Jorge Flores, a disciple of [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
Renau's ''Mural de la conformacion hispanica'', painted with his wife Manuela Ballester&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Manuela Ballester|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;, depicted the conquest and colonization of America by the Spanish and covered more than {{convert|300|m2}}.{{sfn|Fernanda Mancebo|2004|p=60}}
The walls of the rooms and corridors also held the work of  [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Dr. Atl]], [[Benito Messeguer]], [[Jorge González Camarena]], [[Francisco Icaza]], [[Victor Moscoso]] and others.{{sfn|Vargas|2001}}{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=1}}

Sculptures in the gardens included pre-Hispanic allegories by Federico Canessi&lt;sup&gt;([[:de:Federico Canessi|de]])&lt;/sup&gt; and works by Antonio Ballester.
A large equestrian statue of [[Hernán Cortés]] by the Spanish sculptor Florentino Aparicio was installed late in 1962.{{sfn|Hanke|1964|p=339}}
Suárez provided the hotel with a pottery workshop directed by Aparicio, where several noted potters learned their art.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
In 1980 the ceramicist Gustavo Pérez Mirada was able to rent the workshop for a nominal sum with the help of his friend [[Ida Rodríguez Prampolini]].{{sfn|Pérez|2005|p=75}}

In 1969 the mother of Lilia Rossbach was director of the hotel.
She offered the author [[Carlos Monsiváis]] an old bungalow as a quiet space where he could write a book, his ''Días de guardar'', published in 1971.{{sfn|Rossbach|2013|p=258}}
Rafael Buñuel, son of the filmmaker [[Luis Buñuel]], spent six months living at the casino in 1971–72 developing avante-garde theatrical works, which were staged over the next four years.
[[Carmen Montejo]] and [[Sergio Jiménez]] came to give classes to the performers.
The pianist Alfonso Morquecho performed at the hotel.{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}

The Mexican painter and muralist Gerardo Murillo, better known as [[Dr. Atl]], was among the best known guests. 
Dr. Atl would hold marathon conversations from three to four in the afternoon in the dining room with other visitors such as [[Mario Orozco Rivera]] and [[Benito Messeguer]].{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}
A fragment of Dr. Atl's mural, ''Architectural view of the City of Puebla'', is preserved in the [[Chapultepec Castle]].{{sfn|Bravo|2006}}
[[Leonora Carrington]] lived in the casino while they built her house in Cuernavaca.
[[Jules Dassin]] visited with [[Joseph Losey]] and [[Richard Burton]], planning to film ''Under the Volcano'', but the project fell through due to funding problems.{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}

==Demolition controversy==

The property was sold at auction in 2001 to a joint venture of the American [[Costco]] discounter and the Mexican [[Comercial Mexicana]] supermarket chain.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
The partner companies quickly began to clear the site for construction of two giant stores, uprooting trees and tearing down many of the buildings.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
Costco said they would invest over $30 million in the Club de Precios (Price Club) store, which would generate 1,500 temporary and 500 permanent jobs.{{sfn|Casino de la Selva, golpe al patrimonio artístico}}
When the plans became public the [[Civic Front for the Defense of the Casino de la Selva]] was formed by local environmentalists, preservationists and small business owners, asking the city to maintain the hotel and turn the land around it into a park.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=17}}

[[File:Fragmento mural casino.jpg |thumb|Fragment of one of the murals]]
The issue quickly gained national and international media attention.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
The painter José Reyes Meza was refused access to inspect the state of the murals.{{sfn|Bautista|2001}}
On 14 July 2001 it was reported that the Josep Renau Foundation of Valencia, Spain, had sent a communiqué to [[Kōichirō Matsuura]] of [[UNESCO]] asking him to exert pressure on the Mexican government to hold responsible those causing this "damage to the universal cultural heritage".{{sfn|Bautista|2001}}
The Civic Front organization filed lawsuits, organized a boycott of Costco's other Mexican stores, and held public demonstrations outside the construction site entrance.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}

A group of [[Morelos]] state deputies drafted a proposal to urge the Federal [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] (INAH) and [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes]] (INBA) to conserve the historical and archaeological cultural heritage on the site.{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=1}}
They described the damage to the murals due to demolition of part of the shell of the Casino de la Selva building as an act of aggression against the cultural heritage of humanity.{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=1}}
They called on the City of Cuernavaca to take into consideration the opinion of the citizens, suspend the work and prepare a comprehensive plan for conservation and use of the cultural, historial and ecological resources.{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=1}}

In August 2002 demonstrators held a lengthy sit-in, calling for access to the site so they could count the remaining trees.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|pp=88–89}}
On 21 August 2001 protestors blocked access to the property for eight hours before being evicted by the authorities.
31 of the demonstrators were arrested and accused of riot, sabotage, assault, blocking public roads and incitement to crime.{{sfn|Miranda|2002}}
On 23 August 2002 the state authorities transferred 31 opponents of the shopping centre project who had refused to pay bail to Atlacholoaya prison and deployed 360 troops around the entrance to the site to prevent the arrival of a group of supporters from [[San Salvador Atenco]], México.{{sfn|Miranda|2002}}
Six days later 15,000 people marched in protest through downtown Cuernavaca.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=89}}
Eventually the company agreed to save the murals and part of the surrounding forest.{{sfn|Amador Tello|2011}}
The hotel was demolished in the fall of 2002.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=17}}
During the excavation figurines and prehispanic ceramics were found.
The INAH tried to intervene but was too late to stop the work.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}

==Aftermath==

Within a year the new Costco outlet and the new mega supermarket opened in two huge concrete blocks surrounded by a sea of asphalt.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=89}}
In 2003 the UN High Commission on Human Rights in Mexico condemned the project and criticized the local authorities for using excessive force in removing the protesters from the site.{{sfn|Goldberg|2008|p=67}}
One of the organizers of the protests, Flor Guerrero, described the failure to protect the Casino de la Selva as symbolic of Mexico's acceptance of the U.S. free-trade gospel. 
{{quote|Our struggle to defend the Casino de la Selva was basically a struggle against neo-liberalism. We see neo-liberalism here in our country as an economic, cultural, and political penetration at every level. In Latin America today, it isn't armies that are conquering us, it's megastores, transnational corporations. The Casino de la Selva is a dramatic case that should be held up as an example on a global scale. It was a devastating attack against our culture, our art and our environment.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=90}} }} 
Another local resident gave a different view, saying "They said we were all against those stores, but the stores may bring more benefits than harm. New jobs and investment were created, and there's a greater variety of products to choose from in those stores. Besides, the Casino de la Selva hotel never belonged to the people."{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=92}}

Costco opened an art museum named the Museo Muros to hold the Renau and Reyes Meza murals that had been salvaged as well as the [[Jacques Gelman|Gelman]] collection of Mexican art.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}
A reinforced concrete shell was built next to the museum in imitation of the Salón de los Relojes.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72–73}}
The shell was poorly executed and does not achieve the feeling of lightness that was characteristic of Candela's work.
The museum was boycotted by the activists of the Frente Ciudadano Pro-Casino de la Selva and received very few visitors.
In 2008 the Gelman collection was withdrawn and in November 2008 the museum became a branch of the Papalote Museo del Niño.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=73}}

'''Crystal Cubism''' (French: ''Cubisme cristal'' or ''Cubisme de cristal'') is a distilled form of [[Cubism]] consistent with a shift, between 1915 and 1916, towards a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes. The primacy of the underlying geometric structure, rooted in the abstract, controls practically all of the elements of the artwork.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

This range of [[Style (visual arts)|styles]] of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920 (also referred to as the ''Crystal Period'', ''classical Cubism'', ''pure Cubism'', ''advanced Cubism'', ''late Cubism'', ''synthetic Cubism'', or the ''second phase of Cubism''), was practiced in varying degrees by a multitude of artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]—[[Henri Laurens]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]] most noticeably of all. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the French poet and art critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020545 Christopher Green, ''Late Cubism'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference that proceeded from a cohesive stance toward art and life.

As post-war reconstruction began, so too did a series of exhibitions at Léonce Rosenberg's [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]]: order and the allegiance to the aesthetically pure remained the prevailing tendency. The collective phenomenon of Cubism once again—now in its advanced revisionist form—became part of a widely discussed development in French culture. Crystal Cubism was the culmination of a continuous narrowing of scope in the name of a [[return to order]]; based upon the observation of the artists relation to nature, rather than on the nature of reality itself.&lt;ref name="Inside Modernism"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=gpPDpEYRA90C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Crystal+Cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HsCDYfw3KE&amp;sig=nw_h8YuUu7Q9HjoPJIFfwCbTsgE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pKpiVZiMGszcUfGjgKgN&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Crystal%20Cubism%22&amp;f=false Thomas Vargish, Delo E. Mook, ''Inside Modernism: Relativity Theory, Cubism, Narrative'', Yale University Press, 1999], p. 88, {{ISBN|0300076134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Cubism, and its associative ''rappel à l’ordre'', has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader [[Ideology|ideological]] transformation towards [[conservatism]] in both French society and [[Culture of France|French culture]]. In terms of the separation of culture and life, the Crystal Cubist period emerges as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

==Background==

===Beginnings: Cézanne===
[[File:Paul Cézanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Paul Cézanne]], 1888, ''Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin)'', oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]
Cubism, from its inception, stems from the dissatisfaction with the ''idea of form'' that had been in practiced since the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''L'Epopée'', written in 1925, published in ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. First published under the title ''Kubismus'', 1928.  English translation, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt; This dissatisfaction had already been seen in the works of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[Eugène Delacroix]], in the [[Realism (art)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]], in passing through the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], [[Les Nabis]], the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] and the [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]]. [[Paul Cézanne]] was instrumental, as his work marked a shift from a more representational art form to one that was increasingly abstract, with a strong emphasis on the simplification of geometric structure. In a letter addressed to [[Émile Bernard]] dated 15 April 1904, Cézanne writes: "Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point."&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne was preoccupied by the means of rendering volume and space, surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes. Increasingly in his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom. His work became bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly nonrepresentational. As his color planes acquired greater formal independence, defined objects and structures began to lose their identity.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora" /&gt;

===The first phase===
{{main article|Proto-Cubism}}
[[File:Georges Braque, 1908, Maisons et arbre, oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art.jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, 1908, ''Maisons et arbre'' (''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]''), oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, [[Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art]]]]
Artists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice the tendencies toward abstraction inherent in the work of Cézanne, and ventured still further.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; A reevaluation in their own work in relation to that of Cézanne had begun following a series of retrospective exhibitions of Cézanne's paintings held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Moser"&gt;Daniel Robbins, Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; By 1907, representational form gave way to a new complexity; subject matter progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], an exhibition which officially introduced "Cubism" to the public as an organized group movement, and extending through 1913, the [[fine art]]s had evolved well beyond the teachings of Cézanne. Where before, the foundational pillars of academicism had been shaken, now they had been toppled.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; "It was a total regeneration", writes Gleizes, "indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realized that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; 
The evolution towards rectilinearity and simplified forms continued through 1909 with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles; visible in the works of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Robert Delaunay]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-war: analysis and synthesis====
The Cubist method leading to 1912 has been considered 'analytical', entailing the decomposition of the subject matter (the study of things), while subsequently 'synthetic', built on geometric construction (free of such primary study). The terms Analytic Cubism and Synthetic Cubism originated through this distinction.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; By 1913 Cubism had transformed itself considerably in the range of spatial effects.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants Jean Metzinger exhibited his monumental ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]''; Robert Delaunay ''L'équipe du Cardiff F.C.''; [[Fernand Léger]] ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier''; Juan Gris ''L'Homme au Café''; and Albert Gleizes ''[[Les Joueurs de football]]''. At the 1913 Salon d'Automne, a salon in which the predominating tendency was Cubism, Metzinger exhibited ''[[En Canot]]''; Gleizes ''Les Bâteaux de Pêche''; and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] ''La Conquête de l'Air''.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; In these works, more so than before, can be seen the importance of the geometric plane in the overall composition.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt;

Historically, the first phase of Cubism is identified as much by the inventions of Picasso and Braque (amongst the so-called Gallery Cubists) as it is with the common interests towards geometrical structure of Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier (the Salon Cubists).&lt;ref name="Gris"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=correspondence+Juan+Gris,+Maurice+Raynal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=omG4wHCpDC&amp;sig=jyC3HCXNGm4X7vTF98ybQOyk3Wc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeprVfHJBMz9Ur-NgLAI&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=correspondence%20Juan%20Gris%2C%20Maurice%20Raynal&amp;f=false Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, ''Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993'', Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 6, 22-60]. {{ISBN|0300053746}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cubism would evolve pictorially, so too would the crystallization of its theoretical framework advance beyond the guidelines set out in the Cubist manifesto ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger in 1912; though ''Du "Cubisme"'' would remain the clearest and most intelligible definition of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

At the outset of the First World War many artists were mobilized: Metzinger, Gleizes, Braque, Léger, de La Fresnaye, and [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon|Duchamp-Villon]]. Despite the brutal interruption, each found the time to continue making art, sustaining differing types of Cubism. Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an ''evasion'' of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge further and further away from the depiction of things. As the rift between art and life grew, so too came the burgeoning need for a process of distillation.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

This period of profound reflection contributed to the constitution of a new [[mindset]]; a prerequisite for fundamental change. The ''flat surface'' became the starting point for a revaluation of the fundamental principles of painting.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; Rather than relying on the purely intellectual, the focus now was on the immediate experience of the senses, based on the idea according to Gleizes, that form, 'changing the directions of its movement, will change its dimensions' ["La forme, modifiant ses directions, modifiait ses dimensions"], while revealing the "basic elements" of painting, the "true, solid rules - rules which could be generally applied". It was Metzinger and Gris who, again according to Gleizes, "did more than anyone else to fix the basic elements... the first principles of the order that was being born".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; "But Metzinger, clear-headed as a physicist, had already discovered those rudiments of construction without which nothing can be done."&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; Ultimately, it was Gleizes who would take the synthetic factor furthest of all.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

The divers Cubist considerations manifested prior to World War I—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been replaced by a formal reference frame which constituted the second phase of Cubism, based upon an elementary set of principles that formed a cohesive Cubist aesthetic.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; This clarity and sense of order spread to almost all of the artists exhibiting at [[Léonce Rosenberg]]'s gallery—including Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Gino Severini]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]—leading to the descriptive term 'Crystal Cubism', coined by [[Maurice Raynal]],&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; an early promoter of Cubism and continuous supporter during the war and post-war phase that followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/research/leonard-lauder-research-center/programs-and-resources/index-of-cubist-art-collectors/lipchitz Anna Jozefacka, Leonard A. Lauder, Research Center for Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Raynal had been associated with Cubists since 1910 via the milieu of [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;pg=PA140-IA2&amp;lpg=PA140-IA2&amp;dq=%22maurice+raynal%22+%22Cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wPTwqcaO1W&amp;sig=9uerz0v0Z8jtg_r2_XRoo6cQhe4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cxBoVZ6TB4HjUvmKgLAJ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maurice%20raynal%22%20%22Cubism%22&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-garde and Politics in Paris 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998, p. 152], {{ISBN|0300075294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynal, who would become one of the Cubists most authoritative and articulate proponents,&lt;ref name="Cottington 2004"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=%22maurice+raynal%22+%22Cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rn_yvibRnH&amp;sig=8zEhc9vn47tuHhEKSvQ80UP1kUE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mxNoVaKaHIqsU6uxgZAE&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=raynal&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and Its Histories'', Manchester University Press, 2004, pp. 151-153], {{ISBN|0719050049}}&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed a wide range of Cubist activity and for those who produced it, but his highest esteem was directed toward two artists: Jean Metzinger, whose artistry Raynal equated with [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and who was 'perhaps the man who, in our epoch, knows best how to paint'. The other was Juan Gris, who was 'certainly the fiercest of the purists in the group'.&lt;ref name="Cottington 2004" /&gt;

In 1915, while serving on the front line, Raynal suffered a minor shrapnel wound to the knee from exploding enemy artillery fire, though the injury did not necessitate his evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/L'Intransigeant/1915/7/9 ''L'Intransigeant'', 9 July 1915, p. 2, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning from the front line, Raynal served briefly as director for publications of Rosenberg's l'Effort moderne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/ ''Le Siècle'', 8 April 1919, p. 3, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k74806n/f108.image ''Lectures'', Le Nouveau Spectateur, No. 5, 10 July 1919, Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France]&lt;/ref&gt; For Raynal, research into art was based on an eternal truth, rather than on the ideal, on reality, or on certitude. Certitude was nothing more than based on a relative belief, while truth was in agreement with fact. The only belief was in the veracity of philosophical and scientific truths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k56993423/texteBrut Maurice Raynal, ''Quelques Intentions du Cubisme'', éditions de L'Effort moderne, Paris, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Direct reference to observed reality" is present, but the emphasis is placed on the "self-sufficiency" of the artwork as objects unto themselves. The priority on "orderly qualities" and the "autonomous purity" of compositions are a prime concern, writes art historian Christopher Green.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; Crystal Cubism also coincided with the emergence of a methodical framework of theoretical essays on the topic,&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; by Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Fernand Léger, [[Gino Severini]], Pierre Reverdy, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, and Maurice Raynal.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

===Metzinger===
Even before Raynal coined the term Crystal Cubism, one critic by the name of Aloës Duarvel, writing in ''L'Elan'', referred to Metzinger's entry exhibited at Galerie [[Bernheim-Jeune]] as 'jewellery' ("joaillerie").&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaf191601-01.2.19&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# ''La Tombola artistique au profit des artistes polonais victimes de la guerre'', 28 décembre 1915 au 15 janvier 1916, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, 25, boulevard de la Madeleine, published in L'Elan, Number 8, January 1916]&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic, Aurel, writing in ''L'Homme Enchaîné'' about the same December 1915 exhibition described Metzinger's entry as "a very erudite divagation of horizon blue and old red of glory, in the name of which I forgive him" [''une divagation fort érudite en bleu horizon et vieux rouge de gloire, au nom de quoi je lui pardonne''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75938157/f1.image ''Échos, 1915 et la peinture'', L'Homme Enchaîné, Paris, A3, No. 455, Saturday, 8 January 1916 (front page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the year 1916, Sunday discussions at the studio of Lipchitz, included Metzinger, Gris, Picasso, [[Diego Rivera]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[André Salmon]], [[Max Jacob]], and [[Blaise Cendrars]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9–24&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written in Paris by Metzinger to Albert Gleizes in Barcelona during the war, dated 4 July 1916, he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After two years of study I have succeeded in establishing the basis of this new perspective I have talked about so much. It is not the materialist perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a metaphysical perspective—I take full responsibility for the word. You can't begin to imagine what I've found out since the beginning of the war, working outside painting but for painting. The geometry of the fourth space has no more secret for me. Previously I had only intuitions, now I have certainty. I have made a whole series of theorems on the laws of displacement [''déplacement''], of reversal [''retournement''] etc. I have read [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute|Schoute]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Rieman]] (sic), [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]], [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] etc.

The actual result? A new harmony. Don't take this word harmony in its ordinary [''banal''] everyday sense, take it in its original [''primitif''] sense. Everything is number. The mind [''esprit''] hates what cannot be measured: it must be reduced and made comprehensible.

That is the secret. There in nothing more to it [''pas de reste à l'opération'']. Painting, sculpture, music, architecture, ''lasting art'' is never anything more than a mathematical expression of the relations that exist between the internal and the external, the self [''le moi''] and the world. (Metzinger, 4 July 1916)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20One/analytical%20and%20synthetic.html#anchor212039 Peter Brooke, ''Higher Geometries, Precedents: Charles Henry and Peter Lenz, The subjective experience of space, Metzinger, Gris and Maurice Princet'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 'new perspective' according to [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "was a mathematical relationship between the ideas in his mind and the exterior world".&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The 'fourth space' for Metzinger was the space of the mind.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;
 
In a second letter to Gleizes, dated 26 July 1916, Metzinger writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If painting was an end in itself it would enter into the category of the minor arts which appeal only to physical pleasure... No. Painting is a language—and it has its syntax and its laws. To shake up that framework a bit to give more strength or life to what you want to say, that isn't just a right, it's a duty; but you must never lose sight of the End. The End, however, isn't the subject, nor the object, nor even the picture—the End, it is the idea. (Metzinger, 26 July 1916)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Continuing, Metzinger mentions the differences between himself and Juan Gris:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone from whom I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I cannot understand why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take from things what seems to me to have meaning and be most suitable to express my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the ideas expressed in these letters to Gleizes were reproduced in an article written by the writer, poet, and critique [[Paul Dermée]], published in the magazine ''[[Pierre Albert-Birot|SIC]]'' in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaz19190330-01.2.14&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# ''Jean Metzinger, Une Esthétique'', by Paul Dermée, SIC, Volume 4, Nos. 42, 43, March 30 and April 15, 1919, p. 336]. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; but the existence of letters themselves remained unknown until the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

While Metzinger's process of distillation is already noticeable during the latter half of 1915, and conspicuously extending into early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918. Metzinger's radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his 1915-16 compositions is already visible in his work circa 1912-13, in paintings such as ''[[Au Vélodrome]]'' (1912) and ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' (c.1913). Where before, the perception of depth had been greatly reduced, now, the depth of field was no greater than a bas-relief.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Metzinger's evolution toward synthesis has its origins in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a "new perspective" in accord with the "laws of displacement". In the case of ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in ''[[Au Vélodrome]]''. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non-essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards ''[[Soldier at a Game of Chess]]'' (1914–15), and a host of other works created after the artist's demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as ''L'infirmière'' (''The Nurse'') location unknown, and ''[[Femme au miroir]]'', private collection.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the beauty of a painting solely depends on its pictorial qualities: only retaining certain elements, those that seem to suit our need for expression, then with these elements, building a new object, an object which we can adapt to the surface of the painting without subterfuge. If that object looks like something known, I take it increasingly for something of no use. For me it is enough for it to be "well done", to have a perfect accord between the parts and the whole. (Jean Metzinger, quoted in ''Au temps des Cubistes, 1910-1920'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-femme-et-paysage-a-laqueduc-5556907-details.aspx#top Jean Metzinger, quoted in ''Au temps des Cubistes, 1910-1920'', exhibition catalogue, Paris, Galerie Berès, 2006, p. 432. Reproduced in Christie's Paris, 2 May 2012, Lot 23 notes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Metzinger, the Crystal period was synonymous with a return to "a simple, robust art".&lt;ref name="Metzinger"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/modernfrenc00rayn Jean Metzinger, quoted in [[Maurice Raynal]], ''Modern French Painters'', Tudor Publishing Co., New York, 1934, p. 125] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606010101/https://archive.org/details/modernfrenc00rayn |date=2015-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal Cubism represented an opening up of possibilities. His belief was that technique should be simplified and that the "trickery" of [[chiaroscuro]] should abandoned, along with the "artifices of the palette".&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt; He felt the need to do without the "multiplication of tints and detailing of forms without reason, by feeling":&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

:"Feeling! It is like the expression of the old-school tragedian in acting! I want clear ideas, frank colors. 'No color, nothing but nuance', [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]] used to say; but Verlaine is dead, and Homer is not afraid to handle color". (Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

Juan Gris' late arrival on the Cubist scene (1912) saw him influenced by the leaders of the movement: Picasso, of the 'Gallery Cubists' and Metzinger of the 'Salon Cubists'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=d5wXeMFxA2IC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=John+Golding,+Visions+of+the+Modern,+seen+by+many+as+the+leader+of+the+%27Salon%27+Cubists John Golding, ''Visions of the Modern''], University of California Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0520087925}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aN9MriMKsE ''Picasso Posse: The Mona Lisa of Cubism'', Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; His entry at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, ''Hommage à Pablo Picasso'', was also an homage to Metzinger's ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)#The total image|Le goûter (Tea Time)]]''. ''Le goûter'' persuaded Gris of the importance of mathematics (numbers) in painting.&lt;ref&gt;''John Richardson: A Life of Picasso, volume II, 1907–1917'', ''The Painter of Modern Life'', Jonathan Cape, London, 1996, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

As art historian Peter Brooke points out, Gris started painting persistently in 1911 and first exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants (a painting entitled ''Hommage à Pablo Picasso''). "He appears with two styles", writes Brooke, "In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the ''Goûter'' and of Metzinger's later work in 1912. In the other, the grid is still present but the lines are not stated and their continuity is broken".&lt;ref name="P.

In 1911, as the key area of likeness and unlikeness, they more than anything released the laughter." Green continues, "This was the wider context of Gris's decision at the Indépendants of 1912 to make his debut with a ''Homage to Pablo Picasso'', which was a portrait, and to do so with a portrait that responded to Picasso's portraits of 1910 through the intermediary of Metzinger's ''Tea-time''.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=juan+gris+portrait+of+Picasso,+Metzinger+tea-time Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin Von Maur, ''Juan Gris: &amp;#91;catalogue of the Exhibition&amp;#93;'', 1992, London and Otterlo, p. 160]&lt;/ref&gt; While Metzinger's distillation is noticeable during the latter half of 1915 and early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]] dated the shift in style of Juan Gris to the summer and autumn of 1916, following the ''[[Pointillism|pointilliste]]'' paintings of early 1916;&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; in which Gris brought into practice [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] theory via the incorporation of colored dots into his Cubist pictures.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; This timescale corresponds with the period after which Gris signed a contract with Léonce Rosenberg, following a rally of support by [[Henri Laurens]], Lipchitz and Metzinger.&lt;ref name="Derouet, 1996"&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rvart_0035-1326_1996_num_113_1_348280 Christian Derouet, ''Le cubisme "bleu horizon" ou le prix de la guerre.

"Here is the man who has meditated on everything modern", writes [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in his 1913 publication ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]'', "here is the painter who paints to conceive only new structures, whose aim is to draw or paint nothing but materially pure forms". Apollinaire compares the work of Gris with the "scientific cubism" of Picasso... "Juan Gris is content with purity, scientifically conceived. The conceptions of Juan Gris are always pure, and from this purity parallels are sure to spring".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA220 Herschel Browning Chipp, Peter Selz, ''Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics'', University of California Press, 1968, pp. 221-248], {{ISBN|0-520-01450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2"&gt;[http://modjourn.org/render.php?id=1299783137937502&amp;view=mjp_object The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 2: Miscellany Number, Anderson, Margaret C.

In 1916, drawing from black and white postcards representing works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], Gris created a series of classical (traditionalist) Cubist figure paintings, employing a purified range of pictorial and structural features. These works set the tone for his quest of an ideal unity for the next five years.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

"These themes of pictorial architecture and the "constants" of tradition were consolidated and integrated", writes Green ''et al''; "The inference was there to be drawn: to restore tradition was to restore not only an old subject-matter in new terms, but to find the unchanging principles of structure in painting. Cohesion in space (composition) and cohesion in time (Corot ''in'' Gris) were presented as a single, fundamental truth".&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; Gris himself stressed the relativity and ephemerality of "truth" in his paintings (as a function of him) as in the world itself (as a function of society, culture and time); always susceptible to change.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

From 1915 to late 1916, Gris transited through three different styles of Cubism, writes Green: "starting with a solid extrapolation of the structures and materials of objects, moving into the placement of brilliant coloured dots drifting across flat signs for still-life objects, and culminating in a flattened 'chiaroscoro' realised in planar contrasts of a monochromatic palette".&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

Gris's works from late 1916 through 1917, more so than before, exhibit a simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in the artists ''Woman with Mandolin, after Corot'' (September 1916) and in its epilogue ''Portrait of Josette Gris'' (October 1916).&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[File:27. Mujer sentada.jpg|thumb|left|Juan Gris, 1917, ''Seated Woman'' (''Mujer sentada''), 116 × 73 cm, [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]]]
The clear-cut underlying geometric framework of these works seemingly control the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components, including the small planes of the faces, become part of the unified whole. Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point. The geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in ''Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan'' (June 1915). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come. In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach, and asserting its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

In April 1919, following exhibitions by Laurens, Metzinger, Léger and Braque, Gris present nearly fifty works at Rosenberg's Galerie de l'Effort moderne.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; This first [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibition]] by Gris&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_artista/248 Juan Gris, Biography and Works, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/1076 Juan Gris, Collection Online, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; coincided with his prominence among the Parisian avant-garde. Gris was presented to the public as one of the 'purest' and one of the most 'classical' of the leading Cubists.&lt;ref name="Gris, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection//browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A2349&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1&amp;section_id=T034990 Christopher Green, Juan Gris, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gris claimed to manipulate flat abstract planar surfaces first, and only in subsequent stages of his painting process would he 'qualify' them so that the subject-matter became readable. He worked 'deductively' on the global concept first, then consecrated on the perceptive details. Gris referred to this technique as 'synthetic', in contradistinction from the process of 'analysis' intrinsic to his earlier works.&lt;ref name="Gris, MoMA" /&gt;

Gris's open window series of 1921-22 appears to be a response to Picasso's open windows of 1919, painted in St. Raphael.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; By May 1927, the date of his death, Gris had been considered ''the'' leader of the second phase of Cubism (the Crystal period).&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

===Picasso===
While Metzinger and Gris were painting in advanced geometric form during the second phase of Cubism,  Picasso worked on several projects simultaneously. Between 1915 and 1917, he began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. "Hard-edged square-cut diamonds", notes art historian John Richardson, "these gems do not always have upside or downside".&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=AxcsQXDHd7YC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22crystal+cubism%22,+A+Life+of+Picasso:+The+Triumphant+Years,+1917-1932&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hQhsVb6sG8K8UeuVg8AP&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crystal%20cubism%22%2C%20A%20Life%20of%20Picasso%3A%20The%20Triumphant%20Years%2C%201917-1932&amp;f=false John Richardson, ''A Life of Picasso: The Triumphant Years, 1917-1932'', Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, Dec 24, 2008, pp. 77-78], {{ISBN|030749649X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Juan Gris to Maurice Raynal, 23 May 1917, Kahnweiler-Gris 1956, 18&lt;/ref&gt; "We need a new name to designate them," wrote Picasso to [[Gertrude Stein]]: Maurice Raynal suggested "Crystal Cubism".&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Morand, 1996, 19 May 1917, p. 143-4&lt;/ref&gt; These "little gems" may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called [[return to order]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;

===Csaky, Laurens and Lipchitz===
[[File:Joseph Csaky, Deux figures, 1920, relief, limestone, polychrome, 80 cm, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Holland.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Csaky]], ''Deux figures'', 1920, relief, limestone, polychrome, 80&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], Otterlo]]
[[Joseph Csaky]] enlisted as a volunteer in the French army in 1914, fighting alongside French soldiers during [[World War I]], and remained for the duration. Returning to Paris in 1918, Csaky began a series of [[Cubist sculpture]]s derived in part from a machine-like aesthetic; streamlined with geometric and mechanical affinities. By this time Csaky's artistic vocabulary had evolved considerably from his pre-war Cubism: it was distinctly mature, showing a new, refined sculptural quality. Few works of early modern sculpture are comparable to the work Csaky produced in the years directly succeeding World War I. These were nonrepresentational freely-standing objects, i.e., abstract three-dimensional constructions combining organic and geometric elements. "Csaky derived from nature forms which were in concordance with his passion for architecture, simple, pure, and psychologically convincing." (Maurice Raynal, 1929)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar Edith Balas writes of Csaky's sculpture following the war years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Csáky, more than anyone else working in sculpture, took Pierre Reverdy's theoretical writings on art and cubist doctrine to heart. "Cubism is an eminently plastic art; but an art of creation, not of reproduction and interpretation." The artist was to take no more than "elements" from the external world, and intuitively arrive at the "idea" of objects made up of what for him constant in value. Objects were not to be analyzed; neither were the experiences they evoked. They were to be re-created in the mind, and thereby purified. By some unexplained miracle the "pure" forms of the mind, an entirely autonomous vocabulary, of (usual geometric) forms, would make contact with the external world." (Balas, 1998, p. 27)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These 1919 works (e.g., ''Cones and Spheres, Abstract Sculpture'', Balas, pp.&amp;nbsp;30–41)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt; are made of juxtaposing sequences of rhythmic geometric forms, where light and shadow, mass and the void, play a key role. Though almost entirely abstract, they allude, occasionally, to the structure of the human body or modern machines, but the semblance functions only as "elements" (Reverdy) and are deprived of descriptive narrative. Csaky's polychrome reliefs of the early 1920s display an affinity with [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]—an extreme form of the Cubism aesthetic developing at the time—in their rigorous economy of architectonic symbols and the use of crystalline geometric structures.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

Csaky's ''Deux figures'', 1920, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], employs broad planar surfaces accented by descriptive linear elements comparable to Georges Valmier's work of the following year (''Figure'' 1921).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpdubs.hautetfort.com/archive/2007/04/04/cubisme.html Georges Valmier, ''Figure'', 1921, oil on canvas, 97.1 x 74.9 cm]&lt;/ref&gt; Csaky's influences were drawn more from the [[art of ancient Egypt]] rather than from French [[Neoclassicism]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[File:Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Le Guitariste (The Guitar Player).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1918, ''Le Guitariste'' (''The Guitar Player'')]]
With this intense flurry of activity, Csaky was taken on by [[Léonce Rosenberg]], and exhibited regularly at the Galerie l'Effort Moderne. By 1920 Rosenberg was the sponsor, dealer and publisher of [[Piet Mondrian]], Léger, Lipchitz and Csaky. He had just published ''Le Néo-Plasticisme''—a collection of writings by Mondrian—and Theo van Doesburg's ''Classique-Baroque-Moderne''. Csaky's showed a series of works at Rosenberg's gallery in December 1920.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

[[File:Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Still Life, bas relief, stone.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1918, ''Instruments de musique'' (''Still Life''), bas relief, stone]]
For the following three years, Rosenberg purchased Csaky's entire artistic production. In 1921 Rosenberg organized an exhibit titled ''Les maîtres du Cubisme'', a group show that featured works by Csaky, Gleizes, Metzinger, Mondrian, Gris, Léger, Picasso, Laurens, Braque, Herbin, Severini, Valmier, Ozenfant and Survage.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

Csaky's works of the early 1920s reflect a distinct form of Crystal Cubism, and were produced in a wide variety of materials, including marble, onyx and rock crystal. They reflect a collective spirit of the time, "a puritanical denial of sensuousness that reduced the cubist vocabulary to rectangles, verticals, horizontals," writes Balas, "a Spartan alliance of discipline and strength" to which Csaky adhered in his ''Tower Figures.'' "In their aesthetic order, lucidity, classical precision, emotional neutrality, and remoteness from visible reality, they should be considered stylistically and historically as belonging to the [[De Stijl|De Stijl movement]]." (Balas, 1998)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

[[Jacques Lipchitz]] recounted a meeting during the First World War with the poet and writer close to the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], [[Jules Romains]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember in 1915 when I was deeply involved in cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had a visit from the writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." And he answered in a slightly mocking way, "What do you know about crystals?" At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3258970.pdf.bannered.pdf ''Jacques Lipchitz, his life in sculpture'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 30, No. 6 (Jun. - Jul., 1972), published by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 285] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Lipchitz and [[Henri Laurens]]—late adherents to Cubist sculpture, following [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Otto Gutfreund]] and Picasso—began production in late 1914, and 1915 (respectively), taking Cubist paintings of 1913-14 as a starting point.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up Douglas Cooper, "The Cubist Epoch"], Phaidon Press Limited, 1970, in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lipchitz and Laurens retained highly figurative and legible components in their works leading up to 1915-16, after which naturalist and descriptive elements were muted, dominated by a synthetic style of Cubism under the influence of Picasso and Gris.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Between 1916 and 1918 Lipchitz and Laurens developed a breed of advanced wartime Cubism (primarily in sculpture) that represented a process of purification. With observed reality no longer the basis for the depiction of subject, model or motif, Lipchitz and Laurens created works that excluded any starting point, based predominantly on the imagination, and continued to do so during the transition from war to peace.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

In December 1918 Laurens, a close friend of both Picasso and Braque, inaugurated the series of Cubist exhibitions at L'Effort Moderne (Lipchitz showed in 1920), by which time his works had wholly approached the Cubist ''[[Return to order|retour à l'ordre]]''. Rather than descriptive, these works were rooted in geometric abstraction; a species of architectural, polychromed multimedia Cubist constructions.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Pablo Picasso, reproduced in L'Elan, Number 9, 12 February 1916.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, ''Femme assise dans un fauteuil'' (''Woman sitting in an armchair''), reproduced in ''L'Elan'', Number 9, 12 February 1916]]
From its first public exhibition in 1911, art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] had voiced his contempt for Cubism. In June 1918, Vauxcelles, writing under the pseudonym Pinturrichio, continued his attack:&lt;ref name="Vauxcelles"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6544512p/f11.image Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), Le Carnet des ateliers, ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'', 9 June 1918, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Integral Cubism is crumbling, vanishing, evaporating. Defections, every day, reach the headquarters of pure painting. Soon Metzinger will be the last of his species, representative of an abandoned doctrine. "And if one shall remain, he'll whisper painfully, I'll be the one". (Vauxcelles, 1918)&lt;ref name="Vauxcelles" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following month, Vauxcelles forecast the final demise of Cubism by the fall of 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), De Profundis, ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'', 28 July 1918, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall came the end of the war, and in December, a series of exhibitions at Galerie l'Effort Moderne of Cubist works demonstrated that Cubism was still alive.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Defections by [[Diego Rivera]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|André Favory|fr}} from the Cubist circle, cited by Pinturrichio, proved to be insufficient grounds upon which to base his prediction. Vauxcelles even went as far as organizing a small exhibition at the galerie Blot (late 1918) of artists that appeared to be anti-Cubist; Lhote, Rivera and Favory among them. Allies in Vauxcelles ongoing battle against Cubism included Jean-Gabriel Lemoine (''L'Intransigeant''), Roland Chavenon (''L'Information''), [[Gustave Kahn]] (''L'Heure''), and Waldemar George ({{Interlanguage link multi|Jerzy Waldemar Jarocinski|fr}}), who would soon become one of the leading post-war supporters of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Inversely, once a steadfast supporter of Cubism, [[André Salmon]] in 1917-18 predicted too its demise; claiming it to have been merely a phase leading to a new art-form more closely attuned with nature. Two more former advocates of Cubism had also defected, {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Allard|fr}} and [[Blaise Cendrars]], joining the ranks of Vauxcelles in frontline attacks on Cubism. Allard reproached the visible distancing of Cubism from the dynamism and diversity of lived experience toward a universe of purified objects. Similarly, Cendrars wrote in an article published May 1919 "The formulae of the Cubists' are becoming too narrow, and can no longer embrace the personality of the painters".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaise Cendrars, ''Modernités, I, Quelle sera la nouvelle peinture?'', La Rose Rouge, 3 May 1919. Reproduced in Aujourd'hui, Paris 1931, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter attacks===

The poet and theorist [[Pierre Reverdy]] had surpassed all rivals in his attacks on the anti-Cubist campaign between 1918 and 1919. He had been in close contact with the Cubists prior to the war, and in 1917 joined forces with two other poets who shared his points of view: [[Paul Dermée]] and [[Vicente Huidobro]]. In March of the same year Reverdy edited ''Nord-Sud''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/title.html?titleURN=urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnaaw Pierre Reverdy, ''Nord-Sud''], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the magazine was inspired by the [[Paris Métro]] line that extended from Montmartre to Montparnasse, linking these two focal points of artistic creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton]], ''Œuvres complètes No. 1'', Gallimard, La Pléiade, 1988, note 3, p. 1075&lt;/ref&gt; Reverdy began this project towards the end of 1916, with an art world still under the pressures of war, to show the parallels between the poetic theories of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] of [[Max Jacob]] and himself in marking the burgeoning of a new era for poetry and artistic reflection. In ''Nord-Sud'' Reverdy, with the help of Dermée and [[Georges Braque]], exposed his literary theories, and outlined a coherent theoretical stance on the latest developments in Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne-Alain Hubert, note au tome 1 des ''Œuvres complètes'' de Pierre Reverdy, [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]], page 1298&lt;/ref&gt; His treatise ''On Cubism'', published in the first issue of ''Nord-Sud'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaw19170315-01&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- Pierre Reverdy, ''Sur le Cubisme'', Nord-Sud, Volume 1, Number 1, 15 March 1917, pp. 5-7], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; did so perhaps most influentially.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverdy"&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaw191810-01.2.5&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# Pierre Reverdy, ''Arts'', Nord-Sud, Volume 2, Number 16, October 1918, p. 4], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; With his characteristic preference for offense rather than defense, Reverdy launched an attack against Vauxcelles' anti-Cubist crusade:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How many times has it been said that the art movement called Cubism is extinguished? Each time that a purge occurs the critics of the other side, who ask only that their desires be taken as facts, shout defection and howl for its death. This is nothing basically but a ruse, because Pinturrichichio [''sic''], of the ''Carnet de la Semaine'' and the others know very well that the serious artists of this group are extremely happy to see go... those opportunists who have taken over creations the significance of which they do not even comprehend, and were attracted only by the love of buzz and personal interest. It was predictable that these unrecommendable and compromising people would renounce their endeavors sooner or later. (Reverdy, 1918)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverdy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pablo Picasso, reproduced in L'Elan, Number 10, 1 December 1916.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, reproduced in ''L'Elan'', Number 10, 1 December 1916]]
Another vigorous supporter of Cubism was the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. By the end of 1918—filling in the vacuum left in the wake of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|D.-H. Kahnweiler]]'s imposed exile—Rosenberg purchased works by almost all of the Cubists. His defense of Cubism would prove to be longer-lasting and wider-ranging than Reverdy's. His first tactical maneuver was to address a letter to ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'' denying the chimerical claim made by Vauxcelles that both Picasso and Gris had defected. Much more poignant and difficult to combat, however, was his second tactical maneuver: a succession of prominent Cubist exhibitions held at the [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]], in Rosenber's [[Hôtel particulier]], 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and stylishly fashionable [[8th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

This series of large exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists—began 18 December with Cubist sculptures by Henri Laurens, followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by Jean Metzinger, Fernand Léger in February, Georges Braque in March, Juan Gris April, Gino Severini May, and Pablo Picasso in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive,&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes most obviously. Nonetheless, according to Christopher Green, "this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its "new collective form" marked by "intellectual rigor". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Further evidence to bolster the prediction made by Vauxcelles could have been found in a small exhibition at the Galerie Thomas (in a space owned by a sister of [[Paul Poiret]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Germaine Bongard|fr}}). ''The first exhibition of [[Purism|Purist]] Art'' opened on 21 December 1918, with works by [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier|Charles-Édouard Jeanneret]] (later called Le Corbusier), who claimed to be successors of pre-war Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/L'Intransigeant/1921/1/31 ''L'Intransigeant'', 31 January 1921, p. 2, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of a Purist manifesto in book-form had been published to coincided with the exhibition, titled ''Après le cubisme'' (After Cubism):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysId=13&amp;IrisObjectId=6448&amp;sysLanguage=en-en&amp;itemPos=3&amp;itemSort=en-en_sort_string1%20&amp;itemCount=47&amp;sysParentName=&amp;sysParentId=25 Amédée Ozenfant, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, ''Après le cubisme'', Éditions des Commentaires, Paris, 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozenfant and Jeanneret felt that Cubism had become too decorative,&lt;ref name="Speiser"&gt;[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/CorbuCache/2049_2489.pdf Philip Speiser, ''Villa La Rocca'', Fondation Le Corbusier, September 2009, p. 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193059/http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/CorbuCache/2049_2489.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; practiced by so many individuals that it lacked unity, it had become too fashionable. Their clarity of subject matter (more figurative, less abstract than the Cubists) had been welcomed by members of the anti-Cubist camp. They showed works that were a direct result of observation; perspectival space only slightly distorted. Ozenfant and Jeanneret, like Lhote, remained faithful to the Cubist idiom that form should not be abandoned. Some of the works exhibited related directly to the Cubism practiced during the war (such as Ozenfant's ''Bottle, Pipe and Books'', 1918), with flatted planar structures and varying degrees of multiple perspective.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

For Ozenfant and Jeanneret only Crystal Cubism had conserved the geometric rigor of the early Cubist revolution.&lt;ref name="Speiser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lapeinturemodern00ozenuoft Amédée Ozenfant, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, ''La peinture moderne'', Éditions G. Crès et Cie, 1925]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, in collaboration with [[Max Jacob]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], Ozenfant founded the magazine ''L'Élan'', which he edited until late 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/title.html?titleURN=urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnaaf ''L'élan'', Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernist-magazines.org/?q=category/categories/lelan Michelle Parker, ''L'Élan and Amédée Ozenfant: Art for Art's Sake?'', DH and Literary Studies, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/571 Amédée Ozenfant, Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 he met Jeanneret, with whom he would join forces between 1918 and 1925 on a venture called [[Purism]]: a variation of Cubism in both painting and architecture.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Susan|title=Ozenfant and Purism: The Evolution of a style 1915–1930|year=1981|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with the pro-Cubist writer, poet, and critique [[Paul Dermée]], Ozenfant and Jeanneret founded the avant-garde journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau'', published from 1920 to 1925. In the last issue, Jeanneret, under the pseudonym Paul Boulard, writes of how the laws of nature were manifested in the shape of crystals; the properties of which were hermetically coherent, both interiorly and exteriorly. In ''La peinture moderne'', under the title ''Vers le crystal'', Ozenfant and Jeanneret liken the properties of crystals with the true Cubist, whose œuvre tends toward the crystal.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=8qy52T7AJfUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22Toward+the+crystal%22,+Ozenfant+and+Jeanneret&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w1KaVAijYh&amp;sig=XRCGCRUSYeWbnBJprAJ5lTONEQM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3YBqVeLJEYzZU8-RgcgP&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=crystal&amp;f=false Jan de Heer, ''The Architectonic Colour: Polychromy in the Purist Architecture of Le Corbusier'' 010 Publishers, 2009, p. 139], {{ISBN|906450671X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain Cubists have created paintings that can be said to tend toward the perfection of the crystal. These works seem to approach our current needs. The crystal is, in nature, a phenomenon that affects us most because it clearly shows the path to geometric organization. Nature sometimes shows us how forms are built through a reciprocal interplay of internal and external forces... following the theoretical forms of geometry; and man delights in these arrangements because he finds in them justification for his abstract conceptions of geometry: the spirit of man and nature find a factor of common ground, in the crystal... In true Cubism, there something organic that proceeds from the inside to the outside... The universality of the work depends on its plastic purity. (Ozenfant and Jeanneret, 1923-25)&lt;ref name="Speiser" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second Purist exhibition was held at the Galerie Druet, Paris, in 1921. In 1924 Ozenfant opened a free studio in Paris with [[Fernand Léger]], where he taught with [[Aleksandra Ekster]] and [[Marie Laurencin]].&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Judi Freeman, "Ozenfant, Amédée", Grove Art Online. Retrieved 26 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ozenfant and Le Corbusier wrote ''La Peinture moderne'' in 1925.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;

In final issue of ''L'élan'', published December 1916, Ozenfant writes: "Le Cubisme est un movement de purism'' (Cubism is a movement of purism).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaf19161201-01&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- Amédée Ozenfant, ''Notes sur le cubisme'', L'élan, Number 10, 1 December 1916, p. 3]. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

And in ''La peinture moderne'', 1923-25, with Cubism visibly still alive and in highly crystalline form, Ozenfant and Jeanneret write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We see the real cubists continue their work, imperturbable; they are also seen to continue their influence on spirits... They will arrive more or less strongly depending on the oscillations of their nature, their tenacity or their concessions and analysis [''tâtonnement''] that are characteristic of artistic creation, to search for a state of clarification, condensation, firmness, intensity, synthesis; they will arrive at a true virtuosity of the game of shapes and colors, as well as a highly developed science of the composition. Overall and despite the personal coefficients, one can discern a tendency towards what might be imaged in saying: ''tendency toward the crystal''.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Crystal Cubists embraced the stability of everyday life, the enduring and the pure, but too the classical, with all that it signified respecting art and ideal. Order and clarity, right to the core of its Latin roots, was a dominant factor within the circle of Rosenberg's L'Effort moderne. While Lhote, Rivera, Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted to attain a compromise between the abstract and nature in their search for another Cubism, all of the Cubists shared common goals. The first, writes Green: "that art should not be concerned with the description of nature... The rejection of [[Realism (arts)|Naturalism]] was intimately bound up with the second basic principle shared by them all: that the work of art, being not an interpretation of anything else, was something in its own right with its own laws". These same sentiments observable from the outset of Cubism were now essential and prevailing to an extent never before seen. There was a third principle that followed from the former that came to light during the Crystal period, again according to Green: "the principle that nature should be approached as no more than the supplier of 'elements' to be pictorially or sculpturally developed and then freely manipulated according to the laws of the medium alone".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Gleizes' mobilization was not a major obstacle to his production of artwork, though, working primarily on small scale, he did produce one relatively large piece: ''Portrait of an Army Doctor''.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QG9wNyIlEAgC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=gleizes,+%22simultaneous+movements+of+translation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8EIKQ9bxba&amp;sig=Ddnuo643ki8Urc433IuNhY4KzwE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9XovVdD_Gor-ygPcioGIBA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%2C%20%22simultaneous%20movements%20of%20translation%22&amp;f=false Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 2001], {{ISBN|0300089643}}&lt;/ref&gt; An admirer of his work, his commanding officer—the regimental surgeon portrayed by Gleizes in this painting—made arrangements so that Gleizes could continue to paint while mobilized at Toul.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Guggenheim"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1445 Albert Gleizes, ''Portrait of an Army Doctor'', Solomon R.

He had now undertaken a path that lead to 'synthesis', with its starting point in 'unity'.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914'', ''La guerre'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15.

This unity, and the highly crystalline geometricized materialization consisting of superimposed constituent planes of Crystal Cubism would ultimately be described by Gleizes, in ''La Peinture et ses lois'' (1922–23), as 'simultaneous movements of translation and rotation of the plane'.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt; The synthetic factor was ultimately taken furthest of all from within the Cubists by Gleizes.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Gleizes believed that the Crystal Cubists—specifically Metzinger and Gris—had found the principles on which an essentially non-representational art could be built. He felt that the earlier abstract works of artists such as [[František Kupka]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Henry Valensi|fr}}, lacked a solid foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francisboutle.co.uk/pages.php?cID=9&amp;pID=51 ''July 09: Futurism at the Tate Modern: a review by Peter Brooke'', ''From Cubism to Classicism, Painting and its Laws'', From Cubism to Classicism by Gino Severini / Painting and its laws by Albert Gleizes, Francis Boutle, 2001], {{ISBN|1903427053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1920 publication, ''Du Cubisme et les moyens de le comprendre'', Gleizes explained that Cubism was now at a stage of  development in which fundamental principles could be deduced from particular facts, applicable to a defined class of phenomena, drawn and taught to students. These basic theoretical postulates could be as productive for future developments of the fine arts as the mathematically based principles of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] had been since the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/ Peter Brooke, ''Victor Poznanski and the exhibition L'art d'aujourd'hui, 1925'', ''Gleizes - ups and downs of Cubism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Painting and its Laws''===
[[Albert Gleizes]] undertook the task of writing the characterizations of these principles in ''Painting and its Laws'' (''La Peinture et ses lois''), published by gallery owner Jacques Povolozky in the journal ''La Vie des lettres et des arts'', 1922-3, and as a book in 1924.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/painting-and-its-laws.html Albert Gleizes, ''Painting and Its Laws'', summary by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alibert"&gt;Pierre Alibert, ''Gleizes, Naissance et avenire du cubisme'', Aubin-Visconti, Edition Dumas, Saint-Etienne, October 1982, {{ISBN|2-85529-000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''La Peinture et ses lois'' Gleizes deduces the fundamental laws of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the physical laws. This theory, subsequently referred to as ''translation-rotation'', "ranks with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich", writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, MoMA" /&gt;

One of Gleizes's primary objectives was to answer the questions: How will the planar surface be animated, and by what logical method, independent of the artists ''fantaisie'', can it be attained?&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois"&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''La Peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du cubisme'', La Vie des lettres et des arts, 1922-3, 1924 in book form&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleizes bases these laws both on truisms inherent throughout the history of art, and especially on his own experience since 1912, such as: "The primary goal of art has never been exterior imitation" (p.&amp;nbsp;31); "Artworks come from emotion... the product of individual sensibility and taste" (p.&amp;nbsp;42); "The artist is always in a state of emotion, sentimental exaltation [ivresse]" (p.&amp;nbsp;43); "The painting in which the idea of abstract creation is realized is no longer an anecdote, but a concrete fact" (p.&amp;nbsp;56); "Creating a painted artwork is not the emission of an opinion" (p.&amp;nbsp;59); "The plastic dynamism will be born out of rhythmic relations between objects... establishing novel plastic liaisons between purely objective elements that compose the painting" (p.&amp;nbsp;22).&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Le Cubisme et la Tradition'', Montjoie, Paris, 10 February 1913, p. 4. Reprinted as ''A Propos du Salon d'Automne'', in ''Tradition et Cubisme'', Paris, 1927. Gleizes outlines what he perceives as the 'decadence' inherent in the modern art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing, Gleizes states that the 'reality' of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p.&amp;nbsp;62). "The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition" (p.&amp;nbsp;63).&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Defining the laws:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Rhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp.&amp;nbsp;35, 38, 51). This mechanism  is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Alibert (art historian)|fr|Pierre Alibert|lt=Pierre Alibert}}, the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

The problem set out by Gleizes was to replace ''anecdote'' as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Beginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetries]] such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt; (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

The choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through ''translation'' and ''rotation''.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Schematic illustrations:'''&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 1. Mouvements de translation du plan sur un côté.jpg|thumb|center|500px||&lt;div align="center"&gt;1. Movements of translation of the plane to one side&lt;/div&gt;]]

Space and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 2. Mouvements simultanés de rotation et de translation du plan.jpg|thumb|center|500px|&lt;div align="center"&gt;2. Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane&lt;/div&gt;]]

Another movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 3. Mouvements simultanés de rotation et de translation du plan aboutissant à la création d'un organisme plastique spatial et rythmique.jpg|thumb|center|500px|&lt;div align="center"&gt;3. Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane resulting in the creation of a spatial and rhythmic plastic organism&lt;/div&gt;]]

With these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is "a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 4. Systéme plastique spatial et rythmique obtenue par la conjugaison des mouvements simultanés de rotation et de translation du plan et des mouvements de translation du plan sur un côté.jpg|thumb|center|450px|&lt;div align="center"&gt;4. Plastic spatial and rhythmic system obtained by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side&lt;/div&gt;]]

Fig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a "plastic spatial and rhythmic system", by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more ''complex'' than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the ''possibilities of the plane'' to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt; [''L'exposé hâtif de cette mécanique purement plastique aboutissant à la réalisation d'un univers matériel en dehors de l'intervention particulière intentionnelle, suffit à démontrer la ''possibilité du plan'' de signifier spatialement et rythmiquement par sa seule puissance''].&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

==The end-product==
Throughout the war, to [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] and the series of exhibitions at [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]] that followed, the rift between art and life—and the overt distillation that came with it—had become the canon of Cubist orthodoxy; and it would persist despite its antagonists through the 1920s:&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Order remained the keynote as post-war reconstruction commenced. It is not surprising, therefore, to find a continuity in the development of Cubist art as the transition was made from war to peace, an unbroken commitment to the Latin virtues along with an unbroken commitment to the aesthetically pure. The new Cubism that emerged, the Cubism of Picasso, Laurens, Gris, Metzinger and Lipchitz most obviously of all, has come to be known as "crystal Cubism". It was indeed the end-product of a progressive closing down of possibilities in the name of a "call to order". (Christopher Green, 1987, p. 37)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inside Modernism" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More so than the pre-war Cubist period, the Crystal Cubist period has been described by Green as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In terms of a Modernist will to aesthetic isolation and of the broad theme of the separation of culture and society, it is actually Cubism ''after'' 1914 that emerges as most important to the history of Modernism, and especially... Cubism between around 1916 and around 1924... Only after 1914 did Cubism come almost exclusively to be identified with a single-minded insistence on the isolation of the art-object in a special category with its own laws and its own experience to offer, a category considered above life. It is Cubism in this later period that has most to tell anyone concerned with the problems of Modernism and post-modernism now, because it was only then that issues emerged with real clarity in and around Cubism which are closely comparable with those that emerged in and around Anglo-American Modernism in the sixties and after. (Green, 1987, Introduction, p. 1)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Art historian Peter Brooke has commented on Crystal Cubism, and more generally on the Salon Cubists: 
:"A general history of Salon Cubism, however, still needs to be written, a history that could be extended to include the wonderful collective phenomenon which Christopher Green has called 'Crystal Cubism' — the highly structured work of the Cubist painters... who remained in Paris during the war, most notably Metzinger and Gris. An opening up of this early Cubism in all its intellectual fullness would... reveal it as being not only the most radical movement in painting of the past century but, still, the most rich in possibilities for the future". (Peter Brooke, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=QG9wNyIlEAgC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=peter+brooke,+%22%27crystal+Cubism%27%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P_hBVc3-JMHiaJTVgIgN&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20brooke%2C%20%22'crystal%20Cubism'%22&amp;f=false Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', Introduction, p. xi, Yale University Press, 2001], {{ISBN|0300089643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]]. The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL had plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIS attack |author=Khalid al-Taie |publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com |date=13 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIS activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

ISIL uses a unit called the ''Kata'ib Taswiyya'' (settlement battalions) to select targets for demolition.&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4973/destruction-middle-east-antiquities |title=The Destruction of the Middle East |author=Denis MacEoin |publisher=[[Gatestone Institute]] |date=27 December 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] branded the ISIS activities in this respect as "a form of [[cultural cleansing]]"&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; and launched the [[Unite4Heritage]] campaign to protect heritage sites threatened by extremists.

==Motivation==
{{See also|Aniconism in Islam}}
ISIL justifies the destruction of cultural heritage sites with its extreme following of [[Salafism]] which, according to its followers, places "great importance on establishing [[tawhid]] (monotheism)", and "eliminating [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism)." While it is often assumed that the group's actions are mindless acts of vandalism, there is an ideological underpinning to the destruction. ISIL views its actions in sites like Palmyra and Nimrud as being in accordance with Sunni [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/religion-geopolitics/commentaries/glance/dont-be-surprised-isis-destroying-history |title=Don't Be Surprised by ISIS Destroying History |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the ideological aspects of the destruction, there are other, more practical, reasons behind ISIL's destruction of historic sites. Grabbing the world's attention is easily done through the destruction of such sites, given the extensive media coverage and international condemnation that comes afterwards. Destroying historic ruins also allows ISIL to wipe the slate clean and to start afresh, leaving no traces of any previous culture or civilization, while also providing an ideal platform for the group to establish its own identity and leave its mark on history. Despite the images showing extreme destruction, ISIL has also been making use of the looted antiquities to finance their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/iraq-isis-arrest-jihadists-wealth-power |title=How an arrest in Iraq revealed Isis's $2bn jihadist network |author=Martin Chulov |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the UN's ban on the trade of artifacts looted from Syria since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-mideast-crisis-un-idUSKBN0LG1YN20150212 |title=U.N.

Following the [[Tadmur offensive (2015)|capture of Palmyra]] in Syria, ISIL was reported as not intending to demolish the city's World Heritage Site (while still intending to destroy any statues deemed '[[Polytheism|polytheistic]]').&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/isis-releases-footage-of-palmyra-ruins-intact |title=Syria: Isis releases footage of Palmyra ruins intact and 'will not destroy them' |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2015, ISIL released a 87-second video showing parts of the apparently undamaged ancient [[colonnade]]s, the [[Temple of Bel]] and the [[Roman Theatre at Palmyra|Roman theatre]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt; On 27 June 2015, however, ISIL demolished the ancient [[Lion of Al-lāt]] statue in Palmyra. Several other statues from Palmyra reportedly confiscated from a smuggler were also destroyed by ISIL.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; On 23 August 2015, it was reported that ISIL had blown up the 1st-century [[Temple of Baalshamin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34036644 Palmyra's Baalshamin temple 'blown up by IS'], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/isis-blows-up-temple-dating-back-to-17ad-in-unesco-listed-syrian-city Isis 'blows up temple dating back to 17AD' in Syrian city of Palmyra], TheGuardian.com; accessed 25 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2015, ISIL demolished the [[Temple of Bel]] with explosives. Satellite imagery of the site taken shortly after showed almost nothing remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palmyra's Temple of Bel 'destroyed' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-34111092 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report issued on September 3, 2015 by ASOR Syrian Heritage initiative, ISIL also destroyed seven ancient tower tombs in Palmyra since the end of June over two phases.&lt;ref name="natpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/intolerable-crime-against-civilization-isil-destroys-three-ancient-tower-tombs-in-palmyra |title=In latest round of destruction, ISIL reduces three ancient tower tombs in Palmyra to rubble |work=[[National Post]] |date=September 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last phase of destruction occurred between August 27 and September 2, 2015, including the destruction of the 2nd-century AD [[Tower of Elahbel]], called "the most prominent example of Palmyra's distinct funerary monuments".&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; Earlier, the ancient tombs of Iamliku and Atenaten were also destroyed.&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; The [[Monumental Arch of Palmyra|Monumental Arch]] was also blown up in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaheen |first1=Kareem |title=Isis blows up Arch of Triumph in 2,000-year-old city of Palmyra |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/isis-blows-up-another-monument-in-2000-year-old-city-of-palmyra |accessdate=5 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Palmyra was [[Palmyra offensive (March 2016)|recaptured]] by Syrian government forces in March 2016, retreating ISIL fighters blew up parts of the 13th-century [[Palmyra Castle]], causing extensive damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Said |first1=H. |last2=Raslan |first2=Rasha |last3=Sabbagh |first3=Hazem |title=Palmyra Castle partially damaged due to ISIS acts, plans to restore it to its former glory |url=http://sana.sy/en/?p=72903 |work=[[Syrian Arab News Agency]] |date=26 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327133431/http://sana.sy/en/?p=72903 |archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has also looted and demolished the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]/[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of [[Dura-Europos]] in east of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/09/232028.htm |title=We're sorry, that page can't be found. |website=www.state.gov |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed "the [[Pompeii]] of the desert", the city was of particular archaeological significance.

====Hatra====
[[Hatra]] (Arabic: الحضر al-Ḥaḍr) was an ancient city in the Ninawa Governorate and al-Jazira region of Iraq. A large fortified city and capital of the first Arab Kingdom, Hatra withstood invasions by the Romans in A.D. 116 and 198 thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/277&lt;/ref&gt; However about 240 ce,  the city fell to Shāpūr I (reigned c. 240–272), the ruler of the Persian Sāsānian dynasty, and was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Hatra&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the city, especially the temples where Hellenistic and Roman architecture blend with Eastern decorative features, attest to the greatness of its civilization.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt; The city lies 290&amp;nbsp;km (180&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Baghdad and 110&amp;nbsp;km (68&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Mosul.
On 7 March 2015, various sources including Iraqi officials reported that the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had begun demolishing the ruins of Hatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-08/islamic-state-militants-raze-iraq-ancient-hatra-city/6288618 |title=IS continues cultural cleansing of Iraq with Hatra's destruction: UNESCO |date=8 March 2015 |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video released by ISIL the next month showed destruction of the monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bcdd18ddfe5143f08e5e2335e19e5af9/video-islamic-state-group-shot-hammered-away-iraqs-hatra |title=Video: Islamic State group shot, hammered away Iraq's Hatra |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient city was recaptured by the [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] on 26 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-39726244 |title=IS conflict: Iraqi force 'retakes ancient city of Hatra' |date=26 April 2017 |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017 |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries===

ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from various locations, including the [[Central Library of Mosul]] (which they rigged with explosives and burned down),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-burns-down-mosul-library-destroys-8000-rare-books-manuscripts-624375 |title=Isis Burns Down Mosul Library, Destroys 8,000 Rare Books and Manuscripts |first=Johnlee |last=Varghese |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the library at the [[University of Mosul]], a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BC and include "Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul’s establishment families." The stated goal is to destroy all non-Islamic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-hijacks-mosul-university-chemistry-lab-for-making-bombs-1459503003 |title=Islamic State Hijacks Mosul University Chemistry Lab for Making Bombs |last=London |first=Margaret Coker in |date=2016-04-01 |last2=Baghdad |first2=Ben Kesling in |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |issn=0099-9660|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
On 22 September 2014, the United States Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] announced that the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] had partnered with the American Schools of Orient Research Cultural Heritage Initiatives to "comprehensively document the condition of, and threats to, cultural heritage sites in Iraq and Syria to assess their future restoration, preservation, and protection needs".&lt;ref name="usdep"/&gt; In 2014, the [[UNESCO]]'s Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict condemned at the Ninth Meeting "repeated and deliberate attacks against cultural property... in particular in the Syrian Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/syria-crisis-response/regional-response/single-view/news/reinforce_the_immunity_of_our_common_heritage_under_threat/#.VPDhTY6rEYJ |title=Reinforce the immunity of our common heritage under threat |publisher=UNESCO |date=21 December 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] called the destructions in Mosul a violation of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2199]],&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; and the destruction of Nimrud a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nimrud: Outcry as IS bulldozers attack ancient Iraq site |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-31760656 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |work=BBC News |date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Prime Minister of Iraq [[Nouri al-Maliki]] reported that the local parliamentary tourism and antiquities committee had "filed complaints with the UN to condemn all ISIL crimes and abuses, including those that affect ancient places of worship".&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt; On 28 May 2015, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] unanimously passed a resolution, initiated by Germany and Iraq and sponsored by 91 UN member states, stating that ISIL's destruction of cultural heritage may amount to a war crime and urging international measures to halt such acts, which it described as a "tactic of war".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/69/281|UNGA Resolution 69/281], un.org; accessed 15 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Palmyra temple's destruction in August 2015, the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] (IDA) announced plans to establish a digital record of historical sites and artifacts threatened by ISIL advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparpointgroup.com/news/vol13no35-oxford-3d |title=Oxford Deploying 5,000 Modified 3D Cameras to Fight ISIS |author=Sean Higgins |work=sparpointgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20150902/1026494356/Middle-East-ruins-digital-preservation.html#ixzz3kgt8e2xo |title=Protecting History: The Digital Project Preserving Artifacts From ISIL Ruin |author=Sputnik |date=2 September 2015 |work=sputniknews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCToday&gt;{{cite news |title=The digital race against IS |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p030ys68 |accessdate=24 September 2015 |work=BBC Radio 4 "Today" programme |agency=BBC |date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArchDaily&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosenfield |first1=Karissa |title=Harvard and Oxford Take On ISIS with Digital Preservation Campaign |url=http://www.archdaily.com/772902/harvard-and-oxford-take-on-isis-with-digital-preservation-campaign |accessdate=24 September 2015 |work=Arch Daily |date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accomplish this goal, the IDA, in collaboration with [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|UNESCO]], will deploy 5,000 3D cameras to partners in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mackay |first1=Mairi |title=Indiana Jones with a 3-D camera?

The general director of the [[National Museum (Prague)|Czech National Museum]], Michal Lukeš, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Maamoun Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019.&lt;ref name=czradio&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnstone |first1=Chris |title=Czechs sign up to help save Syrian cultural heritage |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/czechs-sign-up-to-help-save-syrian-cultural-heritage |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=Radio Praha |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, The World Monuments Fund (WMF) announced launching a £500,000 scheme to train Syrian refugees near the Syrian-Jordanian border in traditional stone masonry. The aim is teaching them to develop skills necessary to be able to help in restoring cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed during the Syrian Civil War once peace is restored to Syria.&lt;ref name=theart&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaw |first1=Anny |title=Syrian refugees to be trained to rebuild Palmyra and other heritage sites |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/syrian-refugees-to-be-trained-in-traditional-stone-masonry-to-rebuild-palmyra-and-other-heritage-sit/ |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=The Art Newspaper |date=21 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090053/http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/syrian-refugees-to-be-trained-in-traditional-stone-masonry-to-rebuild-palmyra-and-other-heritage-sit/ |archive-date=2017-06-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Foundation of the magazine ===
Its first publication was on July 30, 2012, whose file was treated by Friendship and Sadness according to [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/revistaelcomite1973/docs/elcomit_1973_num_1|title=El Comité 1973 número 1. Amistad y tristeza según Montaigne|work=Issuu|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Committee", as the magazine is generally known, was created by [[Meneses Monroy]] who is its director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elindependientedehidalgo.com.mx/hemeroteca/2014/05/210024|title=Poesía europea en nuevo número de El Comité 1973 {{!}} Independiente de Hidalgo|website=www.elindependientedehidalgo.com.mx|language=es-MX|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, within the Editorial Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sic.cultura.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=revista_elec&amp;table_id=136|title=El Comité 1973|work=Secretaría de Cultura/Sistema de Información Cultural|access-date=13 May 2018|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the writers, Meneses Monroy, Asmara Gay, who is the editor of the magazine and Patricia Oliver, as Chief of Staff. The Editorial Board is composed by [[:es:Agustín_Cadena|Agustín Cadena]], [[:es:Guadalupe_Flores_Liera|Guadalupe Flores Liera]], [[:es:Claudia_Hernández_de_Valle_Arizpe|Claudia Hernández de Valle Arizpe]], Daniel Olivares Viniegra,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://literatura.inba.gob.mx/hidalgo/4357-olivares-viniegra-daniel.html|title=Olivares Viniegra, Daniel|last=CNL|website=literatura.inba.gob.mx|language=es-es|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Juan_Antonio_Rosado|Juan Antonio Rosado Zacarías]], Eduardo Torre Cantalapiedra and E. J. Valdés. Counselor in Visual Arts: [[Elsa Madrigal]].

The name of "The Committee 1973" is due to two fundamental reasons. On the one hand, "The Committee" carries a horizontal spirit, since all the members of the magazine can publish in it and make decisions regarding the themes or the artistic creation of the publication. There is, then, a democratic spirit. As for the year that is part of the name of the magazine, 1973, refers to the date of the death of the poet [[Pablo Neruda]], which, in some way, tries to be a tribute to this [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]], whom [[Gabriel García Márquez]] called: "the greatest poet of the twentieth century in any [[language]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2004/7/16/the_greatest_poet_of_the_20th|title="The Greatest Poet of the 20th Century In Any Language"–Celebrating Chilean Poet Pablo Neruda|work=Democracy Now!|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IV Anniversary ===
In September 2016, the collaborators of the magazine celebrated its fourth anniversary in [[Casa Lamm]]. Asmara Gay, Patricia Oliver, Daniel Olivares Viniegra and Meneses Monroy were there among other members presenting the number 24 of the magazine.

=== V Anniversary ===
&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;In November 2017, "The Committee" celebrated its fifth anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccmc.org.mx/vernoticias.php?artids=739&amp;cat=479|title=V aniversario de la Revista El Comité 1973|website=CCMC|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Urban Artists Auditorium of the Cultural Center of Contemporary Mexico, with the presence of Daniel Olivares Viniegra, poet and writer; [[Meneses Monroy]], director of the magazine; [[:es:Claudia_Hernández_de_Valle_Arizpe|Claudia Hernández de Valle Arizpe]], long-time poet; and Asmara Gay, editor and writer of diverse literary genres.

== Theme ==
The magazine "The Committee 1973" throughout all its issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/revistaelcomite1973|title=Revista El Comité 1973|website=issuu|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a critical and proactive look at artistic creation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title="Buena literatura independiente difunde El Comité 1973".|last=Guzmán Pérez|first=Mario|date=October 3, 2017|work=El Sol de Hidalgo (México). p. Sección Cultura.}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in the themes it deals with and in the artistic proposal of its [[author]]s. The revision of universal themes that motivate the creation can be found in the numbers devoted to friendship, madness, sex, music, but they have also dedicated some editions to the revision of the classic or historical literary work, both in [[Mexico]] and in various countries: [[Hungary]], The [[Renaissance]], France, [[British Isles]], [[Germany]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], to name a few. Another topic that stands out in its publications is the debate on aesthetic creation: translation, literary criticism, microliterature, black novel, censorship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://noticiastm.com/?p=66427|title=Explora las páginas de una revista literaria de Hoy|access-date=13 May 2018|language=es-MX}}&lt;/ref&gt; the problem of [[language]], literary vanguards, and even through the pages of the magazine you can find topics more cryptic or proactive such as: black humor, impossible cities, the other and its difference, fantastic zoology.

'''Elitzur's theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in [[Quantum field theory|quantum]] and [[statistical field theory]] stating that local [[Gauge theory|gauge symmetries]] cannot be [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]]. The theorem was proposed in 1975 by [[Shmuel Elitzur]], who proved it for [[Abelian group|Abelian]] gauge fields on a [[Lattice gauge theory|lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elitzur S | year = 1975 | title = Impossibility of spontaneously breaking local symmetries | journal = Phys.

'''Epiphanies''' are used as a literary device within literature that is when a character has a sudden insight or realisation that changes his or her understanding of themselves or their comprehension of the world. Literary epiphanies are, "puzzled but privileged moments, sudden gifts of vision, when one’s feeling of aliveness intensifies and the senses quicken.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plotz|first=John Milton Gabriel|date=1999|title=Patterns of Epiphany: From Wordsworth to Tolstoy, Pater, and Barrett Browning (review)|journal=Victorian Studies|volume=42|issue=2|pages=366–369|doi=10.1353/vic.2000.0028|issn=1527-2052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term epiphany as a literary device was not given that term until the author [[James Joyce]] gave it that term to the short stories he wrote between 1898 and 1904 which was central to his early work.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Joyce derived the word from the Greek word 'epiphany' that means the manifestation of a deity or a sudden realisation.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jamesjoyce.ie/epiphanies/|title=Epiphanies|work=The James Joyce Centre|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term epiphany as a literary device has become popular among English speakers.

== Etymology ==
Epiphany as a word is derived from the ancient Greek word ''epiphaneia'' "manifestation, striking appearance, festival held in commemoration of the appearance of a god at some particular place."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/epiphany|title=epiphany {{!}} Origin and meaning of epiphany by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has religious connotations in the early fourteenth century meaning "festival of the manifestation of Christ to the gentiles" and in the New Testament meaning an "advent manifestation of Christ."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Christians denoted from epiphany the meaning of a "visible manifestation of a hidden divinity either in the form of a personal appearance, or by some deed of power by which its presence may be known." &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Citation|last=Walzl|first=Florence L.|title=The Liturgy of the Epiphany Season and the Epiphanies of Joyce|date=2011-03-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5744/florida/9780813035291.003.0002|work=Foundational Essays in James Joyce Studies|pages=24–48|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=9780813035291|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a verb the word means "to display or show forth" and when used in the passive voice it translates to "shine forth." &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The novel, ''[[Dubliners]]'' by James Joyce is a collection of short stories published on June 1914.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jamesjoyce.ie/dubliners-3/|title=Dubliners|work=The James Joyce Centre|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short stories capture some of Joyce's most unhappiest moments in life that he connects to the physical place of [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Dublin, to Joyce seemed to him to be the centre of paralysis in which he explains in a letter to Grant Richards, who was the publisher of ''Dubliners'' Joyce explains his purpose and intention behind writing the novel:&lt;blockquote&gt;"My intention was to write a chapter of the moral history of my country and I chose Dublin for the scene because that city seemed to me the centre of paralysis. I have tried to present it to the indifferent public under four of its aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life. The stories are arranged in this order. I have written it for the most part in a style of scrupulous meanness and with the conviction that he is a very bold man who dares to alter in the presentment, still more to deform, whatever he has seen and heard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/804496624|title=James Joyce A to Z : the essential reference to the life and work|last=Nicholas.|first=Fargnoli, A.|isbn=9780195110296|oclc=804496624|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Epiphanies are a main literary device employed within the fifteen short stories in ''Dubliners'' and tend to circulate around moments of realisation of despair and disillusionment. Epiphanies employed by Joyce are often described as "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spector|first=Robert D.|last2=Beja|first2=Morris|date=1972|title=Epiphany in the Modern Novel|journal=Books Abroad|volume=46|issue=2|pages=304|doi=10.2307/40126190|issn=0006-7431|jstor=40126190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epiphanies in ''Dubliners'' in particular follow a common theme of loss and regret that are intertwined with death and despair that emerge from Joyce's very own childhood in Ireland.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://achalana.evolutionofinstruction.org/2013/02/11/epiphanies-of-despair/|title=Epiphanies of Despair » Exploring Distances|website=achalana.evolutionofinstruction.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanies as a structural tool in ''Dubliners'' helps bring the narrative to a climax as the epiphany is formed throughout the story through the protagonists pain and reflection upon their experiences.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Citation|last=Vesala-Varttala|first=Tanja|pages=101–115|publisher=Presses universitaires François-Rabelais|isbn=9782869064676|doi=10.4000/books.pufr.4526|title=Joyce's Dubliners|year=2000|chapter=Joyce's Dubliners and Conversational Narrative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Araby ===
[[Araby (short story)|Araby]] is the third short story in ''Dubliners'' that centres around the narrator recollecting on an experience of when he was a young boy where he experienced a moment of epiphanic disillusionment. The story narrates in first person a young boy who is infatuated with a girl who remains unnamed and is referred to as, "Mangan's sister."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=author.|first=Joyce, James, 1882-1941,|title=Dubliners|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/965806639|isbn=9781520068497|oclc=965806639|access-date=2018-10-09|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator is infatuated with her even though he has never truly spoken to her, yet he claims that her name was, ''"like a summons to all my foolish blood.''"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=author.|first=Joyce, James, 1882-1941,|title=Dubliners|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/965806639|year=2017|isbn=9781520068497|oclc=965806639|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the narrator learns of how Mangan's sister wishes to go to Araby, which is a [[bazaar]] that she cannot go to due to other religious obligations the narrator believes that if he can bring her back a gift that she would return his feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, when the time came to go to the bazaar the narrator is delayed because he needs his uncle to lend him some money although the uncle forgot about it and so the narrator heads out late to the bazaar.

Upon arrival to the bazaar, most of the stalls are closed as he is late. The narrator is confronted by what he is seeing in front of him and he turns away from Araby after his vision and expectations of it are destroyed with the banal reality of it that is presented to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Harry|date=1965|title="Araby" and the Writings of James Joyce|journal=The Antioch Review|volume=25|issue=3|pages=375–410|doi=10.2307/4610703|issn=0003-5769|jstor=4610703}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, he becomes disillusioned with his idealisation of Mangan's sister as well. In the last sentence this notion is captured: "''Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where his realisation becomes an epiphanic moment. He now views the world differently as he now realises his own vanity and stupidity as he now has more self-awareness of himself.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Eveline ===
[[Eveline]] centres around the character of the same name who has been given a chance to escape her life with a man called Frank who is in love with her, however, Eveline's family is the cause of her paralysis. Her mother and brother have died, one of her brothers is always away and her father is an abusive drunkard. It could be assumed that her father's nature would provide greater reason for her to leave but when the opportunity arises for her to escape she simply cannot as she states that "it was impossible" as she realises her situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eveline feels with Frank that, ''"all the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing...No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish."'' This is Eveline's epiphany that she cannot escape even though she wanted to she cannot leave behind her familial ties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== A Little Cloud ===
[[A Little Cloud]] is a part of the Dubliners short story collection centring around the protagonist, Little Chandler who reunites with an old friend, Ignatius Gallaher  who is a more worldly man than himself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Little Chandler wishes to change his life, but the harsh reality of Dublin intrudes upon his hopes and in his moment of epiphany when he realises that it is useless to try to change his reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/823326430|title=James Joyce's Epiphany and Virginia Woolf's "Moment of Importance"|last=MA|first=Jin|date=2011|publisher=Canadian Academy of Oriental and Occidental Culture|oclc=823326430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little Chandler's first epiphany begins when he reunites with Gallaher who is successful in the world after he left Dublin. During this conversation between the two men is when Little Chandler realises and starts to believe that the only way to be successful in life is to leave Dublin.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Little Chandler then returns home to a house full of hate and regret where he his wife controls him and he does not love her and who made him give up what he does love - poetry.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Upon his return home, he looks into a photograph of his wife as he looks, "coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly," back to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/james-joyces-short-story-quot-little-cloud-quot-44153|title=In James Joyce's short story "A Little Cloud", what is the epiphany?  (the revelation of the main character and or the reader????) {{!}} eNotes|website=eNotes|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He feels a deep rush of despair and regret for marrying his wife as he realises that, "''dull resentment against his life awoke within him''."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His child begins to cry and wail whilst Little Chandler was pondering his life and he finds he does not know what to do to make the child stop.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wife eventually rushes in and scolds Little Chandler: ''"'What have you done to him?'''" This is when the final epiphany starts to form itself as he looks into her eyes and his "''heart closed together''" upon gazing into her cold eyes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The last sentence capsulises the epiphany as, "''Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child's sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.''"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The tears of remorse that begin to fill up his eyes are symbolic of his emotion of regret for his life and the uselessness his feels in never being able to change the trajectory of his life in the way that he wants.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The Dead ===
The short story [[The Dead (short story)|''The Dead'']] express the paralysis of the epiphany Joyce’s character Gabriel experiences in discovering his wife’s grief over her first love. The line "''It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life,''” provides a tonal shift from Gabriel lusting after his wife to being dumbstruck by the realisation that he may not be enough for his wife. When Gretta (wife) listens to D’Arcy singing ''The Lass of Aughrim'', she is reminded of her first love’s death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gabriel realises that while he has been lusting after her she has been comparing him to another man. This section of the story is influenced by Joyce’s love of Irish music.

== William Wordsworth's "Spots of time" ==
[[William Wordsworth]] was a [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] in the 1800s. He became a renowned poet with his collaboration with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Samual Taylor Coleridge]] when they wrote the collection of poems together, the ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]''. In Wordsworth's time, epiphanies had not yet been given that term and were referred to by Wordsworth as "spots of time."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDuff|first=Sangam|date=2015|title=Death and the Limits of Epiphany: Wordsworth's Spots of Time and Joyce's Epiphanies of Death|journal=James Joyce Quarterly|volume=53|issue=1–2|pages=61–73|doi=10.1353/jjq.2015.0056|issn=1938-6036}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an agreement that the modern term for the literature device "epiphany" began with Romanticism and in particular with the works of William Wordsworth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Wordsworth's innovation of "spots of time" in his poems have affected modern fiction and the modern short story.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langbaum|first=Robert|date=1983|title=The Epiphanic Mode in Wordsworth and Modern Literature|journal=New Literary History|volume=14|issue=2|pages=335–358|doi=10.2307/468689|issn=0028-6087|jstor=468689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Prelude ===
The main plot points of ''[[The Prelude]]'' centre around the exploration of epiphany through what Wordsworth is trying to express as being vital to the history of his imagination.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bishop|first=Jonathan|date=1959-03|title=Wordsworth and the "Spots of Time"|journal=ELH|volume=26|issue=1|pages=45–65|doi=10.2307/2872079|issn=0013-8304|jstor=2872079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two central themes to ''The Prelude'' are of childhood and memory and the adventures that Wordsworth has had as a child in the [[Lake District]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These memories are how he recollects on these moments of his childhood in his adult life is where his 'spots of time' or epiphanies as they are more commonly referred to, arise from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/william-wordsworth/0/steps/9853|title=Wordsworth's 'Spots of Time'|last=FutureLearn|website=FutureLearn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Book Twelve of The Prelude: Imagination and Taste, How Impaired and Restored ====
In the twelfth book of ''The Prelude'', Wordsworth in his poem elaborates on the experience of the rejuvenating virtue that is given to him through his epiphanic moments that he recalls from childhood experience.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=1770-1850.|first=Wordsworth, William,|title=The prelude : the 1850 text|date=2013|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/973775028|publisher=Naxos|isbn=9781843797340|oclc=973775028|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are in our existence spots of time,/ That with distinct pre-eminence retain,/ A renovating virtue, whence--depressed/ By false opinion and contentious thought,/ Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,/ In trivial occupations, and the round/ Of ordinary intercourse--our minds/ Are nourished and invisibly repaired;/ A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,/ That penetrates, enables us to mount,/ When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen./ This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks/ Among those passages of life that give/ Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,/ The mind is lord and master--outward sense/  The obedient servant of her will. Such moments/ Are scattered everywhere, taking their date/ From our first childhood."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The language Wordsworth uses within this excerpt suggests that he has had many 'spots of time' that he could draw upon from his memory that could give him strength as they release to him a sense of epiphany in his new realisation of seeing the world in a recollection of youth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Notable Authors that use Epiphanies ==
The use of epiphanies as a stylistic and structural device in narrative and poetry came to prominence in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was a popular literary device of the modern author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/technique/epiphany4.html|title=Epiphanies and Time|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erwin Faber''' (21 July 1891 &amp;ndash; 4 May 1989) was a leading actor in [[Munich]] and later throughout [[Germany]], beginning after [[World War I]], and through the late-1970s, when he was still performing at the [[Residenz Theatre]] (The National Theatre of Bavaria).  Born in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], Faber remained in Germany during the [[Third Reich]], emerging afterwards as a prominent actor in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany).  He died in Munich in 1989, only two months after his last performance at the Residenztheater (the National Theatre of Bavaria), at age 97.

== Acting career ==
In addition to performing in dozens of dramas and films in Germany, working with the leading directors in post-World War I Germany, such as [[Max Reinhardt]], [[Otto Falckenberg]], and [[Erich Engel]], Faber also was chosen by [[Bertolt Brecht]] to play the leads in the first three staged plays of Brecht in Munich, beginning with ''[[Drums in the Night]]'' (''Trommeln in der Nacht'') at the avant-garde theatre, the Munich Kammerspiele in September 1922, followed by ''[[In The Jungle of Cities]]'' (''Im Dickicht der Städte'') at Munich's Residenz Theater in May 1923, and ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'' (''Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England'') directed by Brecht himself in his directing debut and featuring [[Oskar Homolka]], in March 1924.&lt;ref name="actingbrecht"&gt;"Acting Brecht: The Munich Years," by W. Stuart McDowell, in ''The Brecht Sourcebook'', Carol Martin, Henry Bial, editors (Routledge, 2000) p. 71&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Erwin Faber also played the lead in a film written by Brecht in 1923, ''[[Mysteries of a Barbershop]]'' (''Mysterien eines Friseursalons''), with leading comic and dramatic actors of Germany of that time: [[Karl Valentin]], Liesl Karlstadt, Blandine Ebinger, [[Max Schreck]], and Carola Neher.  The 16-minute improvised film is now considered one of the hundred most important films in history of [[German film]].&lt;ref name="actingbrecht" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'',  by David Culbert, (Louisiana State University, Carfax Publishing) March, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brechtvalentin"&gt;"A Brecht-Valentin Production: ''Mysteries of a Barbershop''", W. Stuart McDowell, ''Performing Arts Journal'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter, 1977), pp. 2&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Faber also was cast by [[Ingmar Bergman]] for his film ''Life of the Marionettes'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ingmar Bergman, Master Filmmaker, Dies at 89 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/movies/30cnd-bergman.html | first = Mervyn | last = Rothstein | publisher = New York Times | date = 2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11776">The '''film industry in Florida''' is one of the largest in the [[United States]]: in 2006, [[Florida]] ranked third in the U.S. for film production (after [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]) based on revenue generated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funandsun.com/1tocf/film/floridafilms.html 2006 Florida Film Commission Data]&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent 2009-2010 data no longer show Florida among the top four states.&lt;ref name=fw&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://filmworks.filmla.com/2011/06/24/californias-top-five-competitors-for-film-tv-production-dollars/ |title=Film Works L.A.; Note that California, #1 is not included in the chart |access-date=2012-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415232947/http://filmworks.filmla.com/2011/06/24/californias-top-five-competitors-for-film-tv-production-dollars/ |archive-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production activity has been generally concentrated in two regions, South and Central Florida ([[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]).  The South Florida region is famous for large projects like [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]'s ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' film series and Neal Moritz's ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]''. The Central Florida area has been featured in ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', starring [[John Travolta]], and Adam Sandler's ''[[The Waterboy]]''.

The state of Florida has a long film history thanks to its [[Climate of Florida|year-round sunshine and moderate climate]].  Film classics were filmed throughout the state, such as ''[[Moon Over Miami (film)|Moon Over Miami]]'' (1941) and [[Esther Williams]]' ''Easy to Love'' (1953).

==Orlando==
In the early 1990s Orlando experienced a great boom in film production. The construction of the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] and [[Universal Studios]] production facilities attracted many filmmakers to the area. Films like Ron Howard's ''Parenthood'' and [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated television shows]] like ''[[Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' led the pack. Soon, the Steven Spielberg series ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'' and Tom Hank's ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' called Florida home. During this period Orlando acquired the nickname "Hollywood East" because of its surging film industry.

Just as film production appeared to be on the decline in Florida, the phenomenal success of 1998's ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' led to another boom. While this film was filmed in [[Maryland]], its director and entire crew were [[University of Central Florida]] [[film school]] graduates. This cult [[independent film]] has led to a new wave of film production for the area.

==Celebrity residents==
Florida is also the home of many famous actors.  Celebrity residents of Florida include [[Burt Reynolds]], [[James Best]], [[John Travolta]], [[Michael Winslow]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Carrot Top|Scott "Carrot Top" Thompson]], [[Will Smith]], [[Allan Meade]], and [[Sylvester Stallone]].  There are also quite a few successful film directors located in the state including [[Daniel Myrick]] and [[George A. Romero]].

[[File:Frederic-Clay-ILN.jpg|right|thumb|Frederic Clay]] 
'''Frederic Emes Clay''' (3 August 1838 – 24 November 1889) was an English composer known principally for his music written for the stage. Clay, a great friend of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s, wrote four [[comic opera]]s with [[W. S. Gilbert]] and introduced the two men.

While working as a civil servant in the Treasury department, Clay began composing seriously in the early 1860s.  His first big success was ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869), a short comic opera with a libretto by [[W. S. Gilbert]], for the small [[Gallery of Illustration]].  Other pieces with Gilbert and others followed, and Clay turned to composing full-time after his father died in 1873.  That year, he composed a successful opera-bouffe version of ''[[The Black Crook]]'' for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  Clay's last piece with Gilbert was  ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1875).  He also composed two [[cantata]]s.  His last two works were both successful operas composed in 1883, ''The Merry Duchess'' and ''The Golden Ring''.  He then suffered a stroke that paralysed him at age 44.

==Life and career==
Clay was born in Paris&lt;ref name="TBDP1"&gt;"Death of Sir Frederic Clay", ''The Birmingham Daily Post'', 29 November 1889, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; to English parents, [[James Clay (author)|James Clay]] (1804–1873), a member of parliament, and his wife, Eliza Camilla Woolrych.  Clay was the fourth of six brothers and sisters.  His father was celebrated as a player of [[whist]] and the author of a treatise on that subject, as well as an amateur composer.  His mother also had a musical background, as her mother had been an opera singer.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Knowles, Christopher.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5559 "Clay, Frederic Emes (1838–1889)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Clay was educated at home by private tutors in London, studying piano and violin, and then music composition under [[Bernhard Molique]] and, in 1863, with [[Moritz Hauptmann]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Sullivan, Arthur.  [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/ages_ago/clay.html "Frederic Clay (1838–1889)",] ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a civil servant in the Treasury department while also pursuing composing.&lt;ref name="ERA1"&gt;"Death of Mr Frederic Clay", ''The Era'', 30 November 1889, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his father in 1873, his inheritance enabled him to become a full-time composer.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L.  [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/101.htm A 101st Garland of British Light Music Composers], Classical Music Web, MusicWeb-International.com&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of some songs, hymns, instrumental pieces and two [[cantata]]s, his compositions were nearly all written for the stage.  In the mid-1860s, Clay and his friend [[Arthur Sullivan]] became frequent guests at the home of [[John Scott Russell]].  By about 1865, Clay became engaged to Scott Russell's youngest daughter Alice, and Sullivan wooed the middle daughter Rachel.  The Scott Russells welcomed the engagement of Alice to Clay, but he broke it off.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 87; Jacobs, p. 53.  The Scott Russells forbade the relationship between Sullivan and Rachel, because Sullivan had uncertain financial prospects, although Rachel continued to see him covertly.  At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with the eldest daughter, Louise, but both relationships had ceased by early 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Ages Ago.png|left|thumb|300px|A scene from ''[[Ages Ago]]'' in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'']]
Clay wrote his first short play for the amateur stage in 1859 called '''The Pirate's Isle'', and completed the short comic play ''Out of Sight'' the following year.&lt;ref name="ERA1"/&gt; His first professionally produced piece was an opera entitled ''Court and Cottage'', with a libretto by [[Tom Taylor]], which was produced at [[Covent Garden Theatre]] in 1862.  In 1865, for the same theatre, he composed another opera, the unsuccessful ''Constance'' (1865), with a libretto by [[Thomas William Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 16, says: "Constance was written to a rather 'heavy' libretto. ... It was a tale of love and patriotism set in Poland under the Russians – something of a Polish ''Tosca'', but with a happy ending when the hero and heroine are rescued first by a singing [[vivandiere]] and then by the Polish army. The music ... was noted as being promising if rather light and, after being performed eighteen times as a curtain-raiser to the Covent Garden pantomime of ''Cinderella'', it sank into obscurity."  The score is available at the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt; With [[B. C. Stephenson]], he wrote three pieces played by amateurs: ''The Pirate's Isle'', ''Out of Sight'' and ''The Bold Recruit'' (1868), and with [[W. S. Gilbert]] he wrote ''[[Ages Ago]]'' (1869) for [[Thomas German Reed]]'s [[Gallery of Illustration]].&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; This piece ran for 350 performances and was revived several times.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt; Clay introduced Gilbert to Arthur Sullivan during a rehearsal for ''Ages Ago''.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html Analysis of Ages Ago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903092123/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html |date=3 September 2006 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bold Recruit'' was revived at a benefit by German Reed at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] in 1870 as a companion piece to ''Ages Ago''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 24 July 1870, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

These were followed by ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]'' (1870, also with Gilbert), ''In Possession'' (1871, also for German Reed), ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872, with Gilbert), ''Oriana'' (1873, with a libretto by [[James Albery]]), ''Green Old Age'' and ''Cattarina'' (both 1874, with libretti by [[Robert Reece]]), ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1875, the last collaboration between Clay and Gilbert), and ''Don Quixote'' (1876).&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;  ''Ages Ago'' (a one-act piece) and ''Princess Toto'' (a three-act [[comic opera]]) are considered to be among Clay's most tuneful and attractive works.  ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that the music of ''Princess Toto'' "is probably surpassed by no modern English work of the kind for gaiety and melodious charm."&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 29 November 1889, p. 5, col. F&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay also composed part of the score for the spectacle ''Babil and Bijou'' (1872, also for German Reed)&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; and the successful opera-bouffe version of ''[[The Black Crook]]'' (1873 based on the same source material as the earlier American musical of the same name and starring [[Kate Santley]]), both of which were produced with success at the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  He also furnished incidental music for a revival of ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.&lt;ref name="ERA1"/&gt;

===Cantatas and later career===
Clay's two cantatas were ''The Knights of the Cross'' (1866) and ''Lalla Rookh'' (containing perhaps Clay's best-known song, "I'll sing thee songs of Araby" and also "Still this golden lull"), which was produced successfully at the Brighton Festival in 1877.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Clay had difficulty finding work in London and moved to America.  There he met with only mixed success and returned to England in 1881.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His last works were ''The Merry Duchess'' (1883) at the [[Royalty Theatre]], starring [[Kate Santley]] and in which [[Louie Henri]] also appeared,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qUyGtqatz2gC&amp;pg=PA72 Information about ''The Merry Duchess'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Golden Ring'' (starring [[Marion Hood]]) (1883), both with words by [[G. R. Sims]].  The latter was written for the reopening of the Alhambra, which had been burned to the ground the year before.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; These shows were both successful and showed an artistic advance upon Clay's previous work.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, pp. 228 and 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay's friend, Sir Arthur Sullivan, wrote: "In all his works Clay showed a natural gift of graceful melody and a feeling for rich harmonic colouring. [His songs included] 'She wandered down the mountain side,' 'Long ago' and 'The Sands of Dee'".&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Other songs that achieved popularity are "Gipsy John" and "Who Knows".&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

After conducting the second performance of ''The Golden Ring'' in December 1883, Clay suffered a stroke that paralysed him and cut short his productive life.&lt;ref name="TBDP1"/&gt; In 1889 at the age of 51, he was found drowned in his bath at the home of his sisters in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Great Marlow]], England, presumably a suicide.  He was buried in [[Brompton cemetery]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Henry Crabb Robinson''' (1775–1867) was an English lawyer known as a [[diarist]].

==Life==
Robinson was born in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[England]]. He was youngest son of a tanner who died in 1781; [[Habakkuk Crabb]] was his uncle. After education at small private schools, he was articled in 1790 to an [[Lawyer|attorney]] in [[Colchester]]. At Colchester he heard [[John Wesley]] preach one of his last sermons. In 1796 he entered the office of a solicitor in [[Chancery Lane]], London; but in 1798 a relative died, leaving Robinson a sum yielding a considerable yearly income. Proud of his independence and eager for travel, he went abroad in 1800. Between 1800 and 1805 he studied at various places in [[Germany]], meeting [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] there, including [[Goethe]], [[Schiller]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. He then became correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] in 1807. Later on he was sent to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in [[Spain]], as a [[war correspondent]] in the [[Peninsular War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Durán de Porras |first1=Elías |title=Galicia, the Times y la Guerra de la Independencia. Henry Crabb Robinson y la corresponsalía de The Times en A Coruña (1808-1809) |date=2008 |publisher=Fundación Pedro Barrié de la Maza |location=A Coruña |isbn=9788495892676}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On his return to [[London]] in 1809, Robinson decided to quit journalism and studied for [[Barrister|the Bar]], to which he was called in 1813, and became leader of the Eastern [[Circuit court|Circuit]]. Fifteen years later he retired, and by virtue of his conversation and qualities, became a leader in society. He was one of the founders of the London University (now [[University College London]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/uclart/about/collections/objects/four-founders-of-ucl|title=The Four Founders of UCL|publisher=[[University College London]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and travelled several times to Italy, as many of his contemporaries did. Among those whom he befriended in Rome in 1829 was the novelist [[Sarah Burney]].

Robinson died unmarried, aged 91. He was buried in a vault in [[Highgate Cemetery]] alongside his friend [[Edwin Wilkins Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|last=Rigg|first=James McMullen |wstitle=Rolt, Sir John|volume=49|pages=173,174}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bust of Crabb Robinson was made, and a portrait by [[Edward Armitage]].&lt;ref name="DNB00" /&gt;

==Works==
Robinson's ''Diary, Reminiscences and Correspondence'' was published in 1869.{{sfn|Cousin|1910|p=319}} It contains reminiscences of central figures of the English romantic movement: including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], [[William Blake]], [[William Wordsworth]], and others. They are documents on the daily lives of London writers, artists, political figures and socialites. In his essay on Blake, [[Algernon Swinburne|Swinburne]] says, "Of all the records of these his latter years, the most valuable, perhaps, are those furnished by Mr. Crabb Robinson, whose cautious and vivid transcription of Blake's actual speech is worth more than much vague remark, or than any commentary now possible to give."&lt;ref name="Symons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Symons|first=Arthur|title=William Blake|publisher=E. P. Dutton and Company|location=New York|year=1907|pages=331–335|chapter=Appendix: Extracts from the Diary, Letters, and Reminiscences of Henry Crabb Robinson|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/William_Blake_(Symons)/Extracts_from_the_Diary,_Letters,_and_Reminiscences_of_Henry_Crabb_Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1829 Robinson was made a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] (F.S.A.), and contributed a paper to ''[[Archæologia (London)|Archæologia]]'' entitled "The Etymology of the Mass".&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB |last=Rae |first=William Fraser |authorlink=William Fraser Rae |wstitle=Robinson, Henry Crabb |volume=49 |quote=''sources:'' ''Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson'', by [[Thomas Sadler (Unitarian)|Thomas Sadler]]; ''Letters of Charles Lamb'', ed. Ainger.]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His diaries were bequeathed to [[Dr Williams's Library]], because Robinson had been a member of the [[Essex Street Chapel]], the first avowedly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation in England.

The '''International Centre for Theatre Research''' sometimes also known as The International Centre for Theatre Creation was founded in 1970 by [[Peter Brook]] and [[Micheline Rozan]].  It is often abbreviated to the [[acronym]] CIRT as in French the group is called the Centre International de Recherche Théâtrale.  The centre is a multicultural theatrical research and production company based out of the [[Bouffes du Nord]] theatre in Paris since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;'''The Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre'', edited Colin Chambers, Continuum, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8264-4959-X}}, Page 384&lt;/ref&gt; The first three years of the company were taken up by exploring a fundamental theatrical question (see below)

== Funding ==
Brook had previously been sponsored for limited periods by [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] or the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] (at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]]).  Brook and Rozan acquired sufficient funding to sustain Brook's work for three years.  Working with a core company and several visiting collaborators. 
A budget of $1 million was established: $100,000 to set up the organization, and $300,000 for each year from 1971-1973{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  Money was raised from the French government and various international foundations ([[Ford Foundation]], [[Gulbenkian Foundation]] and [[Anderson Foundation]]s)
Money also came from the government of [[Iran]] in the form of a commission for a work at the [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]/[[Persepolis]] festival in 1971. Work was begun even though the full three-year budget was not secured at the outset.

== First three-year journey ==
This multinational assembly of actors, dancers, musicians and other performers travelled widely in the Middle East and Africa in the early 1970s.  This was as a three-year 'pilgrimage' to answer the question "What were the common stories, the recognizable shorthands, the instant abstractions, the shared outlines of story and character with which an international group could work?"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
On this three-year sojourn, they produced two major works ''[[Orghast]]'' I &amp; II, performed in 1971 at the [[Shiraz Arts Festival]] in Iran in the [[Achaemenid]] ruins of [[Persepolis]] and [[Naqsh-e Rostam]], and ''[[The Conference of Birds]]'' developed in [[West Africa]] and completed in 1974 at [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|BAM]] in Brooklyn, New York.

In 1999, the organization added curatorial residencies, and became the International Studio &amp; Curatorial Program (ISCP) with the Trust for Mutual Understanding sponsoring a curator from Czech Republic. In 2001, ISCP relocated to Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan and in 2008, ISCP moved to [[East Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] and increased its capacity to 35 studios.&lt;ref name="timesnewsweekly.com"/&gt; ISCP’s programs are currently housed in a former factory built in 1901.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1269">'''Inventory''' are a collective of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[artists]], [[writers]] and art theorists, founded in 1996.

Some of their pieces see them engage in [[performance art]] in public spaces. 

''Coagulum (Oxford Street)'' in 2000, saw them form into a close group on [[London]]'s [[Oxford Street]], thus disrupting the flow of pedestrians, before entering a shopping centre and dancing to the piped music. For another piece, they played [[football (soccer)|football]] on [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] with a rubber skull, using [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Admiralty Arch]] as goals.

Other pieces, such as the [[installation art|installation]] ''Requiem For The Empty Quarter'' at [[The Approach Gallery]] in [[Bethnal Green]] during 2002, used modified and written-upon objects found on the street.

In 2003, Inventory were nominated for the [[Beck's Futures]] prize.

The origins of '''Israeli printmaking''' can be found in the [[Hebrew]]-[[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] [[printing|print]] from the second half of the 19th century. The field includes the use of various print techniques such as [[woodcut]], [[etching]], [[Lithography]] and more. At the same time, the development of the artistic print in the Land of Israel and later in the State of [[Israel]] cannot be translated into a continuum of development, but rather a tradition of mutual influences along with expressions of disconnect and disregard caused by various artistic influences and by the development of technological means. 

==The beginning of printing in Palestine== 
[[file:Olitzky 02.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|''Seder Avodat Hakodes'' title page, woodcut, printed by [[Israel Back]].]]
The beginning of the modern printing industry in Israel can be found in the second half of the 19th century, when a number of printing houses were established in [[Jerusalem]]. These printing houses dealt with the printing of texts in which various artistic images were incorporated. The first [[Hebrew]] printing house was established by [[Israel Back]] (Baal Koreh [Hebrew term for Torah Reader]) in [[Safed]] in 1841 and transferred to Jerusalem in 1841. Back worked with presses and tools for casting letters he brought with him from Europe. The first press was a wooden table-shaped press, a heavy metal plate laid on the paper undergoing the printing operation.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Olitzky, The Art of Printing, (Hadera: Museum of Printing Art and Hadera Paper, 1973), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, Israel Back received the printing presses nicknamed "Massat Moshe and Yehudit" (he: משאת משה ויהודית) from [[Moses Montefiore]]. Its area of print was 85 cm long and 57&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref&gt;This press, known as the "Moses and Yehudit", was sold with the closure of the printing house by the son of Israel Beck to the "Zuckerman Printing Press" (see, Joseph Olitzky, The Art of Printing, p. 37, 53-54). From a more recent perspective, the press was transferred to the Levin-Epstein Press. Today the press is located at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya&lt;/ref&gt; The first book printed by Back in Jerusalem was "Seder Avodat Hakodes" (he: סדר עבודת הקודש) by [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]].[3] His title page is decorated with a hybrid model created using a [[wood engraving]] technique. In the center of the description is an image of a two-column gate in the [[Ionic order]], bearing a decorative [[frieze]] with an [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaf. Around the gate, Beck created an ornamental frame with vegetal patterns.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p. 188-189.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Christian printing houses such as the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Armenian]] St. James Printing House, founded in 1833; the [[Custody of the Holy Land|Franciscan]] printing house, which began in 1846 under the direction of [[Sebastian Pratschner]]; the printing house of [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]], which was founded in 1853 and another printing house, established in 1885 at the [[Schneller Orphanage]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gil Gordon, "'The best one in the Black Art: The Print-shop of Schneller's German Protestant Mission in Palestine in the late Ottoman Period'," Cathedra 138 (2010):  83-110. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The main concern of printing houses was the printing of texts using [[Letterpress printing]]. However, in the process of printing, various illustrations were sometimes included. These illustrations were created using woodcut, wood engraving or metal engraving techniques and were limited by the size the print. Most of the decorations were assigned to the title page of the book. This page usually consisted of a decorative frame created from a print or image of the [[Holy Land]]. In addition, the printing houses created a variety of printed items such as decorated certificates, "Mizrachs" [ornamental or sacred pictures hung on the east wall of a house or synagogue in the direction of Jerusalem], etc. The printing houses themselves created some of the printing blocks, while others were commissioned by independent trainers. [[Abraham Leib Monzon]], for example, created some of the printing blocks for his printing house, while others were created by artists like [[Meir Rozin]]. On the "Shiviti" plate, for example, created by [[Shimon Israel Shane]], three printing blocks (printing plates) that contain descriptions of the [[Western Wall]], [[Rachel's Tomb]] and the tombs of the kings of the House of David, with hand-painted and hand-stamped seals, were added.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p. 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, these illustrations were reused for various printed materials and even passed between different printing houses.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the technique of lithograph printing was at the ''Salomon Printing House'' (he: דפוס סלומון), founded by [[Yoel Moshe Salomon]] and [[Michal HaCohen]], who learned the technique in [[Königsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Inspiration and Implementation: The Story of the Salomon (Zoref) Family (Jerusalem: The Ari Synagogue, 2011), p. 10- 11.&lt;/ref&gt; During their studies there HaCohen and Solomon printed a pamphlet entitled "Altar Stones," in which they detailed the process of creating a lithographic print.&lt;ref&gt;See Shoshana Halevi, The Beginning of Hebrew Printing in Eretz Israel, on the website Daat (http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/mahanaim/halevi-1.htm) (first published in Mahanayim, 1966), p. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision to import the technique to Israel probably stemmed from their desire to serve as an alternative to the printing house of Back, which for 20 years had held a monopoly in the field of Jewish printmaking. One of the first works printed by the new printing house was "Shoshanta" (1862), the name for a local version of a decorative ornament drawn from European traditions. Along with the descriptions, there were also photographs of places such as the [[Tomb of Absalom]], [[Tower of David]], the Western Wall, etc. 

Another printing press that was known for its artistic works was ''A.L. Monsohn Printing House'' (he: דפוס א.ל. מונזון), which began operations in 1892. The printing house began operating with a hand press and in 1894 brought an automatic machine from Europe that could produce about 1,000 pages per hour.[10] A major part of the work of this printing press was the use of the [[lithograph]] printing technique. Among other things, it created prints of up to half a sheet (50x70 cm),&lt;ref&gt;See: A.L. Monsohn Lithographic Press,1892-1992, (Jerusalem: The Ari Synagogue, 2009), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; from the works of artists such as Rozin, Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi, and others, who also began to make use of photographs created using the lithographic technique,&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., 100 Years of Printing in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs were converted to lithographs in a process that included the use of the technique of etching and transfer paper ([[Decalcomania]]).

== 1900–1950, From Europe to Eretz Israel: the Beginning of the Modern Artistic Print==

While the people of the '[[Old Yishuv]]' perceived art as a religious art that served the [[liturgy]], at the beginning of the 20th century, art became more prevalent in modern Hebrew culture. Expressions of Judaism also began to gain national significance, following the expansion of the [[Zionist movement]] in Europe. The artists who came from Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, already experienced artists with a standing in the print industry, contributed most to the development of this medium in the Eretz Israel. Another central milestone in the development of this concept is the establishment of the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts]] in Jerusalem in 1906.

===Hermann Struck and his successors===

The most prominent Jewish artist in the European printing industry was [[Hermann Struck]], who was associated with many Expressionist artists, was even a member of the [[Vienna Secession|Sezessionstil]] in Berlin, and exhibited consistently until 1913. Along with landscapes, Struck created portraits and genre descriptions of Jewish life, particularly in Eastern Europe. He did this in a variety of print techniques such as lithograph and etching. Over the years he published several files of prints as a book, but Struck's most famous and successful book was ''Die Kunst des Radierens'' (The Art of Etching), published in Berlin in 1908 by [[Paul Kasirer]]. The book described the process of printing etchings, interspersed with illustrations by Struck. Because of the popularity of the book, which appealed to both artists and to the public as a whole, it was printed in four additional editions between 1912 and 1923. The book established Struck's fame as a leading artist in the print industry.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

[[Jacob Steinhardt]] and [[Joseph Budko]], who studied print with Struck, also dealt often with themes from the [[Shtetl]], not only as an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] depiction, as Struck did, but also as a spiritual expression. Part of the change stemmed from the influence of expressionism on these artists. For Steinhardt, for example, this effect was expressed in a theatrical atmosphere rich in pathos and grotesque expressions.&lt;ref&gt;See One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1907 and 1935, Steinhardt created about 250 etchings, but in Palestine he began to work in the [[wood cut]] ,combining [[Wood engraving]] parts, both because of his inability to produce these etchings and as an expression of the influence of the light in Palestine, which he expresses in the contrasting blacks and whites characteristic of this medium.&lt;ref&gt;See: Amishai-Meisels, Ziva, Jacob Steinhardt: Etchings and Lithographs, (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1981), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with their independent works, the two also created [[Illustration]]s in various print techniques for various Hebrew publications that were published in Europe at the time. Among these are the woodcuts that Steinhardt created for the [[Book of Jonah]] (1924) and the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]] (Berlin: Ferdinand Auster, 1923), accompanied by a calligraphic text created by [[Franzisca Baruch]], and the lithographs created by Budko for [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]]’s And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight (1919), as well as his prints for the 50th edition (Berlin: Hovevei Ha-Shir Ha-Ivrit, 1923) of the writings of [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

===1906–1930: Bezalel and the art of printing===
[[File:A.0064-2 size.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bezalel Jerusalem, Lithographical Establishment, Photograph by [[Ya'acov Ben-Dov]]. Jerusalem Print Workshop collection]]
With the establishment of the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts]], [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], one of the leading illustrators in Europe, arrived in Jerusalem. His artistic style derived from the European "[[Jugendstil]]" and his work expressed the main Zionist national outlook at the time. Lilien was also in the habit of taking photographs from which he would create his drawings and prints. Despite the fact that he lived only a short time in Jerusalem, his style influenced Bezalel's main style of design.

In 1909, a lithography department was opened at Bezalel, headed by [[Avraham Gershowitz]] (Gershuni). This department printed a limited number of artistic works, mainly by artists such as [[Shmuel Ben-David]] and [[Jacob Stark|Ya’akov (Jacob) Stark]]. However, the print quality was poor and was not suitable for producing large editions, mainly due to the technical equipment. [[Boris Schatz]] himself testified in 1917 that the school had equipment to "make experimental leaves," but that "we do not have a printing machine."&lt;ref&gt;Boris Schatz, "A Proposal to Strengthen and Distribute Craftsmanship in Jerusalem and Eretz-Israel in General," in Shilo-Cohen, Nurit, Schatz's Bezalel, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1982), p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the artistic endeavors, the department also did commercial work such as printing textbooks and other materials, such as lottery cards designed by Shmuel Haruvi.&lt;ref&gt;See: One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 13-15; Also: Gideon Ofrat, "Comment on the Beginning of Lithography in Eretz Israel," on the website "Gideon Ofrat’s Warehouse" ( https://gideonofrat.wordpress.com/), 7 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the lithographic work at Bezalel included realistic prints of portraits and genre descriptions, as well as a few commercial works.

In 1919 [[Israel Hirshfeld]], a student of Bezalel (1915–1917), was sent to Vienna in order to learn professionally the art of lithograph printing. Throughout his stay there, he exchanged letters with Bezalel teachers like [[Abel Penn]], Schatz, and others who asked him to purchase a press and lithographic equipment for Bezalel, despite the fact that they did not send money to him.&lt;ref&gt;His letters are in the custody of his daughters in Jerusalem. Copies of them are in the Information Center for Israeli Art. A small notebook with documentation of his studies in Vienna was donated by his daughters to the Jerusalem Print Workshop.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 Penn himself went to Vienna and purchased a press and accompanying equipment.[17]See Yigal Zalmona, The Art of Abel Pann- From Montparnasse to the Land of the Bible, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2003), p. XIV-XV.&lt;/ref&gt; On this press, Penn printed the series of illustrations for the Bible he created. There is however some disagreement with regard to the printing technique of these works. While Penn declared he used lithographic printing, others declared that it was a type of offset, claiming that Jerusalem presses were unsuitable for use as a basis for lithographic printing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Comment on the Beginnings of Offset Printing in Eretz Israel," retrieved from Gideon Ofrat’s Storeroom, http://gideonofrat.wordpress.com/, 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Bezalel, in 1923 [[Ze'ev Raban]] and [[Meir Gur Arie]] established a company called "Industrial Art Studio" (he: בית עבודה לעבודות אינדוסטריאליות), within which "Graphica Press" was created, and which printed posters of a limited size and various prints in the Jugendstil style.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Lilien and the Tradition of the Jugendstil in ‘Bezalel’", in: On the Land: Eretz-Israel Art: Pirkei Avot, pp. 211-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist who worked in the field independently was [[Jacob Eisenberg]], who printed etchings in a workshop he set up in his home in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), pp. 14-15, in particular pp. 208-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, the influence of modernist art was evident among some Bezalel students who continued their studies in Europe or were exposed to contemporary art. These were works that established an artistic opposition to the school that expressed the spirit of the period of the Tower of David. Artists such as [[Nachum Gutman]], [[Israel Paldi]] and others created expressive etchings and, particularly, woodcuts. Among these works is a series of prints called "The God Seekers" (1923; he: מבקשי אלוהים), created by [[Reuven Rubin]], and the series of prints "Jaffa" (1925) by Israel Paldi. Late recognition was given to the series "Gray Tura" (1924; he: טורא אפורה) created by [[Arieh Allweil]] in Europe, which was displayed in Israel only in the 1990s.

==1930–1950: From the Consolidation of the Nation to the consolidation of Self==
[[File:Taamon 1940's.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Miron Sima]], [[Yehuda Wolpert]], [[Isidore Aschheim]], [[Jacob Pines]], [[Yossi Stern]] and [[Mordecai Ardon]] at Cafe Ta'mon, Jerusalem, 1940s]]
In the 1930s, the printing industry began to take on greater importance in the field of Eretz Israeli art. The development of the field was closely linked to the [[Fifth Aliyah]], in which many artists came to Eretz Israel and Jerusalem. These artists, persecuted by their countries of origin in Germany and Austria, sought to continue the spirit of European modernism in general and the heritage of German art movements such as Bauhaus and Expressionism in particular.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 26; also: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art, Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2015), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the art of the time reflected in many ways the construction of Zionist national consciousness. An example of this can be found in stamps issued by the [[Jewish National Fund]], quoting images drawn from artists such as Struck, Lilien, Budko, Steinhardt, and others, who reflected the worldview of the creators of the artistic print, and whose images could at that time easily pass from private to nationalistic art.&lt;ref&gt;See: We Shall not Forget You, Exile (Jerusalem, Jewish National Fund, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the Tel Aviv Museum, in 1934, was accompanied by the dedication of one of the two halls of [[Tel Aviv Museum]] to works in the various print fields.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Etchings Exhibitions," Doar Hayom [Post Office Today], 28 January 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the growing importance of the field can be found in an article published on 20 October 1935, in [[Haaretz]], entitled "The Question of Hebrew Graphics"&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; and the printing of a [[Dictionary]] of Graphic Arts published by [[Mordecai Narkis]] in 1937 by the [[Bialik Institute]] and the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language|Hebrew Language Committee]]. The publication of the dictionary reflected the activities of The [[Bezalel National Museum]] in the 1920s and 1930s and the need to create uniform and clear terms for the various print terms. The dictionary of Narkis, dedicated to Hermann Struck on the occasion of his 60th birthday, was based on the German language, whose terms are "most common among the graphic artists living in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Narkis, Dictionary of Graphic Terms, (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute Publishing, 1937, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of these documents reveals that the term "graphics" included both the artistic print and the graphic design field. This mixture would remain a guiding principle in the school of "New Bezalel School for Arts and Crafts" which was opened in 1935 in Jerusalem. The curriculum of the school aspired to raise the artistic level of design in Israel, while providing practical opportunities for students to earn a living. This practical approach demonstrated the fact that Hebrew industry (and, to some extent, the Hebrew city) also began to serve as another legitimate expression of Zionist activity. Therefore, the school, whose first director was Budko, did not open an art track, but rather a track for practical graphics, which was headed by [[Rudi Deutsch]] (Dayan). The department dealt mainly with lithograph printing, which was the most popular commercial technique at the time.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 72-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob Steinhardt]], who immigrated to Eretz Israel in 1933 opened, in what had been the home of Boris Schatz, a painting and printing studio that was a kind of opposition to the "New Bezalel", which was directed by Yosef Budko. After Budko's death in 1940, Steinhardt joined Bezalel's staff and became director of the school's graphics department. During this period, the importance of classical printing techniques, lithography, woodcutting, and engraving as a commercial printing technique became less important, eclipsed by offset printing. However, these techniques were revived through art classes at the school.

During the 1940s a small community of artists, who engaged in graphic techniques, including artistic prints of various kinds, was established around the "New Bezalel." A comprehensive view of their works shows the strong influence of German culture on everything connected to the cultural tradition (Bildung). In the prints of these artists, such as [[Miron Sima]], [[Isidor Aschheim]], and Jakob Eisenscher, as well as in the works of artists who worked independently of this group, such as [[Arieh Allweil]], [[Paul Conrad Henich]], [[Abraham Goldberg]], [[Leo Roth]] and others, we see an attempt to combine European style with characteristics of the local Eretz Israeli reality and Zionist motifs and themes. This was often accompanied by the adoption of biographical-psychological features, which were largely missing in the works of historic Bezalel's artists.

==1950–1970: The print in the State of Israel==
[[File:Pins - Woodcuts for Heinrich von Kleist’s Michael Kohlhaas 07.jpg|thumb|right|250px|From Woodcuts for Heinrich von Kleist’s Michael Kohlhaas (1953 / 2003} by [[Jacob Pins]]. Woodcut, Printed by the Jerusalem Print Workshop]]
[[File:OFEK T.115.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Man and Bull (1964) BY [[Avraham Ofek]]. Etching and aquatint. Printed by the Jerusalem Print Workshop]]
The establishment of the State of [[Israel]] in 1948 does not constitute a significant historical point in the history of [[Israeli art]], apart from several expressions of nationalism and the development of iconography around the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. However, the opening of [[Mandatory Palestine]] to Jewish immigration led to a large population that began to be educated according to the tradition of the young field of the Israeli print, led in these years by Jacob Steinhardt in the new Bezalel. Many of the youngsters who came to Eretz Israel after the Holocaust either under the auspices of Youth Aliyah, or with their families, such as [[Jacob Pins]], [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Avigdor Arikha]], [[Yehuda Bacon]], [[Moshe Hoffman]], among others, became prominent Israeli artists in the 1950s and 1960s.

Apart from the technique of the woodcut, that could be studied at Bezalel, there were not many places that trained artists in the various print techniques. In [[Ein Hod]] and Jerusalem, [[Rudi Lehman]] taught the art of the wood cut and sculpture. A large group of artists were influenced by his approach to art, that combined animal images in a "primitive" style with a modernist ethos of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel C p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; This group included artists such as [[Shoshana Heimann]], [[Raya Bar Ado]]n and others.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Some training in the technique of lithograph printing was provided by Cohen, who operated the Hebrew University Press in Jerusalem. Most of the artists printed their works in his studio, or with local artists, such as [[David Ben Shaul]], who had specialized in lithograph printing in Paris. Upon his return to Israel in 1963, he brought a lithographic press and printed works for various artists in his studio in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;See: Arik Kilmanik, "Setting Up a Print Workshop", in: The Printer’s Imprint: Twenty Years of the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1994), p. 9; also: "A Conversation with Arik Kilmanik", in: Prints from the Collection of the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 1984), p. 4 (no page numbers).&lt;/ref&gt;

Basing themselves on the local tradition and ethos of Paris as the capital of world art,&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, "They Returned from Paris," Ha'aretz, 17 December 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; many artists continued to travel to pursue art studies in France and Europe, unaware of the change in the world art scene and the development of the United States as an art center.&lt;ref&gt;While in the United States offset printing in the 1950s and 1960s became the main printing technique, the use of this technique in industry began only in the late 1950s. According to Eric Kilmanik, one of the first to engage in non- industrial printing was the daughter or granddaughter of Martin Buber, who set up an offset printing workshop in her home, where Kilmanik created a poster for a folk dance evening at the Bezalel Student Union.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Rothman]], for example, went to study at the [[Académie Julian]] in 1959, and later studied in Paris at the [[Johnny Friedlaender]] engraving workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Angel, "The Engravings of Johnny Friedlander," Maariv, 28 May 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tuvia Beeri]] studied at the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] (1963–1961), and continued his specialization in Friedlaender's engraving workshop. [[Milka Cizik]], however, went to study in [[East Germany]] (1965–1961), where she studied various printing techniques at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]].

The French and German influences led to the adoption of modernist techniques,&lt;ref&gt;Newer techniques, which would come to be identified with postmodernism, began to enter the industry in Israel in the late 1950s. In Israel, for example, a silk printing was used. See: "Institute for the Preparation of Professional Study Materials is Established,"Sha’arim, 24 December 1956; And also: "The World of Printing," Davar, 24 September 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Aryeh Rothman's use of the photographic technique of [[Heliograveur]]&lt;ref&gt;The Heliograveur is a form of photogravure that dates back to the 19th century and is used to reproduce photographs.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "invention" by others of various artistic techniques (in the spirit of late [[Surrealism]]). [[Miron Sima]], for example, added to his woodcuts, such as "The Bride", textures printed from fabrics and chains, which sought to enrich the texture of the print, and to deepen its realism. In addition, the shortage of materials available in Israel led many artists to use other techniques that were available to them, such as [[Linocut]], as a substitute for [[wood cut]]. Even Rudi Lehmann, despite his strong connection to artistic tradition, experimented with the use of new materials. He was one of the first artists to create woodcuts on [[plywood]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel C p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic print field to which these students were exposed upon their return to Israel was very limited. Not only were there no places to print editions of artistic prints, it was also considered a secondary art. In the 1960 album ''Graphic Art in Israel'', [[Eugen Kolb]] wrote that "exhibitions of graphics only are considered (unfairly!) for less important exhibits."&lt;ref&gt;Zvi Zohar and Eugen Kolb, The Israeli Graphic, (Ha-Kibbutz Artzi, Merhavia: Sifriat Poalim, 1960), p. 9. Another textual review of the Israeli print and drawing artists appeared in the book The Art of Israel (Jerusalem: Massada, 1963) by Benjamin Tammuz.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisheva Cohen]], curator of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the [[Bezalel National Museum]] and at the [[Israel Museum]], had to publish the booklet T''he Print: What Is It?'' (1965),&lt;ref&gt;What is a Print? (Jerusalem:The Israel Museum,1965).&lt;/ref&gt; in order to expose the field to visitors to the museum. Therefore, it is no wonder that in the annual general exhibition of the ''Israel Painters and Sculptors Association'' of 1963, for example, only 7 artistic prints were displayed out of 375 works.&lt;ref&gt;Among the exhibitors were Hedwig Grossman (1), Hanna Pfizer (1), Jacob Pins (2), Arieh Rothman (2) and Shoshana Resnick (1). See: General Exhibition of Israeli Artists 1963 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the exhibition ''Tazpit'' 1964, which was perceived as more artistic at the time, Tuvia Beeri was the only artist among more than 30 artists who exhibited prints.&lt;ref&gt;See: Tatspit [Observation Point] (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1964). Tazpit - an acronym for an Israeli painting and sculpture exhibition - was an exhibition organized by a group of artists who wanted to create an exhibition of  young art that was free of institutional pressures. In this exhibition, artists who chose to work in the area of prints in those years, such as Yigal Tumarkin and Uri Lifshitz, participated, but the exhibition chose to present works in a more avant-garde style: On the subject of this exhibition, see: Galia BarOr and Hayuta Bahat: Paintings (Ein Harod: Museum of Art, 2013), pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the same time the print was perceived in various circles as an expression of "good taste." An example of this can be found in the publications of [[Moshe Spitzer]], who commissioned illustrations for publications by Tarshish Publishing House that were done using various print techniques. Among these works are [[Avigdor Luisada]]'s woodcuts for [[Yitzhak Shenhar]]’s ''Between Star and Grass'' (1942) and the engravings of [[Avigdor Arikha]] for ''A Stray Dog'' (1958) and the woodcuts created by [[Jacob Pines]] for the book [[Michael Kohlhaas]] (1953).&lt;ref&gt;However, the latter two were not printed directly from the printing board, but were transferred to print using a photographic method, which was more suitable for larger editions. See: Ada Vardi, Spitzer: Chapters and Tarshish (Tel Aviv: Tarshish Publishing, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the printing workshop of the Artists House Tel Aviv opened under the auspices of the Israel Painters and Sculptors Association and was managed by Tuvia Beeri. The workshop gave artists for the first time a place of work to create works using engraving techniques. At the same time, Beeri opened another workshop at the [[Avni Institute of Art and Design|Avni Institute]].

==1970-1990: Between avant-garde and institutionalization ==

During the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], the printing industry underwent a period of unprecedented development in Israel. A variety of print workshops made it possible for artists to create works using various techniques in this medium. A number of artists began to work in prints and in preparing printing plates for other artists in their studio. Moshe Givati established a printing workshop in Haifa that dealt mainly with screen printing technique.&lt;ref&gt;Between 1970 and 1971, Givati worked at a silk-printing workshop at his studio in Haifa, where he created works in the wake of Yitzhak Danziger's "Nesher Quarry" project. In addition, he printed works for artists such as Michael Gross, Shmuel Katz, Zvi Mairovitch and others. From 1974 to 1982 he lived in New York, where he made a living by working in real estate, alongside his work as an artist in a workshop he opened with Arieh Moscovitch.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Ben Shaul|David (Dedi) Ben Shaul]], printed using lithograph technique, and [[Avishai Eyal]], who worked primarily in the medium of etching, set up a separate studio in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Eyal was mainly engaged in experimental printing and in printing prints in small editions. See: Sanford Sivits Shaiman, Prints from the Avishay Ayal Etching workshop 1972-1975 (Haifa: University of Haifa, 1990); Gideon Ophrat, 100 Years of Print Art in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the establishment of the large workshops made the independent activities of these artists somewhat redundant.  Itche Mambush founded another workshop in the 1960s in Ein Hod, directed by [[Ora Lahav Shaltiel]]. In 1972 [[Jacob Harel]] founded a commercial print workshop that would become Har-el Printers and Publishers. In 1974 the [[Jerusalem Print Workshop]] was established in Jerusalem. The workshop was established as a public benefit company and was initially associated with the [[Jerusalem Artists Association]]. In 1975, the [[Israel Museum]] set up another public print workshop - the Burston Graphics Center - in [[Hutzot Hayotzer]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Meira Perry-Lehman, Curator, Israeli prints from the Burston Gallery, (Jerusalem:The Israel Museum, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several other printing houses published in the field of  artistic printing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Rachel Angel, "The Register - in Seventy Languages," Maariv, 16 January 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the rising popularity of the medium could be found in the activity of the Israeli Graphotek, which in [[1978]] had not yet opened its doors to the public, but had already collected about 1300 works by 105 different artists.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Angel, "The Israeli Graphotec," Maariv, 2 March 1979&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[1990s]], Graphotek had already collected about 4,000 works by about 200 artists and was accessible to the public in six centers around the country.&lt;ref&gt;See: The Graphotec Notebook, Alima File (Jerusalem: The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1975 list, [[Adam Baruch]] described the growing popularity of artistic prints during those years in Israel and around the world. Baruch distinguished between the reproduction of old works to the medium of the print, and works of art that made critical use of the various techniques of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;See: Adam Baruch, "The Israeli Print (Cut)" Musag [Concept], Issue No. 5, (October 1975), p 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, attempts were made to mount systematic displays of prints. In 1978, the exhibition "30 Israeli Artists: Artistic Prints" was presented at [[Tel Aviv University]],&lt;ref&gt;See: Talia Rappaport, "50 years of prints," Davar, 23 June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1980s, attempts were made to establish a triennale for graphics at the Haifa Museum of Art. 

Many artists adopted the medium as another technique in their work, a technique of a more commercial nature. Usually prints were produced in editions of between 30 to 150 copies.&lt;ref&gt;The number of copies of the edition is dependent on technique. Silk prints or lithographs were printed in large editions. In some cases, about 250-300 copies were printed.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the works were intended for the international market, especially for the United States. In addition, various albums were also produced that combined 5-10 works by a single artist&lt;ref&gt;Igael Tumarkin , for example, who has created over 300 different prints, published several bound albums, including "Paraphrases on the Polyhedron" (1972), " Self Portrait 1975 " (1975) and " Battle of the Blind Men and the Sow- Heinrich von Kleist "(1979).&lt;/ref&gt; or by a group of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Print Workshop , for example, printed in 1977 an album entitled "Jerusalem", with the prints of five artists ( Michael Gross ,Liliane Klapisch , Moshe Kupferman , Ivan Schwebel and Menashe Kadishman ), in an edition of 200 copies.&lt;/ref&gt; This commercial development led several galleries to continuously produce series of prints for artists, which were printed in the various workshops. The major ones included the Bineth Gallery in Tel Aviv&lt;ref&gt;Produced prints for artists such as Lillian Clapisch , Fima and others&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Engel Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;Produced prints for artists such as Moshe Castel and Anna Ticho and others&lt;/ref&gt; in Jerusalem. The popularity of the print also led to the printing of signed and numbered posters by artists or the production of prints based on the works of deceased artists, by inscribing their signature on the plate.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gad Ullman, "Gray Market Prints: Original Prints, Reproduction, and Everything in-between", Studio, Art Magazine, Issue No. 12 (June 1990), pp 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Unlike most of the artists who worked in the field, in the 1970s and 1980s, a group of artists continued their avant-garde activities concerning everything related to the examination of the artistic object, including in the medium of print. Artists such as [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Benni Efrat]], and others emphasized the plastic nature of the paper by using various artistic means such as repetition and seriality, or by emphasizing the print plate as an object, or by folding and distorting the paper. [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], for example, made use of plates printed on entire sheets of paper in [[1980]], leaving him with negatives. In the works of [[Menashe Kadishman]] (1983), the artist reconstructed his sculptural activities and converted them into the print media, creating a confrontation between nature and culture.&lt;ref&gt;See: Mordechai Omer, Tikkun (Tel Aviv: The Genia Schreiber University Art Gallery,1998), p 182. Also: Gideon Ofrat, 100 Years of Printmaking in Israel , Jerusalem Print Workshop, Jerusalem, 2015 , pp. 187-186.&lt;/ref&gt; A unique preoccupation with the surface of the print is also found in the works of [[Joyce Schmidt]], who created prints using techniques of stress. Her paper-making business led her to make use of the paper produced by the business. 

From a technical point of view, the flourishing of lithography technique particularly stands out during this period. The main development of the technique in Israel during this period can be credited to the work of the Burston Graphic Center, which in its first year trained artists in this technique. [[Alima]], who studied this technique at Burston, imported this printing technique to the print workshop at the Artists House in Tel Aviv and the College of Visual Arts in Beersheva. In her independent work she combined the technique of lithography with other techniques such as screen printing and etching. To a great extent, this technique died out in the early 1990s, with the closure of the Burston Center. 

In contrast to the lithography and etching techniques, the screen printing technique (or "silkscreen printing" as it was called at the time) was perceived as a secondary technique, mainly because it lacked any artistic tradition. Art in Israel began using industrial techniques in the late 1950s, but until the 1970s it was not widely used in art. As early as 1949, [[Ellie Gross]] (Yaari) lectured on serigraphy (screen printing) in the exhibition "What is Graphics?" In the Jerusalem Artists House. However, an early example of artistic use of the medium can be found in the book The Jerusalem Hills and all the Anguish (1967) by Malachi Beit-Arie published by Tarshish. The book was accompanied by screen prints created by Myriam Bat-Yosef and printed in a commercial printing press - "Herut Herut Printing Press".&lt;ref&gt;Ada Vardi, Spitzer: Chapters and Tarshish (Tel Aviv: Tarshish Publishing, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant development in the use of art technique can be attributed to [[Zvi Tolkovsky]], who returned from art studies in the United States and learned the technique there. At the end of the sixties,Tolkovsky returned to Israel and, in 1969-1969, a workshop for printing and screen printing at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that despite the influence of American art, the photograph was not perceived at the time as an independent artistic object, but mainly used as documentation of artistic activity.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkovsky also taught at the Artists House in Tel Aviv, where screen printing was used as part of a variety of techniques such as calligraphy. An expression of the ambivalent status of the screen print can be found in the work of [[Moshe Gershuni]], who was commissioned to create a series of print works at the Jerusalem Print Workshop in 1984.  Gershuni testified that he had a distaste for the print medium, "especially for screen printing, which in my opinion represented the most extreme form of graphic art."&lt;ref&gt;Larry Abramson,, "A Conversation with Gershuni, " in Gershuni in the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 1984, unnumbered pages.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his works in this technique, including "Avinu Malkeinu" [Our Father,Our King] (1984), "Justice and Charity" (1984), and others, enjoyed both artistic and commercial success. 

However, the bulk of the prints were done using various etching techniques. These works were figurative in character and expressive in language. The works of artists such as [[Raanan Levy]], [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Tamara Rickman]], David Ben-Shaul, were drawings, created using traditional techniques as etching and aquatint. In addition, there were also artists who incorporated new techniques in their works, such as [[Uri Lifschitz]], who combined in works such as "Mr. Rabinovich" (1968), etching with photographic etching. [[Yigal Tumarkin]], for example, in the print "Pieta, Pierre Paolo Pasolini," (1979). 

combined several print plates made using the technique of photographic etching, on which he combined drawing and dry etching.  The plates were combined in a collage, cut and twisted to give them an expressive character and to create negative spaces in the composition. Artists such as [[Ivan Schwebel]], [[Asaph Ben Menachem]] and [[Avraham Eilat]], used this expressionism as an expression of symbolism or metaphysical content. In the famous series "[[Kaddish]]" (1984), for example, Moshe Gershuni created a tangle of symbols and images that expressed a complex position toward Judaism and the Jewish God.  
===1990-2010===

In the early 1990s, "new media art" began to develop, using visual images created by "technical reproduction"&lt;ref&gt;Digital media accompanied by a theoretical study which adopted the essay of Walter Benjamin "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction " (1936-1938) as a fundamental theoretical text.&lt;/ref&gt; without the need to use a manual process of creating print plates and manual printing. The use of computer graphics and digital media, which developed during this period, completely replaced manual design. The use of these methods also led to the perception of the art print industry as archaic. This led to the closure and reduction of many print workshops during the 2000s. Among other things, the workshops of the Faculty of Arts - Hamidrasha at Beit Berl College were closed, and Bezalel's work was greatly reduced. 

The activities of professional workshops were also reduced, and they stopped producing works in large editions and went on to print works in editions of only 12-18 copies. The Burston Center workshop was closed in 1990 after management problems, while the Printmaking Workshop of Tel Aviv Artists House converted its services from printing whole editions to making available the possibility of independent activity and instruction in the use of various techniques. Most of institutionalized artistic activity took place at the Gottesman Etching Center, which was established at Kibbutz Cabri in 1993, at the Har-El Printers &amp; Publishers print workshop in Tel Aviv-Jaffa and at the Jerusalem Print Workshop, which experienced a period of prosperity as a result of the workshop's activity, when it moved to a new business and artistic model in the mid-1980s. 

The shrinking of the field led most of the major artists who worked in the print industry, such as [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Larry Abramson]], [[Sharon Poliakine]], [[Asaf Ben Zvi]], [[Hila Lulu Lin]] and others, to perceive the medium as secondary in their work. However, artists such as [[Orit Hofshi]], Asaph Ben-Menahem and others have made it the primary medium in their work. 

An area that began to develop during this period is the production of "artists’ books" - books that combined text - mostly poems - with prints created specifically for this book. Such books replaced folders of prints that artists had previously published as a portfolio. The books were printed in limited editions and numbered in etching or screen printing techniques. As early as the 1980s, the Jerusalem Print Workshop began printing such books. Among the best known are Thirteen Etchings for Poems by [[Haim Nachman Bialik]] (1987) by Moshe Gershuni, and in 1989 the workshop created a series of 9 artists’ books in an edition of 40 copies each.&lt;ref&gt;See: Etchings of Songs: Nine Files of Etchings and Poems , on the Jerusalem Print Workshop site.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of producing such books, most of the works were printed for renowned artists.&lt;ref&gt;The works of the artist include Kaddish (Jaffa: Har-El Printers and Publishers, 1997) by Moshe Gershuni , Death Fugue by Paul Celan (Jaffa: Har-El Printers and Publishers, 1995)) by Yigal Tumarkin (and other works he created in this workshop), the folder of prints of Ofer Lellouche from the Gottesman Etching Center, and "TheTrue Rose of Jericho" (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2003) by Larry Abramson .&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Israeli museums continued to purchase prints, exhibitions in major galleries in Tel Aviv-Jaffa or museum exhibitions of Israeli prints were unusual, and even the inclusion of prints in group thematic exhibitions was very small. In 1994, the Israel Museum mounted the exhibition,The Printer's Imprint: Twenty Years with the Jerusalem Print Workshop, Jerusalem, marking the 20th anniversary of the Jerusalem Print Workshop. Among the other museum exhibitions are Portfolios from the Gottesman Etching Center, Kibbutz Cabri (2006) at the Israel Museum, Etchings (2006) at the Negev Museum of Art and Print Time, Works from the Jerusalem Workshop and the Gottesman Center (2013) at the Open Museum, Tefen.

'''Jack Epps Jr.''' (born 1949) is an American [[screenwriter]], [[author]] and [[educator]], known chiefly for such popular 1980s films as ''[[Top Gun]]'',&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Epps Jr.|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258390/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' and ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'', which he wrote with longtime partner [[Jim Cash]]. Epps Jr. graduated from the College of Arts and Letters at [[Michigan State University]], and has since gone on to teach at [[the University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="Cinema USC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Epps Jr.|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/directories/profile.cfm?id=6498&amp;first=&amp;last=&amp;title=&amp;did=67&amp;referer=%..|publisher=Cinema USC|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Epps Jr. came to California to become a director, but he did not have the money or know-how to do so. He decided to first write a script and to hope that this would lead to directing. Partnering with Anderson House, they sold a script to ''Hawaii Five-O''. He continued to work with House for a few years, before partnering with Jim Cash.&lt;ref name="Old School Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to the 80s: Interview with Jack Epps Jr. screenwriter of Top Gun &amp; more - Kickin' it Old School|url=http://oldschool.tblog.com/post/1970118087|publisher=Old School Blog|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Top Gun'' and later successes===
After completing seven unproduced screenplays together, Epps Jr. and Cash produced ''Top Gun''. This film went on to become the number-one worldwide box office hit in 1986. After this, they quickly wrote other screenplays that were produced, including ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' and ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of my Success]]''. Epps co-authored over 25 screenplays and eight motion pictures that he produced well into the following decade, including ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Turner &amp; Hooch]]'' and ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]''.&lt;ref name="Angels in the Sky Movie"&gt;{{cite web|title=JACK EPPS JR.|url=http://angelsintheskythemovie.com/the-talent-team/8-bios/14-jack-epps-jr|publisher=Angels in the Sky Movie|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for some of the most successful actors in the industry including [[Tom Cruise]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Warren Beatty]] and others.

==Teaching==
Epps Jr. is an Associate Professor and Chair of the Writing for Screen and Television Division in the School of Cinematic Arts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/author/jack-epps-jr&lt;/ref&gt; Using techniques he had developed over his career and applied to classes, he authored a screenwriting manual, ''Screenwriting is Rewriting: The Art and Craft of Professional Revision'', in 2016.

==Awards and honors==
Epps Jr. was awarded on honorary doctorate of fine arts by Michigan State University at their 2009 commencement. He is also the recipient of the Michigan State University Spartans in Hollywood Award.&lt;ref name="Angels in the Sky Movie" /&gt; He is part of the Writer's Guild of America where he has been a member for three decades and he is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

'''JocJonJosch''' is an Anglo-Swiss visual arts collective based in London, Zürich and the [[Valais]] canton of Switzerland. The three members of JocJonJosch are Joschi Herczeg (b. 25/12/1975, Switzerland), Jonathan Brantschen (b. 30/09/1981, Switzerland) and Jocelyn Marchington (b. 29/06/1976, England). 

==Work==
Their work finds its form in performance, sculpture, photography, video, drawing, painting and books, with a focus on issues of identity, specifically the ambiguity between the individual and the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/08/entertainment_enl_1268735367/html/1.stm |title=Three artists stitch themselves together |last=BBC news |website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sculptureshock.rbs.org.uk/artists/jocjonjosch|title=Sculpture Shock|website=sculptureshock.rbs.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsao has been publicly recognized by the World Congress of Chinese Collectors as the leading American collector of Chinese painting of his generation.&lt;ref name="Masters 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Junbo 2008" /&gt; Over his almost 50-year professional career based in the San Francisco Bay Area, he built and helped to build several important collections of [[Chinese painting]], and was friends with significant figures in the Chinese art world. He authored a number of scholarly works on Chinese painting and [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], and collections he assembled have been the subjects of research and exhibition projects by major museums, art academies, and publishing houses.b babe

==Biography==
Tsao was born in [[Tianjin]], [[China]], in 1929&lt;ref group=note&gt;United States Social Security Administration records indicate that he was born in 1923, while Tsao asserts he was born in 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; to a prominent family that became aligned with China's Nationalist Party, the [[Kuomintang]].&lt;ref name="keaig 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt; His father was named Cao Wenming.&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt; In his early years, due to the [[Chinese Civil War]] he migrated to Western China, then returned to the North, and finally in 1949, emigrated to [[Taiwan|Taiwan (Republic of China)]] to escape the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]].&lt;ref name="keaig 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt; In the 1950s, he managed his family's collection of Chinese paintings and studied Chinese painting connoisseurship under noted art authority Li Lin-ts'an, senior curator at the [[National Palace Museum|National Palace Museum (Taipei)]].&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt; He attended law school in Taipei and became a lawyer, then a judge.&lt;ref name="keaig 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt; In 1963 he traveled to the [[United States]] and settled in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt; Soon thereafter he gave up the practice of law; he became a professional art dealer in the mid-1960s, establishing the art gallery Fine East Fine Arts in [[San Francisco]] in 1974, and dedicating the remainder of his life to the preservation and promotion of traditional Chinese art.&lt;ref name="keaig 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="findart 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chinanews 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sina 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sssc 2012" /&gt;

==Projects and Collections==
Although his family's collection of Chinese paintings included earlier works, Tsao, while living in Taipei in the 1950s, began to re-focus the collection on more recent artists, in particular those from the "Modern Period" (1840 – 1966) such as [[Qi Baishi]].&lt;ref name="keaig 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chinanews 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sina 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="artxun 2011" /&gt; He ultimately built a balanced and encyclopedic collection of Modern Chinese painting.&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt; He also assembled a comprehensive collection of seventeenth century paintings, a major collection of paintings by the twentieth century landscape master [[Huang Binhong]], and a collection of [[Chinese seal]]s that ranges from the [[Warring States period]] (475 – 221 BCE) through the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Qingli 2010 p10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ucmerced" /&gt; Tsao has been recognized as a guiding force behind several important private collections such as The Richard Fabian Collection&lt;ref name="Little 2007 p19" /&gt; and The Michael Gallis Collection. Many works from Tsao's collection are either parts of the permanent collection or promised gifts to museums including [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City)]], the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]], and the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this sentence|date=August 2014}}

==Friendships and recognition==
Tsao was a younger contemporary and friend of the collector [[C. C. Wang]],&lt;ref name="findart 2008" /&gt; who collected classical paintings, and thus, was competitive with Tsao only around collecting paintings of the seventeenth century, where their interests overlapped. Tsao also built lasting friendships with fellow art appreciators who lived in or travelled to the San Francisco Bay Area, including the artist [[Zhang Daqian]],&lt;ref name="findart 2008" /&gt; professors of Chinese art history [[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Michael Sullivan]] and Chu-tsing Li (pinyin: Li Zhujin) and their students Wan Qingli, Cai Xingyi, Britta Erickson and James Soong, scholar Fred Fang-yu Wang and the collectors Richard Fabian, Michael Gallis and Michael Shih. As China re-opened in the 1980s and 1990s, Tsao traveled there frequently, building friendships with the [[Shanghai Museum]] curators [[Xie Zhiliu]] and Zheng Wei, artists [[Li Keran]], Zhu Jichan, [[Huang Junbi]], Lou Shibai, dealer/collectors Robert Zhang (pinyin: Zhang Zongxian)&lt;ref name="keaig 2014" /&gt; and others. In 2008, Tsao was selected to represent all American collectors and give a keynote address at the first annual World Congress of Chinese Collectors in Shanghai.&lt;ref name="Masters 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Junbo 2008" /&gt; He was recognized by the organizers for collecting art not for investment, but rather, to elevate the spirit and nurture refinement.&lt;ref name="Masters 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Junbo 2008" /&gt;

After his passing in 2011, Mr. Tsao's heirs established the Mozhai Foundation (in reference to Tsao's studio name), a charitable family foundation dedicated to supporting research and educational programming in the field of traditional Chinese art and culture.&lt;ref name="mozhai"&gt;[http://mozhaifoundation.org/about/ About the Mozhai Foundation], The Mozhai Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LTTR''' is a [[feminist]] [[genderqueer]] collective founded in 2001 with a flexible project oriented practice. LTTR produces a performance series, events, screenings and collaborations. It also released five issues of an annual independent art journal between 2002 and 2006. The collective is rooted in community and collaborative processes without hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IVH7P1JiOhEC&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;ots=usATaM9Vs4&amp;dq=LTTR%20art&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=LTTR&amp;f=false Rethinking Contemporary Art and Multicultural Education By New Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== About ==
The editorial debates of LTTR and decision making surrounding the printed journal were based on the idea of making a significant contribution to [[contemporary]] [[feminist]] [[genderqueer]] concerns. It was edited by consensus in long-process editorial sessions. Each issue was initiated with an international open call and through interpersonal relationships from within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lttr.org/journal The Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Each submission was considered independently and in regards to the working themes of the journal. Each issue included handmade artists’ multiples and was published in a print run of 1000 copies. According to Holland Cotter of ''The New York Times'', "The idea of moving art out of the control of the professional art world underlies the thinking of many of the individuals and collectives associated with LTTR."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/arts/art-in-review-explosion-lttr.html New York Times Article&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
LTTR was founded in 2001 by [[Ginger Brooks Takahashi]], [[K8 Hardy]] and [[Emily Roysdon]]. [[Ulrike Müller (artist)|Ulrike Müller]] joined LTTR in 2005 and Lanka Tattersal was an editor and collaborator for issue 4. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lttr.org/about-lttr LTTR homepage] &lt;/ref&gt;

LTTR is a shifting acronym; it started in 2001 as “Lesbians to the Rescue" and has since stood for phrases ranging from “Lacan Teaches to Repeat” to “Let’s Take the Role.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpractical.com/feature/repetition-and-difference-lttr/ Article in Art Practical ]&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural issue of the collective's art journal was entitled “Lesbians to the Rescue,” followed by “Listen Translate Translate Record,” “Practice More Failure,” “Do You Wish to Direct Me?,” and finally "Positively Nasty." LTTR is dedicated to highlighting the work of radical communities whose goals are sustainable change, queer pleasure, and critical feminist productivity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WTvfzdpTyuUC&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;ots=Ro6OkraScm&amp;dq=LTTR%20art&amp;pg=PT35#v=onepage&amp;q=LTTR%20art&amp;f=false Modern Women: Women Artists at the Museum of Modern Art edited by Cornelia H.

Mălâncrav is a village in Laslea commune. An asphalt road of 13&amp;nbsp;km leads to the village. In the village there is a small community of [[Transylvanian Saxon]]s.

Here some of the most significant [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[mural]]s in [[Transylvania]] aside from those at [[Ghelința]] in [[Covasna County]] are found.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Saxon [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church has early 14th-century Gothic murals in the [[apse]]. 15th-century ones are found in the [[nave]] and a 15th-century late Gothic [[altar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In later centuries the Apafi family (Hungarian nobles in Transylvania) buried their dead in the church since they had overlordship in the village. Although the sarcophagi were removed (one of [[Mihaly Apafi]] is now in [[Budapest]]'s [[Hungarian National Museum]]). The locality was not part of the autonomous Saxon territory Although until the 1970s when it was populated by Germans.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Prince of Wales and sustainable tourism==
In 2006, The [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] bought and restored two 18th century [[Transylvanian Saxon]] houses in the villages of Mălâncrav and [[Viscri]] to help protect the unique way of life that has existed for hundreds of years and promote [[sustainable tourism]].

The buildings have been sensitively restored and converted into guesthouses for tourists. They remain in keeping with the surrounding architecture and feature a number of Transylvanian antiques but with modern facilities where possible.

The renovation of these buildings has helped provide a sustainable future for the people of rural Transylvania while also enabling residents to maintain their traditional way of life.

Margit Tevan was a 20th century Hungarian goldsmith. She was born on 18 January 1901 into a Jewish family and died on 3 November 1978. 

== Studies and training ==
Margit Tevan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margit Tevan |url=http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail_print&amp;entity_id=8115 |website=http://archive.wikiwix.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302143305/http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail_print&amp;entity_id=8115 |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was born on 18 January 1901 in Békéscsaba (Hungary) into a Jewish family whose father was running an important editing house. She started her artistic studies at the Academy of Applied Arts in Budapest and after one year specialized with some of the most famous goldsmiths of the time: Richard Zutt and Ferenc (Francis) Kiss. Not being interested in making jewels, she later joined Arpád Vértes' workshop which was better known under the name of "Stúdió" (1927-1928). In 1927 she married the chemical engineer Miklós Engel and moved to Budapest. By creating boxes and plates, she innovates the goldsmith tradition which at the time was more interested in making vases and bowls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenyeres|first1=Ágnes|title=Magyar életrajzi lexikon II.

== Influence and creations ==
The influence of the Bauhaus school is evident in her early work. She then continued her artistic development towards an archaic romanticism, influenced by Romanesque art and the simplicity of the motifs which she used, especially in her friezes which decorate her boxes and plates. Her many objects which she produced during her whole life are mainly hand hammered silver-leafed copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEVAN_catalog_1981|url=https://get.google.com/albumarchive/100615662422121274676/album/AF1QipMpZV7sY9HDYWoDINEhwHV8rlVktxxyujbNEFK2?source=pwa&amp;authKey=CP3-0biL8sz9mQE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One can find traces of references to both Jewish and Christian culture in her work. She continued her production during Communism where she kept her poetic register with smaller works that are sometimes offered as presents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish Budapest. Monuments, Rites, History|date=1999|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9639116378|location=Budapest|page=179|last1=Frojimovics|first1=Kinga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War and persecution ==
Between 1944 and 1945, she was forced to live in the international ghetto of Budapest and obtained a safe conduct passport from the Swedish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tevan|first1=Margit|title=Minden ház ellenségesen áll - Tevan Margit 1944/45-ös feljegyzése|date=2015|publisher=Tevan Alapítvány|location=Budapest|isbn=9789638972668|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acknowledgements and prizes ==
She participated in numerous exhibitions and received a Diplôme d'honneur for her work during the Paris World Exhibition in 1937. She also obtained a similar diploma during the 1939 New York World Fair. Finally, she won the silver medal at the VII Milan Triennale of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/02500/02510/00046/pdf/EPA02510_corvina_1940_05_340-348.pdf|title=L'Ungheria alla VII Triennale di Milano|website=epa.oszk.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triennale di Milano|url=http://old.triennale.org/it/archivio-fotografico/esposizione/23381-viitrn?filter_catphoto=23430&amp;cat=23430&amp;filter_type=image|website=http://old.triennale.org/it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, she won the Munkácsy Prize, the highest artistic recognition in Hungary, as well as numerous other prizes between 1971 and 1976. She died in Budapest on 3 November 1978.

== Descendants ==
Her son, Engel Tevan István, was born in 1936, worked as a well-known book illustrator, and passed away in 1996.

The '''Monster of Ravenna''' was an apocryphal late [[Renaissance]]-era [[monstrous birth]] whose appearance in early 1512 near the city of [[Ravenna]] was widely reported in contemporary European pamphlets and diaries. Images of its grotesque features were symbolically interpreted by opponents of both the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]], although a more common explanation at the time held that the beast was an [[omen]] regarding the outcome of the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]]. Modern medical consensus identifies the monster as a child with some variety of severe [[congenital disorder]].

== History ==
The earliest account of the monster's existence comes from the diarist Sebastiano di Branca Tedallini, who recorded on March 8 that news of a strange infant's birth had reached [[Pope Julius II]] in Rome. According to his account, the child was said to have been born of a nun and a friar, and was marked by a horned head, the letters YXV on its chest, and with one leg hairy and cloven-hoofed while the other leg's midsection grew a human eye.{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|p=35}} On March 11, the apothecary [[Luca Landucci]] documented how word of this incident had reached Florence; having apparently received a drawing of the monster, Landucci described it to possess features such as a single horn, the wings of a bat, hermaphroditic genitalia, an eye on its right knee and a clawed left foot like an eagle's.{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|p=36}}{{sfn|Daston|Park|1998|p=177}}{{sfn|Leroi|2003|loc=intro}} The tale was subsequently immortalized by further chroniclers of the era, including Johannes Multivallis, Jacques Rueff, [[Conrad Lycosthenes]], [[Caspar Hedio]], [[Pierre Boaistuau]], [[Fortunio Liceti]], and [[Ambroise Paré]].{{sfn|Huet|2004|p=131}} Landucci's physical description appears to have been considered authoritative, as later chroniclers, particularly Boaistuau, largely reproduced his account word-for-word.{{sfn|Hampton|2004|pp=179-180}}{{efn|Boaistuau's account includes the description of the eye on the knee and the clawed foot, but he has combined the two into a single leg. The text is otherwise nearly identical to Landucci.}}

It was common practice for malformed infants, especially those with a low chance of survival in medieval Europe, to be abandoned and left to die by starvation;{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|p=33}} this was swiftly carried out in Ravenna on the order of the Pope.{{sfn|Leroi|2003|loc=intro}}

Even after its reported death, however, news of the monstrous birth continued to sweep Europe, often in stories greatly embellished by the storyteller. In a popular poem given by Marcello Palonio relatively soon after its birth, the monster is oddly implied to possess two heads.{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|pp=40-41}}{{sfn|Ashton|1890|pp=173-174}} With more time, the appearance of the Ravenna monster rapidly evolved, changing its number of legs from two to one and eventually syncretizing with the morality figure of [[:de:Frau Welt|Frau Welt]].{{sfn|Leroi|2003|loc=intro}}{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|pp=37-44}} [[Giovanni Battista Bissoni]] was contracted to design the illustrations to the second edition of Fortunio Liceti's account, with the Monster of Ravenna centrally displayed on the frontispiece; by this point, the creature was well-established as possessing a single clawed foot.{{sfn|Cheng|2012|p=212}}

A major element in the popularity of the "monster" was its appearance alongside similar signs and portents; the occurrence of other [[preternatural]] events was a key factor in convincing Landucci  that this was not an isolated incident.{{sfn|Daston|Park|1998|p=178}} In 1514, with the example of Ravenna still fresh in public memory, a so-called "Monster of [[Bologna]]" was reported. This child was born with two faces, three eyes, and a woman's vulva on its forehead. It lived long enough to be baptized as "Maria" but died four days later.{{sfn|Bowd|1999|p=41}}{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|pp=52-53}}

== Interpretation == 
{{Quote|text=The horn [indicates] pride; the wings, mental frivolity and inconstancy; the lack of arms, a lack of good works; the raptor's foot, rapaciousness, usury, and every sort of avarice; the eye on the knee, a mental orientation solely toward earthly things; the double sex, sodomy. And on account of these vices, Italy is shattered by the sufferings of war, which the [[Louis XII of France|King of France]] has not accomplished by his own power, but only as the scourge of God. |author=Johannes Multivallis |source=Eusebii Caesariensis episcopi chronicon, 1512{{sfn|Daston|Park|1998|pp=181-182}} }}

Contemporary accounts sought to explain the "monster" and its unusual features in religious terms. The version proposed by Multivallis was fairly typical of the age; the recent [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]] was a common theme in most texts produced very soon after the initial incident, being mentioned in both Landucci's report{{sfn|Daston|Park|1998|p=177}} and that of Ambroise Paré, who tersely listed the Monster of Ravenna as an "Example of the Wrath of God" upon Pope Julius II and the people of Italy.{{sfn|Paré|1982|p=6}} Others focused on the specific vice of sexual immorality, as [[Pietro Martire d'Anghiera]] recorded the belief that the monster was born the illegitimate child of a married mother.{{sfn|Niccoli|1990|p=47}}

During the Protestant Reformation, monstrous births and similar incidents were cited with political aim, most notably in the example of [[Monstrous birth#Luther's mooncalf|Luther's mooncalf]]. In the fifth volume of the anti-Lutheran ''Centvrien'' by Johann Nas, [[Martin Luther]] is himself identified with the Monster of Ravenna.{{sfn|Spinks|2009|p=343}} On the Protestant side, early woodcuts were produced which depicted the child as having been born in a Florentine convent, the offspring of a nun and the Pope himself. This was followed by the more established narrative that the birth presaged the invasion of Louis XII as an agent of God's displeasure with Catholic power.{{sfn|Schutte|1985|p=92}}

The Monster of Ravenna is referenced briefly in [[Mateo Alemán]]'s novel ''[[Guzmán de Alfarache]]'', which was published at the turn of the seventeenth century. Following protracted criticism of his own father for being sexually and religiously immoral, Guzmán invokes the grotesque imagery of the Monster as a being which transcends the societal norms of sex.{{sfn|Cruz|2010|pp=11-12}}

== Speculation on origins ==
Analyzing the later account of Ambroise Paré, Walton et al. proposed a tentative diagnosis of [[sirenomelia]] with related factors;{{efn|This is based on Paré's assertion that the child had only one leg, per the later accounts of the Monster's appearance.}} additionally, they highlight possible indicators of [[hydrocephalus]] causing a bulging [[anterior fontanelle]], radial [[hypoplasia]] with [[pterygium]] to give the impression of wings, and [[caudal regression]], the latter of which may have been caused by [[diabetes mellitus]] in the mother.{{sfn|Walton|Fineman|Walton|1993|p=12}} The "horned" forehead can alternatively be viewed as an instance of [[cyclopia]].{{sfn|Martínez‐Frías|1994|p=362}} Finally, it is plausible that some of the more striking features were caused by [[Roberts syndrome]], which could have affected the development of the limbs and genitals.{{sfn|Leroi|2003|loc=intro}}

'''''My Many Colored Days''''' is a children's book written by [[Dr. Seuss]].

Accompanying a manuscript Dr. Seuss wrote in 1973 was a letter outlining his hopes of finding "a great color artist who will not be dominated by me."&lt;ref name=ville&gt;http://www.seussville.com/books/book_detail.php?isbn=9780679875970&lt;/ref&gt; The late Dr. Seuss saw his original text about feelings and moods as part of the "first book ever to be based on beautiful illustrations and sensational color."&lt;ref name=ville /&gt;

It was published posthumously in 1996 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], after Seuss's death in 1991. It features paintings by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher. A rhyming story, it describes each day in terms of a particular color which is in turn associated with a specific [[emotion]]. Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children."&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noether_theorem_1st_page.png|thumb| First page of [[Emmy Noether]]'s article "Invariante Variationsprobleme" (1918), where she proved her theorem.]]
'''Noether's''' ('''first''')&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Noether's second theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; '''theorem''' states that every [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of the [[action (physics)|action]] of a physical system has a corresponding [[conservation law]]. The theorem was proven by mathematician [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and published in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Noether E | year = 1918 | title = Invariante Variationsprobleme | journal = Nachr. D. König. Gesellsch. D. Wiss. Zu Göttingen, Math-phys. Klasse | volume = 1918 | pages = 235–257 |url= https://eudml.org/doc/59024}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a special case was proven by [[Eugène_Cosserat|E. Cosserat]] &amp; [[François_Cosserat|F. Cosserat]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Cosserat E., Cosserat F. |year = 1909 | title = Théorie des corps déformables | publisher = Hermann | place = Paris | url = http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=06420001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of a physical system is the [[time integral|integral over time]] of a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function (which may or may not be an [[integral over space]] of a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density function]]), from which the system's behavior can be determined by the [[principle of least action]]. This theorem only applies to continuous symmetries over [[physical space]].

Noether's theorem is used in [[theoretical physics]] and the [[calculus of variations]]. A generalization of the formulations on [[constants of motion]] in Lagrangian and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (developed in 1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian alone (e.g. systems with a [[Lagrangian_mechanics#Extensions_to_include_non-conservative_forces|Rayleigh dissipation function]]). In particular, [[dissipative]] systems with [[Continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] need not have a corresponding conservation law.

==Basic illustrations and background==
{{unreferenced-section|date=June 2016}}
As an illustration, if a physical system behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space, its [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] is symmetric under continuous rotations: from this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates that the [[angular momentum]] of the system be conserved, as a consequence of its laws of motion. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. It is the laws of its motion that are symmetric.

As another example, if a physical process exhibits  the same outcomes regardless of place or time, then its Lagrangian is symmetric under continuous translations in space and time respectively: by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the [[conservation law]]s of [[momentum|linear momentum]] and [[energy]] within this system, respectively.

As a final example, if the behavior of a physical system does not change upon spatial or temporal reflection, then its Lagrangian has reflection symmetry and time reversal symmetry respectively: Noether's theorem says that these symmetries result in the conservation laws of [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and [[entropy]],{{cn|date=June 2018}} {{discuss|Need to resolve the case when we are discussing entropy of a closed system, which always increases.}} respectively.

Noether's theorem is important, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also as a practical calculational tool. It allows investigators to determine the conserved quantities (invariants) from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it allows researchers to consider whole classes of hypothetical Lagrangians with given invariants, to describe a physical system. As an illustration, suppose that a physical theory is proposed which conserves a quantity ''X''. A researcher can calculate the types of Lagrangians that conserve ''X'' through a continuous symmetry.  Due to Noether's theorem, the properties of these Lagrangians provide further criteria to understand the implications and judge the fitness of the new theory.

There are numerous versions of Noether's theorem, with varying degrees of generality. The original version applied only to [[ordinary differential equation]]s (used for describing distinct particles) and not [[partial differential equation]]s (used for describing fields). The original versions also assume that the Lagrangian depends only upon the first derivative, while later versions generalize the theorem to Lagrangians depending on the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative.{{Disputed inline|False_claim_on_limited_applicability_of_original_version|date=June 2014}}  There are natural quantum counterparts of this theorem, expressed in  the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi identities]]. Generalizations of Noether's theorem to [[superspace]]s also exist.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Informal statement of the theorem ==
All fine technical points aside, Noether's theorem can be stated informally

{{quote|If a system has a continuous symmetry property, then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thompson, W.J. |title=Angular Momentum: an illustrated guide to rotational symmetries for physical systems |publisher=Wiley |year=1994 |isbn=0-471-55264-X |volume=1 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O25fXV4z0B0C&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A more sophisticated version of the theorem involving fields states that:

{{quote|To every differentiable [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] generated by local actions, there corresponds a [[conserved current]].}}

The word "symmetry" in the above statement refers more precisely to the [[covariant transformation|covariance]] of the form that a physical law takes with respect to a one-dimensional [[Lie group]] of transformations satisfying certain technical criteria. The [[conservation law]] of a [[physical quantity]] is usually expressed as a [[continuity equation]].

The formal proof of the theorem utilizes the condition of invariance to derive an expression for a current associated with a conserved physical quantity. 
In modern (since ca. 1980&lt;ref&gt;The term "Noether charge" occurs in Seligman, ''Group theory and its applications in physics, 1980: Latin American School of Physics, Mexico City'', American Institute of Physics, 1981. It comes enters wider use during the 1980s, e.g. by G. Takeda in: Errol Gotsman, Gerald Tauber (eds.) ''From SU(3) to Gravity: Festschrift in Honor of Yuval Ne'eman'', 1985, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;) terminology, the  conserved quantity is called the ''Noether charge'', while the flow carrying that charge is called the ''Noether current''. The Noether current is defined [[up to]] a [[solenoidal]] (divergenceless) vector field.

In the context of gravitation, [[Felix Klein]]'s statement of Noether's theorem for action ''I'' stipulates for the invariants:&lt;ref&gt;Nina Byers (1998) [http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/articles/noether.asg/noether.html "E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws."] in Proceedings of a Symposium on the Heritage of Emmy Noether, held on 2–4 December 1996, at the Bar-Ilan University, Israel, Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|If an integral I is invariant under a continuous group G&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; with ρ parameters, then ρ  linearly independent combinations of the Lagrangian expressions are divergences.}}

==Historical context==
{{main|Constant of motion|conservation law|conserved current}}

A [[conservation law]] states that some quantity ''X'' in the mathematical description of a system's evolution remains constant throughout its motion — it is an [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]].   Mathematically, the rate of change of ''X'' (its [[derivative]] with respect to [[time]]) is zero,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt} = 0 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Such quantities are said to be conserved; they are often called [[constant of motion|constants of motion]] (although motion ''per se'' need not be involved, just evolution in time). For example, if the energy of a system is conserved, its energy is invariant at all times, which imposes a constraint on the system's motion and may help in solving for it. Aside from insights that such constants of motion give into the nature of a system, they are a useful calculational tool; for example, an approximate solution can be corrected by finding the nearest state that satisfies the suitable conservation laws.

The earliest constants of motion discovered were [[momentum]] and [[energy]], which were proposed in the 17th century by [[René Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] on the basis of [[collision]] experiments, and refined by subsequent researchers. [[Isaac Newton]] was the first to enunciate the conservation of momentum in its modern form, and showed that it was a consequence of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]]. According to [[general relativity]], the conservation laws of linear momentum, energy and angular momentum are only exactly true globally when expressed in terms of the  sum of the [[stress–energy tensor]] (non-gravitational stress–energy) and the [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor#Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor|Landau–Lifshitz stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]] (gravitational stress–energy). The local conservation of non-gravitational linear momentum and energy in a free-falling reference frame is expressed by the vanishing of the covariant [[divergence]] of the [[stress–energy tensor]]. Another important conserved quantity, discovered in studies of the [[celestial mechanics]] of astronomical bodies, is the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]].

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, physicists developed more systematic methods for discovering invariants. A major advance came in 1788 with the development of [[Lagrangian mechanics]], which is related to the [[principle of least action]]. In this approach, the state of the system can be described by any type of [[generalized coordinate]]s '''q'''; the laws of motion need not be expressed in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], as was customary in Newtonian mechanics. The [[action (physics)|action]] is defined as the time integral ''I'' of a function known as the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]&amp;nbsp;''L''

::&lt;math&gt;I = \int L(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, t) \, dt ~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the dot over '''q''' signifies the rate of change of the coordinates '''q''',

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Hamilton's principle]] states that the physical path '''q'''(''t'')—the one actually taken by the system—is a path for which infinitesimal variations in that path cause no change in ''I'', at least up to first order. This principle results in the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}}   ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if one of the coordinates, say ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', does not appear in the Lagrangian, the right-hand side of the equation is zero, and the left-hand side requires that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} \right) = \frac{dp_k}{dt} = 0~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the momentum

:&lt;math&gt; p_k = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} &lt;/math&gt;

is conserved throughout the motion (on the physical path).

Thus, the absence of the '''ignorable''' coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the Lagrangian implies that the Lagrangian is unaffected by changes or transformations of ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''; the Lagrangian is invariant, and is said to exhibit a [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]] under such transformations. This is the seed idea generalized in Noether's theorem.

Several alternative methods for finding conserved quantities were developed in the 19th century, especially by [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. For example, he developed a theory of [[canonical transformation]]s which allowed changing coordinates so that some coordinates disappeared from the Lagrangian, as above, resulting in conserved canonical momenta. Another approach, and perhaps the most efficient for finding conserved quantities, is the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]].

==Mathematical expression==
{{see also|Perturbation theory}}

===Simple form using perturbations===

The essence of Noether's theorem is generalizing the ignorable coordinates outlined.

One can assume that the Lagrangian ''L'' defined above is invariant under small perturbations (warpings) of the time variable ''t'' and the [[generalized coordinate]]s '''q'''. One may write

:&lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t^{\prime} = t + \delta t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \rightarrow \mathbf{q}^{\prime} = \mathbf{q} + \delta \mathbf{q} ~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the perturbations ''δt'' and ''δ'''''q''' are both small, but variable. For generality, assume there are (say) ''N'' such [[symmetry transformations]] of the action, i.e. transformations leaving the action unchanged; labelled by an index ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''N''.

Then the resultant perturbation can be written as a linear sum of the individual types of perturbations,
:&lt;math&gt;\delta t = \sum_r \varepsilon_r T_r &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{q} = \sum_r \varepsilon_r \mathbf{Q}_r ~, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[infinitesimal]] parameter coefficients corresponding to each: 
*[[Lie group#The exponential map|generator]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' of [[time evolution]], and
*[[Lie group#The exponential map|generator]] '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; of the generalized coordinates.
For translations, '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant with units of [[length]]; for rotations, it is an expression linear in the components of '''q''', and the parameters make up an  [[angle]].

Using these definitions, [[Emmy Noether|Noether]] showed that the ''N'' quantities

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T_r - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \mathbf{Q}_r&lt;/math&gt;

(which have the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of [energy]·[time] + [momentum]·[length] = [action]) are conserved ([[constants of motion]]).

==== Examples ====

;Time invariance

For illustration, consider a Lagrangian that does not depend on time, i.e., that is invariant (symmetric) under changes ''t'' → ''t'' + δ''t'', without any change in the coordinates '''q'''. In this case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and '''Q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; the corresponding conserved quantity is the total [[energy]] ''H''&lt;ref name="energy" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=401–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L. &lt;/math&gt;

;Translational invariance

Consider a Lagrangian which does not depend on an ("ignorable", as above)  coordinate ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;; so  it is invariant (symmetric) under changes ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''δq''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. In that case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1; the conserved quantity is the corresponding [[momentum]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="momentum" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=403–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_k = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], these apparently separate conservation laws are aspects of a single conservation law, that of the [[stress–energy tensor]],&lt;ref name="stress–energy_tensor" &gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=592–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is derived in the next section.

;Rotational invariance

The conservation of the [[angular momentum]] '''L''' = '''r''' × '''p''' is  analogous to its linear momentum counterpart.&lt;ref name="angular_momentum" &gt;{{harvnb|Lanczos|1970|pp=404–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that the symmetry of the Lagrangian is rotational, i.e., that the Lagrangian does not depend on the absolute orientation of the physical system in space. For concreteness, assume that the Lagrangian does not change under small rotations of an angle ''δθ'' about an axis '''n'''; such a rotation transforms the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} \rightarrow \mathbf{r} + \delta\theta \, \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since time is not being transformed, ''T''=0. Taking ''δθ'' as the ''ε'' parameter and the Cartesian coordinates '''r''' as the generalized coordinates '''q''', the corresponding '''Q''' variables are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then Noether's theorem states that the following quantity is conserved,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \cdot \mathbf{Q}_{r} = 
\mathbf{p} \cdot \left( \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{r} \right) = 
\mathbf{n} \cdot \left( \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} \right) = 
\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{L}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the component of the angular momentum '''L''' along the '''n''' axis is conserved.

If '''n''' is arbitrary, i.e., if the system is insensitive to any rotation, then every component of '''L''' is conserved; in short, [[angular momentum]] is conserved.

===Field theory version===
Although useful in its own right, the version of Noether's theorem just given is a special case of the general version derived in 1915. To give the flavor of the general theorem, a version of the Noether theorem for continuous fields in four-dimensional [[space–time]] is now given. Since field theory problems are more common in modern physics than [[mechanics]] problems, this field theory version is the most commonly used (or most often implemented) version of Noether's theorem.

Let there be a set of differentiable [[Field (physics)|fields]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; defined over all space and time; for example, the temperature &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; would be representative of such a field, being a number defined at every place and time. The [[principle of least action]] can be applied to such fields, but the action is now an integral over space and time

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} = \int \mathcal{L} \left(\varphi, \partial_\mu \varphi, x^\mu \right) \, d^4 x&lt;/math&gt;

(the theorem can actually be further generalized to the case where the Lagrangian depends on up to the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative using [[jet bundle]]s)

A continuous transformation of the fields &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can be written infinitesimally as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \mapsto \varphi + \varepsilon \Psi,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is in general a function that may depend on both &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The condition for &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; to generate a physical symmetry is that the action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is left invariant. This will certainly be true if the Lagrangian density &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is left invariant, but it will also be true if the Lagrangian changes by a divergence,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \mapsto \mathcal{L} + \varepsilon \partial_\mu \Lambda^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

since the integral of a divergence becomes a boundary term according to the [[divergence theorem]]. A system described by a given action might have multiple independent symmetries of this type, indexed by &lt;math&gt;r = 1, 2, \ldots, N,&lt;/math&gt; so the most general symmetry transformation would be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \mapsto \varphi + \varepsilon_r \Psi_r,&lt;/math&gt;

with the consequence

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \mapsto \mathcal{L} + \varepsilon_r \partial_\mu \Lambda^\mu_r&lt;/math&gt;

For such systems, Noether's theorem states that there are &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; conserved [[conserved current|current densities]]

:&lt;math&gt;
j^\nu_r = \Lambda^\nu_r - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}} \cdot \Psi_r
&lt;/math&gt;

(where the dot product is understood to contract the ''field'' indices, not the &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; index or &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; index)

In such cases, the [[conservation law]] is expressed in a four-dimensional way

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\nu} j^\nu = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which expresses the idea that the amount of a conserved quantity within a sphere cannot change unless some of it flows out of the sphere. For example, [[electric charge]] is conserved; the amount of charge within a sphere cannot change unless some of the charge leaves the sphere.

For illustration, consider a physical system of fields that behaves the same under translations in time and space, as considered above; in other words, &lt;math&gt;L \left(\boldsymbol\varphi, \partial_\mu{\boldsymbol\varphi}, x^\mu \right)&lt;/math&gt; is constant in its third argument. In that case, ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, one for each dimension of space and time. An infinitesimal translation in space, &lt;math&gt;x^\mu \mapsto x^\mu + \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; denoting the [[Kronecker delta]]), affects the fields as &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x^\mu) \mapsto \varphi(x^\mu - \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r)&lt;/math&gt;: that is, relabelling the coordinates is equivalent to leaving the coordinates in place while translating the field itself, which in turn is equivalent to transforming the field by replacing its value at each point &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; with the value at the point &lt;math&gt;x^\mu - \varepsilon X^\mu&lt;/math&gt; "behind" it which would be mapped onto &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; by the infinitesimal displacement under consideration. Since this is infinitesimal, we may write this transformation as

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_r = -\delta^\mu_r \partial_\mu \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian density transforms in the same way, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x^\mu) \mapsto \mathcal{L}(x^\mu - \varepsilon_r \delta^\mu_r)&lt;/math&gt;, so

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^\mu_r = -\delta^\mu_r \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;

and thus Noether's theorem corresponds to the conservation law for the [[stress–energy tensor]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name="stress–energy_tensor" /&gt; where we have used &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. To wit, by using the expression given earlier, and collecting the four conserved currents (one for each &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) into a tensor &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, Noether's theorem gives

:&lt;math&gt;
T_\mu{}^\nu = -\delta^\nu_\mu \mathcal{L} + \delta^\sigma_\mu \partial_\sigma \varphi \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}} = \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \varphi_{,\nu}}\right) \cdot \varphi_{,\mu} - \delta^\nu_\mu \mathcal{L}
&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;T_\mu{}^\nu{}_{,\nu} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

(note that we relabelled &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; at an intermediate step to avoid conflict). (However, note that the &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; obtained in this way may differ from the symmetric tensor used as the source term in general relativity; see [[Stress–energy tensor#Canonical stress.E2.80.93energy tensor|Canonical stress–energy tensor]].)

The conservation of [[electric charge]], by contrast, can be derived by considering ''Ψ'' linear in the fields ''φ'' rather than in the derivatives.&lt;ref name="charge"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=593–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[probability amplitude]] ''ψ''('''x''') of finding a particle at a point '''x''' is a complex field ''φ'', because it ascribes a [[complex number]] to every point in space and time. The probability amplitude itself is physically unmeasurable; only the probability ''p'' = |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be inferred  from a set of  measurements. Therefore, the system is invariant under transformations of the ''ψ'' field and its [[complex conjugate]] field ''ψ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; that leave |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; unchanged, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi \rightarrow e^{i\theta} \psi \ ,\ \psi^{*} \rightarrow e^{-i\theta} \psi^{*}~,&lt;/math&gt;

a complex rotation. In the limit when the phase ''θ'' becomes infinitesimally small, ''δθ'', it may be taken as the parameter ''ε'', while the ''Ψ'' are equal to ''iψ'' and −''iψ''*, respectively. A specific example is the [[Klein–Gordon equation]], the [[special relativity|relativistically correct]] version of the [[Schrödinger equation]] for [[spin (physics)|spinless]] particles, which has the Lagrangian density

:&lt;math&gt;L = \psi_{,\nu} \psi^{*}_{,\mu} \eta^{\nu \mu} + m^2 \psi \psi^{*}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, Noether's theorem states that the conserved (∂⋅''j'' = 0) current equals

:&lt;math&gt;j^{\nu} = i \left( \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x^{\mu}} \psi^{*} - \frac{\partial \psi^{*}}{\partial x^{\mu}} \psi \right) \eta^{\nu \mu}~,&lt;/math&gt;

which, when multiplied by the charge on that species of particle, equals the electric current density due to that type of particle. This "gauge invariance" was first noted by [[Hermann Weyl]], and is one of the prototype [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]] of physics.

== Derivations ==

===One independent variable===
Consider the simplest case, a system with one independent variable, time. Suppose the dependent variables '''q''' are such that the action integral

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L [\mathbf{q} [t], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t], t] \, dt &lt;/math&gt;

is invariant under brief infinitesimal variations in the dependent variables. In other words, they satisfy the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} [t] = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [t].&lt;/math&gt;

And suppose that the integral is invariant under a continuous symmetry. Mathematically such a symmetry is represented as a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], '''φ''', which acts on the variables as follows

:&lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t' = t + \varepsilon T &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} [t] \rightarrow \mathbf{q}' [t'] = \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t], \varepsilon] = \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε'' is a real variable indicating the amount of flow, and ''T'' is a real constant (which could be zero) indicating how much the flow shifts time.

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{\mathbf{q}} [t] \rightarrow \dot{\mathbf{q}}' [t'] = \frac{d}{dt} \varphi [\mathbf{q} [t], \varepsilon] = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon] \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t' - \varepsilon T]
.&lt;/math&gt;

The action integral flows to

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I' [\varepsilon] &amp; = \int_{t_1 + \varepsilon T}^{t_2 + \varepsilon T} L [\mathbf{q}'[t'], \dot{\mathbf{q}}' [t'], t'] \, dt' \\[6pt]
&amp; = \int_{t_1 + \varepsilon T}^{t_2 + \varepsilon T} L [\varphi [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon], \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} [\mathbf{q} [t' - \varepsilon T], \varepsilon] \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t' - \varepsilon T], t'] \, dt'
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be regarded as a function of ''ε''. Calculating the derivative at ''ε''' = 0 and using [[Leibniz's rule (derivatives and integrals)|Leibniz's rule]], we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; \frac{d I'}{d \varepsilon} [0] = L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \left( - \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} \right) + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( - \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{(\partial \mathbf{q})^2} {\dot{\mathbf{q}}}^2 T + \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} -
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} T \right) \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the Euler–Lagrange equations imply

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T \right) 
&amp; = \left( \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \right) \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} \, T \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \left( \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{(\partial \mathbf{q})^2} \dot{\mathbf{q}} \right) \dot{\mathbf{q}} T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} \, T.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the previous equation, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; \frac{d I'}{d \varepsilon} [0] \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2] T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Again using the Euler–Lagrange equations we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d t} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} \right) 
= \left( \frac{d}{d t} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right) \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}}
= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon \partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the previous equation, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 = {} &amp; L [\mathbf{q} [t_2], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2], t_2] T - L [\mathbf{q} [t_1], \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1], t_1] T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_2] T + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} [t_1] T \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} [t_2] - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon} [t_1].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From which one can see that

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

is a constant of the motion, i.e., it is a conserved quantity. Since φ['''q''', 0] = '''q''', we get &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \mathbf{q}} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and so the conserved quantity simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \dot{\mathbf{q}} - L \right) T - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial \varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

To avoid excessive complication of the formulas, this derivation assumed that the flow does not change as time passes. The same result can be obtained in the more general case.

===Field-theoretic derivation===
Noether's theorem may also be derived for tensor fields ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; where the index ''A'' ranges over the various components of the various tensor fields. These field quantities are functions defined over a four-dimensional space whose points are labeled by coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; where the index ''μ'' ranges over time (''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and three spatial dimensions (''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3). These four coordinates are the independent variables; and the values of the fields at each event are the dependent variables. Under an infinitesimal transformation, the variation in the coordinates is written

:&lt;math&gt;x^\mu \rightarrow \xi^\mu = x^\mu + \delta x^\mu &lt;/math&gt;

whereas the transformation of the field variables is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^A \rightarrow \alpha^A (\xi^\mu) = \varphi^A (x^\mu) + \delta \varphi^A (x^\mu)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

By this definition, the field variations ''δφ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; result from two factors: intrinsic changes in the field themselves and changes in coordinates, since the transformed field ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; depends on the transformed coordinates ξ&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;. To isolate the intrinsic changes, the field variation at a single point ''x''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; may be defined

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^A (x^\mu) = \varphi^A (x^\mu) + \bar{\delta} \varphi^A (x^\mu)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the coordinates are changed, the boundary of the region of space–time over which the Lagrangian is being integrated also changes; the original boundary and its transformed version are denoted as Ω and Ω’, respectively.

Noether's theorem begins with the assumption that a specific transformation of the coordinates and field variables does not change the [[action (physics)|action]], which is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density over the given region of spacetime. Expressed mathematically, this assumption may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Omega^{\prime}} L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, \xi^{\mu} \right) d^{4}\xi - \int_{\Omega} L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^{\mu} \right) d^{4}x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the comma subscript indicates a partial derivative with respect to the coordinate(s) that follows the comma, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi^A}_{,\sigma} = \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^{\sigma}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ξ is a dummy variable of integration, and since the change in the boundary Ω is infinitesimal by assumption, the two integrals may be combined using the four-dimensional version of the [[divergence theorem]] into the following form

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{\Omega} \left\{ 
\left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \right]
+ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left[ L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma \right]
\right\} d^4 x = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The difference in Lagrangians can be written to first-order in the infinitesimal variations as

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \right] = 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi^A} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, because the variations are defined at the same point as described above, the variation and the derivative can be done in reverse order; they [[commutativity|commute]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma} = 
\bar{\delta} \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^\sigma} = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} ( \bar{\delta} \varphi^A)
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Euler–Lagrange field equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) =
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi^A}
&lt;/math&gt;

the difference in Lagrangians can be written neatly as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left[ L \left( \alpha^A, {\alpha^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) - 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^{\mu} \right) \right] \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}
= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the change in the action can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_\Omega \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left\{ \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma
\right\} d^{4}x = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this holds for any region Ω, the integrand must be zero

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\sigma} 
\left\{ \frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + 
L \left( \varphi^A, {\varphi^A}_{,\nu}, x^\mu \right) \delta x^\sigma
\right\} = 0
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For any combination of the various [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]] transformations, the perturbation can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\delta x^{\mu} = \varepsilon X^\mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \varphi^A = \varepsilon \Psi^A = \bar{\delta} \varphi^A + \varepsilon \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] of φ&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; in the ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; direction. When ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; is a scalar or &lt;math&gt;{X^\mu}_{,\nu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A = \frac{\partial \varphi^A}{\partial x^{\mu}} X^\mu\,.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations imply that the field variation taken at one point equals

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\delta} \varphi^A = \varepsilon \Psi^A - \varepsilon \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the above divergence with respect to ''ε'' at ''ε''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and changing the sign yields the conservation law

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial x^\sigma} j^\sigma = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the conserved current equals

:&lt;math&gt;
j^\sigma = 
\left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \mathcal{L}_X \varphi^A - L \, X^\sigma\right]
- \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial {\varphi^A}_{,\sigma}} \right) \Psi^A\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Manifold/fiber bundle derivation===
Suppose we have an ''n''-dimensional oriented [[Riemannian manifold]], ''M'' and a target manifold ''T''. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of [[smooth function]]s from ''M'' to ''T''. (More generally, we can have smooth sections of a [[fiber bundle]] over ''M''.)

Examples of this ''M'' in physics include:
* In [[classical mechanics]], in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulation, ''M'' is the one-dimensional manifold '''R''', representing time and the target space is the [[cotangent bundle]] of [[space]] of generalized positions.
* In [[field (physics)|field theory]], ''M'' is the [[spacetime]] manifold and the target space is the set of values the fields can take at any given point. For example, if there are ''m'' [[real number|real]]-valued [[scalar field]]s, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1,\ldots,\varphi_m&lt;/math&gt;, then the target manifold is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;. If the field is a real vector field, then the target manifold is [[isomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Now suppose there is a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt;

called the [[Action (physics)|action]]. (Note that it takes values into '''R''', rather than '''C'''; this is for physical reasons, and doesn't really matter for this proof.)

To get to the usual version of Noether's theorem, we need additional restrictions on the [[Action (physics)|action]]. We assume &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}[\varphi]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[integral]] over ''M'' of a function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\varphi,\partial_\mu\varphi,x)&lt;/math&gt;

called the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]], depending on φ, its [[derivative]] and the position. In other words, for φ in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}[\varphi]\,=\,\int_M \mathcal{L}[\varphi(x),\partial_\mu\varphi(x),x] \, \mathrm{d}^nx.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose we are given [[boundary condition]]s, i.e., a specification of the value of φ at the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] if ''M'' is [[Compact space|compact]], or some limit on φ as ''x'' approaches ∞. Then the [[subspace topology|subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of functions φ such that all [[functional derivative]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; at φ are zero, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}[\varphi]}{\delta \varphi(x)}\approx 0&lt;/math&gt;

and that φ satisfies the given boundary conditions, is the subspace of [[on shell]] solutions. (See [[principle of stationary action]])

Now, suppose we have an [[infinitesimal transformation]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, generated by a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], ''Q'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;Q \left[ \int_N \mathcal{L} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \right] \approx \int_{\partial N} f^\mu [\varphi(x),\partial\varphi,\partial\partial\varphi,\ldots] \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu &lt;/math&gt;

for all compact submanifolds ''N'' or in other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}(x)]\approx\partial_\mu f^\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'', where we set

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x)=\mathcal{L}[\varphi(x), \partial_\mu \varphi(x),x].&lt;/math&gt;

If this holds [[on shell]] and [[off shell]], we say ''Q'' generates an off-shell symmetry. If this only holds [[on shell]], we say ''Q'' generates an on-shell symmetry. Then, we say ''Q'' is a generator of a [[one-parameter group|one parameter]] [[symmetry]] [[Lie group]].

Now, for any ''N'', because of the [[Euler–Lagrange]] theorem, [[on shell]] (and only on-shell), we have

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Q\left[\int_N \mathcal{L} \, \mathrm{d}^nx \right]
&amp; =\int_N \left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\varphi} - \partial_\mu \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)} \right]Q[\varphi] \, \mathrm{d}^nx + \int_{\partial N} \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi] \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu \\
&amp; \approx\int_{\partial N} f^\mu \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is true for any ''N'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi]-f^\mu\right]\approx 0.&lt;/math&gt;

But this is the [[continuity equation]] for the current &lt;math&gt;J^\mu&lt;/math&gt; defined by:&lt;ref name=Peskin&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i35LALN0GosC&amp;pg=PA689&amp;dq=weinberg+%22symmetry+%22 |page=18 |author1=Michael E. Peskin |author2=Daniel V. Schroeder |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-201-50397-2 |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu\,=\,\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\varphi)}Q[\varphi]-f^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

which is called the '''Noether current''' associated with the [[symmetry]]. The continuity equation tells us that if we [[Integral|integrate]] this current over a [[space-like]] slice, we get a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]] called the Noether charge (provided, of course, if ''M'' is noncompact, the currents fall off sufficiently fast at infinity).

=== Comments ===
Noether's theorem is an [[on shell]] theorem: it relies on use of the equations of motion—the classical path. It reflects the relation between the boundary conditions and the variational principle. Assuming no boundary terms in the action, Noether's theorem implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial N} J^\mu \, \mathrm{d}s_\mu \approx 0~.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantum analogs of Noether's theorem involving expectation values, e.g. ⟨∫''d''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' ∂·''J''⟩&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, probing [[off shell]] quantities as well are the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi identities]].

=== Generalization to Lie algebras ===
Suppose we have two symmetry derivations ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, [''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is also a symmetry derivation. Let's see this explicitly. Let's say

:&lt;math&gt;Q_1[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f_1^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;Q_2[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f_2^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;[Q_1,Q_2][\mathcal{L}]=Q_1[Q_2[\mathcal{L}]]-Q_2[Q_1[\mathcal{L}]]\approx\partial_\mu f_{12}^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;]&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;]. So,

:&lt;math&gt;j_{12}^\mu=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right)(Q_1[Q_2[\varphi]]-Q_2[Q_1[\varphi]])-f_{12}^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows we can extend Noether's theorem to larger Lie algebras in a natural way.

=== Generalization of the proof ===
This applies to ''any'' local symmetry derivation ''Q'' satisfying ''QS''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0, and also to more general local functional differentiable actions, including ones where the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives of the fields. Let ''ε'' be any arbitrary smooth function of the spacetime (or time) manifold such that the closure of its support is disjoint from the boundary. ''ε''&amp;nbsp;is a [[test function]]. Then, because of the variational principle (which does ''not'' apply to the boundary, by the way), the derivation distribution q generated by ''q''[''ε''][Φ(''x'')] = ''ε''(''x'')''Q''[Φ(''x'')] satisfies ''q''[''ε''][''S'']&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0 for every&amp;nbsp;''ε'', or more compactly, ''q''(''x'')[''S'']&amp;nbsp;≈ 0&amp;nbsp;for all ''x'' not on the boundary (but remember that ''q''(''x'') is a shorthand for a derivation ''distribution'', not a derivation parametrized by ''x'' in general). This is the generalization of Noether's theorem.

To see how the generalization is related to the version given above, assume that the action is the spacetime integral of a Lagrangian that only depends on φ and its first derivatives. Also, assume

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}]\approx\partial_\mu f^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
q[\varepsilon][\mathcal{S}] &amp; = \int q[\varepsilon][\mathcal{L}] \, \mathrm{d}^n x  \\
&amp; = \int \left\{ \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi}\mathcal{L}\right) \varepsilon Q[\varphi]+ \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]\partial_\mu(\varepsilon Q[\varphi]) \right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \\
&amp; = \int \left\{ \varepsilon Q[\mathcal{L}] + \partial_{\mu}\varepsilon \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial \left( \partial_\mu \varphi\right)} \mathcal{L} \right] Q[\varphi] \right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x \\
&amp; \approx \int \varepsilon \partial_\mu \left\{f^\mu-\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]Q[\varphi]\right\} \, \mathrm{d}^n x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''ε''.

More generally, if the Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives, then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\partial_\mu\left[f^\mu-\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu\varphi)} \mathcal{L} \right] \right. &amp; \left.\!\! Q[\varphi] - 2\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]\partial_\nu Q[\varphi] \right. \\[6pt]
&amp; \left. {} + \partial_\nu\left[\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right] Q[\varphi]\right]-\,\cdots\right]\approx 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Example 1: Conservation of energy ===
Looking at the specific case of a Newtonian particle of mass ''m'', coordinate ''x'', moving under the influence of a potential ''V'', coordinatized by time ''t''. The [[Action (physics)|action]], ''S'', is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[x] &amp; = \int L[x(t),\dot{x}(t)] \, dt \\
&amp; = \int \left(\frac m 2 \sum_{i=1}^3\dot{x}_i^2-V(x(t))\right) \, dt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term in the brackets is the [[kinetic energy]] of the particle, whilst the second is its [[potential energy]]. Consider the generator of [[time translation]]s ''Q'' = ''d/dt''. In other words, &lt;math&gt;Q[x(t)]=\dot{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that ''x'' has an explicit dependence on time, whilst ''V'' does not; consequently:

:&lt;math&gt;Q[L]=m \sum_i\dot{x}_i\ddot{x}_i-\sum_i\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x_i}\dot{x}_i = \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2-V(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

so we can set

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2} \sum_i\dot{x}_i^2-V(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
j &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}Q[x_i]-L \\
&amp; = m \sum_i\dot{x}_i^2 -\left[\frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2 -V(x)\right] \\
&amp; = \frac{m}{2}\sum_i\dot{x}_i^2+V(x).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side is the energy, and Noether's theorem states that &lt;math&gt;\dot{j}=0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the principle of conservation of energy is a consequence of invariance under time translations.

More generally, if the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time, the quantity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}\dot{x_i}-L&lt;/math&gt;

(called the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]) is conserved.

=== Example 2: Conservation of center of momentum ===
Still considering 1-dimensional time, let

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[\vec{x}] &amp; = \int \mathcal{L}[\vec{x}(t),\dot{\vec{x}}(t)] \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&amp; = \int \left [\sum^N_{\alpha=1} \frac{m_\alpha}{2}(\dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha)^2 -\sum_{\alpha&lt;\beta} V_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{x}_\beta-\vec{x}_\alpha)\right] \, \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. ''N'' Newtonian particles where the potential only depends pairwise upon the relative displacement.

For &lt;math&gt;\vec{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, let's consider the generator of Galilean transformations (i.e. a change in the frame of reference). In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q_i[x^j_\alpha(t)]=t \delta^j_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Q_i[\mathcal{L}] &amp; = \sum_\alpha m_\alpha \dot{x}_\alpha^i-\sum_{\alpha&lt;\beta}\partial_i V_{\alpha\beta}(\vec{x}_\beta-\vec{x}_\alpha)(t-t) \\
&amp; = \sum_\alpha m_\alpha \dot{x}_\alpha^i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This has the form of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\sum_\alpha m_\alpha x^i_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; so we can set

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}=\sum_\alpha m_\alpha \vec{x}_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{j}=\sum_\alpha \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha}\mathcal{L}\right)\cdot\vec{Q}[\vec{x}_\alpha]-\vec{f}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\sum_\alpha (m_\alpha \dot{\vec{x}}_\alpha t-m_\alpha \vec{x}_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\vec{P}t-M\vec{x}_{CM}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the total momentum, ''M'' is the total mass and &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}_{CM}&lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass. Noether's theorem states:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\vec{j}} = 0 \Rightarrow {\vec{P}}-M \dot{\vec{x}}_{CM} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 3: Conformal transformation ===

Both examples 1 and 2 are over a 1-dimensional manifold (time). An example involving spacetime is a [[conformal transformation]] of a massless real scalar field with a [[Quartic interaction|quartic potential]] in (3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[Minkowski spacetime]].

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}[\varphi] &amp; =\int \mathcal{L}[\varphi (x),\partial_\mu \varphi (x)] \, \mathrm{d}^4x \\
&amp; =\int \left( \frac{1}{2}\partial^\mu \varphi \partial_\mu \varphi -\lambda \varphi^4\right ) \, \mathrm{d}^4x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For ''Q'', consider the generator of a spacetime rescaling. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\varphi(x)]=x^\mu\partial_\mu \varphi(x)+\varphi(x). &lt;/math&gt;

The second term on the right hand side is due to the "conformal weight" of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Note that

:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}]=\partial^\mu\varphi\left(\partial_\mu\varphi+x^\nu\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\varphi+\partial_\mu\varphi\right)-4\lambda\varphi^3\left(x^\mu\partial_\mu\varphi+\varphi\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This has the form of

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu\left[\frac{1}{2}x^\mu\partial^\nu\varphi\partial_\nu\varphi-\lambda x^\mu \varphi^4 \right] = \partial_\mu\left(x^\mu\mathcal{L}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(where we have performed a change of dummy indices) so set

:&lt;math&gt;f^\mu=x^\mu\mathcal{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
j^\mu &amp; =\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial
(\partial_\mu\varphi)}\mathcal{L}\right]Q[\varphi]-f^\mu \\
&amp; =\partial^\mu\varphi\left(x^\nu\partial_\nu\varphi+\varphi\right)-x^\mu\left( \frac 1 2 \partial^\nu\varphi\partial_\nu\varphi-\lambda\varphi^4\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Noether's theorem states that &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu j^\mu = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (as one may explicitly check by substituting the Euler–Lagrange equations into the left hand side).

Note that if one tries to find the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|Ward–Takahashi]] analog of this equation, one runs into a problem because of [[anomaly (physics)|anomalies]].

== Applications ==
Application of Noether's theorem allows physicists to gain powerful insights into any general theory in physics, by just analyzing the various transformations that would make the form of the laws involved invariant. For example:

* the invariance of physical systems with respect to spatial [[translation (physics)|translation]] (in other words, that the laws of physics do not vary with locations in space) gives the law of conservation of [[linear momentum]];
* invariance with respect to [[rotation]] gives the law of conservation of [[angular momentum]];
* invariance with respect to [[time]] translation gives the well-known [[law of conservation of energy]]

In [[quantum field theory]], the analog to Noether's theorem, the [[Ward–Takahashi identity]], yields further conservation laws, such as the conservation of [[electric charge]] from the invariance with respect to a change in the [[phase factor]] of the [[Complex number|complex]] field of the charged particle and the associated [[gauge invariance|gauge]] of the [[electric potential]] and [[vector potential]].

The Noether charge is also used in calculating the [[entropy]] of [[stationary black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vivek Iyer |author2=Wald |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.52.4430 |journal=[[Physical Review D]]  |title=A comparison of Noether charge and Euclidean methods for Computing the Entropy of Stationary Black Holes |volume=52 |issue=8 |pages=4430–9 |year=1995 |arxiv=gr-qc/9503052|bibcode = 1995PhRvD..52.4430I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Olivier Zahm in 1979.jpg|thumb|333x333px|Zahm pictured in [[1979]] in [[Paris]]]]
Olivier Zahm was born and raised in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/olivier-zahm|title=Olivier Zahmis One of the 500 People Shaping the Global Fashion Industry|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of three children born to two university professors. His parents, who were both students at the time of his birth, raised Zahm and his other siblings in student quarters that were designed by [[Charlotte Perriand]] and [[Jean Prouvé]], located at [[:fr:Résidence_universitaire_Jean-Zay|Résidence Universitaire Jean-Zay]] in [[Antony, Hauts-de-Seine|Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his early childhood was spent in academic settings, particularly- during the volatile period of civil unrest in France that broke out in [[May 1968]]''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution. The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against [[capitalism]], [[consumerism]], [[American imperialism]], and traditional institutions, values and order. Many of the new and radical ideas surrounding Zahm, immersing his youth in tumultuous generational discord, stayed with him, shaping his views on art, philosophical ideas and lifestyle choices.  He leveraged his profound formative experience using it as a tool to build aspects and themes that remain prevalent in his personal and professional life in adulthood.  He told The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2010 that he, “remembers summers spent vacationing in the South of France with his parents in a community of like minded free spirits”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/fashion/04ZAHM.html|title=Publisher in the Warhol Mold|last=Morgan|first=Spencer|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; - who he labeled hippies. It was the ''1970s'', the decade of sex revolution and Zahm's parents were committed to [[free love]]'','' [[Naturism|nudism]] and [[Polyamory|polyamourous]] relationships. "My parents had a lot of lovers, they had a lot of affairs. At the time, my parents were really part of this alternative movement in Paris but quite bourgeois too. It wasn't San Francisco or New York. It was the French way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt;." Zahm’s love of magazines began when he was a teenager in the Paris suburbs. “We used to steal porn magazines in the bookstores and shops and look at them during school,” he says. “It was fun and secret. This is where my obsession for magazines comes from. Magazines used to reveal and give us access to sex, fashion, music and art. TV never did that, and books are mostly academic. Magazines were a symbol of freedom.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He studied [[Philosophy|philosophy,]] [[history]],  [[semiotics]] and [[literature]] at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Livres/Olivier-Zahm-l-anar-chic-purple-Fashion-156808|title=Olivier Zahm, l’anar chic|last=Match|first=Paris|access-date=2018-09-24|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His father, Claude, taught philosophy, and Zahm was on track to do the same, before realizing, at 25, that he preferred life outside “la tour d’ ivoire.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahm's youngest sister committed suicide in 1994 at the age of 20. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/02/olivier-zahm-fashions-most-libidinal-editor.html|title=Riding Around Paris With Olivier Zahm, Fashion’s Most Libidinal Editor|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Before entering the world of fashion, Zahm worked as an art critic with widespread recognition for his work as a curator as well as his participation in over 150 exhibitions featuring international contemporary art. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/2/|title=Purple Prose , #2|website=Magpile|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;In responding to the superficial glamour of the 1980s, Zahm co-founded Purple Prose magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/about/|title=Purple Prose  magazine on Magpile|website=magpile.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the introduction of Purple Anthology, Zahm shares why he chose to create Purple Prose:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847830206/|title=Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex - Rizzoli New York|work=Rizzoli New York|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/fw-2008-issue-10/purple-anthology/|title=Purple Anthology - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"We launched Purple Prose in the early 1990s without any means, and without any experience, because we wanted to make a magazine that was radically different. We wanted to support the artists around us that no one else supported, much less talked about. It would be a form of opposition of our own".'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Purple Anthology|last=Zahm|first=Olivier|last2=Fleiss|first2=Elein|publisher=Rizzoli|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8478-3020-6|location=New York City|pages=introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Anthology-Prose-Fashion-Architecture/dp/0847830209|title=Purple Anthology: Art Prose Fashion Music Architecture Sex|date=2008-05-27|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=9780847830206|editor-last=Zahm|editor-first=Olivier|location=New York|language=English|editor-last2=Fleiss|editor-first2=Elein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Art critic and curator (1985–1994) ===
During the beginning of the 80’s Zahm started to observe and take an interest in the art world. He liked the notion of “being everywhere and on the move”, following art fairs, meeting artists, educating himself in the universe of contemporary art while immersing himself into its social landscape.  Zahm’s gift of being a charismatic intellectual and having an eye for contemporary art made itself apparent early on. He found himself penning for the three leading art titles at the time [[Artforum|Art Forum]], Art Flash, [[Texte zur Kunst|Texte Zur Kunst]] and [[Art press|Art Presse]] and introduced a then unknown [[Jeff Koons]], [[Martin Kippenberger]], and [[Larry Clark]] to the European art world.   He started traveling to the United States and Japan, realizing he could set up his own operation and work agenda, 24/7. He told [[I-D|I-D magazine]] in 2010: 
[[File:Jan Van Osst, Sans titre, 1993.jpg|thumb|Jan Van Osst, Sans Titre, 1993 at L'Hiver De L'amour in [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville Paris]] curated by Zahm]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Freedom for me came from the art world because it was a place where I could meet the artists. I wanted to be a social critic. I was more interested in the category of intellectual, involving art and politics and writing sometimes. But I didn't want to be a writer necessarily, I just wanted to be part of an intellectual world." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kby7d/purple-reign-tbt-to-2010-when-i-d-met-olivier-zahm|title=purple reign: #tbt to 2010, when i-D met olivier zahm|date=2017-05-04|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1989, while working at [[Artforum]],  Elien Fleiss, then a young gallery curator received a phone call from Zahm. She was looking for an art critic to write a manifesto against a journalist from a daily newspaper who she felt was writing insanities about contemporary art in general. Zahm agreed to do it, and that was the beginning of the encounter, which then became a love story. Their romance was short-lived, but their professional relationship was fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/fashion/04ZAHM.html|title=Publisher in the Warhol Mold|last=Morgan|first=Spencer|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, they curated “The Winter of Love,”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589&lt;/ref&gt; a hit show for the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Museum of Modern Art in Paris]] that they later took to [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589|title=The Winter of Love (L'Hiver de l'Amour) {{!}} MoMA|website=www.moma.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/france/art-press/20170521/282626032622730|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May of  2017, Zahm published a book in collaboration with Donation Grau titled,' Une avant-garde sans avant-garde'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lespressesdureel.com/ouvrage.php?id=3523|title=Olivier Zahm: Une avant-garde sans avant-garde – Les presses du réel (livre)|website=www.lespressesdureel.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://i-d.vice.com/fr/article/3kbd8v/sans-dieu-ni-maitres-petite-lecon-davant-gardisme-par-olivier-zahm|title=sans dieu ni maitre, petite leçon d'avant-gardisme par olivier zahm|date=2017-04-25|work=I-d|access-date=2018-09-24|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;The book is a collection of Zahm’s most significant texts written during the last 30 years. It is above all a radical reading of art from the 1990s to the present. The [[anthology]] tries to decipher this chaotic, contradictory, oppressive, and ultra-creative period. The introductions that precede each chapter contextualize the selected texts, and develop the idea that the 1990s invented an avant-garde without an avant-garde, the issues of which are increasing and intensifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lespressesdureel.com/ouvrage.php?id=3523|title=Olivier Zahm:  Une avant-garde sans avant-garde – Les presses du réel (livre)|website=www.lespressesdureel.com|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.fr/Une-avant-garde-sans-Olivier-Zahm/dp/2840665441|title=Une avant-garde sans avant-garde|last=recherche|first=résultats de|last2=Grau|first2=Donatien|date=2017-03-01|publisher=Les Presses du réel|isbn=9782840665441|location=Dijon; Zurich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=18&amp;id_b=2748|title=Olivier Zahm - Une avant-garde sans avant-garde|website=jrp-ringier|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livre.fnac.com/a10494503/Olivier-Zahm-Une-avant-garde-sans-avant-garde|title=Une avant-garde sans avant-garde Essai sur l'art - broché - Olivier Zahm - Achat Livre {{!}} fnac|website=livre.fnac.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/olivier-zahms-new-book-une-avant-garde-sans-avant-garde-co-edited-with-donatien-grau-is-available-now-to-pre-order/|title=Olivier Zahm's new book "Une avant-garde sans avant-garde" co-edited with Donatien Grau is available now to pre-order! - purple DIARY|date=2017-02-23|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early day's of ''Purple'' (1992–2004) ====

Zahm gravitated towards the idea of working with magazines from the conception of his career in art.  In 1992 Zahm and his partner Elien Fleiss printed the first issue of Purple Prose, a Parisian literary art zine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ravelinmagazine.com/posts/les-chroniques-purple/|title=Les Chroniques Purple - Ravelin Magazine|date=2014-08-13|work=Ravelin Magazine|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/PURPLE-PROSE-MAGAZINE-ISSUE-1-1992-OLIVIER-ZAHM-ELEIN-FLEISS-RARE-/121033472335|title=PURPLE PROSE MAGAZINE ISSUE #1 1992 OLIVIER ZAHM, ELEIN FLEISS *RARE*  {{!}} eBay|website=eBay|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to create a new kind of space for artists to present their work and express their ideas; and to design a network through which people working in different disciplines, could easily access new information and each other and contributing to the early 90s alternative indie culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-colour-purple-1249204.html|title=The colour purple|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/creative-class/olivier-zahms-cocktail-of-intellect-sex-and-the-seventies|title=Olivier Zahm’s Cocktail of Intellect, Sex and the Seventies|date=2015-05-27|work=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahm liked the idea of a color sharing the title with an art magazine. [[Dike Blair]] an American artist suggested the title Purple Prose in reference to the literary term in which a prose text is so extravagent, ornate, or flowery that it breaks the flow and draws excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/interview-olivier-zahm-on-the-purple-25th-anniversary.html|title=A French Fashion Editor on the Difference Between Paris, New York, and L.A.|last=Swanson|first=Carl|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the birth of Purple Prose, Zahm created spin-off publications like Purple Sexe, Purple Fiction and Purple Fashion. Zahm aimed at fusing together his two worlds, fashion and art, in creating Purple Fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magpile.com/purple-prose/1/|title=Purple Prose , #1|website=Magpile|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical issue featured interviews, articles and presentations covering a wide range of topics and disciplines which include; film and video, politics, fashion, architecture, sexuality, science, photography and music. Each issue was built around a loose theme which serves to create a link between subjects-past examples have been: Indian Summer, Violet Violence, Post-Sex. With its international correspondents and cutting-edge design, Purple Prose had the distinctive feel of a truly global art zine. The texts were written in roughly equal parts French and English, without translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adaweb.walkerart.org/purple/info.html|title=Purple Prose|website=adaweb.walkerart.org|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For many years the magazine was associated with a realist esthetic, that of the new photography of the early 1990s- of photographers like [[Juergen Teller]], [[Terry Richardson]], [[Wolfgang Tillmans]], and [[Mario Sorrenti]].  From a visual standpoint, the magazine represented a break from 80s imagery (like [[Richard Avedon]]’s photography for [[Versace]], for example.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/fine-print-the-purple-anthology/?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=2D16E914473B5E10578FBC9B4FEF8E2C&amp;gwt=pay|title=Fine Print {{!}} 'The Purple Anthology'|last=Hruska|first=Jordan|work=T Magazine|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an artistic standpoint, the artists from the early 1990s were raising up against art as a capitalist fetish; they were aligning themselves with the artistic social and political practices of the 1970s-- those of performance, [[video art]], [[Fluxus]], and the conceptual and minimalist [[avant-garde]]. The magazine was an integral part of this burgeoning context, which included the deconstruction of fashion by [[Martin Margiela]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2007-issue-7/retrospective-maison-martin-margiela/|title=Retrospective Maison Martin Margiela - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Comme des Garçons|Comme des Garçsons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/fw-2012-issue-18/rei-kawakubo/|title=Rei Kawakubo - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the return of subtle political art, with that of [[Félix González-Torres|Felix Gonzalez- Torres]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], and [[Philippe Parreno]], among others; photography of [[Juergen Teller]]; and [[Harmony Korine]] and [[Larry Clark]]’s independent filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2013-issue-19/harmony-korine/|title=Harmony Korine - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/magazine/ss-2013-issue-19/larry-clark/|title=Larry Clark - purple MAGAZINE|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media now generally satisfy the need for images, contacts, and creativity. Publishing a magazine has become so expensive… An actual print object like Purple is a luxury item, which is why new alternative magazines don’t last more than a few years, are often bought, or simply disappear. Doing a luxury magazine today is one of the paradoxes of the Instagram era, when such things cost nothing… A magazine is not an ego trip… It’s a collective work by a group of creative people who believe in the artistic value of the print media and share a similar vision. (Thanks to all of them!) Every image, every single text, the choice of paper, the layout, even the choice of typefaces matters. Everything matters… Purple is made to last. Purple is made to capture a moment every season… In this period of global Internet obsession and digital amnesia, I think that means something&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/purple-25th-anniversary-issue-is-out-now/|title=PURPLE 25TH ANNIVERSARY ISSUE IS OUT NOW! - purple DIARY|date=2017-09-05|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 Purple moved their US based headquarters and offices from [[New York City]] to [[Los Angeles]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/purples-l-a-times-1202780271/|title=Purple’s L.A.

In 2009 [[Chanel]] launched its very first magazine: 31 Rue Cambon. Chanel’s goal was to combine sales and information. [[Karl Lagerfeld]] delegated the artistic direction of the magazine which was not available to the public, but instead only the private cliental of Chanel to Zahm &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tendances-de-mode.com/2009/11/17/1549-31-rue-cambon-le-magazine-chanel|title=31 Rue Cambon : le magazine Chanel - Tendances de Mode|website=www.tendances-de-mode.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://purple.fr/diary/the-new-chanel-magazine-31-rue-cambon-issue-3/|title=THE NEW CHANEL MAGAZINE, 31 RUE CAMBON, issue #3 - purple DIARY|date=2011-02-05|work=Purple|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a5892/olivier-zahm-made-a-corporate-mag-for-chanel-16120/|title=Olivier Zahm Made A 'Corporate Mag' for Chanel|date=2011-02-23|work=ELLE|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahm credited Lagerfeld for reigniting his sentiment for taking photos in 2005.  Zahm told WWD in an interview dedicated to Purple’s 25th Anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/eye/people/purple-reign-10970276/|title=Purple Reign|last=Foreman|first=Katya|date=2017-09-05|work=WWD|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“He (Lagerfeld) was buying these little digital cameras at the time, Sony Cyber-shots, a little pocket-size, flat, digital camera. He had a pile of them on his table and said: “Take this, if you’ll use it.” We had this long discussion about photography and I said, “Karl how can you want to be a photographer when you were friends with [[Helmut Newton]] because, me, I have [[Juergen Teller]] in my generation and I haven’t been able to do photography since I’ve known him, because he’s the best.” And he said: “Olivier, shut up. You don’t understand, photography is not about getting the right picture, it’s about documenting your everyday life. Remember [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], do you think he was a good photographer? He always had a camera on him. Do like Warhol, do like me: Don’t let a day go by without taking a picture.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/eye/people/purple-reign-10970276/|title=Purple Reign|last=Foreman|first=Katya|date=2017-09-05|work=WWD|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2009, he began documenting his late-night partying escapades in high-contrast black-and-white photographs which appeared on Purple Diary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/fashion-s-naughtiest-photographer-olivier-zahm|title=Fashion’s Naughtiest Photographer, Olivier Zahm|last=Jones|first=Justin|date=2014-09-09|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a notorious photo blog that would become the seed for a full Purple website.

According to the principle of "Parthian frontality", all figures, human or divine, face directly forward, with eyes fixed on the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dura-europos|title=DURA EUROPOS – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Parthian art''' was [[Persian art|Iranian art]] made during the [[Parthian Empire]] from 247 BC to 224 AD, based in the [[Near East]]. It has a mixture of Persian and [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] influences. For some time after the period of the Parthian Empire, art in its styles continued for some time. A typical feature of Parthian art is the frontality of the people shown. Even in narrative representations, the actors do not look at the object of their action, but at the viewer. These are features that anticipate the art of [[medieval Europe]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]].

Parthian sites are often overlooked in excavations, thus the state of research knowledge in Parthian art is not complete.  The excavations at [[Dura-Europos]] in the 20th century provided many new discoveries. The classical archaeologist and director of the excavations, [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], realized that the art of the first centuries AD from [[Palmyra]], Dura Europos, and also in Iran as far as the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of north India followed the same principles. He called this art style ''Parthian art''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rostovtzeff: ''Dura and the Problem of Parthian Art''&lt;/ref&gt;

What is now described as Parthian art since the end of the 19th century, was not known as such a century ago. [[Palmyra]] since that time has had numerous sculptures sent to Europe. They depict men and women in robes, richly decorated with numerous jewels, and often represent the ruins of a city often associated with romantic literary sources in conjunction with [[Queen Zenobia]]. However, no separate term was found here for the art created, but they were considered a local variant of [[Roman art]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The excavations at [[Dura Europos]] since inception and especially since the early decades of the 20th century have provided many new discoveries. The classical archaeologist and director of the excavations, Michael Rostovtzeff, realized that the art of the first centuries AD in Palmyra, Dura Europos, and also in [[Iran]] and its other territories followed the same principles. He labeled this art work as Parthian art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The widespread use of this art, even beyond the limits of Parthian empire, however, raised the question of whether this art was truly suitable to label Parthian, which is according to Schlumberger usually affirmed in research, as it was probably influenced by the art of the Parthian capital of [[Ctesiphon]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 73–75 (die Werke im Partherreich in hellenistischer Tradition ordnet er jedoch der griechischen Kunst zu)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the designation of artistic creation of the Parthian Empire and the affected areas in which the research is inconsistent and scrutinized. Authors often avoid the term Parthian art, preferring instead to name the art work on the cultural and political space. Daniel Schlumberger affirmed the notion of Parthian art in one of his most important works about the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Orient (in the original: ''L'Orient Hellénisé'', appeared in [[Germany]] in the World of Art series). However, the book covers not only Parthian art, but also [[Greek art]] in the Orient in general. Hans Erik Mathiesen titled his work ''the Parthian sculpture: Sculpture in the Parthian Empire'' in which he studies art from cities such as Palmyra. Likewise, Trudy S. Kawami called her work to ''Statues in Iran: Monumental Art of the Parthian period of Iran'', while [[Malcolm Colledge]] wrote his book ''Parthian art clearly as Parthian art'' to strictly define a designation of Parthian art.

The Parthian empire stretched over a vast area that was congruent mainly with the territory of present-day Iran and [[Iraq]], and many different tribes. It lasted for over 400 years. From these conditions, it is clear that strong regional differences in the art are expected and that there was a significant development over the centuries. Although there are numerous examples of Parthian art, including those of the royal court, that are well-preserved, there are holes in the examples through the centuries.  Much of the evidence comes from outside of Parthia, such as coins of [[Gondophares]], from about 50 AD found in India in Parthian style.
[[File:Gondophares.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Gondophares]], found in India in clear Parthian style]]

Parthian art is also present in Syria, in many cities such as Palmyra,&lt;ref&gt;M.A.R. Colledge: ''The Art of Palmyra.'' London 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edessa]] and Dura Europos. Not all of the specimens belonged specifically to the Parthians. In the north, this art seems to have flourished in [[Armenia]], although little remains. In the south, [[Bahrain]] clearly followed the Parthian art form, while in the east the transition to [[Gandhara]] art is gradual and therefore difficult to draw a clear line. In earlier research, which looked at the Greek art of [[Classical Greece]] as an ideal, Parthian art was often dismissed as decadent and barbaric art. Recent research, however, sees this differentiated. Parthian art had many creative and original methods and works, and was an influential form especially for [[Byzantine Art]] and [[Medieval art]].

The strong frontal orientation of Parthian art is unusual for the [[Middle East]] and new seems to be influenced by the presence of Greek art, which passed through the Orient since the 3rd century BC.  Parthian art can therefore be described as an oriental creation of the experience of Hellenistic art.

==Epochs==
[[File:Sarbaz Nysa.jpg|thumb|250px|A sculpted head (broken off from a larger statue) of a [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] soldier wearing a [[Hellenistic armies|Hellenistic-style helmet]], from the Parthian royal residence and necropolis of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan]], 2nd century BC]]
The art of Parthia can be roughly divided into two style epochs: A [[Greek art|Greek-style]] phase and a truly Parthian phase. These styles are not necessarily chronological phases following each other, but it can be viewed with strong chronological overlap. A Greek influenced city [[Seleucia]] on the [[Tigris]] was creating art in the Greek style much longer than the Eastern cities, such as [[Ecbatana]]. An example are the coins of [[Vonones I]] (6-12 AD), the specimens that were minted in Seleucia show a purely Greek style. The coins of the same ruler from Ecbatana show a style that is heavily distinguished away from Greek models.

===Hellenistic Phase===

At the beginning of their history, Parthian art was still very much influenced and likened to [[Greek art]]. Especially in the earliest Parthian capital of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nisa]] evidence could be discovered from the early Parthian period indicating the similarities to Greek culture. Most finds there date to the first three centuries BC. There were purely Greek marble sculptures and a series of ivory [[rhyton]]s in Hellenistic style with figuratively decorated designs.

The marble statues are on average 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm high. One of which is a similar depiction of winged [[Aphrodite]]. The lower part of the figure is made of dark stone, so that the marble body comes to a better focus. Another female figure wearing a chiton and an overlying peplos, the right shoulder is a shawl.&lt;ref&gt;Stawiskij: ''Die Völker Mittelasiens.'' S. 58, Fig. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Both statues were likely imported over, either in Hellenic conquests and colonization, or through trade. They are painted with the favorite Hellenistic colors of the then ruling kings there.

The ornamental bands of rhytons depict scenes from Greek mythology. The style of the figures is purely [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]], even if the characters are a bit rough and some topics from the Greek stories shown were apparently not always understood. Nisa and the province of Parthia, which holds the origins of the Parthian Empire, is adjacent to [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greek Bactria]] and is therefore presumed to have influenced the early Parthian artistic&lt;ref&gt;Colledge: ''The Parthians.'' S. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the Rhytha were made in Bactria and came to Nisa as loot.&lt;ref&gt;Stawiskij: ''Die Völker Mittelasiens.'' S. 59–60; Boardman: ''The Diffusion of Classical Art'', S. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture has major Greek influences, while some Iranian elements from the beginning are observable. The architectural decorations in Nisa are usually purely Greek. There were [[Ionia|Ionic]] and [[Corinth]]ian capitals with acanthus leaves. Nisa's battlements and fortifications, however, have their origin in a more Iranian fashion. The square house in Nisa is 38 x 38 meters in size and consists of a large courtyard which is decorated on all four sides by columns. Behind it are found on all four sides elongated rooms, on whose walls are benches. The building perhaps served as a royal treasury and was built of unbaked bricks. The builders were likely following contemporary fashions, recalling the construction of a Greek palaestrae.&lt;ref&gt;Stawiskij: ''Die Völker Mittelasiens.'' S. 52–55; Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Nisa appears as a colonial, Hellenistic Royal Court, which hardly differs from other contemporary Hellenistic residences. This is also evident to observe in [[Ai Khanoum]] where a royal residence of the Greek-Bactrian kingdom was excavated. Schlumberger desires that these examples, therefore, not be classified as Parthian.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mithradatesi.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I.]]]]
Without inscriptions and precise excavations of early Seleucid findings, Parthian buildings are often hard to distinguish. In [[Khurab]] in Iran today is a large mansion with Ionic and [[Dorian Pentapolis|Doric]] columns. The proportions of individual components (pillars seem to be long and thin) suggest that this house had no purely Greek architect. The exact date is therefore controversial.

This Hellenistic style of the early Parthian period was also used on the coins of the Parthian rulers. The earliest specimens are difficult to determine, but are certainly in the Greek style, even if the Parthian rulers carry attributes, which gives the coin an amalgamated appearance. Under [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]], who conquered large parts of the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]], the coins are barely distinguishable from those in the style of Hellenistic royal courts. It is also significant to note that the Parthians could mint only silver and copper coins, but no gold coins. The few known gold coins appear to have been influenced by local princes and prestigious properties in the Parthian sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;Veronique Schiltz: ''Tillya Tepe, Tomb I.'' In: Friedrik Hiebert, Pierre Cambon (Hrsg). ''Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul''. National Geographic, Washington, D.C. 2008, S. 292–293 Nr. 146, {{ISBN|978-1-4262-0295-7}} (Nachahmung in Gold einer Münze von [[Gotarzes I.]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parthian Phase===
The Greek style that may have continued to live on in the production of art in many places in the Parthian pre-Hellenistic traditions. In [[Assyria]] there were two pillars, which are held in such a Hellenic style. They each show a man standing in Parthian costume, however. The figure and the head are shown in profile and are thus in a [[Mesopotamia]]n tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' 190-191, Katalog Nr. 158, 159&lt;/ref&gt; A third stele shows a similar figure, now, however, with his face to the front.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' 191-92, Katalog Nr. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Parthian Empire various dating systems were in use at the same time and it is not known which of these stelae are dated to the correct era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 89–90, 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Frieze in the Temple of Bel Palmyra Syria.JPG|thumb|Relief on the Baal-Temple in Palmyra]]
In the year 31 AD, a stele dating from [[Dura Europos]], which shows the god [[Zeus]] [[Kyrios]] consecrating [[Seleucus I Nicator]] was erected. The head and the chest of Zeus Kyrios are shown frontally, but the legs come from the side.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' 27, 197&lt;/ref&gt;  The Temple of Bel Palmyra Baureliefs, which can safely be dated to the 1st century AD was founded on 6 April 32 AD, in a new style.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge: ''The Parthians.'' S. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The reliefs probably show myths, but their content is unknown from written sources, so that the representations can only be interpreted visually and thus remain incomprehensible. The figures are shown frontally, even in narrative representations of the characters as they turn to the viewer of the reliefs and not the other characters and figures in the scenes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The origin of frontality that characterized Palmyrene and Parthian arts is a controversial issue; while Parthian origin has been suggested (by [[Daniel Schlumberger]]),&lt;ref name="far562"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z51PhFgWoksC&amp;pg=PA69|title=Genres in Visual Representations: Proceedings of a Conference Held in 1986 by Invitation of the Werner-Reimers-Stiftung in Bad Homburg (Federal Republic of Germany)|author= L. P. Van Den Bosch|page= 69|year= 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Avi-Yonah]] contends that it was a local Syrian tradition that influenced Parthian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cKGpa-FJ3XsC&amp;pg=PA177|title= Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Diaspora|author=Rāḥēl Ḥa̱klîlî|page= 177|year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VologasesI.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Vologases I of Parthia|Vologases I]]]]
Therefore, it can be determined from around the 1st century in the Parthian Empire a new style, which is characterized mainly by severe frontal views of the figures, by a linearism and a hieratic representation, is observed.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge: ''The Parthians.'' S. 148; Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire'', S. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  This style veers away from earlier Greek models, includes but not directly to the pre-Hellenistic art, even though the hieratic and the linearism can also be found in the [[Art of the Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; This style seems to have originated in Mesopotamia, in particular [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name="far562" /&gt;

The best example of the emergence of a new style is in the contemporary coinage. The images of the Parthian kings are often highly stylized in the 1st century. Angular shapes replaced the round, flowing forms of the Greek style, at least more prevalently, on the profile on the coins. From about 50 BC on, Parthia [[Roman-Parthian Wars|saw frequent clashes]] with the Greco-oriented Rome. The new style is therefore perhaps a deliberate departure from the Hellenistic traditions and a return to their own traditions and values.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 10–11; Boardman: ''The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity'', S. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paintings==
[[File:Duraeuropa-1-.gif|thumb|Wall paintings from Dura Europos]]
Particularly pronounced in detail in Parthian art is the painted murals. Numerous examples are available in Dura Europos. Some examples are from [[Palmyra]] and [[Hatra]] and fragments of wall paintings have been found in [[Ashur]] and [[Babylon]]. Many of the murals come from temples and houses of worship. In the synagogue and the church of Dura Europos there are mainly scenes from the [[Bible]]. In Mitraeum there are scenes of the deity [[Mithras]]. In some temples of the city there are figures of donors and their family members prominently depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Maura K. Heyn: ''The Terentius Frieze in Context.'' In: Lisa R. Brody, Gail L. Hofman (Hrsg.): ''Dura Europos'', Boston 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-892850-16-4}}, S. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Residential buildings were much less likely to be painted in the Parthian world than in the Greco-Roman word. Here banquet and hunting scenes illustrate the life of the nobility and ruling class.

The figures are all shown facing frontally. While facing the frontal view in Hellenistic painting was one of many possibilities, it was now the general fashion in Parthian art. The figures are facing the viewer, and even in narrative representations one has the feeling that individual characters no longer interact with each other, but are only directed at the viewer. The perspective that it was in Greek style, has largely been disasserted. A certain space of the figures is only indicated by shading on individual parts of the body. The base line, which had played a significant role in Near Eastern art, began to have no meaning. The figures now seem often to float freely in space. At least the majority of the paintings at Dura Europos were commissioned by private donors.  They would have been represented on the temple walls with their family, with their names written next to the characters.

However, there are virtually no examples of figurative wall paintings from the early stages of Parthian art, as it was still under Greek influence. The beginning of Parthian style painting remains unknown for now. In Dura Europos the best purely Parthian examples were dated to the 1st century AD on temple walls.  One scene shows the offerings of Conon. It is among the earliest known Parthian paintings, and is one of the highest quality examples of Parthian art. It shows already all their stylistic features. Although the individual figures are arranged in a foreshortened architecture, with a few of them on the ground, most seem to float in space. All the figures are shown frontally.

Around the year 244 AD, the synagogue of Dura Europos, which was mostly painted with scenes from the [[Old Testament]] was completed. Individual scenes can be found in small panels reproduced, in turn, lining up the entire wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~tokerism/0040/images4/ar.96.03629.jpg|title=Wand in der Synagoge|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are a bit stockier than at other temples to Parthian gods, but show essentially the same style characteristics. They are represented usually frontally and often seem to float in space.

The well-preserved examples of Parthian paintings are mostly from temples and houses of worship. Secular paintings are not as well preserved, and are therefore less known and documented. A specialty among these seems to have been battle and hunting scenes that glorified the lifestyle of the ruling class. Especially prevalent was the motive of the rider. The horses are reproduced here in full gallop. The riders themselves are depicted sitting on them facing the viewer. In battle scenes, there usually are heavily armed [[Cataphracts]]; in hunting scenes there are more simply equipped archers. Remnants of such a riding scene were found in the palace of Assur and seem to have decorated the main rooms of the building. Other examples were found in the Mithraeum of Dura Europos.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge: ''The Parthians.'' Tafel. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  Such riding scenes, in a slightly modified form, would become particularly popular with the [[Sassanid art|Sassanids]].

==Sculptures==
[[File:Relief Palmyra Petit Palais ADUT01909.jpg|thumb|Grave relief of a woman in Palmyra]]

[[File:Parthian Queen Bust.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of a queen of goddess found in [[Susa]].]]
These style elements are also present in the sculptures of Parthian culture. Sculptures in limestone, marble and bronze, are usually designed head-on.&lt;ref&gt;siehe [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/05/wai/ho_51.72.1.htm Beispiel]&lt;/ref&gt; Even within group interaction among scenes figures are not observed participation, but instead completely oriented to the viewer.

Many examples of Parthian period sculpture found in [[Palmyra]], where the tombs of the local upper class were richly decorated, depict the lives of the deceased. There were somewhere between three types of monuments. Locking plates, blocking the entrance of grave installations;. Sarcophagi decorated on the actual coffin box and lying on the lid of the deceased, usually on the side shown at a banquet.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Few of these images give the impression of real portraits. The faces of the deceased seem stylized and glorified. Men and women are usually played back with the upper body and richly hung with jewels. Women usually wear Hellenistic clothing fashions while the men are depicted wearing traditionally Irananian clothing (especially pants).&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Palmyra stone sculptures are present, but were probably one cast in bronze. They decorated the streets of the city, however, they were later melted down. They were erected in honor of noble and wealthy citizens of the city. Many of the base inscriptions of these statues are preserved&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Statues honor deserving citizens are also attested in inscriptions from Parthian cities, but not all accounted for.:
::'' ...the people (honor) Soadu, son of Bolyada ... and he was honored by resolutions and still images from the boule and the people, and was at the time ... honored by the caravans and by individual citizens due to his repeated blessings with four statues on columns in Tertradeion at the public expense and with three other statues in Spasinou Charax and Vologesias''

Hatra in contrast, had numerous stone statues representing deities or local rulers and their family members. The local upper class donated the statues of the temples to the city, where they were found by the excavations. Many of these works are precisely dated by inscriptions of the donor and provide a good chronological framework.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' S. 71 (Liste datierter Skulpturen)&lt;/ref&gt; There is also sometimes even the mention of a sculptor's name, such as [[Aba (builder)|Aba]] or [[Schabaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aakkl.helsinki.fi/melammu/database/gen_html/a0000532.php|title=The Melammu Project|website=www.aakkl.helsinki.fi|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to works in the classical Greco-Hellenistic tradition (especially of classical deities) they show the people sitting or standing, facing front and dressed in Parthian fashion with rich regalia. The men wear shoes, pants and a tunic over it. Over the tunic some men wear a kind of jacket. Often you can see on the left side a dagger, a sword on his right hip. Kings wear a tiara with a diadem or tiara with the image of an eagle. The right hand is usually raised in a gesture of adoration to the top, the left hand holds a sword or a palm branch. Other statues carry in both hands a statue of God.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' S. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; There is striking attention to detail. The patterns of the substances, weapons and jewelry are reproduced exactly.

At [[Susa]] a marble woman's head was found ([[Tehran]], Iranian National Museum, Inv. No. 2452), which is one of the most famous works of art from the Parthian era. The head is proportionally slightly larger than real life. The face is broad with a long thin nose. The eyeballs are not modeled, but the pupil is indicated by a dot. The mouth is softly modeled with rather thin lips. The woman wears a heavy crown, on which the inscription: ''made by Antiochus, son of Dryas''. On the back, a veil is seen. The back of the statue as a whole worked summarily, indicating that the head was designed for the frontal view. She surely was once embedded in a separately crafted body.&lt;ref&gt;Kawami: ''Monumental art of the Parthian period in Iran.'' S. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; The high quality of the work sparked an extensive debate in the research of Parthian art. The modeling of the face is reminiscent of Hellenistic art. Also, the headgear is similar to Hellenistic styles, but other details are clearly Iranian.&lt;ref&gt;Kawami: ''Monumental art of the Parthian period in Iran.'' S. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it has been suggested that this is a work from the Greco-Roman world, which was reworked locally.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' S. 89, n. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous Parthian art work is [[Statue, National Museum of Iran 2401|the bronze statue of a local prince]] found in the Iranian province of Bachtiyārī at Shami. It was found by farmers in the remains of a small shrine of Greek gods and Seleucid kings, who eventually became the cult of the gods and also of past rulers. The statue is almost perfectly preserved, with only the hands missing. It is made of two parts and consists of the body and the head, which was carried out separately and fitted later. The prince is standing in Parthian clothes with a dagger on the side. He wears medium length hair and a mustache. He wears long trousers and a tunic that leaves his chest partially exposed. The figure is aligned in front, radiating power and authority, even if the head seems disproportionately small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/a/1/iran/parthian_prince.JPG|title=Bild des Kopfes|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Schlumberger remarks that there is certainly a specific type that would have dressed thus. Here is a typical Parthian nobleman, as can be seen in the details of the costume.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription at the base assigns it to a specific person. The dating is uncertain, ranging somewhere from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' S. 167 n. 11 (Liste diverser Datierungen)&lt;/ref&gt; The prince has not yet been identified, though, is often assumed to be [[Surenas]]. The high quality of the work sparked a lively debate about the place of manufacture. Theories range from Susa to an artist from Palmyra, who created the work on site.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' S. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these sculptures in a more oriental/Parthian style, there were remains in a more Hellenistic style. Many of these works were probably imported from the Roman Empire. Most works of art in Hatra were likely imported. Other sculptures in a more Hellenic style date from the time when the art in Parthia was strongly oriented to the Hellenistic art, or may even originate from the time of the Seleucid empire.

At [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], there is a statue of a goddess,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agefotostock.com/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/DAE-86013285|title=Mesopotamia, Parthian Iranian art, I-II century AD female figure in limestone|website=age fotostock|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which clearly originates in Hellenistic tradition. It is a 56&amp;nbsp;cm Kompositfigur from Marnor made of alabaster, plaster and bitumen.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelmina Van Ingen: Figurines from Seleucia on the Tigris: discovered by the expeditions conducted by the University of Michigan with the cooperation of the Toledo Museum of Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art, 1927-1932, Ann Arbor, Mich.: University of Michigan Press, 1939, S. 354, Br. 1652, Taf. 88, 644; A. Eggebrecht, W. Konrad, E. B. Pusch: ''Sumer, Assur, Babylon'', Mainz am Rhein 1978, {{ISBN|3-8053-0350-5}}, Nr. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The woman is wearing a chiton and a cloak over it. On her head there is a tiara.  Accurate dating of the work is almost impossible, but it was found in sections of the city by the excavators and is associated with the conquest of the city by the Roman emperor [[Trajan]] (116 AD). From the same town comes a bronze figure of [[Hercules]]. According to the inscription it comes from the Charakene (a part of the Parthian Empire) around 150 AD as booty in the city and there adorned the Temple of Apollo. The work is clearly Hellenistic, but it was in the Charakene for nearly 300 years before it came to Seleucia.&lt;ref&gt;Die Statue ist abgebildet in: Josef Wiesehöfer: ''Das antike Persien'', Zürich 1998, {{ISBN|3-491-96151-3}}, Taf. XVIb, c&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, there were Parthian demands to continue works of art in Hellenistic style.

==Reliefs==

[[File:Xong-e Ashdar Parthian relief.jpg|thumb|Relief of [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]]'s victory]]

There are essentially two different types of relief. There are carvings of a hand with a back plate that are very closely related technically and formally with complete sculptures. In addition, there are also flat reliefs, in which the figures are only a few centimeters carved into the stone. These reliefs are continuing Assyrian and Persian, or pre-Hellenistic, traditions and are visually similar to paintings. Here, as in the painting, there are narrative representations. The figures are mostly frontally facing the viewer. Especially in southwest present-day Iran, in ancient Elymais, many [[rock relief]]s were carved in open air sites in this style. Their execution is mostly rather coarse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/be-bm/behistun/behistun-rem.html|title=Behistun, other monuments - Livius|website=www.livius.org|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous reliefs is a scene with six men at Hung-i Nauruzi.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' S. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the figure, the main character is in frontal view in Parthian costume. To the right are three other men, though slightly smaller carved into the stone. On the left is a rider on a horse. The figure is shown in profile. Behind the rider is followed by another man, again in profile. The stylistic difference between the Hellenistic style portrayed in more riders and reproduced in the Parthian style in other characters led to the assumption that the four men were later carved into the rock on the right side. The rider probably represents a king, and has been identified as Mithridates I, who conquered Elymais in 140/139 BC when Parthian art was still largely Hellenistic. Accordingly, the relief is celebrating his victory. This interpretation has however been rejected and for the theory the rider is a local ruler of the Elymais.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge: ''Parthian art.'' S. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reliefs often show groups of men, single men, and also the figure of [[Heracles]].&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' S. 125–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally older reliefs are Hellenistic while newer are more Iranian-Parthian by fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen: ''Sculpture in the Parthian Empire.'' S. 130–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Assur temple.jpg|thumb|Parthian Temple in Assyria]]
[[File:Hatra ruins.jpg|thumb|Temple in [[Hatra]]]]
In architecture, there is a mixture of [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] and Oriental elements with new forms, especially as a remarkable new design with a large, open hall to a courtyard. This was usually arched. There is a structural unit which is not actually closed, but not fully open. Another peculiarity of the Parthian architecture is the alienation of classical building structures.

In Assyria, a Parthian palace modeled after Greek style is present, with a courtyard entrance&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' Fig. 39 auf S. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; although with some differences. At the center of the palace was a large courtyard, at each of the four sides was an arch. The facades of the courtyard were richly decorated with stucco.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' Fig. 40 auf S. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple of the Sun Mithras in Hatra resembles at first glance a mix of a Mesopotamian and Greco-Roman temple.  The kind of juxtaposition of certain classical structures however is Parthian. A Cella standing at a podium is surrounded on three sides by two rows of columns. The front is adorned by a staircase, which is flanked on the sides of the outer row of columns. The outer row of pillars standing on the base and is decorated with compositional chapters. The inner row of columns stands on the podium and has Ionic capitals. The pediment of the temple front shows a bow. The architraves and pediments are richly decorated with architectural decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Sommer: ''Hatra.'' S. 51–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar temple was found in Assyria, consisting of three consecutive rooms with the Blessed Sacrament as the last room. Around the temple columns are present, resembling a Greek temple. The fact that the columns are only on three sides, and that the front was not decorated with columns indicates a particularly Parthian fashion. In many Greek temples, columns would not be present on one side, but that would rarely be the entrance or front of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge: ''The Parthians.'' S. 126, Fig. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Other temples seem to be built more on ancient Eastern traditions. In the center of the temple complex of Hatra is a series of juxtaposed arches, with two main arches, flanked by several small rooms. There are also six smaller arches in the surrounding space. The complex is also on an elevated podium. The facade is divided by pilasters. It is again found with rich architectural decorations, especially sculptures of individuals, and also of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Sommer: ''Hatra.'' S. 63–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Uruk there still stands the temple of Gareus built entirely of burnt brick, with dimensions of about 10 meters long and 8 meters wide. The interior resembles Babylonian temples with a vestibule and a cella. Even the cult niche with an upstream panel is Babylonian. The facade of the building is decorated with blind arcades. In front of the building were six columns with Ionic capitals . Another architectural decoration consisted of eggs and lesbian bars Kymatien. A frieze depicts dragons and looks more oriental. Overall, we find here again a mixture of Hellenistic and Oriental influences.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 151–153, Figs. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The temples at Dura Europos are architecturally rather simple. There were several rooms arranged around a central courtyard. The 'Holy of Holies' was located mostly on the back of the unit and could be noted by columns at the entrance. The other rooms around the courtyard were used for banquets, as a priest's chamber, or as places of worship . The Blessed Sacrament was often painted magnificently.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Heyn: ''the Terentius Frieze in Context.'' In: Lisa R. Brody, Gail L. Hoffman (Hrsg.): ''Dura Europpos'', Boston 2011, S. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple in [[Palmyra]] appears Hellenistic-Roman at first sight and it is often only very small details that distinguish it from those of the Mediterranean world. Overall, the architecture of the city is more Roman-Syrian with a few idiosyncrasies that are typical Parthia . The Baal temple stands within a walled courtyard, which is decorated with columns and forms a Rhodian peristyle. The actual temple in the center of the complex is a peripteros Temple. Unusual, however, is that the main entrance has a staircase located on the long side of the temple and not on the short side. The roof of the temple is decorated with stepped battlements.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 80–84.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eggelin Tomb Tower Palmyra Syria.jpeg|thumb|Gravetower in Palmyra]]
In the necropolis of Palmyra there were several types of graves. There are architecturally complex grave towers, which are also present at Dura Europos on the [[Euphrates]], as well as at other places, but not in other parts of Syria. These are square buildings that were up to five floors high. The interior offered space for several hundred dead and was often richly decorated with sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Those tombs are a development of Semitic traditions and have no relation with Iranian architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.nl/books?id=OK15YW6BplwC&amp;pg=PA185|title=Acta Iranica|author= Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin|page= 185|year= 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Assur stuck.jpg|thumb|links|Example of Stucco Decoration]]
Abundant ornamental stucco architectural decoration were used in Parthian buildings, on the one hand continuing to Greek pattern, but also has its own new Parthian pattern. The stucco itself had been introduced by the Greeks, and soon found popularity in the region under the Parthians.  The stucco wall patterns can be found on patch columns and ornamental bands. The pillars of stucco are usually placed only on the wall and are purely ornamental elements. They have no support function and do not give the wall depth, as was common in Greco-Roman architecture. The pillars were usually composed of materials that were available locally. In Mesopotamia, therefore many buildings are built of brick, and also stucco. In contrast, Hatra and Palmyra limestone is the predominant material. Stucco here, however, is rarely witnessed. Arches were abundantly used in Parthian architecture, especially above halls.

==Terracotta==
There was a substantial number of terracotta figures and figurines made of this material at many Parthian sites. These can also be stylistically divided into two groups. There is on the one hand purely Greek or Greek influenced figures and on the other hand those in the Near East and later in the Parthian style. The Greek style figure of [[Herakles]] was immensely popular because it was equated with the Parthian Verethragna god.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge: ''The Parthians.'' S. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek fashions also were responsible for depictions of nude women, which was a largely Greek custom.  Parthian types are mainly clothed male figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minervamagazine.com/exc/iraq_10.html|title=diverse Terrakottafiguren in verschiedenen Stilen (unten)|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most major finds for Parthian terracotta was at Seleucia on the Tigris where multiple, extremely detailed figures were found. Astonishingly, there are both Greek and Oriental types present at the site, juxtaposing Parthian history in almost all eras in one spot. There is only another find like this in Susa, where similar discoveries were made.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 156; die Figuren sind vollständig publiziert in: Wilhelmina Van Ingen: ''Figurines from Seleucia on the Tigris: discovered by the expeditions conducted by the University of Michigan with the cooperation of the Toledo Museum of Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art, 1927-1932'', Ann Arbor, Mich.: University of Michigan Press, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Martinez-Sève: ''Les figurines de Suse. Réunion des musées nationaux.'' Paris 2002, {{ISBN|2-7118-4324-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frontal View Interpretation==
[[File:DuraSyn-I-O-Moses burning bush.jpg|thumb|Moses and the Burning Bush, found at the Synagogue of Dura Europos]]
The frontal view of the figures in paintings, sculptures, and relief is not an invention of the Parthians. In the ancient Near East the custom was to depict figures in the profile view, although the frontal view was always present to some degree, especially in sculpture. The frontal view of the flat was used in the ancient Near East to highlight certain figures. Daniel Schlumberger argues that these are always special figures which particular attention given to be perceived as larger than life and more important than other figures in the depiction. The figures, gods and heroes, depicted frontally were not simple copies of life in a different material, they were instead meant to be viewed by the observer as alive. They were virtually present.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of the ancient Near East, and also in archaic Greece, used only the frontal and profile view. Only classical Greek style introduced an intermediate step, especially the three-quarter view. Representations of the classical Greeks tried the illusion of life in all its forms. The characters are totally preoccupied with themselves and ignore the viewer. The frontal view is also found here, but is only one of many possibilities. Parthian art certainly took over the frontal view of Hellenistic art, but it appears the Parthians in their art again took recourse with the presence of the Ancient Orient. The Parthian art is not an illusion and tried to capture the fleeting nature of life. Rather, they tried to give the figures durability. They tried to capture the true content of life and not just the outer shell. The effect of such methods is often that the viewer feels transcended.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion and outlook==
In the 2nd century AD, the Parthian Empire had to contend with numerous internal and external enemies. The Romans marched several times through Mesopotamia and the [[Antonine Plague]] seems to have raged in Parthia . This crisis had an obvious negative impact on the production of art. While much of the better known Parthian art remained the same, because of its natural grandeur and transcendence, some are obvious symptoms of decline in the late 2nd century AD. The coin legends are barely legible. From Susa comes a relief badly sculpted and with figures out of proportion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almendron.com/arte/culturas/persa/ilustraciones/ilus_42.htm|title=Siete mil años de Arte Persa|website=www.almendron.com|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vologases VI .jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Vologases VI of Parthia|Vologases VI]]]]
By 226 AD the Parthian dynasty was eliminated and replaced by the [[Sassanids]]. In large parts of Mesopotamia and Persia Parthian art simply disappeared, although certain artistic traditions, such as stucco reliefs and riding scenes, continued under the Sassanids. In Syria, however, Parthian art style continued for some time since it did not come under Sassanid influence.  Only with the fall of these cities (Hatra shortly after 240, Dura Europos at 256, Palmyra at 272) did Parthian art disappears from view. In the Syrian and Armenian illuminations of the 6th to 10th century, however, many Parthian elements resurged that attest to a continued life of this style.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger: ''Der hellenisierte Orient.'' S. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically the stringent frontal view of Parthian art can be found in the art of [[Byzantium]] and the European [[Middle Ages]], so it can rightly be stated that Parthian art had influenced [[Christianity|Christian]] art for the next 1000 years. The architecture was much like that of the later Islamic world, with many arches and domes. In addition, the Parthian art also strongly beamed eastward and probably had a significant impact on [[Buddhist]] art and indirectly reached even as far as [[China]].

After the [[Second World War]] in 1945, issues surrounding wartime loss and compensation started to arise. Cultural valuables were taken from [[Germany]] and placed in the [[Soviet Union]]. Years later, at the break up of the [[USSR]], the said cultural valuables came to attention as the issue of ownership arose. Following, the debates between the [[Russian Duma]] and the [[Yeltsin]] government began, with the Duma focusing on compensation to Russia for wartime loss, and Yeltsin focusing on maintaining international relationships and agreements. Arising from the debate, were many struggles, but ultimately the enactment of the '''Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation'''.

==Background==
At the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945, in what some would argue as retaliation, and others as compensation for the massive loss of cultural property the [[Soviet Union]] suffered, cultural valuables (such as books, art, artifacts, etc.) were taken (stolen, or relocated) from [[Germany]]. Since the end of the War the existence of such valuables were kept secret, and their existence was denied. In total during [[World War II]], nearly thirty million Soviet people died as a result of prison camps, torture, starvation and cold blood murder. The [[USSR]] suffered a huge wartime loss, not only through cultural property but also by the deaths of millions of people. In 1991 when the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, and the rise of the [[Russian Federation]] began, mention of vast amounts of hidden cultural valuables came to light because the issue of ownership arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monten|first=Lina|title=Soviet World War II Trophy Art In Present Day Russia: The Events, The Law, and The Current Controversies|journal=Depual J. Art. &amp; Ent. Law|year=2004–2005|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
===Yeltsin in Favour of Restitution 1992===
In June 1992, a Decree of the [[Russian Government]] created what was called the State Commission for Restitution of Cultural Valuables, which was to decide issues related to restitution. However, the Commission did very little and was at a halt by June 1993, and then was later abolished by March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also, in 1992, there were many bilateral cultural agreements with a number of countries such as, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], Germany, [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Poland]], and the [[United Kingdom]] for mutual [[restitution]] of displaced cultural valuables; none of which were talked about in the [[Constitutional Court]] ruling in 1999 about the constitutionality of the Russian 1998 law, where international agreements were to be put above domestic laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, in June 1992 there was the only [[restitution]] of books to the west by Russia; there was 600 Dutch books that were returned to the [[Netherlands]]. But, this is only a small portion of the estimated 30,000 Dutch books that had arrived in the USSR. The idea of restitution did not last long, and soon turned into demands for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duma halts restitution 1994===
Starting in 1994, the idea of restitution had completely come to a stop, and the debates started about constructing a law on said cultural valuables. [[Duma]] deputies are responsible for the start of the debate by stating that there is lack of [[international laws]] and the inadequacy of domestic legislation to justify its refusal to permit further restitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came about when Duma deputies refused the return of French archives that were a part of a 1992 agreement. 
Demands for compensation from wartime loss and destruction started to arise from the Duma deputies, suggesting that other countries should be charged storage fees for what was held in Russia secretly for over 50 years; and further that the only possible restitution of cultural valuables that would occur to other nations was in exchange for Russian cultural valuables, because the deputies at this point were arguing that many of the plundered cultural valuables from Russia were being held across the ocean from the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, with the support of some legal specialists and Russian legislators argue that all the cultural valuables that were brought to [[Moscow]] under government orders were all done so legally. But, nevertheless there is the other side of the debate, which is also supported by the [[Yeltsin]] government, who argue for compromise and internationally appropriate solutions.

===Duma Proposes Law 1995 and 1996===
For six years the debate continued. In January 1995 a large international conference was held in [[New York City]] titled "Spoils of War", where the international context about the issues surrounding cultural valuables plundered or misplaced at the end of the Second World War came to light. Firstly, it was important to note that no allied agreement that was made ever stated that works of art or other cultural property could be used for compensation purposes. Efforts such as what was done by the British and the Americans, where they carried out an elaborate program of restitution to countries of origin were discussed. Stories such as the [[United States]] had returned over half a million cultural items to the Soviet Union, but Russians were not aware of this, were among many topics discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On an international level, legal concepts and precedents existed during the time of the plundering from Germany in 1945, such as the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]] of 1907. Specifically Article 56 of the Convention "forbids the seizure, damaging and destruction of property of educational and art institutions, … and articles of scientific and artistic value belonging to individuals and societies as well as to the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such international law did not stop [[Stalin]] from ordering the seizure of cultural valuables as compensatory reparations from Germany. However, Stalin's order is still followed by the Russian position 50 years later, as they would argue that these transfers (seizures) were carried out legally after the war as compensation. On the other side such a point of view is wrong because Russia is not in compliance with international law regarding the protection of cultural property. 
Despite the ongoing debate and Russia's failure to restitute cultural valuables to other [[Europe]]an countries, Russia had an interest in becoming a member of the [[Council of Europe]]. In order for Russia to become a member they had to sign a statement of intent in order to be admitted, which they did and gained admission in late 1995. Russia at this time agreed to negotiate claims for the return of cultural property to other European countries, and to return property that was transferred to Moscow in 1945, in a rapid manner. Surprisingly, nothing to this agreement ever occurred or was of any mention in the Russian press; and less than a year later in May 1996 the Duma passed the first reading of the proposed law nationalizing the spoils of war. The law emphasized compensation to Russia for wartime loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin's Position, July 1996===
It was not long after, in early July 1996, the law was passed almost unanimously, making other European counties very hostile about the law. The passage started a slew of diplomatic protests, and as a result the Russian Upper House, the [[Council of the Federation]], rejected the law strongly because of the outcry from the Yeltsin administration. [[Boris Yeltsin]], president of the [[Russian Federation]] at the time, and his administration stood strong behind this argument for rejecting the law on the basis that it would conflict with numerous international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duma Passes Law, March 1997===
Nevertheless, the law continued to gain support from other nationalist-oriented parties, and the push for the passage of the law continued. The chair of the Duma Committee on Culture, [[Nikolai Gubenko]], continued to stress that the law was a must, on the basis that all the cultural property that was transported to what was the Soviet Union was all done so legally according to allied agreements, and that the law is way of providing justice to the loved ones, nearly 30 million, that are no longer with us due to the horrific outcomes of the war. With more gained support, and a slightly revised law, the Duma again almost unanimously passed the law on February 5, 1997, and was further passed by the upper house, the Council of Federation on March 5, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin Vetoes the Law, March 1997===
Sticking to what he believed, and despite the ongoing support for the law, President Yeltsin [[vetoed]] the law on March 18, 1997. Making his position clear in his official message to the Duma, Yeltsin stood firm that the law was in contradiction of the Constitution. Further Yeltsin pointed out that the law went against Russian bilateral agreements with other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional Court ruling==
Notwithstanding the President's power to veto the law, the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, with a vote of 141 to 37 in favor of the law on May 14, 1997. Regardless of the fact that the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, he still refused to sign the law, and further cited allegations of voting irregularities; and repeated his position that the law conflicted Russia's international legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
President Yeltsin was forced to sign the law by the [[Constitutional Court]] in a decision on April 6, 1998. The Constitutional Court ruled that they were unable to consider the constitutionality of the law before the President signed it. So, on April 15, 1998, President Yeltsin signed the law making it officially Federal Law. The Law did return to Constitutional Court in 1999 for review on the basis of unconstitutionality, contradiction of Russia's international legal obligation and alleged irregular voting practices. The ruling of July 20, 1999 did rule in fact that parts of the law were unconstitutional and that parts of the voting process were violated; but despite these findings the law was still validated and found not in conflict with the Constitution. The ruling further stated that the cultural valuables that were relocated to now what is known as Russia at the end of the Second World War should not be returned to the former aggressor countries and should remain in Russia as a form of compensation. The law was sent back to the Duma for amendments to be made in November 1999, and then finally May 25th, 2000, the Federal Law received the Presidential signature from the then President [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The law==
The Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of World War II and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation consists of six Chapters and twenty-five Articles. The Law is aimed at governing cultural valuables displaced to know what is known as Russia. The fundamental goals of the Federal Law are "to protect said valuables from misappropriation and prevent their illegal export beyond the borders of the Russian Federation as well as their unlawful transfer to whomsoever; to establish the necessary legal bases for treating said cultural valuables as partial compensation for the damage caused to the cultural property of the Russian Federation as a result of the plunder and destruction of its cultural valuables by Germany and its war allies during World War II; to protect the interests of the Russian Federation in the settlement of disputed issues with foreign states concerning said cultural valuables through consistent compliance with the principle of mutuality; to provide a possibility for acquainting citizens of the Russian Federation and foreign citizens, including specialists in the fields of education, science and culture, with said cultural valuables; and to create favorable conditions for the continuous development of international cooperation in the fields of education, science and culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Documentation Project|url=http://docproj.loyola.edu/rlaw/r2.html|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International criticism==
The Law enacted by the Russian Federation on displaced cultural valuables, has been nothing but been criticized on an international level. A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] specialist cited a large number of issues on how the Russian law violates international law and treaties. But more specifically, emphasized that Hungary is entitled to the restitution of Hungarian property removed to the USSR as a result of the Second World War. Further, similar feelings were expressed by a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] specialist, who argues that [[Ukraine]] and other former Soviet republics should have a say in determining the fate of their cultural valuables, on the basis of international norms and democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A specific criticism of the law is the notion of a limitation period. This is the idea that a claim must be made within 18 months of the information about a specific cultural valuable is published in an appropriate federal agency publication. This strikes a lot of concerns because who decides and what is an adequate publication, and after the 18 months what happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2009, a Ministry of Culture legal specialist wrote that the passage of the law "would appear as a unilateral Russian rejection of its international obligations and evoke a negative impact on international relations of the Russian Federation with various European governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Recently, in June 2013, news reports illustrate that the controversy about the appropriation of German artefacts by the USSR, is still on going between Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] and Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]]. During a visit in [[St-Petersburg]], Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, criticized an exhibition at the [[Hermitage Museum]] that contained a number of valuables that were stolen from Germany. President Putin declared that the issue is very sensitive and that both sides would continue to talk to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merkel and Putin view exhibition of disputed art|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23001274|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Salmon Cycle Marker''''' is a 2005 sculpture by Ken MacKintosh and Lillian Pitt, installed outside [[Portland State University]]'s [[Native American Student and Community Center]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Salmon Cycle Marker, (sculpture)|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:siris_ari_368922?q=record_ID%3Asiris_ari_368922&amp;record=1&amp;hlterm=record_ID%3Asiris_ari_368922|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and history==
[[File:PSU campus, 2017 - 04.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque for the sculpture, 2018]]

''Salmon Cycle Marker'' is installed at the intersection of Southwest Broadway and Jackson, just west of the Native American Student and Community Center on the [[Portland State University]] campus. The abstract sculpture, made of wood, bronze, and stainless steel, depicts salmon in the [[Columbia River Gorge]], and their journey from birth to spawning.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; Its pole is made from three trees that fell during the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]]. Images of salmon eggs appear at the base.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The middle of the pole shows an image of Pitt's ''She Who Watches''. MacKintosh's depiction of two salmon mating, as well as an abstract image of a salmon, appear at the top of the pole.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; According to Portland State University, the work is inspired by totem poles, and serves as a metaphor of "regional symbolism".&lt;ref name="PSU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art on the PSU Campus: Tour Narrative|url=https://www.pdx.edu/pcre/sites/www.pdx.edu.pcre/files/Art_Tour_Narrative_6_25_15.pdf|publisher=[[Portland State University]]|accessdate=April 28, 2018|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture has been included in at least one published walking tour of Portland.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Sybilla Avery|title=Walking Portland, Oregon|date=April 2, 2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvPWSWqzCT0C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symphony No. 4 in G minor''', Op. 167, was composed by [[Joachim Raff]] in the spring and summer of 1871, during the time of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The work was published in October 1872. Like his [[Symphony No. 2 (Raff)|Second Symphony]], it does not carry a descriptive title and there is no evidence that Raff had a particular programme in mind when he wrote the symphony.&lt;ref name="Leichtling2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Leichtling|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Raff)|Third Symphony]] and the opera ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Dame Kobold|de}}'', the orchestras were eager to perform Raff's new symphony. It received its premiere on 8 February 1872 in a concert at the Royal Hoftheatre in [[Wiesbaden]], conducted by [[Wilhelm Jahn]],&lt;ref name="Leichtling2005" /&gt; followed by more performances later that year. On 25 October it was performed in [[Frankfurt]] under the baton of Karl Müller and six days later it was performed at the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus]] conducted by Raff.&lt;ref name="Leichtling2005" /&gt; The work was also performed in [[Brussels]] in February 1873 conducted by [[Henri Vieuxtemps]].&lt;ref name="Leichtling2005" /&gt;

Despite its success, the work was overshadowed by Raff's [[Symphony No. 5 (Raff)|Fifth Symphony]], which ultimately became his most successful symphony during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Leichtling2005" /&gt;

==Instrumentation==

The symphony is scored for 2 [[flute|flutes]], 2 [[clarinet|clarinets]], 2 [[bassoon|bassoons]], 4 [[french horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet|trumpets]], [[triangle]] and [[string instrument|strings]].

==Structure==

The work is structured in the traditional symphony form of four movements:

#''Allegro'' ([[G minor]])
#''Allegro molto'' ([[E-flat major]])
#''Andante, non troppo mosso'' ([[C minor]])
#''Allegro'' (G minor)

A typical performance lasts for about 30-35 minutes.

A '''talent show''' is an event in which participants [[performing arts|perform the arts]] of [[singing]], [[dancing]], [[lip sync|lip-syncing]], [[acting]], [[martial arts]], playing an [[musical instrument|instrument]], or other activities to showcase [[skill]]s. Many talent shows are performances rather than contests, but some are actual contests. In the instance of a contest, participants may be motivated to perform for a reward, trophy, or prize of some kind. For example, a [[high school]] might not have many students with any interest in performing in front of the student body for the sole purpose of performing alone and may offer different prizes as an incentive for these students to participate in the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parke |first=Beverly N. |title=Discovering Programs for Talent Development |year=2003 |publisher=Corwin Press |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |isbn=978-0-7619-4613-7|pages=131–32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71ysy1gOEcMC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22talent%20shows%22&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

Since the late 1980s, talent shows have become a notable genre of [[reality television]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Redden|first=Guy|title=Exposing Lifestyle Television: The Big Reveal|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4094-9286-3|pages=129–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YNJN-tolIwEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22talent+show%22&amp;ots=I7uqlYNPUs&amp;sig=jQ6A2VBPiX_e2DB63bJI0mzSx4o#v=onepage&amp;q=%22talent%20show%22&amp;f=false|chapter=Making Over the Talent Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Notun Kuri]]'' (1976), ''[[Popstars]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Academy]]'' (2001), [[Idols (TV series)|''Idol'']] (2001), ''[[The X Factor]]'' (2004), ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'' (2005), ''[[Got Talent]]'' (2006), ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'' (2010), ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' (2013), ''[[Tri Akkorda (Russian Talent Show)]] (2014)'' and ''[[The Four: Battle for Stardom]] (''2018'')'', which have been critical in catapulting some amateur artists to stardom and resulting in their commercially successful careers.

==Non-competitive talent shows for troubled youths==
Talent shows can be seen as a way to help boost the self-esteem, confidence, and assurance of youth. Some communities and companies see talent shows as a way to help prevent [[juvenile delinquency]] among children, teens, and young adults. As a result, these communities create programs such as ''Girls Only!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only! Toolkit|url=http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|website=San Diego District Attorney's Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528165206/http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[San Diego]] to promote the growth of these otherwise trouble youth to better the community. Such programs are created with the hope to prevent youth from the possibilities of entering delinquency or lives of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only!

'''''The Dance II''''' by [[Henri Matisse]] is a [[triptych]] [[mural]] (15 ft high by 45 ft long) in the [[Barnes Foundation]]. It was created in 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/05/16/whats-so-special-about-the-barnes-collection/ ''New Barnes Building Opens, Why People are Upset'']&lt;/ref&gt; at the request of [[Albert C. Barnes]] after he met Matisse in the United  States. Barnes was an art enthusiast and long-time collector of Matisse's works, and agreed to pay Matisse a total of $30,000 for the mural, which was expected to take a year.&lt;ref name=flam&gt;Flam, Jack, ''Matisse: The Dance'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural was to be placed above three arches spanning the windows of the main hall of Barnes' gallery. In Nice, France, Matisse executed the mural on canvas provided by Barnes, as opposed to working on site. This was an unusual approach for such a work, but the patron had offered him complete artistic freedom, and working onsite would in any event have been impractical. 

For Matisse, the project proved to be beset with difficulties, and would end up taking him two years, leaving him physically and emotionally drained. He was also profoundly disappointed to be told on installation that Barnes had no intention of exhibiting the work to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master'', Penguin Books, London, 2006 at 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Matisse was delighted with the work itself. In a 1933 letter to his son, Matisse wrote about the installation at the Barnes Foundation: "It has a splendour that one can't imagine unless one sees it -- because both the whole ceiling and its arched vaults come alive through radiation and the main effect continues right down to the floor...I am profoundly tired but very pleased. When I saw the canvas put in place, it was detached from me and became part of the building."&lt;ref name=flam/&gt;

Some commentators consider that ''The Dance II'' mural was pivotal in enabling Matisse to return to the most essential sources of his art.&lt;ref name=flam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Y-A, “The Shift”, in Turner and Benjamin, eds, Matisse, Brisbane: QAG 1995 at 98&lt;/ref&gt; For Matisse, the work highlighted aspects such as simplicity, flattening, the emphasis on colour and the use of paper cut-outs which would all go on to play an important role in his later artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;"Strange encounters", in www.artinsociety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damage during world tour==
During a 1993 hearing in the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Orphan's Court art conservator Paul R. Himmelstein argued that ''The Dance II'' suffered significant damages during a controversial world tour of highlights from the Barnes Foundation's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Art Held Hostage: The Battle Over the Barnes Collection|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fault in Our Stars''''' is a 2014 American [[Romance film|romantic]] [[Tragedy|tragedy film]]&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2014/06/04/the-fault-in-our-stars-glows-with-teen-tragedy/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailydot.com/via/real-tragedy-fault-in-our-stars/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2012/01/17/145343351/the-fault-in-our-stars-love-in-a-time-of-cancer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/19840005/TRAGIC_ROMANCE_IN_THE_FAULT_IN_OUR_STARS_BY_JOHN_GREEN&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Josh Boone (director)|Josh Boone]], based on [[The Fault in Our Stars|the 2012 novel of the same name]] by [[John Green (author)|John Green]]. The film stars [[Shailene Woodley]], [[Ansel Elgort]], [[Laura Dern]], [[Sam Trammell]], [[Nat Wolff]], and [[Willem Dafoe]] playing supporting roles. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she meets and subsequently falls in love with Augustus Waters, another cancer patient, played by Elgort.

Development of ''The Fault in Our Stars'' began in January 2012 when [[Fox 2000]], a division of [[20th Century Fox]], optioned the rights to adapt the novel into a feature film. Principal photography began on August 26, 2013, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with a few additional days in Amsterdam,  The Netherlands, before concluding on October 16, 2013. Pittsburgh doubled for all of the scenes set in Indianapolis, Indiana, the novel's setting, as well as for some interior scenes set in Amsterdam.

''The Fault in Our Stars'' was released in the United States on June 6, 2014, to positive critical reception, with praise given to Woodley's and Elgort's performances as well as the screenplay. The film was also a blockbuster, becoming number one at the box office during its opening weekend, and grossing over $307 million worldwide against a budget of $12 million. It was released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on September 16, 2014, and grossed over $42 million in total domestic video sales.&lt;ref name="The Numbers"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fault in Our Stars (2014)|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fault-in-Our-Stars-The#tab=summary|website=The Numbers.|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC.|accessdate=10 August 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918191530/http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fault-in-Our-Stars-The | archivedate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazel Grace Lancaster is a teenager living in Indianapolis,  who has terminal [[thyroid cancer]] that has spread to her lungs. Believing she is depressed, her mother Frannie urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient [[support group]] to help her make friends with individuals who are going through the same thing. There Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a charming teenager who lost a leg to [[osteosarcoma|bone cancer]] but has since apparently been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite books. Hazel recommends ''An Imperial Affliction'', a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel ''Counter Insurgence''. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten ([[Willem Dafoe]]), retreated to [[Amsterdam]] following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.

Weeks later, Augustus tells Hazel he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and has corresponded with Van Houten by email. She writes to him to find out more about the novel's ambiguous ending. Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie kindly refuses because of financial and medical constraints. Augustus suggests that she use the "cancer wish" she received from [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] but Hazel explains that she has already used hers to visit [[Walt Disney World]]. Augustus and Hazel go on a picnic date and begin to fall in love. Augustus surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam. After a medical setback, Hazel's doctors eventually agree to allow the trip, since they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all.

Hazel and Augustus arrive in Amsterdam and are presented with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers to a piece of fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the [[Anne Frank House]], where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.

After their return to [[Indianapolis]], Augustus' health worsens. He is taken to the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything, since he "gave me a forever within the numbered days." Augustus dies eight days later and Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. He tells her that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. Van Houten tells her that the novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from [[leukemia]] at a young age. He gives Hazel a piece of paper which she crumples up asking him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads his words accepting his death and about his love for her. She lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says: "Okay."

In Amsterdam, three days of filming took place. Woodley and Elgort were filmed on a canal-side public bench. On July 2, 2014, ''The Guardian'' reported that the bench had gone missing, and city officials said they did not know where it was. Amsterdam city spokesman, Stephan van der Hoek said: "It's a bit embarrassing, because we do keep good track of them, but it's gone all right".

Author John Green, though an Indianapolis native, was pleased with the selection of Pittsburgh for filming. He commented that&lt;blockquote&gt; Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You kind of have to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though it has a lot of hills, it can be Indianapolis. We just have to find a couple of flat streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Best-of-the-Burgh-Blogs/The-412/October-2013/QA-The-Fault-in-Our-Stars-Author-John-Green/#sthash.CQwZmVIp.dpuf|title=Q+A: 'The Fault in Our Stars' Author John Green|work=pittsburghmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing for [[Catholic News Agency]], [[Robert Barron (priest)|Robert Barron]] said:&lt;blockquote&gt; I don’t think it is the least bit accidental that Waters (Gus’s last name) and Grace (Hazel’s middle name) met in the sacred heart of Christ and thereby, despite their shared suffering, managed to give life to one another&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;[and so] Hazel effectively repudiates her nihilism and materialism as she responds across the barrier of death to Gus’s 'okay'{{space}}."

==Hindi remake==
{{Main article|Kizie Aur Manny}}

'''''The Lunch''''' is a very early painting by Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]], finished c. 1617. The work, an oil painting on canvas, is in the [[Hermitage Museum]] of [[Saint Petersburg]].

The painting portrays a table covered by a creased cloth, on which lie two [[pomegranate]]s and a piece of bread. People attending the lunch include an aged man on the left and a young man on the right, while, in the background, an apparently carefree boy pours wine into a  jug.

On the wall in the background hang a white neck-band, a leather bag and, on the right, a sword.

''The Lunch'' is nearly identical to another painting by Velázquez, ''[[The Farmers' Lunch]]'' (1618).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">The '''World Crafts Council AISBL (WCC-AISBL)''' is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that was founded in 1964 to promote fellowship, foster economic development through income generating craft related activities, organize exchange programs, workshops, conferences, seminars, and exhibitions—and in general, to offer encouragement, help, and advice to the craftspersons of the world. The organization is now formally registered in Belgium as an international organization and ''AISBL'' is there the french shortcut for an ''international [[association without lucrative purpose]]''. The WCC is organised into five regions: Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The organization is affiliated to [[UNESCO]].

The WCC was founded in 1964 by [[Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay|Kamaladevi Chattopadhay]] and [[Aileen Osborn Webb]] (who had founded the [[American Craft Council]] in 1943.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://craftvic.org.au/resources/craft-culture/2002/global-peace-through-craft-the-formation-of-the-world-crafts-council ''Global Peace Through Craft: The Formation of the World Crafts Council'', By Sandra Alfoldy], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The WCC (Europe) meets once a year and the 2011 meeting was held in [[Dublin, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture360.org/event/dublin-world-crafts-council-europe-conference/ ''Dublin: World Crafts Council Europe conference'', by Judith Staines], 17 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the General Assembly occurred in [[Chennai]] when [http://www.kaivalam.com/ Usha Krishna] was the President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaivalam.com ''Kaivalam''] Kaivalam Craft Summit&lt;/ref&gt; After this General Assembly the Presidency will move from India to China. Mr. Wang Shan was the president, Ms. Jing Chen was the Secretary General. In 2014, WCC Golden Jubliee Celebration Summit was held in Dongyang, China, more than 2000 craftpeople from 63 countries participated. In 2016, the General Assembly occurred in [[Isfahan, Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://isfwcc.ir/wcc18th/Introduction.aspx , ''The 18th General Assembly of the World Crafts Council Isfahan''], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; from September 22 to 29.

[[File:Zeami.png|thumb|A wooden statue of Zeami]]
{{Nihongo|'''Zeami Motokiyo'''|世阿弥 元清}} (c. 1363&amp;nbsp;– c. 1443), also called {{Nihongo|'''Kanze Motokiyo'''|観世 元清}}, was a Japanese [[Aesthetics|aesthetician]], actor, and playwright. His father, [[Kan'ami]], introduced him to [[Noh]] theater performance at a young age, and found that he was a skilled actor. Kan'ami was also skilled in acting and formed a family theater ensemble. As it grew in popularity, Zeami had the opportunity to perform in front of the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Shōgun]], [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]]. The Shōgun was impressed by the young actor and began to compose a friendship with him. Zeami was introduced to Yoshimitsu's court and was provided with an education in classical literature and philosophy while continuing to act. In 1374, Zeami received patronage and made acting his career. After the death of his father in 1385, he led the family troupe, a role in which he found greater success.

Zeami mixed a variety of Classical and Modern themes in his writing, and made use of Japanese and Chinese traditions. He incorporated numerous themes of [[Zen]] Buddhism into his works and later commentators have debated the extent of his personal interest in Zen. The exact number of plays that he wrote is unknown, but is likely to be between 30 and 50. He wrote many treatises about Noh, discussing the philosophy of performance. These treatises are the oldest known works on the philosophy of drama in Japanese literature, but did not see popular circulation until the 20th-century.

After the death of Yoshimitsu, his successor [[Ashikaga Yoshimochi]] was less favorable to Zeami's drama. Zeami successfully sought out patronage from wealthy merchants and continued his career under their support. He became well-known and well-respected in Japanese society. [[Ashikaga Yoshinori]] became hostile toward Zeami after becoming Shōgun in 1429. Yoshinori held Zeami's nephew Onnami in high regard, and disagreed with Zeami's refusal to declare Onnami his successor as leader of his troupe. Possibly due to this disagreement, though a variety of competing theories have been advanced, Yoshinori sent Zeami into exile to [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]]. After Yoshinori's death in 1441, Zeami returned to mainland Japan, where he died in 1443.

==Early life==
Zeami was born in 1363&lt;ref name=h96p14/&gt; in [[Nagoya]]&lt;ref name=h96p15/&gt; and was known as Kiyomota as a child.&lt;ref name=h96p14&gt;Hare 1996, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was the daughter of a priest and a Fief Lord.&lt;ref name=h96p15&gt;Hare 1996, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; His father Kanami led a theater troupe&lt;ref name=h96p14/&gt; which primarily performed in the [[Kyoto]] region,&lt;ref name=h96p12&gt;Hare 1996, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming popular in the late 1360s and early 1370s. As they became better-known, Kanami's troupe began to perform in Daijogi.&lt;ref name=h96p16/&gt; Zeami acted in the troupe and was considered attractive and highly skilled.&lt;ref name=h96p18&gt;Hare 1996, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebina no Naami, an adviser of the Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, booked the troupe to perform for the Shōgun, who was then 17 years old.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; The shōgun was very powerful politically and was a patron of the arts.&lt;ref name=rxviii/&gt; He was impressed by the troupe, and patronized Kanami. The troupe began to focus on the entertainment value of performance, rather than its religious significance. It had been a form of entertainment associated with the country, but with Yoshimitsu's support it became associated with the upper class.&lt;ref name=h96p13&gt;Hare 1996, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The Shōgun was highly attracted to Zeami, which proved controversial among aristocrats because of Zeami's lower-class background.&lt;ref name=h96p16&gt;Hare 1996, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshimitsu regularly invited Kanami and Zeami to the court, and Zeami accompanied him to events.&lt;ref name=w43&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his connection with the Shōgun, Zeami was provided with a classical education by court statesman and poet Nijo Yoshimoto.&lt;ref name=h96p17&gt;Hare 1996, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Nijo was renowned for his skill as a [[Renga]] and taught Zeami about Literature, Poetry, and Philosophy. This type of education was very unusual for an actor: due to their lower-class backgrounds, actors received little education.&lt;ref name=rxviii/&gt;

==Career==
Zeami received patronage in 1374, which was then an uncommon honor for an actor.&lt;ref name=h96p17/&gt; Patronage allowed him to become a vocational artist&lt;ref name=h96p11&gt;Hare 1996, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and he began to lead the troupe after his father's death in 1385. The troupe became successful during his tenure as a leader.&lt;ref name=h96p21&gt;Hare 1996, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; While leading the troupe, he wrote the first Japanese treatises on pragmatic aesthetics.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt;

Zeami adhered to a [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] writing process: he began with a topic, determined the structure, and finished by writing the lyrics. The number of plays that he wrote is uncertain, but numbers at least 30. His intellectual interests were eclectic&lt;ref name=h96p11/&gt; and he was a proficient writer of Renga.&lt;ref name=h96p19&gt;Hare 1996, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' was the source of several of his best known plays.&lt;ref name=w153&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; He integrated Japanese and Chinese ancient poetry into his drama.&lt;ref name=w18&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary dramatists Doami and Zoami had a significant influence on him,&lt;ref name=h96p30/&gt; earning recognition in his treatises. He spoke particularly well of Zoami,&lt;ref name=rxviii/&gt; but his shift toward Yugen and away from Monomane may have been because of Doami's influence.&lt;ref name=h96p31&gt;Hare 1996, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He mixed popular dance, drama, and music with classical poetics and thus broadened and popularized the classical tradition.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; In his earlier work, he used Zen illustrations, creating new Zen words and using established Zen words out of context. Many of the themes he used are present in other schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=h96p31/&gt; Japan was dominated by a focus on Zen culture then, and he was registered at a Zen temple&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; and was a friend of a well-known Zen priest.&lt;ref name=h96p31/&gt; In 1422, he became a lay monk.&lt;ref name=w45&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important performances of Zeami's career occurred in 1394. At that time, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu visited the [[Kasuga-taisha|Kasuga shrine]] in [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]] and Zeami performed during the visit.&lt;ref name=h96p22&gt;Hare 1996, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; It was a significant political event, so Zeami was likely a well known artist then. He gave two significant performances for the Shōgun in 1399,&lt;ref name=h96p23&gt;Hare 1996, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; one of which could have been attended by [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]].&lt;ref name=h96p25&gt;Hare 1996, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeami found Yoshimitsu to be a difficult patron,&lt;ref name=h96p25/&gt; and was rivaled by Inuo, a [[Sarugaku]] actor, for the favor of the Shōgun.&lt;ref name=h96p26/&gt; Though Yoshimitsu died in 1408,&lt;ref name=h96p26&gt;Hare 1996, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and new Shōgun, Yoshimochi, was indifferent to Zeami&lt;ref name=rxix&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; and preferred the [[dengaku]] work of Zoami,&lt;ref name=rxviii/&gt; Zeami's career remained strong&lt;ref name=h96p28/&gt; due to his connections with the urban commercial class. Due to his status as a well respected public figure, he had access to a number of patrons.&lt;ref name=h96p28&gt;Hare 1996, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually reached the stature of a celebrity&lt;ref name=rxviii&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a significant amount between 1418 and 1428.&lt;ref name=h96p28/&gt;

==Plays==
Authorship of noh plays is a complex issue and often a matter of debate. Many plays have been attributed to Zeami, and he was known to be involved in revising and transmitting many others. But some plays are decisively known to have been written by him. The following are universally attributed to Zeami:&lt;ref name=Tyler92&gt;Tyler 1992, plays introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

* Akoya no Matsu, currently not in the noh repertoire
* [[Atsumori (play)|Atsumori]]
* Hanjo
* [[Izutsu]], probably written in the late 1420s or early 1430s
* Kinuta, probably written in the early 1430s
* [[Matsukaze]], using a section by [[Kan'ami]]
* Saigyo Zakura
* [[Sekidera Komachi]]
* Tadanori
* [[Takasago (play)|Takasago]]
* [[Yamanba (Noh play)|Yamamba]]
* Yashima

==Treatises==
Zeami produced 21 critical writings over a period of roughly four decades.&lt;ref name=q1/&gt; His treatises discuss the principles of Noh. He sought to inform his colleagues of the most important aspects of theater, discussing character acting, music, and physical movement.&lt;ref name=rxvii&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; They also discussed broader themes, such as how life should be lived.&lt;ref name=w15&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The treatises were intended for a small circle of his colleagues, since the troupes were hereditary and such information was traditionally passed down between generations. He desired to facilitate this process&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt; to ensure continued patronage for the troupe.&lt;ref name=rxx/&gt;

===Fūshikaden===
Zeami wrote several treatises on drama, the first of which was the {{Nihongo||風姿花伝|Fūshikaden|"The Transmission of the Flower Through (a Mastery of) the Forms", more loosely "Style and the Flower"}}, known colloquially as {{Nihongo||花伝書|Kadensho|"The Book of Transmission of the Flower"}}. It is the first known treatise on drama in Japan;&lt;ref name=h96p23/&gt; though similar treatises were written by Japanese Buddhist sects and poets, this is the Noh treatise. [[J. Thomas Rimer]] suggests that Zeami's education in Renga poetry provided him with the idea.&lt;ref name=rxx&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; It notably includes a thorough analysis of [[jo-ha-kyū]], which Zeami viewed as a universal concept. His first treatise includes much of his father's views of Noh.&lt;ref name=h96p23/&gt;

===Kakyo===
The treatise ''Kakyo'' was written later and describes Zeami's personal views. Though ''Fushikaden'' discusses flowers at length, ''Kakyo'' deals with spiritual beauty and contains discourses on the voice of the actor and the actors' minds.&lt;ref name=h96p30&gt;Hare 1996, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; A possible interest in Zen has been credited with this shift by some scholars.&lt;ref name=h96p31/&gt; The change in his age between his first and last works also appears to have significantly affected his perspective.&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; He spent a significant amount of time writing ''Kakyo'' and gave the completed work to his son Motomasa,&lt;ref name=h96p29&gt;Hare 1996, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Zeami's son Motoyoshi had previously transcribed Zeami's treatise ''Reflections on Art''.&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt;

==Decline==
After Ashikaga Yoshinori became the Shōgun, he demonstrated a deeper disdain for Zeami than his predecessors had,&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; though the origins of his feelings are unknown. Speculation has centered on Zeami's association with Masashige&lt;ref name=h96p32&gt;Hare 1996, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory that Zeami was a restorationist.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; In 1967, the Kanze-Fukudu genealogy was found and gave credence to the idea that politics contributed to Yoshinori's treatment of Zeami. The genealogy showed that a brother of Zeami's mother was a supporter of the southern court against the Ashikaga Shogunate.&lt;ref name=h96p14/&gt; Yoshinori is sometimes seen as eccentric, and it has been speculated that he punished Zeami because he did not enjoy his performances. (Yoshinori preferred colorful plays&lt;ref name=h96p33&gt;Hare 1996, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; that involved actor portraying demons; these types of plays were seldom found in Zeami's repertoire.)&lt;ref name=h96p35&gt;Hare 1996, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshinori, who enjoyed Monomane, preferred Onnami,&lt;ref name=h96p33/&gt; as his performances included demons.&lt;ref name=h96p35/&gt; Zeami had been close with his Onnami and they had performed together.&lt;ref name=h96p35/&gt; Zeami had been unsure whether any of his sons would be able to lead the troupe after his death, so he paid special attention to Onnami's development.&lt;ref name=w46&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Motomasa, however, began to lead the troupe in 1429.&lt;ref name=w46/&gt; That year, though Motomasa and Onnami each performed for Yoshinori during a 10-day festival&lt;ref name=h96p345&gt;Hare 1996, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshinori forbade Zeami to appear at the [[Sentō Imperial Palace]],&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; possibly due to his refusal to provide Onnami with his complete writings.&lt;ref name=w46/&gt; The next year, the music directorship of the Kiyotaki shrine was transferred from Motomasa to Onnami.&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; That year Zeami's son Motoyoshi retired from acting to serve as a Buddhist priest.&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt; That same year Motomasa died; it has been speculated that he was murdered.&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; Though he had lost political favor, Zeami continued to write prolifically.&lt;ref name=h96p36/&gt;

Onnami inherited the leadership of Zeami's Kanze school.&lt;ref name=h96p35/&gt; The appointment was made by the Shogunate, although the troupes were traditionally hereditary.&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt; Zeami initially opposed Onnami's leadership of the troupe, but he eventually acquiesced.&lt;ref name=h96p35/&gt; Zeami believed that his line had died with Motomasa, but Onnami felt that he continued the line.&lt;ref name=h96p36/&gt; Zeami gave his completed works to [[Konparu Zenchiku]], rather than to Onnami.&lt;ref name=h96p36&gt;Hare 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sado Island==
In 1434, Zeami was exiled to Sado Island.&lt;ref name=h96p32/&gt; He completed his last recorded work two years later, providing a detailed first-person account of his exile.&lt;ref name=h96p37&gt;Hare 1996, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the account he conveys a stoic attitude toward his misfortunes.&lt;ref name=w47&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the end of his life, but it was traditionally believed that he was pardoned and return to the mainland before his death.&lt;ref name=rxix/&gt; Zeami died in 1443 and was buried in Yamato. His wife died a short time later.&lt;ref name=h96p38&gt;Hare 1996, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Zeami is known as the foremost writer of Noh and the artist who brought it to its classical epitome.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; Scholars attribute roughly 50 plays to him, many of which have been translated into European languages. The contemporary versions of his plays are sometimes simplified. Some of his plays are no longer extant, and roughly 16 exist only in the form of rare manuscripts.&lt;ref name=rxxvii&gt;Rimer 1984, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few extant biographical documents of Zeami, the lack of solid information about his life has led to a significant amount of speculation.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt; Some common themes in the speculation are that Zeami could have been a spy, a Ji sect priest, or a Zen master.&lt;ref name=h96p12/&gt;

Zeami's treatises were not widely available after his death, only the upper-class warriors were able to gain access to them. In 1908, several of the treatises were discovered at a used-book store in Japan. They gained wider circulation after this discovery but a complete set was not published until 1940.&lt;ref name=w49&gt;Wilson 2006, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Zeami's plays have been continually performed in Japan since they were first written.&lt;ref name=q1&gt;Quinn 2005, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
