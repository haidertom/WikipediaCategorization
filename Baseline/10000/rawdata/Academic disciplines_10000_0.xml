'''[[Airbag]] launching''' refers to a method to launch vessels with [[ship launching airbag|marine air bags]]. It is a methodology for [[ship]] launching utilizing air bags.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 17682-2013 Ships and marine technology — Methodology for ship launching utilizing air bags&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Xiao Qinghe]] [[shipyard]] launched a tank barge with marine airbags on January 20, 1981 and it is known as the first use of marine airbags.

This kind of [[ship launching]] method has the advantages of requiring less permanent [[infrastructure]], risk, and cost. The airbags provide support to the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull of the ship]],air bags rolling motion take a [[Marine vessel|vessel]] launch into water, thus it is arguably safer than other options like [[sideways]] launching.

Unlike most other launching methods that are fixed infrastructures, airbag launching has relatively less limitations and can be used in versatile ways&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shiplaunching.org/|title=ShipLaunching.org - Ship Repair &amp; Launching Innovation|website=Shiplaunching.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It overcomes the disadvantage of fixed track launching in which capacity of shipbuilding and ship repairing is limited by the fixed infrastructures especially in small and medium-sized shipyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://max-groups.com/products/rubber-ship-launching-airbag-marine-airbag/|title=Rubber Ship Launching Airbag - Max Groups Marine|work=Max Groups Marine|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The arrangements of air bags ==

=== Launching type ===
Based on the ship shapes, the ship may be launched, using air bags, by either end launching type  or side launching type

=== End launching type ===
There are three ways to arrange air bags when using the end launching type. They are (1) linear arrangement (see Figure A.1), (2) staggered arrangement (see Figure A.2), and (3) two-lines arrangement (see Figure A.3). As for which arrangement to use, it will depend on the ship’s width and the length of the air bags.

When the ship’s width is not greater than the effective length of the air bags, the linear arrangement shall be selected

[[File:Air bags linear arrangement.jpg|centre|358x358px|thumb]]

When the ship’s width is greater than the effective length of an air bag and less than the effective length of two air bags, the staggered arrangement can be selected.
[[File:Air bags Staggered arrangement.jpg|centre|thumb|353x353px]]

When the ship’s width is greater than the combined effective length of two air bags, or for special ship such as [[catamaran]] HSC or split hopper barge, the two lines arrangement shall be selected. The distance between the near ends of two air bags is greater than 0,2 m.

[[File:Air_bags_Two-lines_arrangement.jpg|border|388x388px|centre]]

=== Side launching type                                                     ===

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imarine.cn/thread-568191-1-1.html|title = 荣成神飞船舶6200吨成品油轮-SF601下水|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For small flat-bottom ships, the side launching method may be utilized (see Figure A.4)
[[File:Air bags side launching arrangement.jpg|centre|thumb|375x375px]]

== Air bags quantity ==
Air bags shall meet the requirements of ISO 14409&lt;ref&gt;ISO14409-Ships and marine technology of Ship launching air bags&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

According to the weight of the ship being launched, the quantity of the air bags needed for this operation must be calculated in accordance with Formula (1):
[[File:Formula (1).jpg|left|frameless|298x298px]]
where

N is the quantity of air bags used for ship launching;

K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a coefficient, in general, K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 1,2;

Q is the weight of the ship (ton);

g is acceleration of gravity (m/s2), g = 9,8;

C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is the block coefficient of the ship being launched;

R is the allowable unit bearing capacity of the air bags (kN/m);

L&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the contact length between the bottom of the ship and the body of the air bag at the midship section (m).

For ship shifting, 2 to 4 additional air bags shall be made ready and available.

The centre to centre distance between two neighbouring air bags should be less than or equal to that found in Formula (2) and equal to or be greater than that found in Formula (3).
[[File:Formula(2)(3).jpg|left|frameless|287x287px]]
where

L is the actual length of the ship bottom that can make contact with the air bags (m);

N is the quantity of air bags used for ship launching;

k is a coefficient, k = 1 for steel ships, k = 0,8 for wooden, aluminium and glass-fibre-reinforced ships;

D is the nominal diameter of air bags (m).

== Slipway ==
The gradient and the length of the slipway shall be determined according to the size of the ship and the hydrological condition of the area water.

The bearing capacity of the slipway shall be at least twice as strong as the working pressure of air bags.

For ships of more than 3 000 tons of length, more than 120m,the slipway shall be constructed with reinforced concrete and the height difference between the right and left sides shall be less than 20&amp;nbsp;mm. For ships of more than 1 000 tons but less than or equal to 3 000 tons in weight, or more than 90 m but less than or equal to 120 m in length, the slipway shall be constructed with cement concrete and the height difference between the right and left sides shall be less than 50&amp;nbsp;mm. For ships of not more than 1 000 tons in weight or not more than 90 m in length, the [[slipway]] may be an earthen slope and shall be compacted even by rollers. The height difference between the right and left sides shall be less than 80&amp;nbsp;mm.

The [[main slipway]] shall enable the ship to glide automatically when the ship is off the tow. The [[wikt:auxiliary|auxiliary]] slipway shall be determined according to the ship type, the water level at time of launching, the diameter of the air bags, and the safety requirements.

== Towing arrangement ==
A windlass shall be used to control the movement of the ship. Tow system that comprises [[windlass]], steel wire rope and pulley set shall be securely fastened to the ground anchor in front of the berth.

In general, a slow windlass shall be selected for ship launching. The veering speed of the windlass shall be 9 m/min to 13 m/min.

The forces of the windlass and the steel wire rope should be calculated carefully by technicians of ship yards or air bags company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7901">'''Approximate computing''' is a computation technique which returns a possibly inaccurate result rather than a guaranteed accurate result, and can be used for applications where an approximate result is sufficient for its purpose.&lt;ref name="surveyACT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mittal|first1=Sparsh|title=A Survey of Techniques for Approximate Computing|journal=ACM Comput. Surv.|date=May 2016|volume=48|issue=4|pages=62:1–62:33|doi=10.1145/2893356|publisher=ACM|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Sampson, et al. "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1993518 EnerJ: Approximate data types for safe and general low-power computation]", In ACM SIGPLAN Notices, vol. 46, no. 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such situation is for a search engine where no exact answer may exist for a certain search query and hence, many answers may be acceptable. Similarly, occasional dropping of some [[Frame (video)|frames]] in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing [[Approximation theory|bounded approximation]] can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy.{{clarify|date=January 2016}}  For example, in [[k-means clustering|''k''-means clustering]] algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.&lt;ref name="surveyACT"/&gt;

The key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non-critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as [[program crash]] or erroneous output.

==Strategies==
Several strategies can be used for performing approximate computing.

; Approximate circuits
: Approximate [[Adder (electronics)|adders]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Echavarria, et al. "FAU: Fast and Error-Optimized Approximate Adder Units on LUT-Based FPGAs", FPT, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Miao, et al. "Modeling and synthesis of quality-energy optimal approximate adders", ICCAD, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binary multiplier|multipliers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rehman|first=Semeen|last2=El-Harouni|first2=Walaa|last3=Shafique|first3=Muhammad|last4=Kumar|first4=Akash|last5=Henkel|first5=Jörg|date=2016-11-07|title=Architectural-space exploration of approximate multipliers|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2966986.2967005|publisher=ACM|pages=80|doi=10.1145/2966986.2967005|isbn=9781450344661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[logical circuit]]s can reduce hardware overhead.&lt;ref&gt;S. Venkataramani, et al. "SALSA: systematic logic synthesis of approximate circuits", DAC, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Miao, et al. "Approximate logic synthesis under general error magnitude and frequency constraints", ICCAD, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Hegde et al. "Energy-efficient signal processing via algorithmic noise-tolerance", ISLPED, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an approximate multi-bit adder can ignore the [[carry chain]] and thus, allow all its sub-adders to perform addition operation in parallel.
; Approximate storage
: Instead of [[Computer data storage|storing data]] values exactly, they can be stored approximately, e.g., by [[Data truncation|truncating]] the lower-bits in [[floating point]] data. Another method is accept less reliable memory. For this, in [[DRAM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raha|first=A.|last2=Sutar|first2=S.|last3=Jayakumar|first3=H.|last4=Raghunathan|first4=V.|date=July 2017|title=Quality Configurable Approximate DRAM|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7784741/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=66|issue=7|pages=1172–1187|doi=10.1109/TC.2016.2640296|issn=0018-9340}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[eDRAM]], [[refresh rate]] can be lowered and in [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]], supply voltage can be lowered. In general, any [[error detection and correction]] mechanisms should be disabled.
; Software-level approximation
: There are several ways to approximate at software level. [[Memoization]] can be applied. Some [[iteration]]s of [[Loop (computing)|loops]] can be skipped (termed as [[loop perforation]]) to achieve a result faster. Some tasks can also be skipped, for example when a run-time condition suggests that those tasks are not going to be useful ([[task skipping]]). [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s and [[Randomized algorithm]]s trade correctness for execution time guarantees&lt;ref&gt;C.Alippi, Intelligence for Embedded Systems: a Methodological approach,  Springer, 2014, pp. 283&lt;/ref&gt;. The computation can be reformulated according to paradigms that allow easily the acceleration on specialized hardware, e.g. a neural processing unit.&lt;ref&gt;H. Esmaeilzadeh, et al. "Neural acceleration for general-purpose approximate programs", MICRO, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
; Approximate system 
: In an approximate system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raha|first=Arnab|last2=Raghunathan|first2=Vijay|date=2017|title=Towards Full-System Energy-Accuracy Tradeoffs: A Case Study of An Approximate Smart Camera System|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3061639.3062333|journal=Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017|series=DAC '17|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=74:1–74:6|doi=10.1145/3061639.3062333|isbn=9781450349277}}&lt;/ref&gt;, different subsystems of the system such as the processor, memory, sensor, and communication modules are synergistically approximated to obtain a much better system-level Q-E trade-off curve compared to individual approximations to each of the subsystems.

==Application areas==
Approximate computing has been used in a variety of domains where the applications are error-tolerant, such as [[multimedia]] processing, [[machine learning]], [[signal processing]], [[Computational science|scientific computing]], etc. Google is using this approach in their [[Tensor processing unit]]s (TPU, a custom ASIC).

==Derived paradigms==
The main issue in approximate computing is the identification of the section of the application that can be approximated. In the case of large scale applications, it is very common to find people holding the expertise on approximate computing techniques not having enough expertise on the application domain (and vice versa). In order to solve this problem, [[programming paradigm]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Donald|last2=Lenharth|first2=Andrew|last3=Pingali|first3=Keshav|title=A lightweight infrastructure for graph analytics|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles|date=2013|pages=456–471|publisher=ACM|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silvano|first1=Cristina|last2=Agosta|first2=Giovanni|last3=Cherubin|first3=Stefano|last4=Gadioli|first4=Davide|last5=Palermo|first5=Gianluca|last6=Bartolini|first6=Andrea|last7=Benini|first7=Luca|last8=Martinovič|first8=Jan|last9=Palkovič|first9=Martin|last10=Slaninová|first10=Kateřina|last11=Bispo|first11=João|last12=Cardoso|first12=João M.

They all have in common the clear role separation between application [[programmer]] and application [[domain expert]]. These approaches allow the spread of the most common [[Program optimization|optimizations]] and approximate computing techniques.

'''Astrobiology''' is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the [[abiogenesis|origins]], [[Protocell|early evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]].

== Overview ==
The term was first proposed by the Russian ([[Soviet]]) astronomer [[Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov|Gavriil Tikhov]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cockell |first=Charles S. |title='Astrobiology' and the ethics of new science |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Cockell/publication/42790151_%27Astrobiology%27_and_the_ethics_of_new_science/links/0a85e530540978d399000000/Astrobiology-and-the-ethics-of-new-science.pdf |format=PDF |date=2001 |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews  |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=90–96 |doi=10.1179/0308018012772533}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Astrobiology'' is etymologically derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄστρον}}, ''astron'', "constellation, star"; {{lang|grc|βίος}}, ''bios'', "life"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', ''study''. The synonyms of astrobiology are diverse; however, the synonyms were structured in relation to the most important sciences implied in its development: [[astronomy]] and [[biology]]. A close synonym is ''exobiology'' from the Greek {{lang|grc|Έξω}}, "external"; Βίος, ''bios'', "life"; and λογία, -logia, ''study''. The term exobiology was coined by molecular biologist and Nobel Prize winner [[Joshua Lederberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/BB/p-nid/32 Launching a New Science: Exobiology and the Exploration of Space] ''The National Library of Medicine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Exobiology is considered to have a narrow scope limited to search of life external to Earth, whereas subject area of astrobiology is wider and investigates the link between life and the [[universe]], which includes the search for extraterrestrial life, but also includes the study of life on Earth, its origin, evolution and limits.

Another term used in the past is [[xenobiology]], ("biology of the foreigners") a word used in 1954 by science fiction writer [[Robert Heinlein]] in his work ''[[The Star Beast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinlein R, Harold W|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Xenobiology |journal=Science |date=21 July 1961 |pages=223, 225 | doi=10.1126/science.134.3473.223 |jstor=1708323 |volume=134 |issue=3473|bibcode = 1961Sci...134..223H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term xenobiology is now used in a more specialized sense, to mean "biology based on foreign chemistry", whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (possibly synthetic) origin. Since alternate chemistry analogs to some life-processes have been created in the laboratory, xenobiology is now considered as an extant subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Markus Schmidt | title=Xenobiology: A new form of life as the ultimate biosafety tool | journal=BioEssays | date=9 March 2010 | pages=322–331 | doi=10.1002/bies.200900147 | volume=32 | issue=4 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200900147/abstract | pmid=20217844 | pmc=2909387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is an emerging and developing field, the question of whether [[life]] exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of [[science|scientific]] inquiry.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170216"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livio |first=Mario |title=Winston Churchill's essay on alien life found |url=http://www.nature.com/news/winston-churchill-s-essay-on-alien-life-found-1.21467 |date=15 February 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=542 |issue=7641 |pages=289–291 |doi=10.1038/542289a |accessdate=18 February 2017 |bibcode = 2017Natur.542..289L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170215"&gt;{{cite news |last=De Freytas-Tamura |first=Kimiko |title=Winston Churchill Wrote of Alien Life in a Lost Essay |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/europe/winston-churchill-aliens.html |date=15 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study.

In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology |author1=Steven J.

Advancements in the fields of astrobiology, observational astronomy and discovery of large varieties of [[extremophile]]s with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, have led to speculation that life may possibly be thriving on many of the extraterrestrial bodies in the universe. A particular focus of current astrobiology research is the search for [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]] due to this planet's proximity to Earth and geological history.

In late 2008, the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]] probed the environment for past and present [[planetary habitability]] of [[microbe|microbial]] [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]], and researched the history of water there.

When looking for life on other planets like Earth, some simplifying assumptions are useful to reduce the size of the task of the astrobiologist. One is the informed assumption that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on [[Carbon-based life|carbon chemistries]], as are all life forms on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2000 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=20 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of [[molecule]]s that can be formed around it. Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element]] in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and [[organic compound|complex molecules]].

The presence of liquid water is an assumed requirement, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/astrobiology-spsc-04/ |title=Astrobiology |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Science Library: Space Sciences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers posit environments of water-[[ammonia]] mixtures as possible solvents for [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2057.html |title=The Ammonia-Oxidizing Gene |accessdate=20 October 2008 |author=Penn State |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting [[Sun]]-like [[star]]s for increased probabilities of [[planetary habitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |title=Stars and Habitable Planets |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2007 |publisher=Sol Company |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001194624/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |archivedate=1 October 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time to emerge on [[planet]]s orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be [[Tidal lock|tidally "locked"]] to the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/display/?id=223364&amp;source=r |title=M Dwarfs: The Search for Life is On |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=29 August 2005 |publisher=Red Orbit &amp; [[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long lifetimes of [[red dwarf]]s could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See [[Habitability of red dwarf systems]]).

Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor [[life]], there is no evident way to know if any of these simplifying assumptions are correct.

===Communication attempts===
{{Main|Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence}}
[[File:Pioneer10-plaque tilt.jpg|right|thumb|The illustration on the [[Pioneer plaque]] ]]
Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence ([[Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence|CETI]]) focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the [[Arecibo message]] and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. The [[SETI]] program, for example, uses both [[radio telescope]]s and [[optical telescope]]s to search for deliberate signals from an  [[extraterrestrial intelligence]].

While some high-profile scientists, such as [[Carl Sagan]], have advocated the transmission of messages,&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl. Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence. MIT Press, 1973, 428 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/you-never-get-a-seventh-chance-to-make-a-first-impression-an-awkward-history-of-our-space-transmissions/| title=You Never Get a Seventh Chance to Make a First Impression: An Awkward History of Our Space Transmissions| work=Lightspeed Magazine| accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientist [[Stephen Hawking]] warned against it, suggesting that aliens might simply raid Earth for its resources and then move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/25/stephen-hawking-aliens_n_551035.html|title=Stephen Hawking: Humans Should Fear Aliens|date=2010-06-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements of astrobiology===

==== Astronomy ====
{{Main|Astronomy}}
[[Image:OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb planet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Artist's impression of the [[extrasolar planet]] [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] orbiting its star 20,000 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]]; this planet was discovered with [[gravitational microlensing]].]]
[[Image:Telescope Kepler-NASA.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The [[NASA]] [[Kepler mission]], launched in March 2009, searches for [[extrasolar planets]].]]
Most astronomy-related astrobiology research falls into the category of [[extrasolar planet]] (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably [[NASA]]'s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) and [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] programs, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' mission]] in March 2009, and the [[French Space Agency]] launched the [[COROT]] space mission in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/ |title=Kepler Mission |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081031070350/http://kepler.nasa.gov/| archivedate= 31 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |title=The COROT space telescope |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=CNES |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108130307/http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |archivedate=8 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway.

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]]. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vpl.astro.washington.edu/main/about_vpl.html |title=The Virtual Planet Laboratory |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.

An estimate for the number of planets with intelligent ''communicative'' [[extraterrestrial life]] can be gleaned from the [[Drake equation]], essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm |title=What is the Drake Equation? |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Ford |first=Steve |date=August 1995 |publisher=SETI League | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081029212425/http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm| archivedate= 29 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N = R^{*} ~ \times ~ f_{p} ~ \times ~ n_{e} ~ \times ~ f_{l} ~ \times ~ f_{i} ~ \times ~ f_{c} ~ \times ~ L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* '''''N''''' = The number of communicative civilizations
* '''''R*''''' = The rate of formation of suitable stars (stars such as our Sun)
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of those stars with planets (current evidence indicates that planetary systems may be common for stars like the Sun)
* '''''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The number of Earth-sized worlds per planetary system
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of those Earth-sized planets where life actually develops
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of life sites where intelligence develops
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of communicative planets (those on which electromagnetic communications technology develops)
* '''''L''''' = The "lifetime" of communicating civilizations

However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not usable to generate or support [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, '''''R*''''', number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, ''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', stars with planets and ''f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/seti/seti_history_07.html|author=Amir Alexander| title=The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Short History – Part 7: The Birth of the Drake Equation}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or [[pseudoscientific]] arguments.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 17 January 2011 | date = 26 September 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101212184044/http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html| archivedate= 12 December 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another associated topic is the [[Fermi paradox]], which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the [[universe]], then there should be obvious signs of it.

Another active research area in astrobiology is [[planetary system]] formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of the [[Solar System]] (for example, the presence of [[Jupiter]] as a protective shield)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |title=Jupiter: Friend or foe? |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Horner |first=Jonathan |author2=Barrie Jones |date=24 August 2007 |publisher=Europlanet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65SpMGrmN?url=http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |archivedate=15 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on our planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=3910 |title=The Role Of Astrobiology in Solar System Exploration |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last1=Jakosky |first1=Bruce |author2=David Des Marais |date=14 September 2001 |work=NASA |publisher=SpaceRef.com |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1222 |title=Coming Soon: "Good" Jupiters |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Bortman |first=Henry |date=29 September 2004 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biology cannot state that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, has to exist forcibly in an extraterrestrial body. Biologists specify what is speculative and what is not.&lt;ref name=BC/&gt;

Until the 1970s, [[life]] was thought to be entirely dependent on energy from the [[Sun]]. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from [[sunlight]] to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process that is then consumed by oxygen-respiring organisms, passing their energy up the [[food chain]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was thought to obtain its nourishment either from consuming [[marine snow|organic detritus rained down from the surface waters]] or from eating animals that did.&lt;ref name="smoker"&gt;{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |date=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of [[giant tube worm]]s, [[clam]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[mussel]]s, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.&lt;ref name="smoker"/&gt; These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprise an entirely independent [[ecosystem]]. Although most of these multicellular lifeforms need dissolved oxygen (produced by oxygenic photosynthesis) for their aerobic cellular respiration and thus are not completely independent from sunlight by themselves, the basis for their food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] that derives its energy from [[Redox|oxidization]] of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. Other lifeforms entirely decoupled from the energy from sunlight are green sulphur bacteria which are capturing geothermal light for anoxygenic photosynthesis or bacteria running chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium.&lt;ref name="Trixler2013"&gt;{{cite journal | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768233/pdf/COC-17-1758.pdf|last=Trixler|first=F|title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life.|journal=Current Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=17|number=16|pages=1758–1770|doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083|pmc=3768233|pmid=24039543}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

[[Extremophiles]], organisms able to survive in extreme environments, are a core research element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] which are able to survive several kilometers below the ocean's surface near [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[microbe]]s that thrive in highly acidic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/050207_extremophiles.html |title=Wild Things: The Most Extreme Creatures |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |date=7 February 2005 |work=Live Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life.&lt;ref name=Cavicchioli &gt;{{cite journal| title=Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life|journal=Astrobiology|date=Fall 2002 |first=R. |last=Cavicchioli |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=281–92 |pmid=12530238 |doi=10.1089/153110702762027862 |bibcode = 2002AsBio...2..281C |url=http://somosbacteriasyvirus.com/extremophiles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe.

The origin of life, known as [[abiogenesis]], distinct from the [[Evolution#Evolution of life|evolution of life]], is another ongoing field of research. [[Oparin]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane]] postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of [[organic compound]]s from [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic elements]] and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of [[panspermia]] is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the [[panspermia]] hypothesis.

====Astroecology====
{{Main|Astroecology}}
[[Astroecology]] concerns the interactions of life with space environments and resources, in [[planets]], [[asteroids]] and [[comets]]. On a larger scale, astroecology concerns resources for life about [[stars]] in the [[galaxy]] through the cosmological future. Astroecology attempts to quantify future life in space, addressing this area of astrobiology.

Experimental astroecology investigates resources in planetary soils, using actual space materials in [[meteorite]]s.&lt;ref name = "AstroecologyIcarus2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary bioresources and astroecology. 1.

==== Astrogeology ====
{{Main|Geology of solar terrestrial planets}}
[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Astrogeology]] is a [[planetary science]] discipline concerned with the [[geology]] of [[celestial bodies]] such as the [[planet]]s and their [[moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteorite]]s. The information gathered by this discipline allows the measure of a [[planet]]'s or a [[natural satellite]]'s potential to develop and sustain [[life]], or [[planetary habitability]].

An additional discipline of astrogeology is [[geochemistry]], which involves study of the [[chemistry|chemical]] composition of the Earth and other [[planet]]s, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[soil]]s, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the [[hydrosphere]] and the [[atmosphere]] of the planet. Specializations include [[cosmochemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[organic geochemistry]].

The [[fossil record]] provides the oldest known evidence for life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html |title=Fossil Succession |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=14 August 1997 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014190106/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html| archivedate= 14 October 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining the fossil evidence, [[paleontologists]] are able to better understand the types of organisms that arose on the early Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the [[Pilbara]] in [[Western Australia]] and the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] of Antarctica, are also considered to be geological analogs to regions of Mars, and as such, might be able to provide clues on how to search for past [[life on Mars]].

The various organic functional groups, composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide the enormous diversity of chemical reactions necessarily catalyzed by a living [[organism]]. Silicon, in contrast, interacts with only a few other atoms, and the large silicon molecules are monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules.&lt;ref name=BC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life anywhere will be similar  those on Earth, in the generality if not in the detail.&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; Although terrestrial life and life that might arise independently of Earth are expected to use many similar, if not identical, building blocks, they also are expected to have some biochemical qualities that are unique. If life has had a comparable impact elsewhere in the Solar System, the relative abundances of chemicals key for its survival – whatever they may be – could betray its presence. Whatever extraterrestrial life may be, its tendency to chemically alter its environment might just give it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Michael | title = Telltale chemistry could betray ET | date = 21 January 2011 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20927962.700-telltale-chemistry-could-betray-et.html | work = New Scientists | accessdate = 22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have long speculated about the possibility of life in settings other than Earth, however, speculation on the nature of life elsewhere often has paid little heed to constraints imposed by the nature of biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite journal| title=The universal nature of biochemist ry| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA| date=30 January 2001|first=Norman R. |last=Pace| volume=98| issue=3| pages=805–808 |id= |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full| format=| accessdate=20 March 2010| pmid=11158550| doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805| pmc=33372 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..805P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood that life throughout the universe is probably carbon-based is suggested by the fact that carbon is one of the most abundant of the higher elements. Only two of the natural atoms, [[carbon]] and [[silicon]], are known to serve as the backbones of molecules sufficiently large to carry biological information. As the structural basis for life, one of carbon's important features is that unlike silicon, it can readily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby allowing for the chemical versatility required to conduct the reactions of biological metabolism and propagation.

== Rare Earth hypothesis ==
{{Main|Rare Earth hypothesis}}

The Rare Earth hypothesis postulates that multicellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists assume. It provides a possible answer to the Fermi paradox which suggests, "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?" It is apparently in opposition to the [[principle of mediocrity]], assumed by famed astronomers [[Frank Drake]], [[Carl Sagan]], and others. The Principle of Mediocrity suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, but rather that life is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds.

;Methane
In 2004, the spectral signature of [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) was detected in the Martian atmosphere by both Earth-based telescopes as well as by the ''[[Mars Express]]'' orbiter. Because of [[solar radiation]] and [[cosmic radiation]], methane is predicted to disappear from the Martian atmosphere within several years, so the gas must be actively replenished in order to maintain the present concentration.&lt;ref name="results"&gt;

;Planetary systems
It is possible that some exoplanets may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimeter astronomy]] has revealed the constituents of other [[star system]]s.

;Planetary habitability
{{main|Planetary habitability}}
Efforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in [[habitable zone]]s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous [[extrasolar planet]]s have been detected using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|wobble method]] and [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transit method]], showing that planets around other [[star]]s are more numerous than previously postulated. The first Earth-sized extrasolar planet to be discovered within its star's habitable zone is [[Gliese 581 c]].&lt;ref name="Gliese"&gt;{{cite news | first=Ker | last=Than | title=Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life | date=24 April 2007 | publisher=Space.com | url =http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html | pages = | accessdate =20 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081015075030/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html| archivedate= 15 October 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missions ==
Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme [[ecosystem]]s is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life. Missions such as the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]], [[ExoMars]], [[Mars 2020]] rover to Mars, and the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' probe]] to [[Saturn]]'s moons aim to further explore the possibilities of life on other planets in the Solar System.

;''Viking'' program
{{main|Viking lander biological experiments}}
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] posing with a model of the Viking Lander.]]
The two [[Viking program|Viking landers]] each carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars in the late 1970s. These were the only Mars landers to carry out experiments looking specifically for [[metabolism]] by current microbial [[Life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]. The landers used a robotic arm to collect soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars' surface; [[Viking 1]] near the equator and [[Viking 2]] further north.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite book

===Australia===
In [[Australia]] UHF channel allocations are 7&amp;nbsp;MHz wide.  Band V includes channels 36 to 69, with base frequencies of 585.5&amp;nbsp;MHz to 816.5&amp;nbsp;MHz.  More details are available on the [[Australian_and_New_Zealand_television_frequencies|television frequencies]] page.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] UHF channel allocations are 8&amp;nbsp;MHz wide.  Band V includes digital channels 36 to 49, with base frequencies of 594.0&amp;nbsp;MHz to 698.0&amp;nbsp;MHz.  More details are available on the [[Australian_and_New_Zealand_television_frequencies|television frequencies]] page.


===United Kingdom===

In the [[UK]], Band V allocations for television  are 8&amp;nbsp;MHz wide, traditionally consisting of 30 channels from UHF 39 to 68 inclusive. There is also a channel 69, but in the UK, this is allocated to radio microphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canford.co.uk/Technical/PDFs/uk_radiomicrophone_frequ.pdf|title=UK legal radio mic frequency guide|accessdate=2009-05-19|publisher=Canford Audio plc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-wideband aerials of the ''group E'' type cover this entire band.&lt;ref name="atv1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerialsandtv.com/aerials.html#aerialgroups|title=Aerial Groups / Widebands|accessdate=2009-05-17|publisher=A.T.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">'''Biomusicology''' is the study of [[music]] from a [[Biology|biological]] point of view. The term was coined by Nils L. Wallin in 1991 to encompass several branches of [[music psychology]] and [[musicology]], including [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Cognitive neuroscience of music|neuromusicology]], and [[ethnomusicology|comparative musicology]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, N. L. (1991): ''Biomusicology: Neurophysiological, Neuropsychological and Evolutionary Perspectives on the Origins and Purposes of Music'', Stuyvesant, NY: Pendragon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary musicology studies the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution". Neuromusicology studies the "brain areas involved in music processing, neural and cognitive processes of musical processing", and "ontogeny of musical capacity and musical skill". Comparative musicology studies the "functions and uses of music, advantages and costs of music making", and "universal features of musical systems and musical behavior".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology." In: Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (Eds., 1999): ''The Origins of Music'', pp. 5–6. {{ISBN|0-262-23206-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied biomusicology "attempts to provide biological insight into such things as the [[Music therapy|therapeutic uses of music]] in medical and psychological treatment; widespread use of music in the audiovisual media such as film and television; the ubiquitous [[Background music|presence of music in public places]] and its role in influencing mass behavior; and the potential use of music to function as a general enhancer of learning."&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"/&gt;

Whereas biomusicology refers to music among humans, [[zoomusicology]] extends the field to other species.

'''Brightness temperature''' or '''radiance temperature''' is the temperature a [[black body]] in [[thermal equilibrium]] with its surroundings would have to be to duplicate the observed [[Intensity (heat transfer)|intensity]] of a [[grey body]] object at a frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/observatory/radiotelescope/background/?page=brightness |title=Brightness Temperature}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept is used in [[radio astronomy]], [[planetary science]] and [[materials science]]. 

The brightness temperature of a surface is typically determined by an optical measurement, for example using a [[pyrometer]], with the intention of determining the real temperature. As detailed below, the real temperature of a surface can in some cases be calculated by dividing the brightness temperature by the [[emissivity]] of the surface. Since the emissivity is a value between 0 and 1, the real temperature will be greater than or equal to the brightness temperature. At high frequencies (short wavelengths) and low temperatures, the conversion must proceed through [[Planck's law]].

The brightness temperature is not a temperature as ordinarily understood. It characterizes radiation, and depending on the mechanism of radiation can differ considerably from the physical temperature of a radiating body (though it is theoretically possible to construct a device which will heat up by a source of radiation with some brightness temperature to the actual temperature equal to brightness temperature).&lt;ref name="RybickiLightman" /&gt; Nonthermal sources can have very high brightness temperatures. In [[pulsar|pulsars]] the brightness temperature can reach 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K. For the radiation of a typical [[helium–neon laser]] with a power of 60&amp;nbsp;mW and a coherence length of 20&amp;nbsp;cm, focused in a spot with a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;[[µm]], the brightness temperature will be nearly {{val|14|e=9|u=K}}.{{cn|date=August 2015}}


For a '''black body''', [[Planck's law]] gives:&lt;ref name="RybickiLightman"&gt;Rybicki, George B., Lightman, Alan P., (2004) ''Radiative Processes in Astrophysics'', {{ISBN|978-0-471-82759-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BR" /&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;I_\nu = \frac{2 h\nu^{3}}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;I_\nu&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Intensity (physics)|Intensity]] or Brightness) is the amount of [[energy]] emitted per unit [[surface area]] per unit time per unit [[solid angle]] and in the frequency range between &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu + d\nu&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] of the black body; &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]]; &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is [[frequency]]; &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]]; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

For a '''grey body''' the  [[spectral radiance]] is a portion of the black body radiance, determined by the [[emissivity]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
That makes the reciprocal of the brightness temperature:

::&lt;math&gt;T_b^{-1} = \frac{k}{h\nu}\, \text{ln}\left[1 + \frac{e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}{\epsilon}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

At low frequency and high temperatures, when &lt;math&gt;h\nu \ll kT&lt;/math&gt;, we can use the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]]:&lt;ref name="BR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/BlackBodyRad.html|title= Blackbody Radiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\nu} = \frac{2 \nu^2k T}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the brightness temperature can be simply written as:

::&lt;math&gt;T_b=\epsilon T\,&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the brightness temperature is a function of &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, and only in the case of [[Black-body radiation|blackbody radiation]] it is the same at all frequencies. The brightness temperature can be used to calculate the [[spectral index]] of a body, in the case of non-thermal radiation.

== Calculating by frequency ==
The brightness temperature of a source with known spectral radiance can be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrar.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/819510/radiative.pdf|author=Jean-Pierre Macquart|title=Radiative Processes in Astrophysics}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{h\nu}{k} \ln^{-1}\left( 1 + \frac{2h\nu^3}{I_{\nu}c^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;h\nu \ll kT&lt;/math&gt; we can use the Rayleigh–Jeans law:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{I_{\nu}c^2}{2k\nu^2}&lt;/math&gt;

For [[narrowband]] radiation with very low relative [[spectral linewidth]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu \ll \nu&lt;/math&gt; and known [[radiance]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; we can calculate the brightness temperature as:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{I c^2}{2k\nu^2\Delta\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

== Calculating by wavelength ==
Spectral radiance of black-body radiation is expressed by wavelength as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heliosat3.de/e-learning/remote-sensing/Lec4.pdf|title=Blackbody radiation. Main Laws. Brightness temperature}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\lambda}=\frac{2 hc^2}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{ e^{\frac{hc}{kT \lambda}} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

So, the brightness temperature can be calculated as:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{hc}{k\lambda} \ln^{-1}\left(1 + \frac{2hc^2}{I_{\lambda}\lambda^5}  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

For long-wave radiation &lt;math&gt;hc/\lambda \ll kT&lt;/math&gt; the brightness temperature is:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{I_{\lambda}\lambda^4}{2kc}&lt;/math&gt;

For almost monochromatic radiation, the brightness temperature can be expressed by the [[radiance]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and the [[coherence length]] &lt;math&gt;L_c&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{\pi I \lambda^2 L_c}{4kc \ln{2} }&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">The '''Central Economic Mathematical Institute''' ({{lang-ru|Центральный экономико-математический институт (ЦЭМИ)}}) of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] is an economic research institute located in [[Moscow]]. It focuses on economic theory, mathematical economics and [[econometrics]]. The CEMI was established in 1963 as an institute of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], superseding the ''Laboratory of Economics and Mathematical Methods'' which had been founded by [[Vasily Sergeevich Nemchinov]] in 1958. In 1964 a branch of the institute was created in [[Tallinn]], and in 1966 [[Leningrad]] branch was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/rus/index0.htm How CEMI Was Created] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622022515/http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/rus/index0.htm |date=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"When the Institute was founded in 1963, is main goal was an "introduction on the mathematical methods and computers in the practice of planning, creation of the theory of the optimal control of the national economy".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from [http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/about/how/?section=about_link official website].&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the initial founding vision of the Institute was more ambitious. Of six founding research objectives mentioned by Fedorenko in his 1964, three of them directly bore on the "development of a unified system of economic information", the "design and creation of a unified state network of computer centers", and "Derivation of specialized planning and management systems based on mathematical methods and computer technology." Although its failure has since obscured this history, the Institute was initially meant to be the leading organization charged with creating a nationwide economic information network.&lt;ref&gt;Kassel, Simon. ''Soviet Cybernetics Research: A Preliminary Study of Organizations and Personalities'', RAND, Dec. 1971, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerovitch |first=Slava |title=InterNyet: Why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network |journal=[[History and Technology]] |year=2008 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=335–350 |doi=10.1080/07341510802044736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nowadays CEMI's focus has been on the transition period from communism to capitalism in Russia, and on microeconomic models and models of enterprises' behaviour. The so-called System of Optimal Functioning of the Economy (SOFE), with its mathematical planning approach based on methods developed by [[Leonid Kantorovich]] and its IT approach, was intensively discussed during Soviet times. It was objected to by some Marxist economists{{who?|date=December 2015}} as representatives of the Political Economy, who were afraid that the mathematical formula approach was too close to Western economics, and might lead to Soviet economics converting to Western economics, which also rely on mathematical formulas.  CEMI's first director was [[Nikolay Fedorenko|N.P. Fedorenko]]. In 1985 he was succeeded by the Russian academic V.L. Makarov, who still directs the institute.

Academic N.P. Fedorenko and other Russian scientists have issued many books on SOFE; most of them are in Russian.

CEMI headquarters features [[alto-relievo]] mosaic composition [[Möbius strip|Möbius Strip]] on its facade, created by architect [[Leonid Pavlov]] and painters–monumentalists V. Vasiltsov and E. Zharenova in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.metro.ru/library/architecture/vasiltsov.html On Our Work At Nagatinskaya Metro Station] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703002015/http://www.metro.ru/library/architecture/vasiltsov.html |date=July 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chronosequence''' (in [[forest sciences]]) is a set of forested sites that share similar attributes but are of different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Edward Arnold |last=Johnson |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GfyIjLypngIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22chronosequence%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chronosequence%22&amp;f=false |title=Plant disturbance ecology: the process and the response |isbn=978-0-12-088778-1 |publisher=Academic Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many processes in [[forest ecology]] take a long time (decades or centuries) to develop, chronosequence methods are used to represent and study the time-dependent development of a forest. [[Fieldata|Field data]] from a chronosequence can be collected in a short period of several months. For example, chronosequences are often used to study the changes in plant communities during [[Ecological succession|succession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Knops |first1=Johannes M.H. |author1-link= Johannes M.H. Knops |last2=Tilman |first2=David |author2-link=David Tilman |title=Dynamics of soil nitrogen and carbon accumulation for 61 years after agricultural abandonment |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=88–98 |year=2000 |doi=10.2307/177136|jstor=177136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of using '''chronosequences''' to study [[ecological succession]] is in the study of plant and microbial succession in recently deglactiated zones. For example, a study from 2005 used the distance from the nose of a glacier as a proxy for site age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tscherko|first1=Dagmar|last2=Hammesfahr|first2=Ute|last3=Zeltner|first3=Georg|last4=Kandeler|first4=Ellen|last5=Böcker|first5=Reinhard|title=Plant succession and rhizosphere microbial communities in a recently deglaciated alpine terrain|journal=Basic and Applied Ecology|date=5 August 2005|volume=6|issue=4|pages=367–383|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179105000356|doi=10.1016/j.baae.2005.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common assumption in establishing '''chronosequences''' is that no other variable besides age (such as various [[abiotic|abiotic components]] and [[biotic components]]) has changed between sites of interest. Because this assumption cannot always be tested for environmental study sites, the use of chronosequences in field successional studies has recently been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Edward|last2=Miyanishi|first2=Kiyoko|title=Testing the assumptions of chronosequences in succession|journal=Ecology Letters|date=13 March 2008|volume=11|issue=5|pages=419–431|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01173.x|pmid=18341585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dansaekhwa''' ({{lang-ko|단색화}}), also known as "Tansaekhwa" refers to a loose grouping of paintings that emerged in Korean painting starting in the mid-1970s, when a group of artists began to push paint, soak canvas, drag pencils, rip paper, and otherwise manipulate the materials of painting. Tansaekhwa means ‘monochrome painting’ in Korean and was used by the critic Lee Yil in 1980 to refer to a group of largely non-figurative paintings painted in neutral hues.  Promoted in Seoul, Tokyo, and Paris, Tansaekhwa grew to be the international face of contemporary Korean art and a cornerstone of contemporary Asian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kee|first1=Joan|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|date=2013|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0966350391|pages=384|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures associated with Tansaekhwa include: [[Cho Yong-ik]], Chung Chang-Sup, [[Chung Sanghwa|Chung Sang-Hwa]], Ha Chonghyun, Heu Hwang, Kim Guiline, Kwon Young-woo, [[Lee Dong-youb|Lee 
Dong Youb]], [[Lee Ufan]], [[Park Seo-bo|Park Seobo]], Suh Seung-Wong, and Yun Hyong-keun.

==History==
Lee Ufan had moved to Japan in 1956, where he established himself with the Mono-ha movement in the late 1960s. In the mid-1970s he introduced his Korean peers to the Tokyo art scene. “Five Korean Artists, Five Kinds of White,” a group show held at Tokyo Gallery in May 1975, is often credited as the first major presentation of the works that later became known as Tansaekhwa. The five featured artists were Kwon Young-woo, Lee Dong Youb, Heu Hwang, Suh Seung-won and Park Seobo.

==Recent attention==
In 2013, the first extended scholarly discussion of Tansaekhwa, written by Joan Kee, was published by the University of Minnesota Press. It was a finalist for the annual College Art Association Charles Rufus Morey Prize for the most distinguished book in the history of art, the first book on any aspect of modern and contemporary Asian art to receive this designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/moreyfinalists# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322211016/http://www.collegeart.org/awards/moreyfinalists# |archive-date=2016-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jenny Jungsil|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|journal=Journal of Korean Studies|date=2014|volume=38|pages=157–160|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/594914|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, a spate of survey shows in Korea and the United States triggered renewed critical and commercial interest in Dansaekhwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Degen|first1=Natasha|last2= Kim|first2=Kibum|year= 2015|title=The Koreans at the Top of the Art World |website=New Yorker |url= http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-koreans-at-the-top-of-the-art-world |access-date= 2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Display behaviour is a set of ritualized behaviours that enable an animal to communicate to other animals (typically of the same species) about specific stimuli &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Ximena J.|last2=Jackson|first2=Robert R.|date=2007-09-01|title=Complex display behaviour during the intraspecific interactions of myrmecomorphic jumping spiders (Araneae, Salticidae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930701450504|journal=Journal of Natural History|volume=41|issue=25-28|pages=1659–1678|doi=10.1080/00222930701450504|issn=0022-2933|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These ritualized behaviours can be visual however many animals depend on a mixture of visual, audio, tactical and/or chemical signals as well &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. [[Evolution]] has tailored these stereotyped behaviours to allow animals to communicate both conspecifically and interspecifically which allows for a broader connection in different niches in an [[ecosystem]].  It is connected to [[sexual selection]] and survival of the species in various ways. Typically, display behaviour is used for [[Courtship display|courtship]] between two animals and to signal to the female that a viable male is ready to mate &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loxton|first=R. G.|date=1979-01-01|title=On display behaviour and courtship in the praying mantis Ephestiasula amoena (Bolivar)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01083.x|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=65|issue=1|pages=103–110|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01083.x|issn=0024-4082|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In other instances, species may exhibit territorial display behaviour, in order to preserve a [[foraging]] or [[Predation|hunting]] territory for its family or group. A third form is exhibited by tournament species in which males will fight in order to gain the 'right' to breed.Animals from a broad range of evolutionary hierarchies avail of display behaviours- from invertebrates such as the simple [[jumping spider]]&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; to the more complex vertebrates like the [[Harbor seal|harbour seal]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Parijs|first=Sofie M.|last2=Hastie|first2=Gordon D.|last3=Thompson|first3=Paul M.|date=2000-03-01|title=Individual and geographical variation in display behaviour of male harbour seals in Scotland|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1999.1307|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|issue=3|pages=559–568|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1307|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   

== In animals ==

=== Invertebrates ===

==== Insects ====
Communication is very important for animals all throughout the animal kingdom, even those with fairly simple nervous systems and body plans. For example, since female [[Mantidae|praying mantids]] are [[Sexual cannibalism|sexually cannibalistic]], the male will typically avail of a concealment form of display behaviour&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loxton|first=R. G.|date=1979-01-01|title=On display behaviour and courtship in the praying mantis Ephestiasula amoena (Bolivar)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01083.x|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=65|issue=1|pages=103–110|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01083.x|issn=0024-4082|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is a series of creeping movements executed by the male as it approaches the female with freezing of the body whenever the female looks towards the male. However, according to laboratory studies conducted by Loxton in 1979, one type of [[Mantis|praying mantis]], ''Ephestiasula arnoena'', shows both male and female counterparts performing overt and ritualized behaviour before mating&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. Both displayed a semaphore behaviour, meaning both displayed their front legs in a boxing fashion before the slow approach of the male from behind &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. This semaphore display in ''E. arnoenais''key in communicating between both mantids that both are ready for copulation and, by extension, the continuance of their genetic line.

Along with the display behaviour shown by the praying mantid, flies belonging to the genus ''[[Megaselia]]'' also show such behaviour&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Brian|last2=Porras|first2=Wendy|date=2015-03-06|title=Extravagant female sexual display in a Megaselia Rondani species (Diptera: Phoridae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/bdj.3.e4368|journal=Biodiversity Data Journal|volume=3|pages=e4368|doi=10.3897/bdj.3.e4368|issn=1314-2828}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Contrary to the typically female-selected mating that occurs for most organisms, these flies have females that show the display behaviour and males that choose the mate. Females have a bright orange colouring that attracts the male and also perform a series of fluttering wing movements that make the insect appear to "dance" and make the openings on their abdomens to swell in order to attract a male &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. It is also interesting to note that there is experimental evidence that implies the female may also release pheromones that attract the male; this is an instance of chemical display behaviour that plays a large role in animal communication &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DISNEY|first=R. HENRY L.|date=2003-09-12|title=The dorsal abdominal glands and the higher classification of the Phoridae (Diptera)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.293.1.1|journal=Zootaxa|volume=293|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.11646/zootaxa.293.1.1|issn=1175-5334}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Arachnids ====
Along with mantids, jumping spiders also show display behaviour. The family [[Jumping spider|Salticidae]] consists of jumping spiders with keen vision which results in very clear display behaviours for courting in particular &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Ximena J.|last2=Jackson|first2=Robert R.|date=2007-09-01|title=Complex display behaviour during the intraspecific interactions of myrmecomorphic jumping spiders (Araneae, Salticidae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930701450504|journal=Journal of Natural History|volume=41|issue=25-28|pages=1659–1678|doi=10.1080/00222930701450504|issn=0022-2933|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Jumping spider|Salticids]] are very similar in appearance to ants that live in the same area and therefore use their appearance to avoid predators. Since this similarity in appearance is so obvious, salticid spiders can use display behaviours to communicate both with members of their own species and also with members of the ants that they mimic &lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;.

=== Vertebrates ===

==== Birds         ====
Birds also very commonly use display behaviours for courtship and communication. [[Manakin|Manakin birds]] (in the family Pipridae) in the Amazon undergo large demonstrations of display behaviour in order to court females in the population &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cárdenas-Posada|first=Ghislaine|last2=Cadena|first2=Carlos Daniel|last3=Blake|first3=John G.|last4=Loiselle|first4=Bette A.|date=2017-11-13|title=Display behaviour, social organization and vocal repertoire of Blue-backed Manakin Chiroxiphia pareola napensis in northwest Amazonia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12548|journal=Ibis|volume=160|issue=2|pages=269–282|doi=10.1111/ibi.12548|issn=0019-1019|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since males provide no other immediate benefit to females, they must undergo ritualized behaviours in order to show their [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] to possible mates; the female then uses the information she gathers from this interaction to make a decision on who she will mate with &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This display behaviour consists of various flight patterns, wing and colour displays, and particular vocalizations  &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. As a result of this performance, the males will be chosen by the female and reproduction will commence.

==== Mammals ====
Along with invertebrates and birds, vertebrates like the [[Harbor seal|harbour seal]] also show display behaviour. Since the harbour seal resides in an aquatic environment, the display behaviours expressed are slightly different from those seen in terrestrial mammal species . Male harbour seals show specific vocalization and diving behaviours while demonstrating such behaviours for possible mates &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Parijs|first=Sofie M.|last2=Hastie|first2=Gordon D.|last3=Thompson|first3=Paul M.|date=2000-03-01|title=Individual and geographical variation in display behaviour of male harbour seals in Scotland|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1999.1307|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|issue=3|pages=559–568|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1307|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As seals are distributed over such a large area, these display behaviours can slightly change geographically as males try to appeal to the largest amount of females possible over a large geographical range. Dive displays, head flicks, and various vocalizations all work together in a display behaviour that signifies to the females in a colony that the males are ready to mate &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;.

== Factors influencing display behaviour in animals ==
Display behaviour is a set of very conspicuous behaviours that allows for the attraction of mates but also can result in the attraction of predators. As a result, animals have certain environmental and social cues that they can use to decide when is the most beneficial time to show such behaviours; they use these triggers to minimize cost ([[Anti-predator adaptation|predator avoidance]]) and maximize gain (mate attraction)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooke|first=P. N.|last2=Alford|first2=R. A.|last3=Schwarzkopf|first3=L.|date=2000-12-04|title=Environmental and social factors influence chorusing behaviour in a tropical frog: examining various temporal and spatial scales|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002650000256|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=49|issue=1|pages=79–87|doi=10.1007/s002650000256|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first factor is temporal. Depending on the time of the season, animals (more specifically, [[Micrixalus|tropical frogs]], in this study) show strong seasonal trends in display behaviour favouring times closer to the beginning of the mating season &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. This is plausible as this allows the most time for the attraction of a mate and the decline in calling to the end of the season is also valid because most organisms will have a mate by then and not have any need to continue such display behaviour. Depending upon the species and evolutionary histories, environmental factors such as temperature, elevation, and precipitation can affect the presence of these behaviours &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. Along with environmental cues, social cues can also play a role in the demonstration of display behaviour. For example, [[Aggression|aggressive]] display behaviour in the [[crayfish]] ''Orconectes virilistends'' to be triggered by impositions of other crayfish on previously established territory &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Daniel I.|last2=Hazlett|first2=Brian A.|date=1974-01-01|title=Examination of the Agonistic Behaviour of the Crayfish Orconectes Virilis By Character Analysis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156853974x00453|journal=Behaviour|volume=50|issue=3|pages=193–215|doi=10.1163/156853974x00453|issn=0005-7959}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Such displays consist of a preliminary raising of claws between 4 to 5 times and if this is not sufficient to warn the other to not encroach on the territory then tactile engagement will occur. In this case, display behaviour is a preliminary step to the engagement of aggressive tactile behaviour whereas many cases of display behaviour result in the engagement of mating rituals.

==Among humans==
Humans typically advertise their suitability as mates in acquiring wealth or fame.  The [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] ''big men'' would stage elaborate [[meal|feasts]] to show the extent of their [[social influence|influence]] and [[power (sociology)|power]]. The [[potlatch]]es of the [[Pacific Northwest]] were held for much of the same effect.

==Tournament species==
[[File:Susa group, mountain gorilla.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Male mountain gorilla]]
Tournament species in [[zoology]] are those [[species]] in which members of one sex (usually [[male]]s) compete in order to mate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wingfield|first=J. C.|last2=Sapolsky|first2=R. M.|date=2003-08-01|title=Reproduction and Resistance to Stress: When and How|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2826.2003.01033.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology|language=en|volume=15|issue=8|pages=711–724|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2826.2003.01033.x|issn=1365-2826}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tournament species, the reproductive success of the small group of competition winners is predominantly higher than that of the large group of losers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tournament species are characterized by fierce same-sex fighting.  Significantly larger or better-armed individuals in these species have an advantage, but only to the competing sex.  Thus, most tournament species have high [[sexual dimorphism]].  Examples of tournament species include [[grouse]], [[peafowl]], [[lion]]s, [[mountain gorilla]]s and [[elephant seal]]s.

In some species, members of the competing sex come together in special display areas called [[Lek (animal behavior)|leks]]. In other species, competition is more direct, in the form of fighting between males.

In a small number of species, females compete for males; these include species of [[Jacanidae|jacana]], species of [[phalarope]], and the [[spotted hyena]]. In all these cases, the female of the species shows traits that help in same-sex battles: larger bodies, aggressiveness, territorialism.  Even maintenance of a multiple-male "harem" is sometimes seen in these animals.

Most species fall on a continuum between tournament species and [[pair-bonding]] species.

Dystrophic lakes, also known as humic lakes, are lakes that contain high amounts of [[humic substances]] and organic acids. The presence of these substances causes the water to be brown in colour and have a generally low [[pH]] of around 4.0-6.0.  Due to these acidic conditions, there is little [[biodiversity]] able to survive, consisting mostly of [[algae]], [[phytoplankton]], picoplankton, and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="DRZY"&gt;Drzymulska, D., Fiłoc, M., Kupryjanowicz, M., Szeroczyńska, K., &amp; Zieliński, P. 2015. Postglacial shifts in lake trophic status based on a multiproxy study of a humic lake. Holocene, 25(3), 495-507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JASS"&gt;Jasser, I.  1997. The dynamics and importance of picoplankton in shallow, dystrophic lake in comparison with surface waters of two deep lakes with contrasting trophic status. Hydrobiologia, 342/343(1), 87-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Ample research has been performed on the many dystrophic lakes located in Eastern Poland, but dystrophic lakes can be found in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name="KOST"&gt;Kostrzewska-Szlakowska, I. 2017. Microbial Biomass and Enzymatic Activity of the Surface Microlayer and Subsurface Water in Two Dystrophic Lakes.  Polish Journal of Microbiology, 66(1), 75-84.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Classification of Dystrophic Lakes==

Lakes can be categorzied according to the increasing productivity as [[Oligotrophic lake|oligotrophic]], mesotrophic, [[eutrophic]], and hypereutrophic.  Dystrophic lakes used to be classified as oligotrophic due to their low [[productivity]].  However, more recent research shows dystrophia can be associated with  any of the trophic types.  This is due to a wider possible pH range (acidic 4.0 to more neutral 8.0 on occasion) and other fluctuating properties like nutrient availability and chemical composition.  Therefore, dystrophia can be categorized as a condition affecting trophic state rather than a trophic state in itself &lt;ref name="KOSTR"&gt;Kostrzewska-Szlakowska, I, Jasser, I. 2011. Black box: what do we know about humic lakes?  Polish Journal of Ecology, 59(4), 647-664.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Chemical Properties==

Dystrophic lakes have a high level of dissolved organic carbon.  This consists of contains organic [[Carboxylic acid|carboxylic]] and [[Phenolic acid|phenolic acids]], which keep water pH levels relatively stable by acting as a natural [[Buffer solution|buffer]].  Therefore, the lake’s naturally acidic pH is largely unaffected by industrial emissions.  Dissolved organic carbon also reduces the entry of ultraviolet radiation and can reduce the [[bioavailability]] of heavy metals by binding them.&lt;ref name="KORO"&gt;Korosi, J. B. and Smol, J. P. 2012. Contrasts between dystrophic and clearwater lakes in the long-term effects of acidification on cladoceran assemblages. Freshwater Biology, 57(1), 2449–2464.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significantly lowered calcium content in the water and [[sediment]] of a dystrophic lake when compared with a regular lake.&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt; [[Essential fatty acid|Essential fatty acids]], like EPA{{clarify|date=December 2017}} and DHA{{clarify|date=December 2017}}, are still present in the organisms in humic lakes, but are downgraded in nutritional quality by this acidic environment, resulting low nutritional quality of dystrophic lake's [[Autotroph|producers]], such as phytoplankton.&lt;ref name="TAI"&gt;Taipale, S.J, Vuorio, K, Strandberg, U, et al. 2016. Lake eutrophication and brownification downgrade availability and transfer of essential fatty acids for human consumption.  Environment International, 96(1), 156-166.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hydrochemical Dystrophy Index is a scale used to evaluate the dystrophy level of lakes.  In 2016, Gorniak proposed a new set of rules for evaluating this index, using properties such as the surface water pH, [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electric conductivity]], and concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon.&lt;ref name="GORN"&gt;Górniak, A. 2016. A new version of the Hydrochemical Dystrophy Index to evaluate dystrophy in lakes. Ecological Indicators, 78(1), 566-573.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because of different preexisting trophic status, lakes affected by dystrophia may differ strongly in their chemical composition from other dystrophic lakes. &lt;ref name="KOSTR" /&gt; Studies of the chemical composition of dystrophic lakes have shown heightened levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and higher activities of [[lipase]] and [[Glucosidases|glucosidase]] in polyhummic lakes when compared with oligohumic lakes.  In oligohumic lakes, the surface microlayers have higher levels of [[phosphatase]] activity than the subsurface microlayers. The opposite is true when the lake is polyhumic.  Both oligohumic and polyhumic lakes show higher [[aminopeptidase]] activity in the subsurface microlayers than in the surface microlayers.&lt;ref name="KOST" /&gt;

==Life in Dystrophic Lakes==

The [[Drainage basin|catchment area]] of a dystrophic lake is usually a [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forest rich with [[Sphagnum|peat mosses]] that spread along the water surface.&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt; Despite the presence of ample nutrients, dystrophic lakes can be considered nutrient-poor, because their nutrients are trapped in organic matter, and, therefore. are unavailable to primary producers.&lt;ref name="DRAK"&gt;Drakare, S, Blomqvist, P, Bergstro, A, et al. 2003. Relationships between picophytoplankton and environmental variables in lakes along a gradient of water colour and nutrient content.  Freshwater Biology, 48(1), 729-740.&lt;/ref&gt; The organic matter in dystrophic lakes is mainly is allochthonous: it is terrestrially derived: organic matter removed in the catchment area gradually fills this aquatic environment. Due to this organic matter rich [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], it is bacterioplankton that contraols for the rate of nutrient flux between the aquatic and terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name="NEW"&gt;Newton, R.J. et al. 2006. Microbial community dynamics in a humic lake: differential persistence of common freshwater phylotypes. Environmental Microbiology, 8(6), 956-970.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bacteria are found in high numbers and have great growth potentials despite dystrophic conditions. These bacteria drive the food web of humic lakes by providing energy and supplying usable forms of organic and inorganic carbon to other organisms, primiarily to [[Phagocytosis|phagotrophic]] and [[Mixotroph|mixotrophic]] [[Flagellate|flagellates]]. &lt;ref name="SAL"&gt;Salonen, K, and Jokinen, S.  1988.  Flagellate grazing on bacteria in a small dystrophic lake.  Hydrobiologia, 161(1), 203-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Decomposition of organic matter by bacteria converts also organic nitrogen and phosphorus into their inorganic forms which are now available for uptake by  primary producers which includes both large and small phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria).&lt;ref name="JASS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt; The biological activity of humic lakes is, however, dominated by bacterial [[metabolism]], which dominates the [[food web]].  The  chemistry of humic lakes makes it difficult for higher trophic levels such as [[Planktivore|planktivorous]] fish to establish themselves, leaving a simplified food web consisting mostly of plants, plankton, and bacteria.&lt;ref name="NEW" /&gt; The dominance of the bacteria means that the dystrophic lakes to have a higher [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] rate than [[primary production]] rate.&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt;

==Impacts of Dystrophication on a Lake Ecosystem==

The formation of a humic lake via organic runoff has a dramatic effect on the lake [[ecosystem]].  Chemical composition changes that increase the lake’s acidity make it difficult for fish and other organisms to [[Cell proliferation|proliferate]].  The quality of the lake for use as drinking water also decreases as the carbon concentration and acidity increase. The fish that do adapt to the increased acidity may also not be fit for human consumption, as the [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollutant]]s. Concentrations and mobility of heavy metals may also be altered as a result of changes in chemical composition of a humic lake.&lt;ref name="LARS"&gt;Larsen, S., Andersen, T., and Hessen, D. O.  2010.  Global Change Biology, 17(2), 1186-1192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dystrophic Lakes and Climate Change==

Lakes are commonly known to be important sinks in the [[carbon cycle]].  Due to their high levels of dissolved organic carbon, dystrophic lakes are significantly larger carbon sinks than clear lakes.&lt;ref name="SOB"&gt;Sobek, S. et al.  2006.  A Carbon Budget of a Small Humic Lake: An Example of the Importance of Lakes for Organic Matter Cycling in Boreal Catchments.  Ambio, 35(8), 469-475.&lt;/ref&gt; The elevated levels of carbon concentrations in humic lakes are affected by vegetation patterns in the catchment area, the runoff from which is the main source of organic material.  However, changes in these levels can also be attributed to shifts in precipitation, modifications of soil [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralization]] rates, reduced [[Sulfate|sulphate]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]], and changes in temperature.  All these factors can be affected by [[climate change]]. Overall, climate change is expected to increase the supply of organic carbon to lakes and therefore change the character of some to the dystrophic one &lt;ref name="LARS"/&gt;.

==Examples of Dystrophic Lakes==

Examples of dystrophic lakes that have been studied by scientists include Lake Suchar II in Poland, and lakes Allgjuttern, Fiolen, and Brunnsjön in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="DRZY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GORN" /&gt;

}}The '''European Foundation for Management Development''' ('''EFMD''') is an international not-for-profit association, based in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=L'European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.groupeiam.com/index.php/accueil-efmd/72-international/organismes-internationaux-de-labellisation/100-l-european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://www.groupeiam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's largest network association in the field of management development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba-courses.com/efmd.htm |title=European Foundation for Management Development: EQUIS Accreditation: A Level of Quality |work=MBA Courses Worldwide |publisher=Sandringham Publishing Ltd |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has over 890 member organizations from [[academia]], business, public service and consultancy in 88 countries (as of September 2017). EFMD provides a forum for networking in [[management development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development|url=http://10times.com/organizers/european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://10times.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFMD operates the '''EFMD Quality Improvement System''' ([[EFMD Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]]), which is one of the leading international systems of quality assessment, improvement, and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business administration. It is comparable to its American equivalent [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] and provides a forum for information, research, networking and debate on innovation and best practice in management development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hayleys case study by INSEAD wins top award in Europe |location=Sri Lanka |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|The Daily Mirror]] |date=3 June 2010 |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/print/index.php/business/127-local/12150.html |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation also runs the EPAS accreditation system for programmes as well as the EFMD Deans Across Frontiers development programme (EDAF) and the Business School Impact System (BSIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.unprme.org/about-prme/governance/efmd.php|journal=http://www.unprme.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types of accreditation ==

While the [[EQUIS]] accreditation process, which is valid for an entire school (or faculty), is the main type of accreditation EFMD offers, there are a variety of other accreditations available. With EPAS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= EPAS Accreditation EFMD Programme accreditation System (EPAS) |url=http://www.efmd.org/index.php/services-for-business-schools/epas-accreditation |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible for business schools to have certain degree programs accredited rather than the entire school. This variant somewhat resembles the AMBA ([[Association of MBAs]]) accreditation, as the London-based Association accredits the school's entire portfolio of [[MBA]] programs, but does not accredit the entire business school. EFMD also offers an accreditation for online courses (EOCCS) and for corporate learning (CLIP).

== Triple Accreditation ==

In business and management education, acquiring multiple accreditation by [[EQUIS]], [[AACSB]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]] is often considered the "gold standard" because a business school must go to through a rigorous certification process by each of the three accreditation bodies. Schools that acquire all three are often referred to as having a [[Triple accreditation]] or Triple Crown accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Grandes écoles: les labels enfin décryptés|url=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/info/labels-accreditations-grandes-ecoles-enfin-decryptes.html|journal=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr|date = 13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EFMD activities ==

EFMD is the European partner in the [[China Europe International Business School]] ([[CEIBS]]), a joint venture with [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]] established as the first international business school with autonomous status in 1994 under an agreement between the [[European Commission]] and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
EFMD is also founding partner of the Global Foundation for Management Education (GFME), which is a joint venture with the US-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([[AACSB]] International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFMD organizes conferences and seminars around the world for management development industry and published the [http://globalfocusmagazine.com Global Focus magazine].

In 2009, EFMD received an EU grant worth €2.2m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2009 Annual Action Programme for Non-State Actors and Local Authorities in Development |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/documents/aap/2009/af_aap_2009_dci-nsa_p2.pdf |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a project that aims to improve the efficiency of Cuban companies by providing training to senior managers. This project, called '''Consolidating and Strengthening Cuban Managerial Capabilities''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Consolidating and Strengthening Cuban Managerial Capabilities |url=http://www.efmd.org/index.php/international-projects/current-projects/cuba-project |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to be implemented under the leadership of EFMD together with [[ESADE]], a business school in Barcelona, and the Cuban Ministry of Higher Education.

'''GenMAPP''' (Gene Map Annotator and Pathway Profiler) is a free, [[open-source software|open-source]] [[bioinformatics]] software tool designed to visualize and analyze [[genomic]] data in the context of pathways ([[metabolic pathways|metabolic]], [[Cell signaling networks|signaling]]), connecting gene-level datasets to biological processes and disease. First created in 2000, GenMAPP is developed by an open-source team based in an academic research laboratory. GenMAPP maintains databases of gene identifiers and collections of pathway maps in addition to visualization and analysis tools.  Together with other public resources, GenMAPP aims to provide the research community with tools to gain insight into biology through the integration of data types ranging from genes to proteins to pathways to disease.

==History==

GenMAPP was first created in 2000 as a prototype software tool in the laboratory of [http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu/gladstone/site/conklin/ Bruce Conklin] at the [http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu J. David Gladstone Institutes] in [[San Francisco]] and continues to be developed in the same non-profit, academic research environment. The first release version of GenMAPP 1.0 was available in 2002 [1], supporting analysis of [[DNA microarray]] data from [[homo sapiens|human]], [[mus musculus|mouse]], [[rattus norvegicus|rat]] and [[saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]]. In 2004, GenMAPP 2.0 was released, combining the previously accessory programs MAPPFinder [2] and MAPPBuilder, and expanding support to additional species. GenMAPP 2.1 was released in 2006 with new visualization features and support for a total of eleven species.

==Usage==

GenMAPP was developed by biologists and is focused on pathway visualization for bench biologists. Unlike many other computational [[systems biology]] tools, GenMAPP is not designed for cell/systems modeling; it focuses on the immediate needs of bench biologists by enabling them to rapidly interpret [[genomic]] data with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.
GenMAPP is implemented in [[Visual Basic]] 6.0 and is available as a stand-alone application for [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems, including [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] or [[Parallels Workstation]] on a Mac. The program is freely available for [http://www.genmapp.org/login/loginerror.php?ReferPage=/download-genmapp2.php download] and includes an automatic update feature that allows rapid and reliable distribution of updates to the program and documentation.

==Content and Features==

GenMAPP builds and maintains gene databases for a variety of key [[model organism]]s:

* human - ''[[Homo sapiens]]''
* mouse - ''[[Mus musculus]]''
* rat - ''[[Rattus norvegicus]]''
* yeast - ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''
* zebrafish - ''[[Danio rerio]]''

}}The '''Hertie School of Governance''' is a German private independent [[graduate school]] located in [[Berlin]]'s [[Friedrichstraße]]. It has a right to confer doctoral degrees. Half of the students in the Hertie School come from abroad, and the [[working language]] is [[English language|English]].

Predominantly, Hertie's students have backgrounds in law, economics, political science and international relations and pursue a Master of Public Policy or Master of International Affairs degree. The school offers its students the opportunity to complete a "professional year" at a [[multinational corporation]], government ministry or an international organization. In addition to this possibility, research collaboration with faculty is encouraged. The Hertie School also offers an Executive Masters of Public Administration.
[[File:Hsog-exterior.jpg|thumb|South West Wing of Hertie School of Governance]]
Hertie students who are also admitted at a partner university, such as [[Sciences Po]] or [[Syracuse University]] can spend their second year in these institutions and earn an additional master's degree. Or students can pursue study abroad opportunities at one of the Hertie School's nearly 30 academic partners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hertie-school.org/en/studyabroad/|title=Hertie School {{!}} Study abroad|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide.

The research focus of the Hertie School, which has existed since its founding, lies in the analysis of the conditions, structures and dynamics of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/download/archiv/hginfo_3017_Hertie.pdf|title=Hertie School of Governance {{!}} Hintergrundinformation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Hertie School of Governance was founded by the [http://www.ghst.de Hertie Foundation], located in [[Frankfurt]]. The school was established in 2003 as one of the first European professional schools for public policy.

In February 2005, the Hertie School was awarded state recognition as college of higher education by the Berlin Ministry of Science, Research, and Culture (Senatsverwaltung für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur). The work of the Hertie School is based on four pillars: Research, Degree Programmes (Master of Public Policy, Master of International Affairs, Executive Master of Public Administration, and the Berlin School for Transnational Studies), Executive Education, and Knowledge Transfer.

In October 2017, the Hertie School once again received full accreditation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/download/archiv/6648-17.pdf|title=Stellungnahme zur Reakkreditierung (Promotionsrecht) der Hertie School of Governance, Berlin|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to confer doctoral degrees for another ten years.[[Image:Hsog-name.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hertie School of Governance]]

==Enrollment==
In September 2017, a total of 586 students were enrolled in the school. This includes 460 master’s students, 68 Executive MPA participants and 58 doctoral students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hertie-school.org/en/who-we-are/facts/|title=Who we are {{!}} Facts and figures|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hertie School of Governance has a highly selective application process.

==Academic programmes==
The [[Master of Public Policy]] (MPP) programme offers teaching on corporate relations &amp; government affairs in the public, civil society and private sectors. The programme is intended for students pursuing a future career dealing professionally with problems of modern governance, international relations, advanced economics and politics. Upon completion of the two-year programme, students receive the Master of Public Policy (MPP). Prospective students have typically studied economics, law or political science, but candidates from every field of study apply for admission.

The Master of International Affairs (MIA) programme, a new programme added in fall 2015, focuses on [[international relations]]. It prepares for positions requiring a profound understanding of today’s global policy challenges.

The Executive Master of [[Public Administration]] (EMPA) programme is aimed at experienced professionals for whom cooperation between government, business and civil society is an important part of their work. Participants in the Executive MPA programme choose an individual area of concentration and can either study full-time over a period of one year or complete the programme over a period of two years if they wish to study part-time while working. Prospective students must have at least two years' professional work experience, as well as an educational background in economics, law or social sciences. There exist exchange programmes with the [[ESCP Europe]], the [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[University of Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;://www.hertie-school.org/empa/partners-exchanges/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hertie School of Governance also offers a PhD study programme as part of the [[Berlin Graduate School for Transnational Studies]] (BTS), a joint endeavour of the [[Free University of Berlin]] (FUB), the Hertie School of Governance (HSoG) and the [[WZB Berlin Social Science Center]].

In autumn 2012, the Hertie School welcomed its first PhD cohort. PhD candidates take core curriculum courses in their first year while beginning their dissertation research and are expected to complete their PhDs within three years.

==Faculty==
Members of the core faculty are President [[Helmut Anheier|Helmut K. Anheier]], Kerstin Bernoth, Ba¸sak Çalı, Luciana Cingolani, Mark Dawson, [[Henrik Enderlein]], Christian Flachsland, Lukas Graf, Mark Hallerberg, Gerhard Hammerschmid, Anke Hassel, Lion Hirth, [[Klaus Hurrelmann]], [[Wolfgang Ischinger]], Markus Jachtenfuchs, Christian Joerges, Mark Kayser, [[Claudia Kemfert]], Genia Kostka (Fellow), Michaela Kreyenfeld, Johanna Mair, Jan Christoph Minx, [[Alina Mungiu-Pippidi]], [[Jean Pisani-Ferry]], Andrea Römmele, Hanna Schwander (from 01.02.2018), Daniela Stockmann, Christian Traxler, Kai Wegrich and Julian Wucherpfennig.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hertie-school.org/faculty/ Webseite der Hertie School of Governance: Core Faculty], retrieved 26 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
The Hertie School of Governance has established dual degree programs: with the MPA Programme at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] (LSE), the MPP Programme at the School of Public Affairs at [[Sciences Po]] in [[Paris]], and the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] (SIPA) at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], the Programme in Government and International Organizations at [[Bocconi University]] in [[Milan]] and MPP Program at the [[University of Tokyo]].

Apart from the dual degree programmes, students also have the option to spend an exchange semester at the [[Georgetown Public Policy Institute]] (GPPI) at [[Georgetown University]], the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] at the [[National University of Singapore]], the [[Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy]] at [[Duke University]], the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at [[Syracuse University]], the School of Public Policy &amp; Management at [[Tsinghua University]], the [[Graduate School of Public Policy, University of Tokyo]], [[Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration]] at [[The George Washington University]], [[American University School of Public Affairs]] at [[American University]] and the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in Geneva.

ITC promotes [[PhD]] Research in collaboration with universities in the Netherlands. In addition, ITC undertakes applied and technological consultancy projects world wide and contributes to fundamental research in the fields of its expertise.

==Education at ITC ==
More than 19,000 students from over 170 countries have followed ITC courses since 1950. The institute's degrees are accredited by the Dutch system of higher education.

ITC offers degree, diploma and certificate courses in geo-information science and earth observation applied to eight domains: Disaster management; Earth sciences; Geoinformatics; Governance; Land administration; Natural resources; Urban planning; and Water resources.

ITC has several joint educational programmes with partner institutes in the developing world, for example joint MSc programmes in geo-hazards with the [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]] in [[Dehradun]], [[India]] and [[Gadjah Mada University]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. It also offers much of its curriculum as distance education modules, and offers custom training courses to meet specific capacity building requirements, both in Enschede and abroad.

{{Sociolinguistics}}

'''Language planning''' (also known as '''language engineering''') is a deliberate effort to influence the function, structure, or acquisition of [[languages]] or [[dialects|language variety]] within a [[speech community]].&lt;ref name= Kaplan&gt;Kaplan B., Robert, and Richard B. Baldauf Jr. ''Language Planning from Practice to Theory.''  Clevedon: Multilingual Matters ltd., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[government]] planning, but is also used by a variety of [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as grass-roots organizations, and individuals. Goals of such planning vary. Better communication through assimilation of a single dominant language can bring economic benefits to minorities but is also perceived to facilitate their political domination.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias&gt;Cobarrubias, Juan.  "Ethical Issues in Status Planning."  ''Progress in Language Planning: International Perspectives''.  Eds. Juan Cobarrubias and Joshua Fishman.  New York: Mouton Publishers, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the establishment of language regulators, such as formal or informal agencies, committees, societies or academies, to design or develop new structures to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref&gt;''Language: An Introduction,'' Lehmann, W.P., 1983, Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ideology ==

Four overarching [[language ideology|language ideologies]] motivate decision making in language planning.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias /&gt;  The first, linguistic assimilation, is the belief that every member of a society, irrespective of their [[First language|native language]], should learn and use the dominant language of the society in which they live.  An example is the [[English-only movement]] of some residents of the [[United States]].

In contrast is the second ideology, linguistic pluralism - the recognition and support of multiple languages within one society.  Examples include the coexistence of [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]] in [[Switzerland]]; and the shared official status of [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in [[Singapore]].  The coexistence of many languages may not necessarily arise from a conscious language ideology, but rather related to the relative efficiency in communication of a common language.

The third ideology, vernacularization, denotes the restoration and development of an indigenous language, along with its adoption by the state as an [[official language]].  Examples include [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the state of [[Israel]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in [[Peru]].

The final ideology, internationalization, is the adoption of a non-indigenous language as a means of wider communication, as an official language or in a particular domain, such as the use of English in [[India]], Singapore, the [[Philippines]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[South Africa]].

==Goals==

Eleven language planning goals have been recognized (Nahir 2003):&lt;ref name=Nahir&gt;Nahir, Moshe. "Language Planning Goals: A Classification." ''Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings.'' Eds.  Paulston, Christina Bratt and G. Richard Tucker.  Oxford: Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
# Language Purification – prescription of usage in order to preserve the "[[linguistic purism|linguistic purity]]" of language, protect language from foreign influences, and guard against language deviation from within
# [[Language revitalization|Language Revival]] – the attempt to restore to common use a language that has few or no surviving native speakers&lt;ref&gt;Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann claims that any attempt to revive a no-longer spoken language is likely to end up with a hybrid - see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf "Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns"]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Language reform|Language Reform]] – deliberate change in specific aspects of language, such as [[orthography]], [[spelling]], or [[grammar]], in order to facilitate use
# Language Standardization – the attempt to garner [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] for a regional language or dialect, developing it as the chosen major language, or [[standard language]], of a [[region]]
# Language Spread – the attempt to increase the number of speakers of a language
# Lexical Modernization – word creation or adaptation
# Terminology Unification – development of unified [[terminology|terminologies]], primarily in technical domains
# Stylistic Simplification – simplification of language usage in [[lexicon]], grammar, and style. That includes modifying the use of language in social and formal contexts.
# Interlingual Communication – facilitation of linguistic communication between members of distinct speech communities
# Language Maintenance – preservation of the use of a group's native language as a first or [[second language]] where pressures threaten or cause a decline in the status of the language
# Auxiliary-Code Standardization – standardization of marginal, auxiliary aspects of language, such as signs for the deaf, place names, or rules of [[transliteration]] and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]

== Types ==
Language planning has been divided into three types:

=== Status planning ===
Status planning is the allocation or reallocation of a language or variety to functional domains within a society, thus affecting the status, or standing, of a language.

==== Language status ====
Language status is a concept distinct from, though intertwined with, language [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and language function. Strictly speaking, language status is the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, John. "Language, Prestige, and Stigma," in ''Contact Linguistics''. Ed. Hans Goebel. New York: de Gruyter, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A language garners status according to the fulfillment of four attributes, described in 1968 by two different authors, [[Heinz Kloss]] and [[William Alexander Stewart|William Stewart]]. Both Kloss and Stewart stipulated four qualities of a language that determine its status. Their respective frameworks differ slightly, but they emphasize four common attributes:
# Language origin – whether a given language is indigenous or imported to the speech community
# Degree of standardization – the extent of development of a formal set of norms that define 'correct' usage
# Juridical status
##Sole official language (e.g. French in France and Turkish in Turkey)
##Joint official language (e.g. English and [[Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]]; French, German, Italian and Romansh in Switzerland)
##Regional official language (e.g. [[Igbo language|Igbo]] in [[Nigeria]]; [[Marathi language|Marathi]] in [[Maharashtra]], India)
##Promoted language – lacks official status on a national or regional level but is promoted and sometimes used by public authorities for specific functions (e.g. [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[New Mexico]]; [[West African Pidgin English]] in [[Cameroon]])
##Tolerated language – neither promoted nor proscribed; acknowledged but ignored (e.g. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] in the [[United States]] in present day)
##Proscribed language – discouraged by official sanction or restriction (e.g. Galician, Basque and Catalan during [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime in Spain; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] in [[Greece]]);&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. "Planning," in ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; indigenous American languages during the [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school era]]&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;cite [http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf Jennifer Jones, Dee Ann Bosworth, Amy Lonetree,  "American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing"], Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways, 2011, accessed 25 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
#Vitality – the ratio, or percent, of users of a language to another variable, like the total population.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias/&gt; Kloss and Stewart both distinguish six classes of statistical distribution. However, they draw the line between classes at different percentages. According to Kloss, the first class, the highest level of vitality, is demarcated by 90% or more speakers. The five remaining classes in decreasing order are 70–89%, 40–69%, 20–39%, 3–19%, and less than 3%. Stewart defines the six classes are determined by the following percentages of speakers: 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and less than 5%.

Together, origin, degree of standardization, juridical status, and vitality express a language's status.

William Stewart outlines ten functional domains in language planning:&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;Stewart, William A.  "Sociolinguistic Typology of Multilingualism," in ''Readings in the Sociology of Language''.  Ed. Joshua Fishman.  The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Official – An official language "function[s] as a legally appropriate language for all politically and culturally representative purposes on a nationwide basis."&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt;  Often, the official function of a language is specified in a [[constitution]].
#Provincial – A provincial language functions as an official language for a geographic area smaller than a nation, typically a [[province]] or [[region]] (e.g. French in [[Quebec]])&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Cooper, Robert L.  ''Language Planning and Social Change''.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Wider communication – A language of wider communication is a language that may be official or provincial, but more importantly, functions as a medium of communication across language boundaries within a nation (e.g. [[Hindi]] in India; [[Swahili language]] in [[East Africa]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#International – An international language functions as a medium of communication across national boundaries (e.g. English, formerly French as a diplomatic and international language)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Capital – A capital language functions as a prominent language in and around a national [[capital (political)|capital]] (e.g. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and French in [[Brussels]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Group – A group language functions as a conventional language among the members of a single cultural or ethnic group (e.g. Hebrew amongst the [[Jews]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Educational – An educational language functions as a medium of instruction in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools on a regional or national basis ([[Urdu]] in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in [[East Pakistan]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#School subject – A school subject language is a language that is taught as a subject in secondary school or [[higher education]] (e.g. [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] in English-language schools)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Literary – A literary language functions as a language for [[literature|literary]] or [[scholarly]] purposes (Ancient Greek)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Religious – A religious language functions as a language for the ritual purposes of a particular religion (e.g. Latin for the [[Latin Rite]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; [[Arabic]] for the reading of the [[Qur'an]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;

Robert Cooper, in reviewing Stewart's list, makes several additions.  First, he creates three sub-types of official functions: statutory, working, and symbolic.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;  A statutory language is a language that a government has declared official by law. A working language is a language that a government uses as a medium for daily activities, and a symbolic language is a language that is a [[symbol]] of the state. Cooper also adds two functional domains to Stewart's list: mass media and work.

===Corpus planning===
Corpus planning refers to the [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] intervention in the forms of a language, whereby planning decisions are made to engineer changes in the structure of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonG&gt;Ferguson, Gibson. (2006). ''Language Planning and Education.'' Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus planning activities often arise as the result of beliefs about the adequacy of the form of a language to serve desired functions.&lt;ref name=Hornberger&gt;Hornberger, Nancy H. (2006). "Frameworks and Models in Language Policy and Planning", in Thomas Ricento, ''An Introduction to Language Policy'', Wiley-Blackwell, pp 24-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike status planning, which is primarily undertaken by administrators and politicians, corpus planning generally is performed by individuals with greater linguistic expertise.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; There are three traditionally recognized types of corpus planning: graphization, standardization, and modernization.

====Graphization====
Graphization refers to development, selection and modification of [[writing system|scripts]] and orthographic conventions for a language.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J. (2005). "Corpus Planning: Syllabus and Materials Development," in Eli Hinkel, ''Handbook of Research in Second Language Teaching and Learning'', Routledge, pp 993-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of writing in a speech community can have lasting sociocultural effects, which include easier transmission of material through generations, communication with larger numbers of people, and a standard against which varieties of spoken language are often compared.&lt;ref name=FergusonC&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. (1968). "Language Development", in Charles A. Ferguson, Thom Huebner (1996), ''Sociolinguistic Perspectives: papers on language in society, 1959-1994'', Oxford University Press US, pp 40-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]] made two key observations about the results of adopting a writing system. First, the use of writing adds another variety of the language to the community's repertory. Although written language is often viewed as secondary to spoken language, the [[vocabulary]], [[grammar|grammatical structures]] and [[phonology|phonological structures]] of a language often adopt characteristics in the written form that are distinct from the spoken variety. Second, the use of writing often leads to a folk belief that the written language is the 'real' language, and speech is a corruption of it. Written language is viewed as more conservative, while the spoken variety is more susceptible to language change. Isolated relic areas of the spoken language may be less innovative than the written form, or the written language may have been based on a divergent variety of the spoken language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

In establishing a writing system for a language, corpus planners have the option of using an existing system or creating a new one. The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Japan]] chose to adopt the [[Japanese language]]'s [[katakana]] [[syllabary]] as the writing system for the [[Ainu language]]. Katakana is designed for a language with a basic CV [[syllable structure]], but Ainu contains many CVC syllables that cannot easily be adapted to this syllabary. As a result, Ainu uses a modified katakana system, in which syllable-final [[syllable coda|codas]] are [[consonants]] by a [[subscript]] version of a katakana symbol that begins with the desired consonant.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat /&gt;

An example on a created script includes the development of the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] in 405 AD by [[Saint Mesrob|St. Mesrop Mashtots]]. Though the script was modeled after the [[Greek alphabet]], the original script distinguished Armenian from the Greek and [[Syriac alphabet]]s of the neighboring peoples.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Similarly, in the early 19th century, [[Sequoyah]] (Cherokee) created an orthography for written [[Cherokee]] in the Southeast of the present-day United States. It uses some Latin characters but also introduces new ones.

====Standardization====
The process of Standardization often involves one variety of a language taking precedence over other social and regional [[dialect]]s of a language.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Christian, Donna (1988). "Language Planning: the view from linguistics", in Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''Language: the socio-cultural context'', Cambridge University Press, pp 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, where dialects are mutually intelligible, is to introduce a poly-phonemic written form that is intended to represent all dialects of a language adequately but with no standard spoken form. If one variety of a language is chosen, that variety comes to be understood as supra-dialectal and the 'best' form of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The choice of which language takes precedence has important societal consequences, as it confers privilege upon speakers whose spoken and written dialect conforms closest to the chosen standard.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;Wiley, Terrance G. (2003). "Language Planning and Policy," in Sandra McKay, Nancy H. Horberger, ''Sociolinguistics and Language Teaching'', Cambridge University Press, pp 103-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard that is chosen as the norm is generally spoken by the most powerful social group within the society, and is imposed upon the less powerful groups as the form to emulate. This often reinforces the dominance of the powerful social group and makes the standard norm necessary for socioeconomic mobility.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; In practice, standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as the [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]] of the norm.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The history of English provides an example of standardization occurring over an extended time period, without formally recognized language planning. The standardization process began when [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] in [[England]] in 1476. This was accompanied by the adoption of the south-east [[English Midlands|Midlands]] variety of English, spoken in [[London]], as the print language. Because of the dialect's use for administrative, government, business, and literary purposes, this variety became entrenched as the prestigious variety of English. After the creation of [[grammar]]s and [[dictionaries]] in the 18th century, the rise of print [[Capitalism#As a mode of production|capitalism]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and [[mass education]] led to the dissemination of this dialect as the standard norm for the English language.

====Modernization====
Modernization is a form of language planning that occurs when a language needs to expand its resources to meet functions. Modernization often occurs when a language undergoes a shift in status, such as when a [[country]] gains [[independence]] from a [[colonialism|colonial power]] or when there is a change in the language [[education policy]].&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; The most significant force in modernization is the expansion of the [[lexicon]], which allows the language to discuss topics in modern [[semantic domain]]s. Language planners generally focus on creating new lists and [[glossary|glossaries]] to describe new technical terms, but it is also necessary to ensure that the new terms are consistently used by the appropriate sectors within society. While some languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], have experienced rapid lexical expansion to meet the demands of modernization, other languages, such as [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt; Rapid lexical expansion is aided by the use of new terms in textbooks and professional publications, as well as frequent use among specialists. Issues of [[linguistic purism]] often play a significant role in lexical expansion, but technical vocabulary can be effective within a language, regardless of whether it comes from the language's own process of [[word formation]] or from extensive [[loanword|borrowing]] from another language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC/&gt; While Hungarian has almost exclusively used language-internal processes to create new lexical items, Japanese has borrowed extensively from English to derive new words as part of its modernization.

=== Acquisition planning ===
Acquisition planning is a type of language planning in which a national, state or local government system aims to influence aspects of language, such as language status, distribution and literacy through education. Acquisition planning can also be used by non-governmental organizations, but it is more commonly associated with government planning.&lt;ref&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J., and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr., "Language Planning in Local Contexts: Agents, Contexts and Interactions." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''. Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, acquisition planning is integrated into a larger language planning process in which the statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Sociolinguistic Settings of Language Planning." ''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a [[multilingualism|bilingual]] language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language's script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language's status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote [[language revitalization]], which can change a language's status or reverse a [[language shift]], or to promote linguistic purism.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Language Planning Processes"''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.

====The education sector====
The education [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] or education sector of government is typically in charge of making national [[language acquisition]] decisions based on state and local evaluation reports. The responsibilities of education sectors vary by country; [[Robert B. Kaplan]] and Richard B. Baldauf describe the sectors' six principal goals:&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

# To decide what languages should be taught within the [[curriculum]].
# To determine the amount and quality of [[teacher training]].
# To involve local [[communities]].
# To determine what materials will be used and how they will be incorporated into [[syllabi]].
# To establish a local and state [[Educational assessment|assessment]] system to monitor progress.
# To determine financial [[cost]]s.

====Problems====
Although acquisition planning can be useful to governments, there are several problems that must be considered.&lt;ref name= Thorburn&gt;Thorburn, Thomas. "Cost-Benefit Analysis in Language Planning." ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Even with a solid evaluation and assessment system, the effects of planning methods can never be certain; governments must consider the effects on other aspects of state planning, such as economic and political planning. Some proposed acquisition changes could also be too drastic or instituted too suddenly without proper planning and organization. Acquisition planning can also be financially draining, so adequate planning and awareness of financial resources is essential. It is important therefore that government goals, such as those described above, be organized and planned carefully.&lt;ref name= Thorburn /&gt;

====Multilingualism====
There is also a growing concern over the treatment of [[multilingualism]] in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Mansor, Sabiha. ''Language Planning in Higher Education''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several [[first language|(native) languages]]. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity.&lt;ref name= Fishman&gt;Fishman, Joshua A. "The Impact of Nationalism on Language Planning," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Some states prefer incorporating different languages in order to help students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.

====Non-governmental organizations====
In addition to the education sector, there are non-governmental sectors or organizations that have a significant effect on language acquisition, such as the [[Académie française]] of France or the [[Real Academia Española]] of Spain.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt; These organizations often create their own dictionaries and grammar books, thus affecting the materials which students are exposed to in schools. Although these organizations do not hold official power, they influence government planning decisions, such as with educational materials, affecting acquisition.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

====Ireland====
Before the partition of [[Ireland]], a movement began which aimed at the restoration of [[Irish language|Irish]], as the nation's primary language, based on a widespread sentiment for Irish nationalism and cultural identity.&lt;ref name= Macnamara&gt;Macnamara, John. "Successes and Failures in the Movement for the Restoration of Irish," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; During and after colonisation, Irish had competed with English and [[Scots language|Scots]];  the movement to restore the language gained momentum after the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] was created to promote the acquisition of Irish in schools, thus "de-Anglicizing" Ireland.&lt;ref name= Macnamara /&gt; Immediately after Ireland gained independence in 1922, the League declared that Irish must be the language of instruction for at least one hour in primary schools nationwide. Irish-speaking teachers were recruited, and preparatory colleges were established to train new ones.

The program implementation was mostly left to the individual schools, which did not consistently carry it out. Additionally, educating a generation is a long process, for which the League was not prepared. There was no consensus as to how the Irish language should be reinstituted; the League and schools did not develop a system assessment plan to monitor progress. As a result, the movement lost strength, and the number of native Irish speakers has been in steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Giolla Chriost, Diarmait. "Micro-level Language Planning in Ireland." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''  Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case study: Quechua in Peru ==

=== Status planning ===
[[Peru]]'s history of language planning begins in the 16th century with Spanish [[colonization]].  When the Spanish first arrived in Peru, [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] served as a language of wider communication, a lingua franca, between Spaniards and Peruvian natives. As the years passed, Spaniards asserted the superiority of the Spanish language; as a result, Spanish gained prestige, taking over as a language of wider communication and the dominant language of Peru.&lt;ref name= CoronelM&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. "Functional Domains of the Quechua Language in Peru: Issues of Status Planning." University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, under the leadership of President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], the revolutionary government of Peru declared Quechua an official language of the Peruvian state, "coequal with Spanish."&lt;ref name=Hornberger2&gt;Hornberger, Nancy and Kendell A. King. "Authenticity and Unification in Quechua Language Planning." University of Pennsylvania: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the law was reversed.&lt;ref name=CoronelM /&gt; Peru's 1979 [[constitution]] declares Spanish the only official language of the state; Quechua and Aymara are relegated to "official use zones," equivalent to Stewart's provincial function described above. Quechua has officially remained a provincial language since 1979.  Today, Quechua also serves a limited international function throughout [[South America]] in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]]; communities of Quechua speakers outside Peru enable communication in Quechua across borders. Still, because of Quechua's low status, Spanish is almost always used as the lingua franca instead. Recently, Quechua has also gained ground in the academic world, both as a school subject and a topic of literary interest.

=== Corpus planning ===
The three main types of corpus planning are all evident in the development of Quechua languages in Peru since the colonial era. Graphization has been in process since the arrival of the Spanish in the region, when the Spanish imperialists attempted to describe the exotic sounds of the language to Europeans.&lt;ref name= Coronel&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. (1996). "Corpus Planning for the Southern Peruvian Quechua Language." ''Working Papers in Educational Linguistics,'' 12 (2), pp 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Quechua was made an official language in Peru in 1975, the introduction of the language into the education and government domains made it essential to have a standard written language.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;  The task of adopting a writing system proved to be a point of contention among Peruvian linguists. Although most agreed to use the [[Latin alphabet]], linguists disagreed about how to represent the phonological system of Quechua, particularly in regards to the vowel system. Representatives from the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua|Peruvian Academy of the Quechua language]] and the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] wanted to represent [[allophone]]s of the [[vowel]]s /i/ and /u/ with separate letters &lt;e&gt; and &lt;o&gt;, which creates an apparent five-vowel system. They argued that this makes the language easier to learn for people who are already familiar with written Spanish. However, other Peruvian linguists argued that a three-vowel system was more faithful to the [[phonology]] of Quechua. After several years of debate and disagreement, in 1985 Peruvian linguists proposed the Pan-Quechua alphabet as an accurate representation of the language, and this was adopted in [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs and textbooks. However, the Peruvian Academy and the SIL both refused to adopt it and continued to propose new alphabets, leaving the issue unsettled.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt; For more information, see [[Quechua languages#Writing system|Quechua writing system]] and [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]]. Another of the primary issues disagreements was about how to reflect the phonological differences apparent in different dialects of Quechua. For example, some distinct dialects utilize [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[glottalization|glottalized]] versions of the [[voiceless uvular plosive|voiceless uvular stop /q/]], while others do not and some language planners found it important to reflect these dialectal differences.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

The search for a unified alphabet reflects the process of standardization. Unlike other cases of standardization, in Quechua this has been applied only to the written language, not to the spoken language, and no attempt was made to change the spoken language of native speakers, which varied by regions. Rather, standardization was required in order to create a uniform writing system to provide education to Quechua speakers in their native language.

Language planners in Peru have proposed several varieties to serve as the supradialectal spoken norm. Some saw [[Qusqu-Qullaw]] as the natural choice for a standard norm, as it is recognized to be the variety closest to that spoken by the Incas. Others argued that [[Ayacucho Quechua]] is a better option, as the language is more conservative and similar to the proto-language, while Qusqu-Qullaw has been influenced by contact with the [[Aymara language]].

[[Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino]] proposed a standard literary norm, [[Southern Quechua]] that combines features of both these dialects. This norm has been accepted by many institutions in Peru.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

Lexical modernization has also been critical to the development of Quechua. Language planners have attempted to create new Quechua words primarily through Quechua morphemes, which are combined in new ways to give new meanings. In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

=== Acquisition planning ===
Since Quechua is no longer an official language of Peru, Quechua literacy is not consistently encouraged in schools.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3&gt;Hornberger, Nancy "Quechua Literacy and Empowerment." ''Indigenous Literacies in the Americas'' Ed. Hornberger, Nancy. New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Peru's education system is instead primarily based on Spanish, the nation's official language. Despite its low prestige, Quechua is still spoken by millions of indigenous Peruvians, a large portion of whom are bilingual in Quechua and Spanish. There is a desire to preserve the uniqueness of Quechua as a language with its own attributes and representations of culture. Some argue that promoting a diverse literacy program gives students diverse perspectives on life, which could only enhance their educational experience.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3 /&gt; Before 1975, Peru had bilingual education programs, but Quechua was not taught as a subject in primary and secondary schools.  After the 1975 education reform, Quechua and Spanish both had standing in bilingual programs, but only in restricted speech communities. These experimental programs were then canceled due to a change in government planning, but again reinstated in 1996. Even with national [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs, teachers at local schools and members of the community often prefer using Spanish, destabilizing support for bilingual education.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt; This underscores the importance of community support as a goal for the education sector as mentioned earlier. Some believe that due to Spanish's higher national prestige, it is more socially and economically beneficial to learn and speak Spanish. It is debatable whether these education programs will benefit education or raise the status of Quechua.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt;

'''METRIC''' (Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration) is a [[computer model]] developed by the [[University of Idaho]], that uses [[Landsat]] satellite data to compute and map [[evapotranspiration]] (ET).&lt;ref&gt;[http://idwr.idaho.gov/GIS/mapping-evapotranspiration/ Idaho Department of Water Resources - Mapping Evapotranspiration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, R.G., M. Tasumi and R. Trezza. 2007. Satellite-based energy balance for mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration (METRIC) – Model. ASCE J. Irrigation and Drainage Engineering 133(4):380-394.

Chapter 21 in Evapotranspiration – Remote Sensing and Modeling (A. Irmak (Kilic), editor),  Publisher: InTech.&lt;/ref&gt;  METRIC calculates ET as a residual of the surface energy balance, where ET is estimated by keeping account of total net short wave and long wave radiation at the vegetation or soil surface, the amount of heat conducted into soil, and the amount of heat convected into the air above the surface.  The difference in these three terms represents the amount of energy absorbed during the conversion of liquid water to vapor, which is ET. METRIC expresses near-surface temperature gradients used in heat convection as indexed functions of radiometric surface temperature, thereby eliminating the need for absolutely accurate surface temperature and the need for air-temperature measurements.

The surface energy balance is internally calibrated using ground-based reference ET that is based on local weather or gridded weather data sets to reduce computational biases inherent to remote sensing-based energy balance. Slope and aspect functions and temperature lapsing are used for application to mountainous terrain. METRIC algorithms are designed for relatively routine application by trained engineers and other technical professionals who possess a familiarity with energy balance and basic radiation physics. The primary inputs for the model are short-wave and long-wave thermal images from a satellite e.g., [[Landsat]] and [[MODIS]], a [[digital elevation model]], and ground-based weather data measured within or near the area of interest. ET “maps” i.e., images via METRIC provide the means to quantify ET on a field-by-field basis in terms of both the rate and spatial distribution. The use of surface energy balance can detect reduced ET caused by water shortage.[[File:Surface energy balance.png|thumb|The surface energy balance is used in many thermal-based remote sensing models to estimate ET.  Rn is net radiation; H is sensible heat flux; G is heat conduction to the ground and ET is the amount of energy consumed by evapotranspiration (conversion of liquid water to vapor).]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2484">'''McIlvaine buffer''' is a [[buffer solution]] composed of [[citric acid]] and [[disodium hydrogen phosphate]], also known as '''citrate-phosphate buffer'''. It was introduced in 1921 by a [[United States]] agronomist Theodore Clinton McIlvaine from [[West Virginia University]], and can be prepared in [[pH]] 2.2 to 8 by mixing two stock solutions.&lt;ref name="McIlvaine"&gt;{{Cite journal|author = McIlvaine TC|year = 1921|title = A buffer solution for colorimetric comparison|journal = J.

==Applications==
McIlvaine buffer can be used to prepare a water-soluble [[mounting media]] when mixed 1:1 with glycerol.&lt;ref name="SA-Mount"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mycoplasma Detection|url=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Usage/b1155use.pdf|website=Sigma-Aldrich|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Preparation of McIlvaine buffer requires [[disodium phosphate]] and [[citric acid]]. One liter of 0.2M stock solution of disodium phosphate can be prepared by dissolving 28.38g of disodium phosphate in water, and adding a quantity of water sufficient to make one liter. One liter of 0.1M stock solution of citric acid can be prepared by dissolving 19.21g of citric acid in water, and adding a quantity of water sufficient to make one liter. From these stock solutions, McIlvaine buffer can be prepared in accordance with the following table:

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Metalearning' has previously been applied to the fields of [[Social Psychology]] and [[Computer Science]] but in this context exists an entirely new concept.

The theory of Metalearning builds off earlier work by Doya into the learning algorithms of [[Supervised learning]], [[Reinforcement learning]] and [[Unsupervised learning]] in the [[Cerebellum]], [[Basal Ganglia]] and [[Cerebral Cortex]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608099000465
| accessdate = 2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory emerged from efforts to unify the dynamic selection process for these three learning algorithms to a regulatory mechanism reducible to individual neurotransmitters.

==Roles of Neuromodulators==

===Dopamine===
[[Dopamine]] is proposed to act as a "global learning" signal, critical to prediction of rewards and [[Reinforcement learning|action reinforcement]]. In this way, dopamine is involved in a learning algorithm in which Actor, Environment and Critic are bound in a dynamic interplay that ultimately seeks to maximise the sum of future rewards by producing an optimal [[action selection]] policy. In this context, Critic and Actor are characterised as independent network edges that also form a single Complex Agent. This Agent collectively influences the information state of the Environment, which is fed back to the Agent for future computations. Through a separate pathway, Environment is also fed back to Critic in the form of the reward gained though the given action, meaning an equilibrium can be reached between the predicted reward of given policy for a given state, and the evolving prospect of future rewards.

===Serotonin===
[[Serotonin]] is proposed to control the balance between short and long term reward prediction, essentially by variably "discounting" expected future reward sums that may require too much expenditure to achieve. In this way, serotonin may facilitate the expectation of reward at a quasi-emotional level, and thus either encourage or discourage persistence in reward-seeking behaviour depending on the demand of the task, and the duration of persistence required. As global reward prediction would theoretically result from Serotonin modulated computations reaching a [[steady state]] with the computations similarly modulated by [[Dopamine]]; high serotonergic signalling may override the computations of Dopamine and produce a divergent paradigm of reward not mathematically viable through the dopamine modulated computations alone.

===Norepinephrine===
[[Norepinephrine]] is proposed to facilitate "wide exploration" by [[stochastic]] [[action selection]]. The choice between focusing on known, effective strategies or selecting new, experimental ones is known in [[probability theory]] as the [[Multi-armed bandit|Exploration-Exploitation Problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = [[Usher (neuroscience)|Usher]]
| title = The Role of Locus Coeruleus in the Regulation of Cognitive Performance
| publisher = Science
| year = 1999
| url =http://www.sciencemag.org/content/283/5401/549.short
| accessdate = 2013-08-04|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interplay between situational urgency, and the effectiveness of known strategies thus influences the dilemma between reliable selection for the largest predicted reward, and exploratory selection outside known parameters. Since neuronal firing cascades (such as those required to perfectly swing a golf club) are by definition unstable and prone to variation; Norepinephrine thus selects for the most reliable known execution pattern at higher levels, and allows for more random and unreliable selection at low levels with the purpose of potentially discovering more efficient strategies in the process.

===Acetylcholine===
[[Acetylcholine]] is proposed to facilitate the balance between memory storage and memory renewal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = [[Hasselmo]]
| first = Michael
| title = Acetylcholine and memory
| publisher = Trends in Neurosciences
| year = 1993
| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016622369390159J
| accessdate = 2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding an optimal balance between stability and effectiveness of learning algorithms for the specific environmental task. Acetylcholine thus modulates [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]] in the [[Hippocampus]], [[Cerebral Cortex]] and [[Striatum]] to facilitate ideal learning conditions in the brain. High levels of Acetylcholine would thus allow for very rapid learning and remodelling of synaptic connections, with the consequence that existing learning may become undone. Likewise, the learning of states that takes place over an extended [[temporal resolution]] may be overridden before it reaches a functional level, and thus learning may occur too quickly to actually be performed efficiently. At lower levels of Norepinephrine, plastic changes are proposed to occur much more slowly, potentially being protective against unhelpful learning conditions or allowing for information changes to embody a much broader temporal resolution.

==Metalearning==
Central to the idea of Metalearning is that global learning can be modelled as function of efficient selection of these four [[Neuromodulation|neuromodulators]]. While no [[Substitution model#Mechanistic vs. empirical models|mechanistic model]] is put forward for where Metalearning ultimately exists in the hierarchy of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], the model has thus far demonstrated the [[Dynamical system|dynamics]] necessary to infer the existence of such an agent in biological learning as a whole. While [[computational models]] and information systems are still far away from approaching the complexity of human learning; Metalearning provides a promising path forwards for the future evolution of such systems as they increasingly approach the complexity of the biological world.

==Potential Applications==
The investigation of Metalearning as a neuroscientific concept has potential benefits to both the understanding and treatment of [[Mental disorder|Psychiatric Disease]], as well as bridging the gaps between [[Neural network|Neural Networks]], [[Computer Science]] and [[Machine Learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Minan-ur-Rehman-Book.jpg|150px|thumb|Book-Title '''Minan-ur-Rehman'' '''(1895)]]
{{Ahmadiyya}}
'''Arabic - the Mother of all Languages - (Book) ''' ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' [Arabic: منن الرّحمٰن ] is a brief treatise on Philology by   [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], (1835-1908) written in May 1895. Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the first language taught to man by God Himself and the Mother of all languages (Arabic: ''Ummul-al-Sinnah''). He highlighted certain peculiarities of the Arabic language, which he claimed could not be found in any other language and challenged his adversaries, to refute his claim also addressing [[Max Muller]] (1823-1900) to come forward and meet the challenge.

==A 20th Century Prophet Ahmad==
::"From my early age, I have been engaged in investigations in religion, I have never reconciled myself with mere platitudes or cursory observations ;  I have never been content with superficial ideas as is the wont of every dull person who is a prisoner of ignorance and untruth. I have never insisted upon baseless ideas, as is the habit of a narrow-minded person who had no desire to understand. Never has anything moved me towards anything except with the eye of penetrating research and except for the attraction of deep-delving insight, nothing has ever lured me into professing a formal creed. And no one has taught me except God Who is the best of all teachers." (page 35)

==Introduction to the book==
:: "So, I named the book منن الرّحمٰن .  [Literally]  ''Favours of the Beneficent God'',   for by many a variety of Grace and Favour, God Almighty bestowed a reward on me, and He is the best of the Givers of favours". (page. 77)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=Urdu#page/126/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman, (Arabic), by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1895)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A short Treatise, namely ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' (1895) English translation by Qazi Abdul Hameed, Lahore (1963)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=English#page/-3/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman (English Translation) 1963 by Qazi Abdul Hameed]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently the book appears to be in response to [[Max Muller]]'s belief that:
::: “I, therefore, date the real beginning of the science of language from the first day of [[Pentecost]].” &lt;ref&gt;Lectures on the Science of Language,  page 53. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32856/32856-0.txt] page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad strongly reacted to this claim and  refuted [[Max Muller]]'s proposition by referring him to the NT Acts II:4-6, explaining that the Disciples only spoke languages already known and understood by all the Jews &lt;ref&gt;"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance ... Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language." -Acts 2:4,6"&lt;/ref&gt;
Ahmad writes, he very earnestly prayed to God, and asked for true knowledge in this regard. So God diverted his attention to a verse of the Quran 30:23.
:: وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفُ أَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَأَلْوَنِكُمْ
::إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأَيَـتٍ لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ
[The Quran, 30:23] And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours. In that surely are Signs for those who possess knowledge.

Ahmad claimed in light of Quranic verses:
::"All praise is due to Allah, the Sustainer, the Beneficent. To Him belongs all Excellence, Grace and Goodness. He created man and taught him a plain language. And out of one language He created various languages in different countries just as He created various colors (of mankind); out of one color. And He made Arabic the mother of all languages. He made it the like of the sun in brightness and luster."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/topics/arabic/ Minan-ur-Rahman - Arabic - the mother of all languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed, the true Science of Languages has been taught in the Holy Quran, explaining the unique characteristics of the Arabic language. "He created man then taught him speech and guided him " (page 85).

==Unique Characteristics of Arabic==
In this book ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the very First Language, taught to man by God. Ahmad describes the system of ''Mufradaat'' [the Simples or the Roots of words] in the Arabic Language had a unique scientific organization and a system, unknown in any other language. He described the five peculiarities of Arabic and claimed, all other languages of man, were derived from Arabic,

He explained, in the Arabic language, even the lonely alphabets (a, b, c etc.) at times manifest full and extensive meanings. e.g.:( see pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11)

فِ  (fi) 'Be faithful'

قِ  (qi) 'Keep an eye on'

لِ  (li) 'Come nearer'

عِ  ('I) 'Call to mind'

اِ   (I)  'Promise'

خِ  (Khe)  'Go, neither slowly nor fast, but with rather moderate pace'

ہِ   (hi)  'Burst thyself, or become weak'

دِ   (di)  'Pay blood-money'

رِ   (ri)  'Flare up, become brighter, or come out of the fireplace.' or 'Become dirty'

شِ  (shi)  'Paint thy garments with patterns '

نِ   (ni)   'Be slow or lazy'

Ahmad goes on explaining, sometimes even small '''single words''' give extensive meanings: e.g.

عرضتُ  (''araztu'') means: "I have roamed about Makkah, Madina, and all the habitations around them."

طہفلتُ  (''Tahfaltu'') means: "I eat and have determined always to eat Millet bread ."

جثمَ  (''Jasama'')  means: "Half the night has passed".

حیعلَ  (''Haya-al'')  means: "Come; Pray!  It is proper time."

==The Mother Language==
"The Arabic language possesses excellent qualities and signs which, in the eyes of scholars, invest it with the status of a Mother in relation to
other languages, and these languages are like a shadow in relation to Arabic or like sparrows in relation to a preying falcon." (page  100).

Ahmad believed that Arabic, being the First Language, however, in due course of time, great changes in the structure and form of the vocal apparatus, man's ecology and environment, and many other unknown factors, caused a diversification of Arabic language into thousands of tongues, all derived from Arabic. He writes, quoting from the Hebrew Torah,  Genesis 11:1:-
::: ויהי כל הארץ שׂפה אחת ודברים אחדים׃
:::"And the whole earth was one lip and speeches identical". (Gen, 11:1) [page. 14]
::...the nearness or remoteness of a place from the equator, of the distinctive effect of the various plants, and because of other unknown factors, every locality inheres in its inhabitants a proclivity of a special kind, towards developing a peculiar voice-apparatus, a distinctive accent, and a form of words which is of a peculiar character....[page: 12]

He after commenting upon the relationship of Hebrew, or Sanskrit to Arabic, writes:
::...all the languages of the world have come into existence through a process of far  reaching change, yet by fully pondering over it, and by looking at the operative factors, it clearly appears that the speeches and words of these languages have been transplanted into a variety of shapes and forms from Arabic simples. [page. 16]

::"Arabic is singular in its attributes, perfect in its root-words, wonderful  in the charm of its compounds and captivating in the structural beauty of its sentences." (page 105).

==Five Points of Excellence==
Ahmad highlighted ''Five'' points of the excellence of the Arabic language: [page. 17]

1. Arabic has a complete organised structure of roots, that is to say, the roots meet fully all the needs of human beings in the field of expression ; the other languages are not so fitted.

2. In Arabic, the names of the Divine Being, the names of the principal constituent parts of the universe, of plants, animals and minerals and of the members of the human body, possess, in the why and wherefore of their contents, deep philosophy and learning.

3. The Additions and the roots of Arabic words are perfectly organised. The scope of this organisation, by linking into one philosophical chain, all the verbs and nouns, belonging to the same root, points out their interrelationships. This is not to be found, to this degree of excellence, in other languages.

4. In Arabic expressions, words are few but meanings are many, that is to say, the Arabic language makes use of (ا) [alif], and (ل) [laam] and nunnation (تنوین) and the sequence of words, in such a way that to express the same meaning the other languages need a number of sentences to be linked up for the same purpose.

5. Arabic possesses roots and expressions which are the perfect means of portraying the most delicate and deep things of the mind and human ideas.

A greater part of the book is devoted to manifest these characteristic in further details. He writes, " Thousands of languages
are stricken with the calamity of a drawback that instead of root-words they make use of complex grammatical constructions, which shows that at a time of need such constructions have been invented by man." [page. 22]

==Arabic follows the Law of Nature==
After the above  ''Introductory details'', the rest of the treatise is in a very lucid and elegant Arabic.[page 27-127]
He explains that Arabic is unique to follow the patterns we observe in Nature. Two distinct features, i.e.'the pre-existing' Grace of God, like the bounties of Nature, the qualities inherent in the soil and earth, the sun and the changing weathers etc. And the second aspect being human efforts, labour and endeavours, these combine to give birth to the fruit of human endeavours. To fulfil these ''Two'' requirements,  Arabic has ''Two'' distinct words for ''Mercy'', ''Rahman'' [رحمان]and ''Raheem''. [رحیم].
To explain his point, Ahmad writes:
::It will be noticed that in as much  this quality Mercy, in accordance with the eternal distribution process. consisted of two manifestations of the Divine Law of Nature. there are to be found two root-words in the Arabic language to express that fact. And for a seeker of Truth. it would be profitable to follow the rule that the Attributes and Acts of God which are prominently portrayed in the Book of Nature should be taken as a standard, that their different categories which are apparent from the Law of Nature should be searched for in the root-words of Arabic, and that when ever it is intended to point out the difference between Arabic synonyms, which relate to the attributes or the acts of God, one should turn to the division and distribution of the attributes or acts of God which are apparent from the working of the universe, for, the real object of the Arabic language is the service of Divine Knowledge, as the real aim of the creation of man is the recognition of the Creator. [page. 35]

==Ten Categories of Arabic Roots==
Ahmad believed that Arabic was the Language of Divine Realization and designed to fulfill the Physical and Spiritual needs of man. He classified the Arabic Root-Words, into ten categories, calling them as the ''Ten Circles of Roots''. He describes them as follows: (pp: 38-40)

::1) Root-words  relating to the Person of God, arguments for the existence of God, His attributes, His Names and Acts, His Practice and Custom.

::2)  The system of root-words relating to the Unity of God and the arguments on behalf thereof.

::3) The system of root-words which deals with the attributes, acts, and actions, habits and situations, spiritual and physical, (of man) which, along with their mutual distinctions, are perpetrated by man and which may appear,  in agreement with or in opposition to God's Will.

::4) The system of root-words which constitute, as facts of Divine knowledge; a perfected  teaching from God Almighty and which relate to inculcations or techniques dealing with morals, beliefs, rights of God, rights of men, philosophic learning, punishments, commandments, the Do's and Dont's.

::5) The system of root-words which expound the nature of true salvation, the true means or methods of obtaining it; the signs by which the saved believers and those who occupy a station  of nearness to God may be recognized.

::6) The system of root-words which explain what is Islam, what is disbelief, what is ''shirk'' or polytheistic belief and which deal forth with the arguments for the truth of Islam, and refute the objections against Islam.

::7) The system of root-words which refute all the wrong beliefs of opponents.

::8) The system of root-words which relate to warnings and tidings, promise of favourable or adverse happenings ; which relate to description of the hereafter, to miracles and to parables or which are of the nature of prophecies which contribute to the strengthening of one's faith, or which relate to other expedient subjects, or which deal with narratives which are meant as a warning, a threat, or a tiding.

::9) The system of root-words which relate to the life-story and chaste qualities of the Holy Prophet (May peace and blessings of God be upon him,) which consist of the high example of the pure life of the Holy Prophet ; which also partake of full and forceful arguments in support of the prophet-hood of the Holy Prophet (may peace and the blessings of God be upon him.)

::10) The system of root-words which expound the beauties and the spiritual effectiveness of the Holy Quran and which set out its inherent qualities.

==Language as the Evolution of ''Names''==
How did language come into being? To quote Encyclopædia Britannica: " On the ultimate origin of language speculation has been rife, more, however, among philosophers than among philologists, who have very often been too matter-of-fact to take an interest in this problem. Some scholars (among them quite recently W. Schmidt) see the insufficiency of the usual theories, and giving up all attempts at explaining it in a natural way fall back on the religious belief that the first language was directly given to the first men by God through a miracle."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://gluedideas.com/content-collection/Encyclopedia-Britannica-Volume-13-Part-2-Kurantwad-Statue-of-Liberty/The-Origin-of-Language.html Origin of Language Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology and Bible history, (1992) by Joseph P. Free, page 43 (W. Schmidt on Language, [https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVoe4n0ifIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

::"When man was made to evolve through stages of creation ; when he was transferred from a state of potentiality to one of actuality, when he was given, in his nature and physical evolution, different shapes and figures, and some of the varieties of creation succeeded other varieties, and there happened to be mutual differences and distinctions, the process gave rise to many degrees and stages which required to be described by ''Names'',  Arabic provided them with their "names", and thus completed its gift as is the custom of rich philanthropists." (page 123)

==Further Contributions ==
A renowned Philologist Sheikh [[Muhammad Ahmad Mazhar]] (1896-1993) has contributed immensely to the work of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] and studied the various languages (around 35) and traced them to their Arabic Root-Words. The works, which trace the Arabic Roots, are the dictionary format, are easily available, can be downloaded freely by pasting the links in the browser's address bar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5517">'''Modular constructivism''' is a style of [[sculpture]] that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and was associated especially with [[Erwin Hauer]] and [[Norman Carlberg]]. It is based on carefully structured modules which allow for intricate and in some cases infinite patterns of repetition, sometimes used to create limitless, basically planar, screen-like formations, and sometimes employed to make more multidimensional structures. Designing these structures involves intensive study of the combinatorial possibilities of sometimes quite curvilinear and fluidly shaped modules, creating a seamless, quasi-organic unity that can be either rounded and self-enclosed, or open and potentially infinite. The latter designs have proved useful and attractive for use in eye-catching architectural walls and screens, often featuring complex patterns of undulating, tissue-like webbing, with apertures which transmit and filter light, while generating delicate patterns of shadow.

Writing in ''Architecture Week'' (August 4, 2004), Hauer explains that "Continuity and potential infinity have been at the very center of my sculpture from early on." [http://www.architectureweek.com/2004/0804/culture_2-2.html] Hauer made an extensive study of [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] form, especially what he calls "saddle surfaces," which combine convex and concave curvature and thus allow for smooth self-combination, sometimes in multiple dimensions. Another inspiration is the sculpture of [[Henry Moore]], with its fluid curves and porosity.

Hauer's enthusiasm caught the imagination of his colleague at [[Yale]], [[Norman Carlberg]]. Both were devoted students of the arch-formalist [[Josef Albers]]. Indeed, from the beginning, there was in this modular approach to sculpture an implicit [[formalism (art)|formalism]] and even [[minimalism]] which held itself aloof from some of the other artistic trends of the time, such as the [[pop art]] and [[post-modernism]] that were just beginning to emerge. As Carlberg recalls, within his artistic circle "you analysed, you looked at something, but you looked at it formally just for what it was and the message was almost always out of it."

[[File:Amborella trichopoda.jpg|thumb|In the [[Order (biology)|order]] Amborellales, there is only one [[family (biology)|family]], Amborellaceae and there is only one [[genus]], ''Amborella '', and in this genus there is only one species, namely ''[[Amborella trichopoda]]''.]]

[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus wild.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'', the [[hyacinth macaw]], is a monotypic species; no [[subspecies]] have been distinguished within it. However, the genus ''[[Anodorhynchus]]'' does include three species.]]

In [[biology]], a '''monotypic taxon''' is a taxonomic group ([[taxon]]) that contains only one immediately subordinate taxon.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E, Ashlock PD. (1991). ''Principles of Systematic Zoology'' (2nd ed.). McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-041144-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monotypic [[species]] is one that does not include [[subspecies]] or smaller, infraspecific taxa.{{Cn|date=August 2017}} In the case of genera, the term "unispecific" or "monospecific" is sometimes preferred.

In [[botanical nomenclature]], a '''monotypic genus''' is a [[genus (biology)|genus]] in the special case where a genus and a single species are simultaneously described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Reine, W.F.P.h.V. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG|isbn=978-3-87429-425-6}} articles 38.5 and 38.6&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast an '''oligotypic taxon''' contains more than one but only a very few subordinate taxa.

==Examples==
Just as the term ''monotypic'' is used to describe a taxon including only one subdivision, one can also refer to the contained taxon as monotypic within the higher-level taxon, e.g. a genus monotypic within a family. Some examples of monotypic groups are:
* In the [[Order (biology)|order]] Amborellales, there is only one [[family (biology)|family]], Amborellaceae and there is only one [[genus]], ''[[Amborella]]'', and in this genus there is only one species, namely ''Amborella trichopoda''
* The family [[Cephalotaceae]] includes only one genus, ''[[Cephalotus]]'', and only one species, ''Cephalotus follicularis'' – the [[Albany pitcher plant]].

'''''NASA 360''''' is a half-hour [[vodcast]] developed by [[NASA]] in partnership with the [[National Institute of Aerospace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nianet.org/|title=National Institute of Aerospace}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered in August 2008. It has aired on more than 450 TV stations across the country, is available on air and cruise lines, and is consistently one of the top-downloaded programs on the NASA.gov website. It is currently in its tenth season.

==Description==
''NASA 360'' is one of four programs in NASA's award-winning eClips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/nasaeclips/index.html|title=NASA eClips website}}&lt;/ref&gt; suite of web-based shows designed to encourage careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. ''NASA 360'' is written, produced, and edited by Timothy J. Allen, Tom Shortridge, and Scott Bednar; Rebecca Jaramillo is the Senior Educator and Project Coordinator for ''NASA 360'', and Harla Sherwood the Principal Investigator - all of the National Institute of Aerospace.

''NASA 360'' shows how NASA has changed and continues to change life on Earth by examining how technologies developed by or for NASA are being used in everything from space exploration to everyday consumer products. These include lithium ion batteries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasa360/nasa360-0102.html|title= NASA 360 Season 1 Episode 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; medical innovations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasa360/nasa360-0107.html|title=NASA 360 Season 1 Episode 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sporting equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasa360/nasa360-0211.html|title=NASA 360 Season 2 Episode 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and automotive and aircraft safety and efficiency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasa360/nasa360-0103.html|title=NASA 360 Season 1 Episode 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; among many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_nasa360.html|title=Barnstorff, Kathy.

''NASA 360'' is shot on-location at NASA centers across the country, as well as at other relevant sites across the globe. The fifth season marked the revitalization of ''NASA 360'' and features new hosts Caleb Kinchlow and Molly McKinney, [[B-roll]], animations, and interviews conducted with NASA researchers, engineers, and astronauts, as well as with outside sources with expertise relevant to the topics being discussed.

The show is produced for a young adult audience, and stylistically this is accomplished through the use of hand-held cameras, quick edits, and numerous transitions, effects, and filters used in post-production.

''NASA 360'' was originally created in 2006 by producers Kevin Krigsvold and Michael Bibbo. It was hosted by Johnny Alonso and Jennifer Pulley through 2012. 23 episodes were produced during this period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="89717">'''Neuroscience of free will''', a part of [[neurophilosophy]], is the study of the interconnections between [[free will]] and [[neuroscience]].

As it has become possible to study the human living [[brain]], researchers have begun to watch [[decision making]] processes at work. Findings could carry implications for our [[sense of agency]], [[moral responsibility]], and our understanding of [[consciousness]] in general.&lt;ref name="Fate, Freedom and Neuroscience"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Institute of Art and Ideas|title=Fate, Freedom and Neuroscience|url=http://iai.tv/video/fate-freedom-and-neuroscience|publisher=IAI|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; One of the pioneering studies in this domain was designed by [[Benjamin Libet]],&lt;ref name="Unconscious cerebral initiative  and the role of conscious will  in voluntary action"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libet|first=Benjamin|title=Unconscious cerebral initiative  and the role of conscious will  in voluntary action|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=1985|volume=8|pages=529–566|url=http://selfpace.uconn.edu/class/ccs/Libet1985UcsCerebralInitiative.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2013|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00044903}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies have attempted to predict participant actions before they make them.&lt;ref name=soonetal /&gt; [[File:Some brain areas.png|thumb|right|350px|Some areas of the human brain implicated in mental disorders that might be related to free will. Area 25 refers to [[Brodmann area 25|Brodmann's area 25]], related to [[long-term depression]].]]
The field remains highly controversial. There is no consensus among researchers about the significance of findings, their meaning, or what conclusions may be drawn. The precise role of consciousness in decision making therefore remains unclear.

Thinkers like [[Daniel Dennett]] or [[Alfred Mele]] consider the language used by researchers. They explain that "free will" means many different things to different people (e.g. some notions of free will are [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]], some not). Dennett insists that many important and common conceptions of "free will" are compatible with the emerging evidence from neuroscience.&lt;ref name=WalterH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kane/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt;

==Overview==
{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = ...the current work is in broad agreement with a general trend in neuroscience of volition: although we may experience that our conscious decisions and thoughts cause our actions, these experiences are in fact based on readouts of brain activity in a network of brain areas that control voluntary action...It is clearly wrong to think of [feeling of willing something] as a prior intention, located at the very earliest moment of decision in an extended action chain. Rather, W seems to mark an intention-in-action, quite closely linked to action execution.|source = -Patrick Haggard&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt; discussing an in-depth experiment by Itzhak Fried&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt;}}
One significant finding of modern studies is that a person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain scanning technology, other scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether subjects would press a button with their left or right hand up to 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice.&lt;ref name=soonetal&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2112 |title=Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain |year=2008 |last1=Soon |first1=Chun Siong |last2=Brass |first2=Marcel |last3=Heinze |first3=Hans-Jochen |last4=Haynes |first4=John-Dylan |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=543–5 |pmid=18408715}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some forms of "free will". To be clear, no single study would disprove all forms of free will. This is because the term "[[free will]]" can encapsulate different hypotheses, each of which must be considered in light of existing [[empirical evidence]].

There have also been a number of problems regarding studies of free will.&lt;ref name=Klemm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0076-2 |title=Free will debates: Simple experiments are not so simple |year=2010 |last1=Klemm |first1=W. R. |journal=Advances in Cognitive Psychology |volume=6 |pages=47–65 |pmid=20859552 |pmc=2942748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in earlier studies, research relied too much on the introspection of the participants, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be inaccurate. Many brain activity measures have been insufficient and primitive as there is no good independent brain-function measure of the conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions. The conclusions drawn from measurements that ''have'' been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings is representing. In other words, the dip might have nothing to do with unconscious decision, since many other mental processes are going on while performing the task.&lt;ref name=Klemm/&gt; Some of the research mentioned here has gotten more advanced, however, even recording individual neurons in conscious volunteers.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected – challenging any versions of "free will" where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;

===Free will as illusion===
[[File:Playing the piano.jpg|thumb|left|140px|An activity like playing the piano may be intentional, but is generally regarded as requiring many practiced actions. Studies suggest that each key press could be initiated unconsciously.]]It is quite likely that a large range of cognitive operations are necessary to freely press a button. Research at least suggests that our conscious self does not initiate all behavior. Instead, the conscious self is somehow alerted to a given behavior that the rest of the brain and body are already planning and performing. These findings do not forbid conscious experience from playing some moderating role, although it is also possible that some form of unconscious process is what is causing modification in our behavioral response. Unconscious processes may play a larger role in behavior than previously thought.

It may be possible, then, that our intuitions about the role of our conscious 'intentions' have led us astray; it may be the case that we have [[Correlation does not imply causation|confused correlation with causation]] by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in [[neurostimulation]], [[brain damage]], but also research into [[introspection illusion]]s. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for [[moral responsibility]]. Neuroscientist and author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is 'intuitive': he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues - "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;"The Moral Landscape", p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientist [[Walter Jackson Freeman III]] nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly trying to keep up with what we do."&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Walter J. How Brains Make Up Their Minds. New York: Columbia UP, 2000. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.

===Disputed relevance of scientific research===
Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies think these studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that physical factors in the brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that "We feel we choose, but we don't".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Researcher [[John-Dylan Haynes]] adds "How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Philosophers Walter Glannon and [[Alfred Mele]] think some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because "[[free will]]" can mean many things: It is unclear what someone means when they say "free will does not exist". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] notions of free will – but that is an "easy target for neuroscientists to knock down".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in [[materialistic]] terms. In these cases, "free will" means something more like "not coerced" or that "the person could have done otherwise at the last moment". The existence of these types of free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about what goes on in the brain during decision making.&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;

{{Quote box|align=left|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote= "[Some senses of free will] are compatible with what we are learning from science...If only that was what scientists were telling people. But scientists, especially in the last few years, have been on a rampage – writing ill-considered public pronouncements about free will which... verge on social irresponsibility.

This issue may be controversial for good reason: There is evidence to suggest that people normally associate a [[Free will#Believing in free will|belief in free will]] with their ability to affect their lives.&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9047-7 |title=Why 'Willusionism' Leads to 'Bad Results': Comments on Baumeister, Crescioni, and Alquist |year=2009 |last1=Nahmias |first1=Eddy |journal=Neuroethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9046-8 |title=Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Alquist |year=2009 |last1=Holton |first1=Richard |journal=Neuroethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=13–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], author of ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'' and a supporter of [[compatibilism|deterministic free will]], believes scientists risk making a serious mistake. He says that there are types of free will that are incompatible with modern science, but he says those kinds of free will are not worth wanting. Other types of "free will" are pivotal to people's sense of responsibility and purpose (see also [[Free will#Believing in free will|"believing in free will"]]), and many of these types are actually compatible with modern science.&lt;ref name=DennettPOI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/daniel_dennett_the_scientific_study_of_religion/|title=Daniel Dennett - The Scientific Study of Religion|publisher=Point of Inquiry |type=Podcast|date=December 12, 2011}}. Discussion of free will starts especially at 24 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other studies described below have only just begun to shed light on the role that consciousness plays in actions and it is too early to draw very strong conclusions about certain kinds of "free will". It is worth noting that such experiments – so far – have dealt only with free will decisions made in short time frames (seconds) and ''may'' not have direct bearing on free will decisions made ("thoughtfully") by the subject over the course of ''many'' seconds, minutes, hours or longer. Scientists have also only so far studied extremely simple behaviors (e.g. moving a finger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/the-moral-sciences-club/what-can-neuroscience-teach-us-about-evil|title=What can neuroscience teach us about evil?|author=Will Wilkinson}} {{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adina Roskies points out five areas of neuroscientific research:  1.) action initiation, 2.) intention, 3). decision, 4.)

==Notable experiments==

===Libet experiment===
A pioneering experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain (in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP), which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;). Although it was well known that the Bereitschaftspotential (sometimes also termed "readiness potential") preceded the physical action, Libet asked how the Bereitschaftspotential corresponded to the felt intention to move. To determine when the subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock and report its position when they felt that they had felt the conscious will to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;

[[File:B.Libet.experiment.gif|thumb|left|300px|Libet's experiment: (0) repose, until (1) the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] is detected, (2-Libet's W) the volunteer memorizes a dot position upon feeling their intention, and (3) then acts.]]
Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity leading up to the ''conscious'' decision by the subject to flick their wrist began approximately half a second ''before'' the subject consciously felt that they had decided to move.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0355-1_16 |chapter=Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action |title=Neurophysiology of Consciousness |series=Contemporary Neuroscientists |year=1993 |last1=Libet |first1=Benjamin |isbn=978-1-4612-6722-5 |pages=269–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libet's findings suggest that decisions made by a subject are first being made on a subconscious level and only afterward being translated into a "conscious decision", and that the subject's belief that it occurred at the behest of their will was only due to their retrospective perspective on the event.

The interpretation of these findings has been criticized by [[Daniel Dennett]], who argues that people will have to shift their attention from their intention to the clock, and that this introduces temporal mismatches between the felt experience of will and the perceived position of the clock hand.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D.

Having attempted the experiment himself, Mele explains that "the awareness of the intention to move" is an ambiguous feeling at best. For this reason he remained skeptical of interpreting the subjects' reported times for comparison with their '[[Bereitschaftspotential]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigthink.com/ideas/19231 Bigthink.com]{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
[[File:Bereitschaftspotenzial fig1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Typical recording of the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] that was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;). [[Benjamin Libet]] investigated whether this neural activity corresponded to the "felt intention" (or will) to move of experimental subjects.]]

In a variation of this task, Haggard and Eimer asked subjects to decide not only when to move their hands, but also to decide ''which hand to move''. In this case, the felt intention correlated much more closely with the "[[lateralized readiness potential]]" (LRP), an [[Event-related potential|ERP]] component which measures the difference between left and right hemisphere brain activity. Haggard and Eimer argue that the feeling of conscious will must therefore follow the decision of which hand to move, since the LRP reflects the decision to lift a particular hand.&lt;ref name="HandE" /&gt;

A more direct test of the relationship between the Bereitschaftspotential and the "awareness of the intention to move" was conducted by Banks and Isham (2009). In their study, participants performed a variant of the Libet's paradigm in which a delayed tone followed the button press. Subsequently, research participants reported the time of their intention to act (e.g., Libet's "W").  If W were time-locked to the Bereitschaftspotential, W would remain uninfluenced by any post-action information.  However, findings from this study show that W in fact shifts systematically with the time of the tone presentation, implicating that W is, at least in part, retrospectively reconstructed rather than pre-determined by the Bereitschaftspotential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02254.x |title=We Infer Rather Than Perceive the Moment We Decided to Act |year=2009 |last1=Banks |first1=William P. |last2=Isham |first2=Eve A. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |pages=17–21 |pmid=19152537 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely a sign that the brain is paying attention.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an audio tone indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not. The researchers found that there was the same RP signal in both cases, regardless of whether or not volunteers actually elected to tap, which suggests that the RP signal doesn't indicate that a decision has been made.&lt;ref name=Anil&gt;{{cite journal

In a second experiment, researchers asked volunteers to decide on the spot whether to use left hand or right to tap the key while monitoring their brain signals, and they found no correlation among the signals and the chosen hand. This criticism has itself been criticized by free-will researcher Patrick Haggard, who mentions literature that distinguishes two different circuits in the brain that lead to action: a "stimulus-response" circuit and a "voluntary" circuit. According to Haggard, researchers applying external stimuli may not be testing the proposed voluntary circuit, nor Libet's hypothesis about internally triggered actions.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008" /&gt;

Libet's interpretation of the ramping up of brain activity prior to the report of conscious "will" continues to draw heavy criticism. Studies have questioned participants' ability to report the timing of their "will". Authors have found that [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA]] activity is modulated by attention (attention precedes the movement signal by 100ms), and the prior activity reported could therefore have been product of paying attention to the movement.&lt;ref name="Lau2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=H. C.|title=Attention to Intention|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=5661|year=2004|pages=1208–1210|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1090973}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that the perceived onset of intention depends on neural activity that takes place after the execution of action. [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) applied over the [[supplementary motor area|preSMA]] after a participant performed an action shifted the perceived onset of the motor intention backward in time, and the perceived time of action execution forward in time.&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Hakwan C.|last2=Rogers|first2=Robert D.|last3=Passingham|first3=Richard E.|title=Manipulating the Experienced Onset of Intention after Action Execution|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=19|issue=1|year=2007|pages=81–90|issn=0898-929X|doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.1.81|pmid=17214565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have speculated that the preceding neural activity reported by Libet may be an artefact of averaging the time of "will", wherein neural activity does not always precede reported "will".&lt;ref name="Trevena" /&gt; In a similar replication they also reported no difference in electrophysiological signs before a decision not to move, and before a decision to move.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

Despite his findings, Libet himself did not interpret his experiment as evidence of the inefficacy of conscious free will — he points out that although the tendency to press a button may be building up for 500 milliseconds, the conscious will retains a right to veto any action at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Libet |first=Benjamin |year=2003 |title=Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity? |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=24–8 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=24&amp;epage=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, unconscious impulses to perform a volitional act are open to suppression by the conscious efforts of the subject (sometimes referred to as "free won't"). A comparison is made with a [[golf]]er, who may swing a club several times before striking the ball. The action simply gets a rubber stamp of approval at the last millisecond. [[Max Velmans]] argues however that "free won't" may turn out to need as much neural preparation as "free will" (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velmans |first1=Max |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=42&amp;epage=61 |title=Preconscious Free Will |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=42–61 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have however replicated Libet's findings, whilst addressing some of the original criticisms.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt; A recent study has found that individual neurons were found to fire 2 seconds before a reported "will" to act (long before EEG activity predicted such a response).&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Itzhak Fried replicated Libet's findings in 2011 at the scale of the single neuron. This was accomplished with the help of volunteer [[epilepsy]] patients, who needed [[electrodes]] implanted deep in their brain for evaluation and treatment anyway. Now able to monitor awake and moving patients, the researchers replicated the timing anomalies that were discovered by Libet and are discussed in the following study.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Similarly to these tests, [[Chun Siong Soon]], [[Anna Hanxi He]], [[Stefan Bode]] and [[John-Dylan Haynes]] have conducted a study in 2013 claiming to be able to predict the choice to sum or subtract before the subject reports it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/6217|title=Predicting free choices for abstract intentions|first1=Chun Siong|last1=Soon|first2=Anna Hanxi|last2=He|first3=Stefan|last3=Bode|first4=John-Dylan|last4=Haynes|date=9 April 2013|publisher=|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=15|pages=6217–6222|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212218110|pmid=23509300|pmc=3625266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconscious actions===

====Timing intentions compared to actions====
A study by Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, published in 2008, claims to have replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization on the part of participants.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt; The authors believe that their method can identify the time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the [[readiness potential]]). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.

=====The experiment=====
[[File:Wijsvinger.jpg|thumb|right|120px|It is difficult to identify exactly when a person becomes aware of his action. Some findings indicate that awareness comes after actions have already begun in the brain.]]
Matsuhashi and Hallett's study can be summarized thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after it has already been started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.

To test this hypothesis, Matsuhashi and Hallet had volunteers perform brisk finger movements at random intervals, while not counting or planning when to make such (future) movements, but rather immediately making a movement as soon as they thought about it. An externally controlled "stop-signal" sound was played at pseudo random intervals, and the volunteers had to cancel their intent to move if they heard a signal while being aware of their own immediate intention to move. Whenever there ''was'' an action (finger movement), the authors documented (and graphed) any tones that occurred before that action. The graph of tones before actions therefore only shows tones (a) before the subject is even aware of his "movement genesis" (or else they would have stopped or "vetoed" the movement), and (b) after it is too late to veto the action. This second set of graphed tones is of little importance here.

In this work, "movement genesis" is defined as the brain process of making movement, of which physiological observations have been made (via electrodes) indicating that it may occur before conscious awareness of intent to move (see [[Benjamin Libet]]).

By looking to see when tones started preventing actions, the researchers supposedly know the length of time (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. This moment of awareness (as seen in the graph below) is dubbed "T" (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their [[Event-related potential]] (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins.

The researchers found that the time of the conscious intention to move T normally occurred ''too late'' to be the cause of movement genesis. See the example of a subject's graph below on the right. Although it is not shown on the graph, the subject's readiness potentials (ERP) tells us that his actions start at –2.8 seconds, and yet this is substantially earlier than his conscious intention to move, time "T" (−1.8 seconds). Matsuhashi and Hallet concluded that the feeling of the conscious intention to move does not cause movement genesis; both the feeling of intention and the movement itself are the result of unconscious processing.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt;

=====Analysis and interpretation=====
[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A simple "signalling noise" is used, but it is to warn participants that they must prevent any actions they are aware of.]]
This study is similar to Libet's in some ways: volunteers were again asked to perform finger extensions in short, self-paced intervals. In this version of the experiment, researchers introduced randomly timed "stop tones" during the self paced movements. If participants were not conscious of any intention to move, they simply ignored the tone. On the other hand, if they were aware of their intention to move at the time of the tone, they had to try to veto the action, then relax for a bit before continuing self-paced movements. This experimental design allowed Matsuhashi and Hallet to see when, once the subject moved his finger, any tones occurred. The goal was to identify their own equivalent of Libet's W, their own estimation of the timing of the conscious intention to move, which they would call "T"(time)

Testing the hypothesis that 'conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun' required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There would also be a point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during a certain period of time during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action – they have passed the action's "point of no return". That is exactly what the researchers found (see the graph on the right, below).

[[File:TimingConsciousIntentiontoMoveHistogram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Graphing tones as they appeared (or didn't) in the time before any action. In this case, researchers believe the subject becomes aware of his actions at about -1.769 seconds (this is time 'T'). A typical subject's ERP recordings suggest movement preparation as early as −2.8 seconds.]]
The graph shows the times at which unsuppressed responses to tones occurred when the volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (dubbed "tone events" on the graph) on average up until 1.8 seconds before movement onset, but a significant decrease in tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about −1.8 seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden increase in the number of tone events at 0.1 seconds, meaning this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (−1.8 seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to [[Event-related potential|ERP]] measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about −2.8 seconds on average for this participant. Since T — like Libet's original W — was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Haggard describes other studies at the neuronal levels as providing "a reassuring confirmation of previous studies that recorded neural populations"&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt; such as the one just described. Note that these results were gathered using finger movements, and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of [[planning]] has implications for free will and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher [[Alfred Mele]] also doubts the conclusions of these studies. He explains that simply because a movement may have been initiated before our "conscious self" has become aware of it does not mean our consciousness does not still get to approve, modify, and perhaps cancel (called vetoing) the action.&lt;ref name=mele&gt;{{cite book

===Unconsciously cancelling actions===
The possibility that human "free won't" is also the prerogative of the subconscious is being explored.

====Retrospective judgement of free choice====
[[File:LED traffic light.jpg|thumb|left|140px|As green light switches to yellow, research seems to suggest that humans cannot tell the difference between "deciding" to keep driving, and having no time to decide at all.]]

Recent research by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness may not be what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it ''easy'' to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the [[introspection illusion]]. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to "veto" an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

=====The experiment=====
The experiment involved asking volunteers to respond to a go-signal by pressing an electronic "go" button as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; In this experiment the go-signal was represented as a visual stimulus shown on a monitor (e.g. a green light as shown on the picture). The participants' reaction times (RT) were gathered at this stage, in what was described as the "primary response trials".

The primary response trials were then modified, in which 25% of the go-signals were subsequently followed by an additional signal – either a "stop" or "decide" signal. The additional signals occurred after a "signal delay" (SD), a random amount of time up to 2 seconds after the initial go-signal. They also occurred equally, each representing 12.5% of experimental cases. These additional signals were represented by the initial stimulus changing colour (e.g. to either a red or orange light). The other 75% of go-signals were not followed by an additional signal – and was therefore considered the "default" mode of the experiment. The participants' task of responding as quickly as possible to the initial signal (i.e. pressing the "go" button) remained.

Upon seeing the initial go-signal, the participant would immediately intend to press the "go" button. The participant was instructed to cancel their immediate intention to press the "go" button if they saw a stop signal. The participant was instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the "go" button, or not pressing it, if they saw a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal ("decide trials"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared too ''late'' in the process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed).

Those trials in which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a subsequent signal show a quick RT of about 600&amp;nbsp;ms. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown too late, and the participant had already enacted their impulse to press the go-button (i.e. had not decided to do so), also show a quick RT of about 600&amp;nbsp;ms. Those trials in which a stop signal was shown and the participant successfully responded to it, do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had had the opportunity to decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

The participant was asked at the end of those "decide trials" in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus), or had acted based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data however, it appears there was discrepancy between when the user thought they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses) – in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when they thought they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal) – where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.

=====The rationale=====

Kuhn and Brass wanted to test participant self-knowledge. The first step was that after every decide trial, participants were next asked whether they had actually had time to decide. Specifically, the volunteers were asked to label each decide trial as either failed-to-decide (the action was the result of acting impulsively on the initial go-signal) or successful decide (the result of a deliberated decision). See the diagram on the right for this decide trial split: failed-to-decide and successful decide; the next split in this diagram (participant correct or incorrect) will be explained at the end of this experiment. Note also that the researchers sorted the participants’ successful decide trials into "decide go" and "decide nogo", but were not concerned with the nogo trials since they did not yield any RT data (and are not featured anywhere in the diagram on the right). Note that successful stop trials did not yield RT data either.
[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionTrials.png|thumb|right|400px|The different types of trials and their different possible outcomes.]]

Kuhn and Brass now knew what to expect: primary response trials, any failed stop trials, and the "failed-to-decide" trials were all instances where the participant obviously acted impulsively – they would show the same quick RT. In contrast, the "successful ''decide''" trials (where the decision was a "go" and the subject moved) should show a slower RT. Presumably, if deciding whether to veto is a conscious process, volunteers should have no trouble distinguishing impulsivity from instances of true deliberate continuation of a movement. Again, this is important since decide trials require that participants rely on self-knowledge. Note that stop trials cannot test self-knowledge because if the subject ''does'' act, it is obvious to them that they reacted impulsively.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

=====Results and implications=====
[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionGraph.png|thumb|left|300px|The general distribution of reaction times for the different trials. Notice the timing of the two peaks for trials labelled "successful decide".]]
Unsurprisingly, the recorded RTs for the primary response trials, failed stop trials, and "failed-to-decide" trials all showed similar RTs: 600&amp;nbsp;ms seems to indicate an impulsive action made without time to truly deliberate. What the two researchers found next was not as easy to explain: while some "successful decide" trials did show the tell-tale slow RT of deliberation (averaging around 1400&amp;nbsp;ms), participants had also labelled many impulsive actions as "successful decide". This result is startling because participants should have had no trouble identifying which actions were the results of a conscious "I will not veto", and which actions were un-deliberated, impulsive reactions to the initial go-signal. As the authors explain:

{{cquote|[The results of the experiment] clearly argue against Libet's assumption that a veto process can be consciously initiated. He used the veto in order to reintroduce the possibility to control the unconsciously initiated actions. But since the subjects are not very accurate in observing when they have [acted impulsively instead of deliberately], the act of vetoing cannot be consciously initiated.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;}}

In decide trials the participants, it seems, were not able to reliably identify whether they had really had time to decide – at least, not based on internal signals. The authors explain that this result is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a conscious veto, but simple to understand if the veto is considered an unconscious process.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; Thus it seems that the intention to move might not only arise from the subconscious, but it may only be inhibited if the subconscious says so. This conclusion could suggest that the phenomenon of "consciousness" is more of narration than direct arbitration (i.e. unconscious processing causes all thoughts, and these thoughts are again processed subconsciously).

=====Criticisms=====
After the above experiments, the authors concluded that subjects sometimes could not distinguish between "producing an action without stopping and stopping an action before voluntarily resuming", or in other words, they could not distinguish between actions that are immediate and impulsive as opposed to delayed by deliberation.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; To be clear, one assumption of the authors is that all the early (600&amp;nbsp;ms) actions are unconscious, and all the later actions are conscious. These conclusions and assumptions have yet to be debated within the scientific literature or even replicated (it is a very early study).

The results of the trial in which the so-called "successful decide" data (with its respective longer time measured) was observed may have possible implications{{clarify|date=June 2012}} for our understanding of the role of consciousness as the modulator of a given action or response — and these possible implications cannot merely be omitted or ignored without valid reasons, specially when the authors of the experiment suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

It is worth noting that Libet consistently referred to a veto of an action that was initiated endogenously.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"/&gt; That is, a veto that occurs in the absence of external cues, instead relying on only internal cues (if any at all). This veto may be a different type of veto than the one explored by Kühn and Brass using their decide signal.

Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds &amp;mdash; a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:
* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations
so that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom Evolves" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf Dennett, D. ''The Self as Responding and Responsible Artefact'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The point of no return ===
In early 2016, [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] published a paper by researchers in [[Berlin]], Germany, ''The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements'', in which the authors set out to investigate whether human subjects had the ability to veto an action (in this study, a movement of the foot) after the detection of its [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/1080|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2016-01-26|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4743787|pmid = 26668390|pages = 1080–1085|volume = 113|issue = 4|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1513569112|first = Matthias|last = Schultze-Kraft|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Birman|first3 = Marco|last3 = Rusconi|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Allefeld|first5 = Kai|last5 = Görgen|first6 = Sven|last6 = Dähne|first7 = Benjamin|last7 = Blankertz|first8 = John-Dylan|last8 = Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; is an instance of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neural oscillation|electrical activity]] within the [[motor cortex]], quantified by the use of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], that occurs moments before a motion is performed by a person: it is considered a signal that the brain is "getting ready" to perform the motion. The study found evidence that these actions can be vetoed even after the BP is detected (i. e. after it can be seen that the brain has started preparing for the action). The researchers maintain this is evidence for the existence of at least some degree of free will in humans:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neuroscience and Free Will Are Rethinking Their Divorce|url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html|website = Science of Us|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously, it had been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brain might not stand in the way of free will|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22144-brain-might-not-stand-in-the-way-of-free-will/|website = New Scientist|access-date = 2016-02-13|first = Anil|last = Ananthaswamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, given the unconscious nature of the BP and its usefulness in predicting a person's movement, these are movements that are initiated by the brain without the involvement of the conscious will of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/21870/free_will_web.pdf|title = Libet and the Case for Free Will Scepticism|date = |access-date = |website = Oxford University|publisher = Oxford University Press|last = Swinburne|first = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Libet Experiments|url = http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html|website = www.informationphilosopher.com|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that subjects were able to "override" these signals and stop short of performing the movement that was being anticipated by the BP. Furthermore, researchers identified what was termed a "point of no return": once the BP is detected for a movement, the person could refrain from performing the movement only if they attempted to cancel it 200 [[millisecond]]s or longer before the onset of the movement. After this point, the person was unable to avoid performing the movement. Previously, [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, USA, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuronal prediction of free will ===
Despite criticisms, experimenters are still trying to gather data that may support the case that conscious "will" can be predicted from brain activity. fMRI machine learning of brain activity (multivariate pattern analysis) has been used to predict the user choice of a button (left/right) up to 7 seconds before their reported will of having done so.&lt;ref name="soonetal" /&gt; Brain regions successfully trained for prediction included the frontopolar cortex ([[anterior]] [[Lateral and medial|medial]] [[prefrontal cortex]]) and [[precuneus]]/[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[cingulate cortex]] (medial [[parietal cortex]]). In order to ensure report timing of conscious "will" to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500ms apart), and upon pressing the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% accuracy rate, which may be limited by experimental setup; machine learning data limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision.

Another version of the fMRI multivariate pattern analysis experiment was conducted using an abstract decision problem, in an attempt to rule out the possibility of the prediction capabilities being product of capturing a built-up motor urge.&lt;ref name="SoonHe2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soon|first1=C. S.|last2=He|first2=A. H.|last3=Bode|first3=S.|last4=Haynes|first4=J.-D.|title=Predicting free choices for abstract intentions|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=110|issue=15|year=2013|pages=6217–6222|issn=0027-8424|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212218110|pmid=23509300|pmc=3625266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each frame contained a central letter like before, but also a central number, and a surrounding 4 possible "answers numbers". The participant first chose in their mind whether they wished to perform an addition or difference (subtraction) operation (and noted the central letter on the screen at the time of this decision). The participant then performed the mathematical operation based on the central numbers shown in the next two frames. In the following frame the participant then chose the "answer number" corresponding to the result of the operation. They were further presented with a frame which allowed them to indicate the central letter appearing on the screen at the time of their original decision. This version of the experiment discovered a brain prediction capacity of up to 5 seconds before the conscious will to act.

Multivariate pattern analysis using EEG has suggested that an evidence based perceptual decision model may be applicable to free will decisions.&lt;ref name="BodeSewell2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=S.|last2=Sewell|first2=D.

Furthermore, when the participant was unable to determine the nature of the stimulus the recent decision history predicted the neural activity (decision). The starting point of evidence accumulation was in effect shifted towards a previous choice (suggesting a priming bias). Another study has found that subliminally priming a participant for a particular decision outcome (showing a cue for 13ms) could be used to influence free decision outcomes.&lt;ref name="MattlerPalmer2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattler|first1=Uwe|last2=Palmer|first2=Simon|title=Time course of free-choice priming effects explained by a simple accumulator model|journal=Cognition|volume=123|issue=3|year=2012|pages=347–360|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.03.002|pmid=22475294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it has been found that decision history alone can be used to predict future decisions. The prediction capacities of the Soon et al. (2008) experiment were successfully replicated using a linear SVM model based on participant decision history alone (without any brain activity data).&lt;ref name="LagesJaworska2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lages|first1=Martin|last2=Jaworska|first2=Katarzyna|title=How Predictable are "Spontaneous Decisions" and "Hidden Intentions"? Comparing Classification Results Based on Previous Responses with Multivariate Pattern Analysis of fMRI BOLD Signals|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=3|year=2012|issn=1664-1078|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a recent study has sought to confirm the applicability of a perceptual decision model to free will decisions.&lt;ref name="BodeBogler2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=Stefan|last2=Bogler|first2=Carsten|last3=Haynes|first3=John-Dylan|title=Similar neural mechanisms for perceptual guesses and free decisions|journal=NeuroImage|volume=65|year=2013|pages=456–465|issn=1053-8119|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.09.064|pmid=23041528}}&lt;/ref&gt; When shown a masked and therefore invisible stimulus, participants were asked to either guess between a category or make a free decision for a particular category. Multivariate pattern analysis using fMRI could be trained on "free decision" data to successfully predict "guess decisions", and trained on "guess data" in order to predict "free decisions" (in the [[cuneus|precuneus and cuneus]] region).

Contemporary voluntary decision prediction tasks have been criticised based on the possibility the neuronal signatures for pre-conscious decisions could actually correspond to lower conscious processing rather than unconscious processing.&lt;ref name="MillerSchwarz2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Jeff|last2=Schwarz|first2=Wolf|title=Brain signals do not demonstrate unconscious decision making: An interpretation based on graded conscious awareness|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=24|year=2014|pages=12–21|issn=1053-8100|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2013.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; People may be aware of their decisions before making their report yet need to wait several seconds to be certain. Such a model does not however explain what is left unconscious if everything can be conscious at some level (and the purpose of defining separate systems). Yet limitations remain in free will prediction research to date. In particular, the prediction of considered judgements from brain activity involving thought processes beginning minutes rather than seconds before a conscious will to act, including the rejection of a conflicting desire. Such are generally seen to be the product of sequences of evidence accumulating judgements.

It has been suggested that sense authorship is an illusion.&lt;ref name="Wegner2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00002-0 |title=The mind's best trick: How we experience conscious will |year=2003 |last1=Wegner |first1=Daniel M |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=65–69 |pmid=12584024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconscious causes of thought and action might facilitate thought and action, while the agent experiences the thoughts and actions as being dependent on conscious will. We may over-assign agency because of the evolutionary advantage that once came with always suspecting there might be an agent doing something (e.g. predator). The idea behind retrospective construction is that, while part of the "yes, I did it" feeling of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] seems to occur during action, there also seems to be processing performed after the fact – after the action is performed – to establish the full feeling of agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2004_2/Rakos_2004.pdf | title=The Belief in Free Will as a Biological Adaptation: Thinking Inside and Outside the Behavior Analytic Box | author=Richard F.

Unconscious agency processing can even alter, in the moment, how we perceive the timing of sensations or actions.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2497 |title=Human volition: Towards a neuroscience of will |year=2008 |last1=Haggard |first1=Patrick |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=934–46 |pmid=19020512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007"/&gt; Kühn and Brass apply retrospective construction to explain the two peaks in "successful decide" RT's. They suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated, but that the impulsive early decide trials that should have been labelled "failed to decide" were mistaken during unconscious agency processing. They say that people "persist in believing that they have access to their own cognitive processes" when in fact we do a great deal of automatic unconscious processing before conscious perception occurs.

It should be noted that criticism to Wegner's claims regarding the significance of introspection illusion for the notion of free will has been published.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. criticism by H. Andersen in his paper with the title 'Two Causal Mistakes in Wegner's Illusion of Conscious Will' ; Also as a criticism, read "On the alleged illusion of conscious will' by Van Duijn and Sacha Bem.

===Manipulating choice===

[[File:Transcranial magnetic stimulation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] uses magnetism to safely stimulate or inhibit parts of the brain.]]
Some research suggests that [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] can be used to manipulate the perception of authorship of a specific choice.&lt;ref name="Walsh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Walsh|title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Neurochronometrics of Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rACRPwAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Mit Press|isbn=978-0-262-73174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments showed that neurostimulation could affect which hands people move, even though the experience of free will was intact. An early [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] study revealed that activation of one side of the neocortex could be used to bias the selection of one's opposite side hand in a forced-choice decision task.&lt;ref name="ammon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.53.8.705 |title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation can influence the selection of motor programmes |year=1990 |last1=Ammon |first1=K |last2=Gandevia |first2=S C |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=705–7 |pmid=2213050 |pmc=488179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammon and Gandevia found that it was possible to influence which hand people move by stimulating [[frontal lobe|frontal]] regions that are involved in movement planning using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.

Right-handed people would normally choose to move their right hand 60% of the time, but when the right hemisphere was stimulated they would instead choose their left hand 80% of the time (recall that the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere for the right). Despite the external influence on their decision-making, the subjects continued to report that they believed their choice of hand had been made freely. In a follow-up experiment, [[Alvaro Pascual-Leone]] and colleagues found similar results, but also noted that the transcranial magnetic stimulation must occur within 200 milliseconds, consistent with the time-course derived from the Libet experiments.&lt;ref name="Brasil-NetoPascual-Leone1992"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.55.10.964 |title=Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation and response bias in a forced-choice task |year=1992 |last1=Brasil-Neto |first1=J P |last2=Pascual-Leone |first2=A |last3=Valls-Sole |first3=J |last4=Cohen |first4=L G |last5=Hallett |first5=M |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=964–6 |pmid=1431962 |pmc=1015201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, a team of researchers from the UK and the US published a paper demonstrating similar findings.

===Manipulating the perceived intention to move===

Various studies indicate that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies have focused on the pre-[[supplementary motor area]] (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008"/&gt; In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual awareness of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating [[premotor cortex|premotor]] brain regions.&lt;ref name="DesmurgetReilly2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desmurget|first1=M.|last2=Reilly|first2=K. T.|last3=Richard|first3=N.|last4=Szathmari|first4=A.|last5=Mottolese|first5=C.|last6=Sirigu|first6=A.|title=Movement Intention After Parietal Cortex Stimulation in Humans|journal=Science|volume=324|issue=5928|year=2009|pages=811–813|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1169896|pmid=19423830}}&lt;/ref&gt; When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.

This suggests that awareness of an intention to move may literally be the "sensation" of the body's early movement, but certainly not the cause. Other studies have at least suggested that "The greater activation of the SMA, SACC, and parietal areas during and after execution of internally generated actions suggests that an important feature of internal decisions is specific neural processing taking place during and after the corresponding action. Therefore, awareness of intention timing seems to be fully established only after execution of the corresponding action, in agreement with the time course of neural activity observed here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/neuro.09.014.2007 |title=High-frequency oscillations in distributed neural networks reveal the dynamics of human decision making |year=2008 |last1=Guggisberg |first1=Adrian G. |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=1 |pmid=18958227 |last2=Dalal |first2=SS |last3=Findlay |first3=AM |last4=Nagarajan |first4=SS |pages=14 |pmc=2525986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment involved an electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while the participant was led to believe they were entirely self-conducted.&lt;ref name="WegnerWheatley1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wegner|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Wheatley|first2=Thalia|title=Apparent mental causation: Sources of the experience of will.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=7|year=1999|pages=480–492|issn=0003-066X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480|pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and it was found that if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones they were more likely to say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires: priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).

Lau et al. set up an experiment where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) pulse, and the other was given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16&amp;nbsp;ms, and shifted back the 14&amp;nbsp;ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200&amp;nbsp;ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements.&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007" /&gt; Often it is thought that if free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.

===Related models===

The idea that intention co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement is reminiscent of "forward models of motor control" (or FMMC, which have been used to try to explain [[inner speech]]). FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction – the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they are in control of a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see [[self serving bias]]es) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.009 |title=Metacognition of agency across the lifespan |year=2010 |last1=Metcalfe |first1=Janet |last2=Eich |first2=Teal S. |last3=Castel |first3=Alan D. |journal=Cognition |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=267–82 |pmid=20570251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, it is by the application of the forward model that one might imagine how other consciousness processes could be the result of efferent, predictive processing. If the conscious self is the efferent copy of actions and vetoes being performed, then the consciousness is a sort of narrator of what is already occurring in the body, and an incomplete narrator at that. Haggard, summarizing data taken from recent neuron recordings, says "these data give the impression that conscious intention is just a subjective corollary of an action being about to occur".&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Parallel processing helps explain how we might experience a sort of [[Libertarian free will|contra-causal free will]] even if it were determined.

How the brain constructs [[consciousness]] is still a mystery, and cracking it open would have a significant bearing on the question of free will. Numerous different models have been proposed, for example, the [[Multiple Drafts Model]] which argues that there is no central [[Cartesian theater]] where conscious experience would be represented, but rather that consciousness is located all across the brain. This model would explain the delay between the decision and conscious realization, as experiencing everything as a continuous 'filmstrip' comes behind the actual conscious decision. In contrast, there exist models of [[Cartesian materialism]] that have gained recognition by neuroscience, implying that there might be special brain areas that store the contents of consciousness; this does not, however, rule out the possibility of a conscious will. Other models such as [[epiphenomenalism]] argue that conscious will is an illusion, and that consciousness is a by-product of physical states of the world. Work in this sector is still highly speculative, and researchers favor no single model of consciousness. (See also: [[Philosophy of mind]].)

=== Related brain disorders ===
Various brain disorders implicate the role of unconscious brain processes in decision making tasks. Auditory hallucinations produced by Schizophrenia seem to suggest a divergence of will and behaviour.&lt;ref name="Wegner2003" /&gt; The left brain of people whose hemispheres have been disconnected has been observed to invent explanations for body movement initiated by the opposing (right) hemisphere, perhaps based on the assumption that their actions are consciously willed.&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gazzaniga|first1=Michael S.|title=The Cognitive Neurosciences|year=1984|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, people with 'alien hand syndrome' are known to conduct complex motor movements against their will.&lt;ref name="GeschwindIacoboni1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geschwind|first1=D.

=== Neural models of voluntary action ===
A neural model for voluntary action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008" /&gt; The first involving early preparatory signals ([[basal ganglia]] [[substantia nigra]] and [[striatum]]), prior intention and deliberation (medial [[prefrontal cortex]]), motor preparation/readiness potential ([[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]]), and motor execution ([[primary motor cortex]], [[spinal cord]] and [[muscle]]s). The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping ([[premotor cortex]], [[primary motor cortex]], [[Postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal cortex]], and back to the [[premotor cortex]]). He proposed that voluntary action involves external environment input ('when decision'), motivations/reasons for actions (early 'whether decision'), task and action selection ('what decision'), a final predictive check (late 'whether decision') and action execution.

Another neural model for voluntary action also involves what, when, and whether (WWW) based decisions.&lt;ref name="BrassLynn2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brass|first1=Marcel|last2=Lynn|first2=Margaret T.|last3=Demanet|first3=Jelle|last4=Rigoni|first4=Davide|title=Imaging volition: what the brain can tell us about the will|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=229|issue=3|year=2013|pages=301–312|issn=0014-4819|doi=10.1007/s00221-013-3472-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 'what' component of decisions is considered a function of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], which is involved in conflict monitoring.&lt;ref name="MuellerBrass2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Veronika A.|last2=Brass|first2=Marcel|last3=Waszak|first3=Florian|last4=Prinz|first4=Wolfgang|title=The role of the preSMA and the rostral cingulate zone in internally selected actions|journal=NeuroImage|volume=37|issue=4|year=2007|pages=1354–1361|issn=1053-8119|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.06.018|pmid=17681798}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing ('when') of the decisions are considered a function of the [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]], which is involved in motor preparation.&lt;ref name="Krieghoff2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krieghoff|first1=Veronika|title=Dissociating what and when of intentional actions|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=3|year=2009|issn=1662-5161|doi=10.3389/neuro.09.003.2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, the 'whether' component is considered a function of the [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] medial [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="BrassLynn2013"/&gt;

=== Prospection ===
{{Main article|Prospection}}
[[Martin Seligman]] and others criticize the classical approach in science which views animals and humans as "driven by the past", and suggest instead that people and animals draw on experience to evaluate prospects they face, and act accordingly. The claim is made that this purposive action includes evaluation of possibilities that have never occurred before, and is experimentally verifiable.&lt;ref name=Seligman1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seligman2/&gt;

Seligman and others argue that free will and the role of subjectivity in consciousness can be better understood by taking such a "prospective" stance on cognition, and that "accumulating evidence in a wide range of research suggests [this] shift in framework".&lt;ref name=Seligman2/&gt;

'''''News from Nowhere''''' (1890) is a classic work combining [[utopian socialism]] and [[soft science fiction]] written by the artist, designer and socialist pioneer [[William Morris]]. It was first published in serial form in the ''[[Commonweal (UK)|Commonweal]]'' journal beginning on 11 January 1890. In the novel, the narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] and awakes to find himself in a future society based on [[common ownership]] and democratic control of the [[means of production]]. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society functions simply because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find pleasure in their work.

The novel explores a number of aspects of this society, including its organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people. Morris fuses [[Marxism]] and the romance tradition when he presents himself as an enchanted figure in a time and place different from Victorian England. As Morris, the romance character, quests for love and fellowship—and through them for a reborn self—he encounters romance archetypes in Marxist guises. Old Hammond is both the communist educator who teaches Morris the new world and the wise old man of romance. Dick and Clara are good comrades and the married lovers who aid Morris in his wanderings. The journey on the Thames is both a voyage through society transformed by revolution and a quest for happiness. The goal of the quest, met and found though only transiently, is Ellen, the symbol of the reborn age and the bride the alien cannot win. Ellen herself is a multidimensional figure: a working class woman emancipated under socialism, she is also a benign nature spirit as well as the soul in the form of a woman.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Silver, Carole. The Romance of William Morris. Athens, Ohio: Ohio UP, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The book offers Morris' answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolishment of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and work.

In the novel, Morris tackles one of the most common [[criticisms of socialism]]; the supposed lack of incentive to work in a communistic society. Morris' response is that all work should be creative and pleasurable. This differs from the majority of Socialist thinkers, who tend to assume that while work is a necessary evil, a well-planned equal society can reduce the amount of work needed to be done by each worker. ''News From Nowhere'' was written as a [[libertarian socialist]] response to an earlier book called ''[[Looking Backward]]'', a book that epitomises a kind of [[state socialism]] that Morris abhorred. It was also meant to directly influence various currents of thought at the time regarding the tactics to bring about socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Anarchism and Utopia: William Morris's News from Nowhere |author=Michael Holzman |journal=ELH |volume=51 |issue=3 |date=1984 |pages=589–603 |doi=10.2307/2872939 |jstor=2872939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Looking Backward'' ==
Morris reviewed the novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' in the ''[[Commonweal (UK)|Commonweal]]'' on 21 June 1889. In his review, Morris objects to Bellamy's portrayal of his imagined society as an authority for what socialists believe. Morris writes,
'In short a machine life is the best which Mr. Bellamy can imagine for us on all sides; it is not to be wondered at then that this, his only idea for making labour tolerable is to decrease the amount of it by means of fresh and ever fresh developments of machinery… I believe that this will always be so, and the multiplication of machinery will just multiply machinery; I believe that the ideal of the future does not point to the lessening of men's energy by the reduction of labour to a minimum, but rather the reduction of pain in labour to a minimum, so small that it will cease to be pain; a dream to humanity which can only be dreamed of till men are even more completely equal than Mr. Bellamy's utopia would allow them to be, but which will most assuredly come about when men are really equal in condition.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first= William|title=Bellamy's Looking Backward|work=The William Morris Internet Archive Works (1889)|accessdate=14 April 2008|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1889/backward.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris’s basic antipathy with Bellamy arose chiefly from his disagreement with Bellamy’s social values and aesthetic convictions. While Bellamy favoured the urban, Morris favoured the pastoral; while Bellamy lauded the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the power of the machine, Morris yearned for the restoration of an organic way of life which utilised machines only to alleviate the burdens which humans might find irksome; while Bellamy sought salvation through an omnipotent state, Morris wished for a time when it would have withered away.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

More specifically, Morris criticised the limited nature of Bellamy's idea of life. He identifies five concerns – work, technology, centralisation, cities, arts – which demonstrates the "half change" advanced in ''Looking Backward''. Morris's review also contains an alternate future society in each of these instances. This was the framework based on which he would later attempt to elaborate his vision of an utopia in ''News From Nowhere''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, W. (2003). ''News From Nowhere''. Leopold, D (Ed.). New York, Oxford University Press Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender in Nowhere==
In ''News From Nowhere'' Morris describes women in the society as ‘respected as a child bearer and rearer of children desired as a woman, loved as a companion, un-anxious for the future of her children’ and hence possessed of an enhanced 'instinct for maternity'. The sexual division of labour remains intact. Women are not exclusively confined to domestic labour, although the range of work they undertake is narrower than that of man; but domestic labour is seen as something for which women are particularly fitted.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levitas|first= Ruth|title=Who Holds the Hose? Domestic Labor in the Work of Bellamy, Gillman, and Morris - Ebsco Host : Academic Search Premier 6 (1996)|accessdate= 15 March 2008|url=http://corvette.salemstate.edu:2561/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=3&amp;sid=a7ff7a45-7fc8-4ef0-9c41-0ca33040fd09%40sessionmgr9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ‘The men have no longer any opportunity of tyrannising over the women, or the women over the men; both of those took place in old times. The women do what they can do best and what they like best, and the men are neither jealous nor injured by it.’&lt;ref name=Nowhere/&gt; 
The practice of women waiting on men at meals is justified on the grounds that, 
‘It is a great pleasure to a clever woman to manage a house skilfully, and to do so that all house-mates about her look pleased and are grateful to her. And then you know everybody likes to be ordered about by a pretty woman…’&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

Morris presents us with a society in which women are relatively free from the oppression of men; while domestic work, respected albeit gender-specific in Morris's work here as elsewhere, is portrayed as a source of potential pleasure and edification for all denizens of his Utopia.

== Marriage ==
Morris offers a Marxian view of marriage and divorce. Dick and Clara were once married with two children. Then Clara ‘got it in her head she was in love with someone else,’ so she left Dick only to reconcile with him again.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Jan. "Concerning Love: News From Nowhere and Gender." William Morris &amp; News from Nowhere: A Vision for Our Time. Eds. Stephen Coleman and Paddy O'Sullivan. (Bideford, Devon: Green Books, 1990): 107–125&lt;/ref&gt; Old Hammond informs the reader that there are no courts in ''Nowhere'', no divorce in ''Nowhere'', and furthermore no contractual marriage in ''Nowhere''. When dealing with marriage and divorce Old Hammond explains,
‘You must understand once for all that we have changed these matters; or rather that our way of looking at them has changed…We do not deceive ourselves, indeed, or believe that we can get rid of all the trouble that besets the sexes… but we are not so mad as to pile up degradation on that unhappiness by engaging in sordid squabbles about livelihood and position, and the power of tyrannising over the children who have been the result of love or lust.'&lt;ref name=Nowhere&gt;{{cite book

In Nowhere people live in groups of various sizes, as they please, and the nuclear family is not necessary.

Concerning marriage, the people of ''Nowhere'' practice monogamy but are free to pursue romantic love because they are not bound by a contractual marriage.

== Education ==
Early in the novel we learn that though the people of ''Nowhere'' are learned there is no formal schooling for children. Although Oxford still exists as a place to study the 'Art of Knowledge', we learn that people are free to choose their own form of education. As for educating children, we learn that children in ''Nowhere''
‘often make up parties, and come to play in the woods for weeks together in the summer time, living in tents, as you see. We rather encourage them to do it; they learn to do things for themselves, and get to know the wild creatures; and you see the less they stew inside houses the better for them.’&lt;ref name=Nowhere/&gt;

Here Morris breaks away from the traditional institutions of 19th century England. Learning through nature is the best suited lifestyle for this agrarian society.

== How We Might Live ==
''News from Nowhere'' is a [[utopia]]n representation of Morris’ vision of an ideal society. "Nowhere" is in fact a literal translation of the word "utopia".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|utopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Utopia, an imagined society, is idyllic because the people in it are free from the burdens of industrialisation and therefore they find harmony in a lifestyle that coexists with the natural world.
In a lecture "How We Live and How We Might Live" 1884, Morris gives his opinions about an ideal existence. This opinion is the bedrock for the novel. Morris writes,
'Before I leave this matter of the surroundings of life, I wish to meet a possible objection. I have spoken of machinery being used freely for releasing people from the more mechanical and repulsive part of necessary labour; it is the allowing of machines to be our masters and not our servants that so injures the beauty of life nowadays. And, again, that leads me to my last claim, which is that the material surroundings of my life should be pleasant, generous, and beautiful; that I know is a large claim, but this I will say about it, that if it cannot be satisfied, if every civilised community cannot provide such surroundings for all its members, I do not want the world to go on.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salmon|first= Nicholas|title=Works|work=Marxist Internet Archive|accessdate= 14 April 2008|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
{{Move section to wikiquote}}
* As he formed the words, the train stopped at his station, five minutes' walk from his own house, which stood on the banks of the [[Thames]], a little way above an ugly suspension bridge. He went out of the station, still discontented and unhappy, muttering "If I could but see it! if I could but see it!" but had not gone many steps towards the river before (says our friend who tells the story) all that discontent and trouble seemed to slip off him.
* "I think I know what you mean. You think that I have done you a service; so you feel yourself bound to give me something which I am not to give to a neighbour, unless he has done something special for me. I have heard of this kind of thing; but pardon me for saying, that it seems to us a troublesome and roundabout custom; and we don't know how to manage it. And you see this ferrying and giving people casts about the water is my business, which I would do for anybody; so to take gifts in connection with it would look very queer. Besides, if one person gave me something, then another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won't think me rude if I say that I shouldn't know where to stow away so many mementos of friendship."
* All this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to have made the old man talk more. But Dick got rather restive under so much ancient history: besides, I suspect he wanted to keep me as fresh as he could for his great-grandfather. So he burst out laughing at last, and said: "Excuse me, neighbours, but I can't help it. Fancy people not liking to work! — it's too ridiculous. Why, even you like to work, old fellow — sometimes," said he, affectionately patting the old horse with the whip. "What a queer disease! it may well be called Mulleygrubs!"
* "Man alive! how can you ask such a question? Have I not told you that we know what a prison means by the undoubted evidence of really trustworthy books, helped out by our own imaginations? And haven't you specially called me to notice that the people about the roads and streets look happy? and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours were shut up in prison, while they bore such things quietly? And if there were people in prison, you couldn't hide it from folk, like you can an occasional man-slaying; because that isn't done of set purpose, with a lot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison business is. Prisons, indeed! O no, no, no!"
* "Then you suppose nonsense," said he. "I know that there used to be such lunatic affairs as divorce courts. But just consider; all the cases that came into them were matters of property quarrels: and I think, dear guest," said he, smiling, "that though you do come from another planet, you can see from the mere outside look of our world that quarrels about private property could not go on amongst us in our days."
* But of course I understand your point of view about education, which is that of times past, when 'the struggle for life,' as men used to phrase it (i.e., the struggle for a slave's rations on one side, and for a bouncing share of the slave-holders' privilege on the other), pinched 'education' for most people into a niggardly dole of not very accurate information; something to be swallowed by the beginner in the art of living whether he liked it or not, and was hungry for it or not: and which had been chewed and digested over and over again by people who didn't care about it in order to serve it out to other people who didn't care about it."
* "I must now shock you by telling you that we have no longer anything which you, a native of another planet, would call a government."
* "A terrible tyranny our Communism, is it not? Folk used often to be warned against this very unhappiness in times past, when for every well-fed, contented person you saw a thousand miserable starvelings. Whereas for us, we grow fat and well-liking on the tyranny; a tyranny, to say the truth, not to be made visible by any microscope I know. Don't be afraid, my friend; we are not going to seek for troubles by calling our peace and plenty and happiness by ill names whose very meaning we have forgotten!"
* "As a matter of fact, the history of the terrible period of transition from commercial slavery to freedom may thus be summarised. When the hope of realising a communal condition of life for all men arose, quite late in the nineteenth century, the power of the middle classes, the then tyrants of society, was so enormous and crushing, that to almost all men, even those who had, you may say despite themselves, despite their reason and judgement, conceived such hopes, it seemed a dream. So much was this the case that some of those more enlightened men who were then called Socialists, although they well knew, and even stated in public, that the only reasonable condition of Society was that of pure Communism (such as you now see around you), yet shrunk from what seemed to them the barren task of preaching the realisation of a happy dream. Looking back now, we can see that the great motive-power of the change was a longing for freedom and equality, akin if you please to the unreasonable passion of the lover; a sickness of heart that rejected with loathing the aimless solitary life of the well-educated man of that time: phrases, my dear friend, which have lost their meaning to us of the present day; so far removed we are from the dreadful facts which they represent."
* "Go back again, now you have seen us, and your outward eyes have learned that in spite of all the infallible maxims of your day there is yet a time of rest in store for the world, when mastery has changed into fellowship — but not before. Go back again, then, and while you live you will see all round you people engaged in making others live lives which are not their own, while they themselves care nothing for their own real lives — men who hate life though they fear death. Go back and be the happier for having seen us, for having added a little hope to your struggle. Go on living while you may, striving, with whatsoever pain and labour needs must be, to build up little by little the new day of fellowship, and rest, and happiness."

==Influence==
The title ''News from Nowhere'' has inspired many enterprises, including a [[Independent bookstore|political bookstore]] in Liverpool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=News From Nowhere Co-operative Ltd |url=http://www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk/ |title=News From Nowhere Radical &amp; Community Bookshop, Liverpool |publisher=Newsfromnowhere.org.uk |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theatre company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromnowhere.net/ |title=Tim Crouch news from nowhere -news from nowhere |publisher=Newsfromnowhere.net |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a short film describing a fictional trip by Morris up the [[River Thames]] exploring ideas of aesthetic and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/63268/news-from-nowhere.html |title=News from Nowhere &amp;#124; review, synopsis, book tickets, showtimes, movie release date &amp;#124; Time Out London |publisher=Timeout.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary art exhibition at the [[Lucy Mackintosh]] Gallery in Lausanne, Switzerland, with six British artists: Michael Ashcroft, Juan Bolivar, Andrew Grassie, Justin Hibbs, Alistair Hudson, and [[Peter Liversidge]] during April–May 2005 was called ''News From Nowhere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucymackintosh.ch/archives.php?id=19 |title=Galerie Lucy Mackintosh |publisher=Lucymackintosh.ch |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk singer [[Leon Rosselson]]'s song "Bringing the News from Nowhere", from his eponymous 1986 album, is a tribute to Morris.

''News From Nowhere'' was an influencing factor in historian [[G. D. H. Cole]]'s conversion to socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Margaret. ''The Life of G.D.H. Cole'', p.33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A track on ''[[Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!]]'' by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] (2008) is called "[[More News from Nowhere]]".

In 2008 Waltham Forest commissioned the composer, Mike Roberts, to create a new community symphony based on the story. Incorporating Morris' axiom of 'art for the people and by the people' the piece was written in collaboration with 180 primary school children - all composing small fragments of music that were weaved into the final piece.  The result was a 90-minute work for children's choir, orchestra and 10 other smaller ensembles.  The work is being recorded with the artistic support of The William Morris Gallery during 2014-15 for release in June 2015 to commemorate the novel's 125th anniversary.

The novel ''News from Gardenia'' (2012) by [[Robert Llewellyn]] was influenced by ''News from Nowhere''.

Korean artists Moon Kyungwon and Jeon Joonho were inspired by ''News from Nowhere'' in their collaborative project "News from Nowhere" (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromnowhere.kr/ |title=Home : News from nowhere |publisher=Newsfromnowhere.kr |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the English band [[Darkstar (band)|Darkstar]] released an album titled ''News from Nowhere''.

The book was adapted by Sarah Woods as a radio play, broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 25 May 2016.

''[[The Baffler]]'' magazine hosts a monthly [[podcast]] by journalist Corey Pein called ''[https://thebaffler.com/latest/category/bafflercasts/news-from-nowhere News from Nowhere]'', inspired by Morris' book.

The Open Group information security management maturity model' ('''O-ISM3''') is an Information Security Management Framework that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing information security management systems.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==History==
The original motivation behind O-ISM3 development was to narrow the gap between theory and practice for information security management systems, and the trigger was the idea of linking security management and maturity models. O-ISM3 strove to keep clear of a number of pitfalls with previous approaches.&lt;ref name="mikko"&gt;Siponen, Mikko (2002-08-24). Designing Secure Information Systems and Software: Critical evaluation of the existing approaches and a new paradigm. ''OULU 2002'', 24 August 2002. Retrieved from http://jultika.oulu.fi/files/isbn9514267907.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project looked at [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]], [[ISO 9000]], [[COBIT]], [[ITIL]], [[ISO/IEC 27001:2013]], and other standards, and found some potential for improvement in several fields, such as linking security to business needs, using a process based approach, providing some additional details (who, what, why) for implementation, and suggesting specific metrics, while preserving compatibility with current IT and security management standards.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Availability==
[[The Open Group]] provides O-ISM3 free of charge to organisations for their own internal noncommercial purposes.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The '''PAIRS Foundation''', Inc., develops [[experiential learning]] curricula and programs designed to reconcile married couples and prevent divorce. It is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation based in Broward County, Florida. The company was originally established in Virginia as PAIRS, Ltd. in 1983 and as The PAIRS Foundation, Inc. in Florida in 2000. In 2010, PAIRS, Ltd. formally merged into The PAIRS Foundation, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunbiz.org Florida Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAIRS Foundation owns copyright to marriage and relationship education programs that are taught by instructors worldwide who are trained, certified and licensed by the foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumer.pairs.com/directory.php PAIRS Instructors]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the trademark,  "skills for successful relationships".

==Mission==

PAIRS Foundation's mission is to "teach those attitudes, emotional understandings, and behaviors that nurture and sustain healthy relationships and to make this knowledge broadly available on behalf of a safer, saner, more loving world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://instructor.pairs.com/history.html PAIRS Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The PAIRS 120-hour semester course was   developed in 1975 by marriage and family therapist Lori Heyman Gordon as a graduate program for counseling students at [[American University]] in Washington, D.C.; it was one of the first comprehensive educational programs in the United States that sought to reduce marriage and family breakdown through [[Relationship Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lori Heyman. "Passage to Intimacy", Fireside Books, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  The course integrated and  work by  [[Virginia Satir]], [[Daniel Harold Casriel|Daniel Casriel]], [[Murray Bowen]], [[James Framo]], George Bach, Gordon and others.&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria, Rita. "Building Intimate Relationships", "The Saga of PAIRS." Routledge, December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casriel_website"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Lori Heyman|title=From the road to happiness to a relationship roadmap for couples|url=http://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/22/from-the-road-to-happiness-to-a-relationship-roadmap-for-couples/|website=DanielCasriel.com|publisher=Purpose Built Families Foundation|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 1982 [[Washington Post]] article featured PAIRS as a new alternative to traditional [[Family Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/03/31/couples-can-this-marriage-be-saved-331 McNees, Pat. "Can This Marriage Be Saved," Washington Post, November 29, 1982.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1997, Carlos Durana, Ph.D., conducted early studies on the impact of the program, many of which were published in industry journals. During that period, articles about the program appeared in ''Newsweek'', ''Time'', ''Cosmopolitan,''  '' Ladies Home Journal'' and ''Psychology Today'' Gordon was also featured in interviews on CNN, NBC's Today Show, Geraldo, The Gordon Elliot Show, and CBN.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lori Heyman. "If You Really Loved Me", Science and Behavior, Palo Alto (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation began piloting intensive couples seminars, ranging from one to four days, in the late nineties. A December 1998 ''New Woman'' magazine cover story featured the first-person account of Molly and Chris Hanson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pairs.com/marriage_makeover.html Hanson, Molly. "PAIRS Marriage Makeover," New Woman Magazine, December 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2000, the foundation's CEO Seth Eisenberg was a guest on ABC's ''[[Politically Incorrect]] with Bill Maher'' to discuss Florida's Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act, mandating relationship skills training in high schools and for couples applying for marriage licenses. O .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=203828&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=2480254  - TV Guide, Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Gordon was recognized with the Impact Award of the Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples Education:&lt;ref&gt;[http://instructor.pairs.com/history.html PAIRS History]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAIRS was awarded a $5 million federal grant in 2006 by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], to provide classes and conduct a five-year evaluation of the program's impact among English, Spanish and French/Creole-speaking couples and singles in Florida's Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2010/04/14/marriages-families-jobs/ Falciglia, Amanda. "Study offers hope for marriages, families, and jobs," FatherhoodChannel.com, April 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, PAIRS was featured in a [[Time magazine]] cover story by Belinda Luscombe, "Who Needs Marriage?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2032116,00.html Luscombe, Belinda. "Who Needs Marriage," Time Magazine, November 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Time Magazine]] story that month featured a PAIRS [[iPhone]] App and questioned, "Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2010/11/01/can-an-iphone-app-save-your%C2%A0marriage/ Luscombe, Belinda. "Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage," Time Magazine, November 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] [[Veterans Health Administration]] featured PAIRS in an article about helping Veterans strengthen "their most significant relationships":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Department of Veterans Affairs is trying a new path to caring for and healing the nation's wounded Veterans. Now, in addition to repairing their damaged bodies and minds, VA is going one step further and helping to repair their crumbling intimate relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/health/NewsFeatures/20121018a.asp Peterson, Hans. "Relationship Retreats: From Warriors to Soul Mates," Veterans Health Administration, October 18, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in October 2012, PAIRS Foundation's collaboration with the San Diego VA Healthcare System was recognized with the "Spirit of Planetree Award" for the program's impact strengthening relationships between "family, friends and social supports as a central component of patient-centered care."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/04/pairs-collaboration-with-va-recognized-with-prestigious-2012-spirit-of-planetree-award-104/ Henthorn, Robert.

In a joint effort with the Department of Veterans Affairs Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation Initiative, PAIRS Foundation published the ''PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide'' in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/pairs/docs/va_support PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide, January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation produced a video in May 2014 promoting the Warrior to Soul Mate program, supported by the PAIRS curriculum, as a valuable component of VA's efforts to promote health and wellness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1qDGaW-PbM U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation.

==Operation Sacred Trust==

In September 2011, the foundation's [[Operation Sacred Trust]] initiative, launched in collaboration with [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]], Henderson Behavioral Health, and Neighborhood Housing Services of South Florida, was awarded a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Supportive Services for Veteran Families ("SSVF"), to help end homelessness for Veteran families in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. An additional $1 million was awarded in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf.asp U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Supportive Services for Veteran Families website]&lt;/ref&gt; Two November 11, 2012 articles featured Operation Sacred Trust as a new model for ending homelessness for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lilly|first=Christiana|title=Operation Sacred Trust Combats Veteran Homelessness In South Florida With $1 Million Grant |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/homeless-veterans-operation-sacred_n_2093151.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman-Eisenberg|first=Stephanie|title=A step forward for homeless vets|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/11/11/3090081/a-step-forward-for-homeless-vets.html|publisher=Miami Herald|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2012, a CBS News story featured Operation Sacred Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newland|first=Maggie|title=Miami Man Turns Life Around, Gives Back to Fellow Veterans|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/11/12/miami-man-turns-life-around-gives-back-to-fellow-veterans/|publisher=CBS Miami|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage Equality==

{{Sociology}}
'''Phenomenology''' within [[sociology]] ('''Phenomenological sociology''') is the study of the formal structures of concrete social existence as made available in and through the analytical description of acts of intentional consciousness. The object of such an analysis is the meaningful lived world of everyday life: the ''[[Lebenswelt]]'', or "Life-world". The task of phenomenological sociology, like that of every other phenomenological investigation, is to account for, or describe, the formal structures of this object of investigation in terms of subjectivity, as an object-constituted-in-and-for-consciousness.&lt;ref name=Gurwitsch64&gt;{{cite book | last = Gurwitsch | first = Aron | authorlink = Aron Gurwitsch | title = The Field of Consciousness | publisher = Duquesne Univ Pr | year = 1964 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8207-0043-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That which makes such a description different from the "naive" subjective descriptions of the man in the street, or those of the traditional social scientist, both operating in the natural attitude of everyday life, is the utilization of [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological methods]].

==Context==
Social phenomenologists talk about the social construction of reality. They view social order as a creation of everyday interaction, often looking at conversations to find the methods that people use to maintain social relations.&lt;ref name=Novak1&gt;{{cite book | last = Novak | first = Mark | authorlink = Mark Novak | title = Issues in Aging, 3rd Ed. | publisher = Pearson | year = 2012 | location = | pages = 30 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-205-83195-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading exponent of Phenomenological Sociology was [[Alfred Schütz]] (1899–1959). Schütz sought to provide a critical philosophical foundation for [[Max Weber]]'s [[Verstehen|interpretive sociology ''(verstehende Soziologie)'']] by applying methods and insights derived from the phenomenological philosophy of [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) to the study of the social world.&lt;ref name=Schutz67&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Schütz]], Alfred |title=Phenomenology of the Social World |publisher=[[Northwestern University Press]] |location=Evanston, Ill |year=1967 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8101-0390-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barber04&gt;{{cite book |author=Barber, Michael D. |title=The participating citizen: a biography of Alfred Schutz |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |location=Albany, N.Y |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7914-6141-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=March 2011}} It is the building of this bridge between Husserlian phenomenology and Weberian sociology that serves as the starting point for contemporary phenomenological sociology. This does not mean, of course, that all versions of phenomenological sociology must be based on Weberian themes. In point of fact, there is some historical evidence [Dilthey's influence on Weber re: the former's theory of ''[[Weltanschauung]]'', and Husserl's influence on Dilthey re: the former's theory of meaning] that would support the argument that elements of Weberian sociology are themselves based on certain phenomenological themes; especially in regard to the theory of the intended meaning of an act, and ideas regarding theory and concept formation.

While Husserl's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of intentional consciousness, Schütz's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of what he termed the Life-world.&lt;ref name=Schutz80&gt;{{cite book |author=Schütz, Alfred|author2=Luckmann, Thomas |title=Structures of the Life-World, Vol. 1 (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy) |publisher=Northwestern University Press |location=Evanston, Ill |year=1980 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8101-0622-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl's work was conducted as a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] phenomenology of consciousness. Schütz's work was conducted as a mundane phenomenology of the social world.&lt;ref name=Natanson74&gt;{{cite book |author=Natanson, Maurice Alexander |title=Edmund Husserl: Philosopher of Infinite Tasks |publisher=Northwestern University Press |location=Evanston, Ill |year=1974 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8101-0456-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=March 2011}} The difference in their respective projects rests at the level of analysis, the objects taken as a topic of study, and the type of phenomenological reduction that is employed for the purposes of analysis.

Ultimately these two distinct phenomenological projects should be seen as complementary, with the structures of the latter dependent on the structures of the former. That is, valid phenomenological descriptions of the formal structures of the life-world should be wholly consistent with the descriptions of the formal structures of intentional consciousness. It is from the latter that the former derives its validity, verifiability, and [[truth value]].&lt;ref name=Sokolowski00&gt;{{cite book |author=Sokolowski, Robert |title=Introduction to phenomenology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-521-66792-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in keeping with Husserl's conception of phenomenology as "First Philosophy", the foundation, or ground, for both philosophy and all of the sciences.&lt;ref name=Husserl89&gt;{{cite book |author=Husserl, Edmund |title=The crisis of European sciences and transcendental phenomenology: an introduction to phenomenological philosophy |publisher=Northwestern University Press |location=Evanston, Ill |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8101-0458-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General thesis of the natural attitude==

The general thesis of the natural attitude is the ideational foundation for the fact-world of our straightforward, common sense social experience {{Elucidate|date=March 2011}}. It unites the world of individual objects into a unified world of meaning, which we assume is shared by any and all who share our culture (Schütz:1962) {{Clarify|date=March 2011}}. It forms the underpinning for our thoughts and actions. It is the projected assumption, or belief, in a naturally occurring social world that is both factually objective in its existential status, and unquestioned in its "natural" appearance; social objects [persons, language, institutions, etc.] have the same existential "thing" status as objects occurring in nature [rocks, trees, and animals, etc.].

Although it is often referred to as the "General Thesis of the Natural Attitude", it is not a thesis in the formal sense of the term, but a non-thematic assumption, or belief, that underlies our sense of the objectivity and facticity of the world, and the objects appearing in this world. The facticity of this world of common sense is both unquestioned and virtually "unquestionable"; it is sanctionable as to its status as that which "is", and that which "everyone", or, at least, "any reasonable person", agrees to be the case with regard to the factual character of the world.

As far as traditional social science is concerned, this taken-for-granted world of social facts is the starting and end point for any and all investigations of the social world. It provides the raw, observable, taken-for-granted "data" upon which the findings of the social sciences are idealized, conceptualized, and offered up for analysis and discourse. Within traditional social science, this "data" is formulated into a second order world of abstractions and idealizations constituted in accordance with these sciences' pre-determined interpretive schemes (Husserl:1989).

Schutz's phenomenological descriptions are made from within the phenomenological attitude, after the phenomenological reduction [epoche], which serves to suspend this assumption, or belief, and reveal the phenomena occurring within the natural attitude as objects-for-consciousness.

==Phenomenological reduction==

Martin Heidegger aptly characterizes Husserl's phenomenological research project as, "...the analytic description of intentionality in its ''a priori''" (Heidegger:1992); as it is the phenomenon of intentionality which provides the mode of access for conducting any and all phenomenological investigations, and the ultimate ground or foundation guaranteeing any findings resulting from any such inquiry. In recognizing consciousness as having the formal structure of intentionality, as always having ''consciousness of'' an intended object, Husserlian phenomenology has located the access point to a radical new form of scientific description.

Methodologically, access to this field is obtained through the phenomenological reduction. While there is some controversy as to the official name, number, and levels of the reduction, this internal argument among the philosophers need not concern us. For the purposes of a mundane phenomenology of the social world, we, as phenomenological social scientists, engage in a mundane phenomenological reduction called the [[Epoché]]. The hallmark of this form of the reduction is what it reveals about its field of inquiry: a mundane phenomenology of the social world defines its phenomenal field as the intersubjective region of mundane consciousness as appearing from within the natural attitude.

The phenomenological reduction as applied to a mundane analysis of the social world consists of the bracketing [equivalents: methodical disregard, putting out of play, suspension] of the thesis of the natural attitude. This bracketing is nothing more than a bracketing of the existential belief in the existence of the objective world; the existential status of the world itself is ''not'' called into question. The result of this bracketing is that our attention is shifted from the objects in the world as they occur in nature, to the objects in the world as they appear for consciousness - as phenomenon for intentional consciousness. Our descriptions of objects in the world are now transformed from the naive descriptions of objects as occurring in nature, to phenomenological descriptions of objects as appearing for consciousness. In short, for the purpose of a mundane phenomenological analysis within the natural attitude, the epoche transforms objects as occurring in nature into: objects-for-subjectivity, objects-for-consciousness, objects-as-intended.

Keep in mind that for positivism, the meaning of an object is, by definition, "objective". That is, the meaning of the object is a property of the object itself, is independent of any particular observer, and "the same" for any and all observers regardless of their orientation or perspective. For phenomenology, an object is always intended, and constituted, as meaningful by a particular intending subject from a particular orientation and from a particular perspectival viewing point. In addition, phenomenologically speaking, the meaning of the object cannot be separated from its phenomenonality, or materiality, and cannot be constituted qua meaningful object without the meaning bestowing act of intending on the part of a constituting subject.

For a phenomenology undertaken within the natural attitude, meaning does not inherently accrue to an object as a thing-in-itself, is not an "add-on" to the object [a label], and is not separable from the object as constituted by the intending subject in the act of meaning constitution. For phenomenology, the meaning and the object [in its "materiality"] are co-constituted in the intending of the object by the subject - phenomenologically speaking there are only meaningful objects. There is no such thing as a neutrally valued object,  or a meaningless object, and the notion of an object as "nonsense" is itself a meaningful determination - as the existentialists would say, we are condemned to meaning.

Note that, because we as observers have already been born into an already-existing social world that is already pre-interpreted - through both social meanings and through architectural and business intentionality - and 'made meaningful-to-us' as an intersubjectively available "entity", any proposal that the subject is creating the object, or creating the meaning of the object as an individual achievement in a particular situation is a misrepresentation of what is actually taking place. Within the 'Natural Attitude of Everyday Life', the subject's role in the constitution of meaningful objects is better understood as a reading off, or interpretation, of the meaning from the object-as-intended. This reading off, or interpretation, of the object's meaning is an intersubjective achievement of the intending subject that takes place within the intersubjective realm of the natural attitude.

A '''singing school''' is a school in which students are taught to sightread [[vocal music]]. Singing schools are a long-standing cultural institution in the [[U.S. Southern states|Southern United States]]. While some singing schools are offered for credit, most are informal programs.

Historically, singing schools have been strongly affiliated with [[Protestant]] Christianity. Some are held under the auspices of particular Protestant denominations that maintain a tradition of [[a cappella]] singing, such as the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]] and the [[Primitive Baptists]]. Others are associated with [[Sacred Harp]], [[Southern Gospel]], and similar singing traditions, whose music is religious in character but sung outside the context of church services.

Often the music taught in singing schools uses [[shape note]] or "buckwheat" notation, in which the notes are assigned particular shapes to indicate their pitch. There are two main varieties: the four-note, or ''fasola'', system used in Sacred Harp music, and the seven-note system developed by [[Jesse B. Aikin]] used in southern gospel music. Some churches, including some Baptist churches (though fewer and fewer), use [[hymnal]]s printed in shape notes.

==History==
===Origins===

[[File:1783 April5 SingingSchool NewHampshireGazette.png|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Dearborn]]'s singing school announcement in the New Hampshire Gazette, April 5, 1783]]

The first American singing schools began in [[New England]] in the early 1700s as an effort to spread the use of [[written music]] in [[congregational singing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sing with Understanding |last=Eskew |first=Harry |author2=Hugh T. McElrath  |year=n.d. |isbn=0-8054-6809-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithCreek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithcreekmusic.com/Hymnology/American.Hymnody/Singing.Schools/Singing.School.movement.html |title=The American Singing School Movement |publisher=Smith Creek Music |year=2001 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[religious denomination|denominations]], controversies existed on whether congregations should sing audibly, and whether singing should be limited to the [[Psalms of David]]. This New England controversy centered around "regular singing" versus the "usual way". The "usual way" consisted of the entire congregation singing in unison tunes passed on by [[oral tradition]], often by [[lining out]].&lt;ref name="SmithCreek"/&gt; "Regular singing" consisted of ''singing by note'' or ''rule''.&lt;ref&gt;The word "regular" nowadays has multiple meanings; what was meant by "regular" at the time (Marini 2003, 75) was "according to rule", following the original Latin ''regula'', meaning "rule". See [[Oxford English Dictionary]], entry for "regular".&lt;/ref&gt; Though intended for the entire congregation, "regular singing" sometimes divided the congregation into singers and ''non-singers''. [[Massachusetts]] [[Religious minister|minister]]s [[John Tufts (music educator)|John Tufts]] and [[Thomas Walter (minister)|Thomas Walter]] were among the leaders in this "reform movement". Tufts' ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes'' is generally considered the first singing school manual. By the middle of the 18th century, the arguments for "regular singing" had generally won the day.

By the end of the 18th century, the singing school manuals had become standardized in an oblong-shaped ''tunebook'', usually containing tunes with only one stanza of text. [[William Billings]] was one of the most important of the New England singing school teachers of this period. One of his singing schools was held in 1774 in Stoughton, Massachusetts. According to Hall, "The school taught by William Billings is the first and only one with all the pupils given." A few members of this singing school later helped organize the [[Stoughton Musical Society]] in 1786, now the oldest surviving choral society in the United States.

New systems of [[music notation]], including [[shape note]]s, were developed by singing school teachers as an aid in learning to sing by sight. Early shape note systems were an extension of "Old English" or "Lancashire" [[Solfège|sol-fa]], developed in Britain in the 17th century, with the intention of teaching school children to sing, and remained in use there until the 20th. This system was used in America from the late 17th century. The use of "shape-notes" themselves was an American innovation, first put into use in 1798 in Philadelphia and soon popular in the many hymn collections published in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes. P., ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', Oxford, 1970, (p.564) &lt;/ref&gt; The four-shape "fasola" system was prominent before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and survives largely in the [[Sacred Harp]] tradition, while various seven-shape systems gained popularity beginning in the 1860s and are still seen in some denominational hymnals and in [[Southern Gospel]] music.

By the 1820s, the "Yankee singing school" had become a nationwide phenomenon. However, advocates of [[European classical music]] like [[Lowell Mason]] sought to suppress the tradition in favor of a more cosmopolitan idiom, which came to be taught at public school (United States)|public schools]].&lt;ref name="SmithCreek"/&gt; Eventually, singing schools in the north faded to obscurity, while in the south and west they became a prominent social event for small-town Americans looking for something to do.

===Continued use in the South===
Singing schools were often taught by traveling singing masters who would stay in a location for a few weeks and teach a singing school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blevins|first1=Brooks|title=Where Everything New Is Old Again|journal=Southern Cultures|date=2016|volume=22|issue=4|pages=135-149|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=120126150&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A singing school would be a large social event for a town; sometimes nearly everyone in the town would attend and people would come from many miles away. Many young men and women saw singing schools as important to their [[courtship|courtship traditions]]. Sometimes the entire life of a town would be put on hold as everyone came out to singing school. In this way, singing schools resembled [[tent revival]]s.

[[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] related attending a singing school as a young lady in ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'', one of the [[Little House on the Prairie|''Little House'' books]]. Her husband, [[Almanzo Wilder]], courted her there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=These Happy Golden Years |last=Wilder |first=Laura Ingalls |authorlink=Laura Ingalls Wilder |year=2003 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=0-06-052315-8 |pages=232–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common tradition was the "singing school picture" taken of the teacher and students on the last day of school. Many old black and white photographs exist as records of these events from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; [[genealogy|genealogical researchers]] often find these records useful. The pictures were often taken in front of a blackboard with the name of the teacher and date of the school. Some of these pictures show small classes, while others record very large schools.

[[File:Singing school conducted at Jacksonville as part of six-day Extension school in August, 1915. - (3856643518).jpg|thumb|left|Singing school conducted at Jacksonville as part of six-day Extension school in August, 1915.]]

Singing schools underwent many changes as cities grew and the population moved away from an agrarian lifestyle. One of the most notable changes was the length of schools; at one time it was common for schools to last four weeks. This was shortened over time, and today most of the larger singing schools last for two weeks, though the Gospel Singers of America School of Gospel Music still lasts for three weeks.

Singing schools began to hold less interest for the general public as time went on and could rarely get attendance from an entire town. Instead, schools were attended by interested students from a much larger region. In the case of Sacred Harp singing schools, students usually attended because of their interest in the Sacred Harp singing tradition; in other schools, students attended because of an interest in vocal church music, especially for those churches that maintain an all-''a capella'' music tradition.

The tradition of having singing school masters who traveled between various towns where they held singing schools faded away in favor of holding annual schools in the same location. Primitive Baptists have established three permanently located singing schools in the state of [[Texas]] (Harmony Hill at [[Azle, Texas|Azle]], Harmony Plains at [[Cone, Texas|Cone]], and Melody Grove at [[Warren, Tyler County, Texas|Warren]]). There are several non-denominational seven-shape singing schools throughout the southern United States, including the North Georgia School of Gospel Music in Georgia, [[Ben Speer]]'s Stamps-Baxter School of Music in Tennessee, Cumberland Valley School of Gospel Music in Tennessee and the Alabama School of Gospel Music in Alabama. Camp Fasola, which was founded in 2003, is an attempt by Sacred Harp enthusiasts to establish a permanent annual singing school.

Singing schools are also common in Missionary Baptist churches, as well as rural churches across the South, including Methodist, Church of God, Southern Baptist, and other denominations. Many of these churches still prefer to use shape note hymnals, as opposed to round note versions that many denominational publishing houses provide. In southern gospel singing schools, [[convention songbook]]s are used to teach sight-singing, music theory, and conducting. Some music publishing companies have also published music theory books for use in the schools.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Rudiments of Music'' and ''Understanding Harmony'', published by ''jeffress/phillips music co.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==

The basic subjects taught at singing schools are [[music theory]] and [[sight reading]] (the ability to sing a piece of music on first reading). Most southern gospel schools also focus extensively on song leading, the ability to direct a group in vocal music. Song leading requires both music theory skills and [[public speaking]] skills. In addition, many schools teach composition and ear training. Most song leading classes are open to both genders, but some schools are associated with Christian religious traditions that allow only male leadership and therefore only offer such classes to males.
 
Sacred Harp singing schools use one or more of the 20th century editions of ''The Sacred Harp'' as curriculum. Some of these schools are one-day workshops held in conjunction with a singing convention. The emphasis is on teaching newcomers and advanced musicians the note system and traditions of Sacred Harp.

Many singing schools have published their own small textbooks on music theory, harmony, and song and lyric composition. These are often offered to students as part of the tuition charge of the school.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}Some schools, such as Cumberland Valley School of Gospel Music, include in the tuition charge a convention songbook rather than a textbook.  At some schools students purchase a [[pitch pipe]] or [[tuning fork]]. Primitive Baptists commonly practice pitching by ear rather than with a pitch pipe. Southern gospel schools primarily use the [[piano]] as accompaniment. Pitch pipes are sometimes used in individual classes for brief practice.

It is common for students to continue to return to their singing school year after year, even after completing the entire curriculum the school offers, for additional practice as well as for the social opportunity the school represents. Many singing school students eventually become teachers. Though singing schools are not as prominent today as they were, for many people they are still an important yearly event.

The '''Smith chart''', invented by  [[Phillip Hagar Smith|Phillip H. Smith]] (1905–1987),&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. H.; Transmission Line Calculator; Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 1, pp 29-31, January 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. H.; An Improved Transmission Line Calculator; Electronics, Vol. 17, No. 1, p 130, January 1944&lt;/ref&gt; is a graphical aid or [[nomogram]] designed for [[electrical engineering|electrical and electronics engineers]] specializing in [[radio frequency]] (RF) engineering to assist in solving problems with [[transmission line]]s and [[impedance matching|matching]] circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Ramo, Whinnery and Van Duzer (1965); "Fields and Waves in Communications Electronics"; John Wiley &amp; Sons; pp 35-39. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith chart can be used to simultaneously display multiple parameters including [[electrical impedance|impedances]], [[admittance]]s, [[reflection coefficient]]s, &lt;math&gt;S_{nn}\,&lt;/math&gt; [[scattering parameters]], [[noise figure]] circles, constant gain contours and regions for [[stability theory|unconditional stability]], including mechanical [[vibration]]s analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M. (2005); ''Microwave Engineering, Third Edition'' (Intl. Ed.); John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.; pp 64-71. {{ISBN|0-471-44878-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Guillermo (1997); ''Microwave Transistor Amplifiers Analysis and Design, Second Edition''; Prentice Hall NJ; pp 93-103. {{ISBN|0-13-254335-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith chart is most frequently used at or within the [[1 (number)|unity]] [[radius]] region. However, the remainder is still mathematically relevant, being used, for example, in [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] design and [[stability theory|stability]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Guillermo (1997) (op. cit);pp 98-101&lt;/ref&gt;

While the use of paper Smith charts for solving the complex mathematics involved in matching problems has been largely replaced by software based methods, the Smith chart display is still the preferred method of displaying how RF parameters behave at one or more frequencies, an alternative to using [[table (information)|tabular]] information. 
Thus most RF circuit analysis software includes a Smith chart option for the display of results and all but the simplest impedance measuring instruments can display measured results on a Smith chart display.

[[Image:Smith chart gen.svg|thumbnail|250px|An impedance Smith chart (with no data plotted)]]

==Overview==
[[Image:NetworkAnalyzer.jpg|400px|thumb|A [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]] ([[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] 8720A) showing a Smith chart.]]
The Smith chart is plotted on the [[complex number|complex]] [[reflection coefficient]] plane in [[dimension|two dimensions]] and is scaled in normalised [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (the most common), normalised [[admittance]] or both, using different colours to distinguish between them. These are often known as the Z, Y and YZ Smith charts respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Guillermo (1997) (op. cit);p 97&lt;/ref&gt; Normalised scaling allows the Smith chart to be used for problems involving any [[characteristic impedance|characteristic]] or system impedance which is represented by the center point of the chart. The most commonly used normalization impedance is 50 [[ohm]]s. Once an answer is obtained through the graphical constructions described below, it is straightforward to convert between normalised impedance (or normalised admittance) and the corresponding unnormalized value by multiplying by the characteristic impedance (admittance). Reflection coefficients can be read directly from the chart as they are unitless parameters.

The Smith chart has [[circumference|circumferential]] scaling in [[wavelengths]] and [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. The wavelengths scale is used in [[distributed element model|distributed component]] problems and represents the distance measured along the transmission line connected between the [[signal generator|generator]] or source and the load to the point under consideration. The degrees scale represents the angle of the voltage reflection coefficient at that point. The Smith chart may also be used for [[lumped element model|lumped element]] matching and analysis problems.

Use of the Smith chart and the interpretation of the results obtained using it requires a good understanding of [[alternating current|AC circuit theory]] and transmission line theory, both of which are pre-requisites for RF engineers.

As impedances and admittances change with frequency, problems using the Smith chart can only be solved manually using one [[frequency]] at a time, the result being represented by a [[point (geometry)|point]]. This is often adequate for [[frequency range|narrow band]] applications (typically up to about 5% to 10% [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) but for wider bandwidths it is usually necessary to apply Smith chart techniques at more than one frequency across the operating frequency band. Provided the frequencies are sufficiently close, the resulting Smith chart points may be joined by straight lines to create a [[locus (mathematics)|locus]].

A locus of points on a Smith chart covering a range of frequencies can be used to visually represent:
*how [[capacitance|capacitive]] or how [[inductance|inductive]] a load is across the frequency range
*how difficult matching is likely to be at various frequencies
*how well matched a particular component is.

The accuracy of the Smith chart is reduced for problems involving a large locus of impedances or admittances, although the scaling can be magnified for individual areas to accommodate these.

==Mathematical basis==
[[File:Smith chart explanation.svg|thumb|500px|right|Most basic use of an impedance Smith chart. A wave travels down a [[transmission line]] of [[characteristic impedance]] ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, terminated at a load with [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and normalised impedance {{nowrap|1=''z''=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. There is a [[signal reflection]] with coefficient Γ. Each point on the Smith chart simultaneously represents both a value of ''z'' (bottom left), and the corresponding value of Γ (bottom right), related by {{nowrap|1=''z''=(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Γ)/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;Γ).}}]]

===Actual and normalised impedance and admittance===
A transmission line with a characteristic impedance of &lt;math&gt;Z_0\,&lt;/math&gt; may be universally considered to have a [[characteristic admittance]] of &lt;math&gt;Y_0\,&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;Y_0 = \frac{1}{Z_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Any impedance, &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{T}\,&lt;/math&gt; expressed in ohms, may be normalised by dividing it by the characteristic impedance, so the normalised impedance using the lower case ''z''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{T} = \frac{Z_\text{T}}{Z_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, for normalised admittance
:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{T} = \frac{Y_\text{T}}{Y_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;
The [[International system of units|SI unit]] of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is the [[ohm]] with the symbol of the upper case [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[omega]] (Ω) and the [[SI unit]] for [[admittance]] is the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] with the symbol of an upper case letter S. Normalised impedance and normalised admittance are [[dimensionless]]. Actual impedances and admittances must be normalised before using them on a Smith chart. Once the result is obtained it may be de-normalised to obtain the actual result.

===The normalised impedance Smith chart===
[[File:Transmission_line_pulse_reflections.gif|thumb|right|300px|Transmission lines terminated by an open circuit (top) and a short circuit (bottom). A pulse reflects perfectly off both these terminations, but the sign of the reflected voltage is opposite in the two cases. Black dots represent electrons, and arrows show the electric field.]]
Using transmission line theory, if a transmission line is [[Electrical termination|terminated]] in an impedance (&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{T}\,&lt;/math&gt;) which differs from its characteristic impedance (&lt;math&gt;Z_0\,&lt;/math&gt;), a [[standing wave]] will be formed on the line comprising the [[resultant]] of both the incident or '''f'''orward (&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F}\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the '''r'''eflected or reversed (&lt;math&gt;V_\text{R}\,&lt;/math&gt;) waves. Using [[complex number|complex]] [[exponential function|exponential]] notation:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F} = A \exp(j \omega t)\exp(+\gamma \ell)~\,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{R} = B \exp(j \omega t)\exp(-\gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(j \omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[time|temporal]] part of the wave
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(\pm\gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the spatial part of the wave and
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f\,&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] in [[radian]]s per [[second]] (rad/s)
:&lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[frequency]] in [[hertz]] (Hz)
:&lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; is the time in seconds (s)
:&lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; are [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\ell\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance measured along the transmission line from the load toward the generator in metres (m)
Also
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \alpha + j \beta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[propagation constant]] which has units 1/m
where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[attenuation constant]] in [[neper]]s per metre (Np/m)
:&lt;math&gt;\beta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase constant]] in [[radian]]s per metre (rad/m)
The Smith chart is used with one frequency (&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;) at a time, and only for one moment (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) at a time, so the temporal part of the phase (&lt;math&gt;\exp(j \omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt;) is fixed. All terms are actually multiplied by this to obtain the [[instantaneous phase]], but it is conventional and understood to omit it. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F} = A \exp(+\gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{R} = B \exp(-\gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the forward and reverse voltage amplitudes at the load.

====The variation of complex reflection coefficient with position along the line====
[[File:SmithChartLineLength.svg|thumb|right|500px|Looking towards a load through a length &lt;math&gt;\ell\,&lt;/math&gt; of lossless transmission line, the impedance changes as &lt;math&gt;\ell\,&lt;/math&gt; increases, following the blue circle. (This impedance is characterized by its reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{reflected}}/V_{\text{incident}}&lt;/math&gt;.) The blue circle, centered within the impedance Smith chart, is sometimes called an ''SWR circle'' (short for ''constant [[standing wave ratio]]'').]]
The complex voltage reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident (or forward) wave. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{V_\text{R}}{V_\text{F}} = \frac{B \exp(-\gamma \ell)}{A \exp(+\gamma \ell)} = C \exp(-2 \gamma \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''C''}} is also a constant.

For a uniform transmission line (in which &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is constant), the complex reflection coefficient of a standing wave varies according to the position on the line. If the line is [[attenuation (electronics)|lossy]] (&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero) this is represented on the Smith chart by a [[spiral]] path. In most Smith chart problems however, losses can be assumed negligible (&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the task of solving them is greatly simplified. For the loss free case therefore, the expression for complex reflection coefficient becomes 
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \Gamma_\text{L} \exp(-2 j \beta \ell)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_\text{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the reflection coefficient at the load, and &lt;math&gt;\ell\,&lt;/math&gt; is the line length from the load to the location where the reflection coefficient is measured. The phase constant &lt;math&gt;\beta\,&lt;/math&gt; may also be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength ''within the transmission line'' at the test frequency.

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \Gamma_\text{L} \exp\left(\frac{-4 j \pi}{\lambda}\ell\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
This equation shows that, for a standing wave, the complex reflection coefficient and impedance repeats every half wavelength along the transmission line. The complex reflection coefficient is generally simply referred to as reflection coefficient. The outer circumferential scale of the Smith chart represents the distance from the generator to the load scaled in wavelengths and is therefore scaled from zero to 0.50&amp;nbsp;.

====The variation of normalised impedance with position along the line====
If &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt; are the voltage across and the current entering the termination at the end of the transmission line respectively, then
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F} + V_\text{R} = V\,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{F} - V_\text{R} = Z_0 I\,&lt;/math&gt;.
By dividing these equations and substituting for both the voltage reflection coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{V_\text{R}}{V_\text{F}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and the normalised impedance of the termination represented by the lower case ''z'', subscript T
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}=\frac{V}{Z_0 I}\,&lt;/math&gt;
gives the result:
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}=\frac{1+\Gamma}{1-\Gamma}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
Alternatively, in terms of the reflection coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{z_\text{T} - 1}{z_\text{T} + 1}\,&lt;/math&gt;
These are the equations which are used to construct the ''Z'' Smith chart. Mathematically speaking &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}\, &lt;/math&gt; are related via a [[Möbius transformation]].

Both &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}\,&lt;/math&gt; are expressed in [[complex numbers]] without any units. They both change with frequency so for any particular measurement, the frequency at which it was performed must be stated together with the characteristic impedance.

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed in [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[angle]] on a [[complex plane|polar diagram]]. Any actual reflection coefficient must have a magnitude of less than or equal to [[1 (number)|unity]] so, at the test frequency, this may be expressed by a point inside a circle of unity radius. The Smith chart is actually constructed on such a polar diagram. The Smith chart scaling is designed in such a way that reflection coefficient can be converted to normalised impedance or vice versa. Using the Smith chart, the normalised impedance may be obtained with appreciable accuracy by plotting the point representing the reflection coefficient ''treating the Smith chart as a polar diagram'' and then reading its value directly using the characteristic Smith chart scaling. This technique is a graphical alternative to substituting the values in the equations.

By substituting the expression for how reflection coefficient changes along an unmatched loss free transmission line
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{B \exp(-\gamma \ell)}{A \exp(\gamma \ell)} =\frac{B \exp(-j \beta \ell)}{A \exp(j \beta \ell)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
for the loss free case, into the equation for normalised impedance in terms of reflection coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{T}=\frac{1 + \Gamma}{1 - \Gamma}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
and using [[Euler's formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(j\theta) = \cos \theta + j \sin \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;
yields the impedance version transmission line equation for the loss free case:&lt;ref&gt;Hayt, William H Jr.; "Engineering Electromagnetics" Fourth Ed; McGraw-Hill International Book Company; pp 428–433. {{ISBN|0-07-027395-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{in} = Z_0 \frac{Z_\text{L} + j Z_0 \tan (\beta \ell)}{Z_0 + j Z_\text{L} \tan (\beta \ell)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{in}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance 'seen' at the input of a loss free transmission line of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, terminated with an impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Versions of the transmission line equation may be similarly derived for the admittance loss free case and for the impedance and admittance lossy cases.

The Smith chart graphical equivalent of using the transmission line equation is to normalise &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;, to plot the resulting point on a ''Z'' Smith chart and to draw a circle through that point centred at the Smith chart centre. The path along the arc of the circle represents how the impedance changes whilst moving along the transmission line. In this case the circumferential (wavelength) scaling must be used, remembering that this is the wavelength within the transmission line and may differ from the free space wavelength.

====Regions of the ''Z'' Smith chart====
If a polar diagram is mapped on to a [[cartesian coordinate system]] it is conventional to measure angles relative to the positive ''x''-axis using a [[counterclockwise]] direction for positive angles. The magnitude of a complex number is the length of a straight line drawn from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] to the point representing it. The Smith chart uses the same convention, noting that, in the normalised impedance plane, the positive x-axis extends from the center of the Smith chart at &lt;math&gt;z_\text{T} = 1 \pm j 0\,&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;z_\text{T} = \infty \pm j \infty\,&lt;/math&gt;. The region above the x-axis represents inductive impedances (positive imaginary parts) and the region below the {{math|''x''}}-axis represents capacitive impedances (negative imaginary parts).

If the termination is perfectly matched, the reflection coefficient will be zero, represented effectively by a circle of zero radius or in fact a point at the centre of the Smith chart. If the termination was a perfect open circuit or [[short circuit]] the magnitude of the reflection coefficient would be unity, all power would be reflected and the point would lie at some point on the unity circumference circle.

====Circles of constant normalised resistance and constant normalised reactance====
The normalised impedance Smith chart is composed of two families of circles: circles of constant normalised resistance and circles of constant normalised reactance. In the complex reflection coefficient plane the Smith chart occupies a circle of unity radius centred at the origin. In cartesian coordinates therefore the circle would pass through the points (+1,0) and (&amp;minus;1,0) on the ''x''-axis and the points (0,+1) and (0,&amp;minus;1) on the ''y''-axis.

Since both &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z\,&lt;/math&gt; are complex numbers, in general they may be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;z = a + j b\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = c + j d\,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' real numbers.

Substituting these into the equation relating normalised impedance and complex reflection coefficient:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}\,&lt;/math&gt;
gives the following result:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = c + j d = \left[\frac{a^2 + b^2 - 1}{(a + 1)^2 + b^2}\right] + j \left[\frac{2b}{(a + 1)^2 + b^2}\right]\,&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the equation which describes how the complex reflection coefficient changes with the normalised impedance and may be used to construct both families of circles.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, C. W.;"Transmission Lines for Communications with CAD Programs";Macmillan; pp 80-85. {{ISBN|0-333-47398-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Y'' Smith chart===
The ''Y'' Smith chart is constructed in a similar way to the ''Z'' Smith chart case but by expressing values of voltage reflection coefficient in terms of normalised admittance instead of normalised impedance. The normalised admittance ''y''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the reciprocal of the normalised impedance ''z''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{T}=\frac{1}{z_\text{T}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{T} = \frac{1-\Gamma}{1+\Gamma}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{ 1 - y_\text{T} }{ 1 + y_\text{T} }\,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''Y'' Smith chart appears like the normalised impedance type but with the graphic scaling rotated through 180°, the numeric scaling remaining unchanged.

The region above the ''x''-axis represents capacitive admittances and the region below the ''x''-axis represents inductive admittances. Capacitive admittances have positive [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] parts and inductive admittances have negative imaginary parts.

Again, if the termination is perfectly matched the reflection coefficient will be zero, represented by a 'circle' of zero radius or in fact a point at the centre of the Smith chart. If the termination was a perfect open or short circuit the magnitude of the voltage reflection coefficient would be unity, all power would be reflected and the point would lie at some point on the unity circumference circle of the Smith chart.

===Practical examples===
[[Image:SmithEx2.png|thumbnail|Example points plotted on the normalised impedance Smith chart]]
A point with a reflection coefficient magnitude 0.63 and angle 60° represented in polar form as &lt;math&gt;0.63\angle60^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt;, is shown as point P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the Smith chart. To plot this, one may use the circumferential (reflection coefficient) angle scale to find the &lt;math&gt;\angle60^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt; graduation and a ruler to draw a line passing through this and the centre of the Smith chart. The length of the line would then be scaled to P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; assuming the Smith chart radius to be unity. For example, if the actual radius measured from the paper was 100&amp;nbsp;mm, the length OP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would be 63&amp;nbsp;mm.

The following table gives some similar examples of points which are plotted on the ''Z'' Smith chart. For each, the reflection coefficient is given in polar form together with the corresponding normalised impedance in rectangular form. The conversion may be read directly from the Smith chart or by substitution into the equation.

===Working with both the ''Z'' Smith chart and the ''Y'' Smith charts===
In RF circuit and matching problems sometimes it is more convenient to work with admittances (representing [[electrical conductance|conductances]] and [[susceptance]]s) and sometimes it is more convenient to work with impedances (representing [[Electrical resistance|resistances]] and [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]]s). Solving a typical matching problem will often require several changes between both types of Smith chart, using normalised impedance for [[series and parallel circuits|series]] elements and normalised admittances for [[series and parallel circuits|parallel]] elements. For these a dual (normalised) impedance and admittance Smith chart may be used. Alternatively, one type may be used and the scaling converted to the other when required. In order to change from normalised impedance to normalised admittance or vice versa, the point representing the value of reflection coefficient under consideration is moved through exactly 180 degrees at the same radius. For example, the point P1 in the example representing a reflection coefficient of &lt;math&gt;0.63\angle60^\circ\,&lt;/math&gt; has a normalised impedance of &lt;math&gt; z_P = 0.80 + j1.40\,&lt;/math&gt;. To graphically change this to the equivalent normalised admittance point, say Q1, a line is drawn with a ruler from P1 through the Smith chart centre to Q1, an equal radius in the opposite direction. This is equivalent to moving the point through a circular path of exactly 180 degrees. Reading the value from the Smith chart for Q1, remembering that the scaling is now in normalised admittance,  gives &lt;math&gt;y_P = 0.30 - j0.54\,&lt;/math&gt;. Performing the calculation
:&lt;math&gt;y_\text{T} = \frac{1}{ z_\text{T} }\,&lt;/math&gt;
manually will confirm this.

Once a [[transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] from impedance to admittance has been performed, the scaling changes to normalised admittance until a later transformation back to normalised impedance is performed.

The table below shows examples of normalised impedances and their equivalent normalised admittances obtained by rotation of the point through 180°. Again, these may be obtained either by calculation or using a Smith chart as shown, converting between the normalised impedance and normalised admittances planes.

===Choice of Smith chart type and component type===
The choice of whether to use the ''Z'' Smith chart or the ''Y'' Smith chart for any particular calculation depends on which is more convenient. Impedances in series and admittances in parallel add while impedances in parallel and admittances in series are related by a reciprocal equation. If &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{TS} &lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent impedance of series impedances and &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{TP} &lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent impedance of parallel impedances, then
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{TS} = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z_\text{TP}} = \frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2} + \frac{1}{Z_3} + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;
For admittances the reverse is true, that is
:&lt;math&gt;Y_\text{TP} = Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Y_\text{TS}} = \frac{1}{Y_1} + \frac{1}{Y_2} + \frac{1}{Y_3} + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;
Dealing with the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]], especially in complex numbers, is more time consuming and error-prone than using linear addition. In general therefore, most [[Radio frequency|RF]] engineers work in the plane where the [[circuit topography]] supports linear addition. The following table gives the complex expressions for impedance (real and normalised) and admittance (real and normalised) for each of the three basic [[passive components|passive circuit elements]]: resistance, inductance and capacitance. Using just the characteristic impedance (or characteristic admittance) and test frequency an [[equivalent circuit]] can be found and vice versa.

==Using the Smith chart to solve conjugate matching problems with distributed components==
Distributed matching becomes feasible and is sometimes required when the physical size of the matching components is more than about 5% of a wavelength at the operating frequency. Here the electrical behaviour of many lumped components becomes rather unpredictable. This occurs in microwave circuits and when high power requires large components in shortwave, FM and TV Broadcasting,

For distributed components the effects on reflection coefficient and impedance of moving along the transmission line must be allowed for using the outer circumferential scale of the Smith chart which is calibrated in wavelengths.

The following example shows how a transmission line, terminated with an arbitrary load, may be matched at one frequency either with a series or parallel reactive component in each case connected at precise positions.

[[Image:SmithEx4.png|thumbnail|Smith chart construction for some distributed transmission line matching]]
Supposing a loss-free air-spaced transmission line of characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0 = 50 \ \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, operating at a frequency of 800&amp;nbsp;MHz, is terminated with a circuit comprising a 17.5 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistor in series with a 6.5 nanohenry (6.5 nH) inductor. How may the line be matched?

From the table above, the reactance of the inductor forming part of the termination at 800&amp;nbsp;MHz is
:&lt;math&gt;Z_L = j \omega L = j 2 \pi f L = j32.7 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
so the impedance of the combination (&lt;math&gt;Z_T&lt;/math&gt;) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Z_T = 17.5 + j32.7 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
and the normalised impedance (&lt;math&gt;z_T&lt;/math&gt;) is
:&lt;math&gt;z_T = \frac{Z_T}{Z_0} = 0.35 + j0.65\,&lt;/math&gt;
This is plotted on the Z Smith chart at point P&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;. The line OP&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; is extended through to the wavelength scale where it intersects at the point &lt;math&gt;L_1 = 0.098 \lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;. As the transmission line is loss free, a circle centred at the centre of the Smith chart is drawn through the point P&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; to represent the path of the constant magnitude reflection coefficient due to the termination. At point P&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; the circle intersects with the unity circle of constant normalised resistance at 
:&lt;math&gt;z_{P21} = 1.00 + j1.52\,&lt;/math&gt;.
The extension of the line OP&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; intersects the wavelength scale at &lt;math&gt;L_2 = 0.177 \lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the distance from the termination to this point on the line is given by
:&lt;math&gt;L_2 - L_1  = 0.177\lambda - 0.098\lambda = 0.079\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since the transmission line is air-spaced, the wavelength at 800&amp;nbsp;MHz in the line is the same as that in free space and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{c}{f}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of [[speed of light|electromagnetic radiation in free space]] and &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in hertz. The result gives &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 375 \ \mathrm{mm}\,&lt;/math&gt;, making the position of the matching component 29.6&amp;nbsp;mm from the load.

The conjugate match for the impedance at P&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;math&gt;z_{match}\,&lt;/math&gt;) is 
:&lt;math&gt;z_{match} = - j (1.52),\!&lt;/math&gt;
As the Smith chart is still in the normalised impedance plane, from the table above a series capacitor &lt;math&gt;C_m\,&lt;/math&gt; is required where
:&lt;math&gt;z_{match} = - j 1.52 = \frac{-j}{\omega C_m Z_0} = \frac{-j}{2 \pi f C_m Z_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Rearranging, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;C_m=\frac{1}{(1.52) \omega Z_0} = \frac{1}{(1.52)(2 \pi f) Z_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
Substitution of known values gives
:&lt;math&gt;C_m = 2.6 \ \mathrm{pF}\,&lt;/math&gt;
To match the termination at 800&amp;nbsp;MHz, a series capacitor of 2.6 pF must be placed in series with the transmission line at a distance of 29.6&amp;nbsp;mm from the termination.

An alternative shunt match could be calculated after performing a Smith chart transformation from normalised impedance to normalised admittance. Point Q&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; is the equivalent of P&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; but expressed as a normalised admittance. Reading from the Smith chart scaling, remembering that this is now a normalised admittance gives
:&lt;math&gt;y_{Q20} = 0.65 - j1.20\,&lt;/math&gt;
(In fact this value is not actually used). However, the extension of the line OQ&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; through to the wavelength scale gives &lt;math&gt;L_3 = 0.152 \lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;. The earliest point at which a shunt conjugate match could be introduced, moving towards the generator, would be at Q&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, the same position as the previous P&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, but this time representing a normalised admittance given by 
:&lt;math&gt;y_{Q21} = 1.00 + j1.52\,&lt;/math&gt;.
The distance along the transmission line is in this case 
:&lt;math&gt;L_2 + L_3  = 0.177\lambda + 0.152\lambda = 0.329\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;
which converts to 123&amp;nbsp;mm.

The conjugate matching component is required to have a normalised admittance (&lt;math&gt;y_{match}&lt;/math&gt;) of
:&lt;math&gt;y_{match} = - j1.52\,&lt;/math&gt;.
From the table it can be seen that a negative admittance would require an inductor, connected in parallel with the transmission line. If its value is &lt;math&gt;L_m\,&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;-j1.52 = \frac{-j}{\omega L_m Y_0}= \frac{-jZ_0}{2\pi f L_m}\,&lt;/math&gt;
This gives the result 
:&lt;math&gt;L_m = 6.5 \ \mathrm{nH}\,&lt;/math&gt;
A suitable inductive shunt matching would therefore be a 6.5 nH inductor in parallel with the line positioned at 123&amp;nbsp;mm from the load.

==Using the Smith chart to analyze lumped element circuits==
The analysis of lumped element components assumes that the wavelength at the frequency of operation is much greater than the dimensions of the components themselves. The Smith chart may be used to analyze such circuits in which case the movements around the chart are generated by the (normalized) impedances and admittances of the components at the frequency of operation. In this case the wavelength scaling on the Smith chart circumference is not used. The following circuit will be analyzed using a Smith chart at an operating frequency of 100&amp;nbsp;MHz. At this frequency the free space wavelength is 3 m. The component dimensions themselves will be in the order of millimetres so the assumption of lumped components will be valid. Despite there being no transmission line as such, a system impedance must still be defined to enable normalization and de-normalization calculations and &lt;math&gt;Z_0 = 50 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is a good choice here as &lt;math&gt;R_1 = 50 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;. If there were very different values of resistance present a value closer to these might be a better choice.

[[Image:SmithCctEx1.png|thumbnail|A lumped element circuit which may be analysed using a Smith chart]]
[[Image:SmithEx5.png|thumbnail|Smith chart with graphical construction for analysis of a lumped circuit]]
The analysis starts with a Z Smith chart looking into R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; only with no other components present. As &lt;math&gt;R_1 = 50 \ \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the system impedance, this is represented by a point at the centre of the Smith chart. The first transformation is OP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; along the line of constant normalized resistance in this case the addition of a normalized reactance of -''j''0.80, corresponding to a series capacitor of 40 pF. Points with suffix P are in the ''Z'' plane and points with suffix Q are in the ''Y'' plane. Therefore, transformations ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are from the Z Smith chart to the Y Smith chart and transformation ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is from the Y Smith chart to the Z Smith chart.

A generalized 3D Smith chart based on the extended complex plane ([[Riemann sphere]]) and [[inversive geometry]] was proposed in 2011. The chart unifies the passive and active circuit design on little and big circles on the surface of a unit sphere using the stereographic [[conformal map]] of the reflection coefficient's generalized plane. Considering the point at infinity, the space of the new chart includes all possible loads. The north pole is the perfect matching point, while the south pole is the perfect mismatch point.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Muller, Pablo Soto, D. Dascalu, D. Neculoiu, V.E.

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of gender''' is a prominent subfield of [[sociology]]. Social interaction directly correlated with sociology regarding social structure. One of the most important social structures is [[Social status|status]]. This is determined based on position that an individual possesses which effects how he/she will be treated by society. One of the most important statuses an individual claims is gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjjbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=gender+roles+in+marriage#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20roles%20in%20marriage&amp;f=false|title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda L.|date=2015-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317348085|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discourse and the academic literature generally use the term ''[[gender]]'' for the perceived or projected ([[Gender identity|self-identified]]) [[masculinity]] or [[femininity]] of a person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Introduction==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The term ''gender role'' was coined by [[John Money]] in a seminal 1955 paper where he defined it as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |url= |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |doi= |pmid=13260820 |quote=By the term, gender role, we mean all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism. Gender role is appraised in relation to the following: general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor, play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams, and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's gender is complex, encompassing countless characteristics of appearance, speech, movement and other factors not solely limited to [[biological sex]]. Societies tend to have [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] [[gender systems]] in which everyone is categorized as [[male]] or [[female]]. Some societies include a [[third gender]] role; for instance, the Native American [[Two-Spirit]] people and the [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]]s of India. There is debate over the extent to which gender is a [[social construct]] or a [[Sex differences in humans|biological construct .]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0465077144|location=New York|pages=|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In feminist theory==
{{Main|Feminist theory|Feminist sociology}}

During the 1970s, there was no consensus about how the terms were to be applied. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'', the author uses "innate gender" and  "learned sex roles", but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed. By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted traits.

Liberal feminism is the belief that individuals should be free to develop their own talents and pursue their interests. Individuals seek to expand equality by removing the barriers in society. Socialist feminism thinks that capitalism strengthens patriarchy by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few. The traditional family structure should be replaced by a collective revolution. In Radical feminism, they believe that patriarchy is so deeply rooted in society that even a sociological revolution would not end it; Society must eliminate gender itself.

==Other languages==
In English, both ''sex'' and ''gender'' are used in contexts where they could not be substituted (sexual intercourse; anal sex; safe sex; sex worker; sex slave). Other languages, like [[German language|German]], use the same word ''Geschlecht'' to refer both to grammatical gender and to biological sex, making the distinction between ''sex'' and ''gender'' advocated by some anthropologists difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loan-word ''gender'' to achieve this distinction. Sometimes 'Geschlechtsidentität' is used as gender (although it literally means ''gender identity'') and 'Geschlecht' as sex (translation of [[Judith Butler]]'s ''[[Gender Trouble]]''). More common is the use of modifiers: ''biologisches Geschlecht'' for ''sex'', ''Geschlechtsidentität'' for ''gender identity'' and ''Geschlechterrolle'' for ''gender role'' etc.

==U.S. media==

Media criticism is a reflection of the gender inequality in society through print, advertisements, television and music.  Media influences and reinforces the idea of [[The Beauty Myth]] as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book, The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, which refers to unrealistic standards of beauty for women.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. The Beauty Myth: how images of beauty are used against women. N.p.: Perennial, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the mainstream media perpetuates the idea of hetero-masculinity by portraying men as dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael. Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men . New York : HarperCollins, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that the media objectifies and oppresses women, and men who don't fall into the heteronormative category.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, S. (1999). "Never Just Pictures" in Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oppression ===

Through the media, men are taught to be ultra-masculine by being desensitized, violent, and physically strong.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. (2002) 8 Reasons Why Eminem's Popularity is a Disaster for Women.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of media that often portray the ultra-masculine figure are advertisements, specifically beer commercials.  These forms encourage men to oppress other men if they do not fit the ideals of heteromasculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, L. (2004) "Beer Commercials: A manual for masculinity" in Kimmel, M. S., &amp; Messner (Eds.), M. A. Men's Lives (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. pp. 533-543.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectification of women ===
{{See also|Sexualisation}}

Objectification of women refers to instances in the media in which women may be viewed as, or directly compared to, insentient objects that can be acquired and/or possessed. This can be examined in the context of advertisements, where objects may be anthropomorphized and given feminine qualities or aspects of the female form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/objectify.|title=Definition of OBJECTIFY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some studies indicate that widespread objectification of women in the media may have significant repercussions on society, such as low self-esteem and/or eating disorders among women.&lt;ref&gt;Greening, Kacey D. "The Objectification and Dismemberment of Women in the Media." Undergraduate Research Journal for the Human Sciences (2004): n. pag. URC. Web. 8 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.kon.org/urc/v5/greening.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and socialization==
{{See also|Socialization#Gender socialization}}
Socialization theory offers a straightforward account of the acquisition of gendered identities. Infants are seen as blank slates, waiting to be written down on by their environment. Through their interactions with people close to them and exposure to the values of their society, infants learn what sex is attributed to them and what roles they are expected to learn. Reinforcement (through rewarding gender-appropriate behavior and punishing what may seem as deviant behavior) socializes children into their genders.&lt;ref name="thorne"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Play: Girls and Boys in School|author=Thorne, Barrie|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8135-1923-3|location=New Brunswick, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, for example, are far more likely to engage with their sons in rough physical play than they are with their daughters, and it has been argued that long-term consequences may follow (in this case, a head start for boys in the development of physical violence and aggressiveness.)&lt;ref&gt;Mcdonald, K. and R.D. Park (1986). Parent-child physical play, Sex Roles, Vol.15, pp.367-378&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents and family can influence the way that a child develops their view of gender. These types of influences can include parental attitudes and difference of treatment regarding male and female children. Researcher Susan Witt claims that parents also expose children to gender from the time they are born via specific toys, colors, and names associated with genders in the binary. Witt suggests that parental attitudes about gender can differ from male to female children and that these attitudes develop quickly after a child's birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witt|first1=Susan|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|journal=Adolesncence|date=Summer 1997|volume=32|issue=126|pages=253–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Susan Grieshaber, in "Constructing the Gendered Infant", suggests that attitudes regarding pregnancy change after parents find out the sex of their child, subsequently changing parental attitudes towards the unborn child. According to Grieshaber's theory, once parents determine the sex of their unborn child, they assume a gender while planning for the child's arrival. Because of this, Grieshaber claims that infants are born into a gendered world where they never know anything other than the gender traits that are assumed due to their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Early Childhood|last=Yelland|first=Nicola|last2=Grieshaber|first2=Susan|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=0-415-15409-X|location=New York, New York|pages=15–35|chapter=Constructing the Gendered Infant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Kara Smith utilizes similar theory throughout the analysis of her pregnancy journals kept throughout her second pregnancy. Smith concluded that her attitude towards her child changed after learning that her child’s sex was male. Smith's claim is reflected in changes in tone of voice when talking to the unborn child as well as differences in physical touch of her stomach throughout the rest of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kara|date=2005|title=Prebirth Gender Talk: A Case Study in Prenatal Socialization|url=|journal=Women and Language|volume=28|pages=49–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory of gender socialization, discussed by Susan McHale, is that the gender roles and attitudes of older siblings can impact the gender roles adopted by younger children. Throughout the findings of McHale's study, it is maintained that parents still have the most familial influence on childhood socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McHale|first=Susan|date=2001|title=Sibling Influences on Gender Development in Middle Childhood and Early Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/H_Helms_Sibling_2001.pdf|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=37|pages=115–125|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.1.115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time children reach the age of three, many will have acquired a firm sense of themselves as male or female, a gender identity that remains throughout life. In addition, many pre-schoolers develop a firm awareness of [[gender stereotypes]], insisting that certain activities or items of clothing are not for girls and others not for boys. Yet gender identity does not automatically follow from biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|date=2000|title=The Five Sexes, Revisited|url=|journal=The Sciences|volume=40|issue=4|pages=18–23|via=|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03504.x|pmid=12569934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-300-06497-1|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults respond differently to communicative efforts of boys and girls. A study of infants aged 13 months found that when boys demand attention - by behaving aggressively, or crying, whining or screaming - they tended to get it. By contrast, adults tended to respond to girls only when they used language, gestures, or gentle touches; girls who used attention-seeking techniques were likely ignored. There was little difference in the communicative patterns at the start of the study, but by the age of two, the girls have become more talkative and boys more assertive in their communicative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagot | first1 = B.I | year = 1985 | title = Differential reactions to assertive and communicative acts by toddler boys and girls | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 1499–505 | doi=10.2307/1130468| pmid = 4075871 | jstor = 1130468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms that are taught throughout childhood are influential in an individual's life because the ideas about gender that are typically taught by parents in early years are reinforced outside of the home.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study done by Dr. Mick Cunningham states that the normative behaviors and attitudes that children observe can influence the way that these children grow up to structure their own households in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Mick|date=April 2001|title=Parental Influences on the Gendered Division of Housework|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=66|issue=2|pages=184|doi=10.2307/2657414|via=|jstor=2657414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normative gender roles can be reinforced outside of the household, adding power to these hegemonic ideas about gender. An analysis of children’s books in the twenty-first century, by Janice McCabe, suggests that this particular avenue of children’s media symbolically annihilates females, representing them about half as often as that of males. Underrepresentation such as this can affect children and their views of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|date=2011|title=Gender in Twentieth- Century Children's Books|url=|journal=Gender and Sociology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1177/0891243211398358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children’s TV networks, such as Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network have demonstrated a disproportional representation of males and females on their respective shows in a study done by Beth Hentges and Kim Case. According to Hentges and Case, there are less female characters across all three children’s networks; however, there is more propagation of stereotypical gendered behavior on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon than that of Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hentges|first=Beth|last2=Case|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=Gender Representation on Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon Broadcasts in the United States|url=|journal=Journal of Children and Media|volume=7|issue=3|pages=319–333|doi=10.1080/17482798.2012.729150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atypical Household Influence on Gender Socialization ===

Some children are raised in atypical households that challenge normative gender roles. In Jada Tidwell's study, she observes the play of children who come from households with lesbian feminist mothers (both single mothers and couples). Tidwell's observations consisted of both individual play as well as play integrated with the mothers. As a result of these observations, Tidwell asserts that atypical environments can affect children’s lives and ideas. According to Tidwell, households that challenge hegemonic cultural ideas ultimately give children a different perspective of gender than those of children raised in heterosexual, two parent households. In the families studied by Jada Tidwell, children reported ideas that both endorsed and challenged stereotypical gender roles at times.&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, Jada Annette. “Gender Development in Children with Atypical Parental Socialization: An Example of Lesbian Feminist Mothers.” ''Georgia State University,'' US: ProQuest Information &amp; Learning, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In a different study, Abbie Goldberg observed toddlers from various types of households and how these children engaged in play. Goldberg's findings suggest that children whose parents are of the same gender tend to play in ways that are less adherent to stereotypical gender roles than children from heterosexual households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Abbie|date=November 2012|title=Gender- Typed Play Behavior in Early Childhood: Adopted Children with Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Parents|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=67|issue=9–10|pages=503–515|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0198-3|pmid=23420542|pmc=3572788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Witt, in her article “Parental Influence on Children’s Socialization to Gender Roles’, advocates for androgynous gender roles in parenting, arguing that environments are more open minded about gender and encouraging to both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Gender and psychoanalysis==
One of the most influential of the psychoanalytic theories of gender identity is the perspective developed in the book The Reproduction of Mothering. Its author, Nancy Chodorow, traces the implications for emotional development by linking them with the way mothers usually care for their infants in their formative years, while fathers are more emotionally distant. The development of an identity takes place as the infant gets more and more separated from his/her mother, with whom the infant is initially psychically merged. This process however operates differently for boys and girls. Girls can separate gradually, maintain a continuous sense of relationship with the mother, who is after all experienced as alike. For boys, on the other hand, separating from the mother, who is experienced as different, involves repressing the feminine aspects of themselves and rejecting their tenderness that was central to that early relationship. Boys' sense of maleness, according to Chodorow, is achieved at a great emotional cost.&lt;ref&gt;Chodorow, N. (1978). ''The Reproduction of Mothering'', Berkeley, CA, and London, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, men grow up to have a more autonomous sense of self, and to be more independent, more instrumental and competitive in their dealings with others. They are also more likely to have difficulty expressing their emotions and to be anxious about intimacy. Women, on the other hand, have more ability and more need to sustain relationship with others.; they have greater empathy with others. They have difficulty however in maintaining the boundaries of an independent and autonomous self.

Chodorow however believes that these patterns aren't inevitable. Changes in the social arrangements for care of children such as dual parenting, which would involve fathers in emotional intimacy with their children, can break the cycle.

==Gender and the division of labor==
Before industrialization, economic activity, which centered around agricultural work, crafts and so on, was organized by households. Household members, whether male or female, young or old, contributed to the family's livelihood. Although women might do some types of work and men others, depending on region and class, the distinction between men as breadwinners and women as housewives didn't characterize pre-industrial divisions of labor.

Industrialization shifted much productive activity to factories, shops and offices. This separation of work from home signaled a profound change in gender relations and gender discourse. The home came to be understood not as the site of a family enterprise, but as a refuge from the world of work. Women were defined as the keepers of the home, as it was seen as their nature to create harmony and virtue rather than services and goods. Preindustrial society relied on gendered roles in the workforce to create equilibrium between men and women. Men were assigned the hunter role while women were assigned the domestic roles. Men were expected to supply food and shelter for the family while women were the caretakers for the children and their household. As centuries passed, this continued and created a divide in gendered roles in labor. Women remained dependent on men to provide, this dependence led to male roles being more valued in society which still remains in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Gender in conversation==
Some research has found that, in classroom settings, male students tend to talk more, and longer, than female students. This was determined to be particularly noticeable when the instructor is male.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985&gt;{{cite web |last=Krupnick |first=Catherine G. |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58474/krupnick.html |title=Women and Men in the Classroom: Inequality and Its Remedies |work=On Teaching and Learning, Volume 1 |year=1985 |accessdate=3013-06-23 |publisher=Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results were found previously in hospitals by Erving Goffman in 1961, university discussion groups by Elizabeth Aries in 1972, and in corporate settings by Rosabeth Kanter in 1977.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985/&gt;

=== Gender in the workplace ===
Women and men experience different types of mobility within the workplace. Women tend to experience a [[glass ceiling]], an invisible barrier that prevents them from moving up the corporate ladder. Men in jobs traditionally held by women, such as nursing, elementary school teaching, and social work, experience a "glass escalator" effect in which they are able to quickly ascend the job hierarchy to become managers and principals.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Christine L., "The Glass Escalator: The Hidden Advantages for Men in the "Female" Professions", Social Problems, 39(3), pp. 253-267&lt;/ref&gt; There also tends to be a [[gender pay gap]] between men and women, with women earning 77% as much as men.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
 
One cause of the gender pay gap may be due to [[occupational segregation]], which pushes men and women towards gender-specific forms of employment, rather than pay discrimination. Another cause is the [[double burden]], a phenomenon in which women perform most of the unpaid childcare and household work despite being otherwise employed for pay. A third cause is [[occupational sexism]], one part of which favors men for promotions due to their traditional breadwinner status.&lt;ref&gt;Coltrane, Scott. 1997. Family Man: Fatherhood, Housework, and Gender Equity. Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 class action lawsuit, [[Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.]], charged Wal-Mart with sexist hiring and promotion practices.

In addition, the emergence of [[transgender]] individuals in the workplace has begun to disrupt the gender binary of male and female.  By creating a hybrid gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;Connel, C. "Doing, Undoing, or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople."  Gender &amp; Society, 24(1), 31-55&lt;/ref&gt; the transgender community suggests notions of movement toward [[postgenderism]].{{peacock term|date=June 2013}}

== Intersectionality ==
[[Intersectionality]] is a [[Neo-Marxist]] concept stemming from a [[critical theory]] social analysis of [[class (social)|class]], [[race (human classification)|race]], and [[gender]]. The theory of intersectionality argues that forms of "inequality, oppression, and privilege" are shaped by interconnected axes of identity, and are mutually reinforced by social interactions and by social, political, and economic structures, such as capitalism, patriarchy, and institutionalized heteronormativity.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"&gt;Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker, "Doing Difference," Gender and Society 9, no. 1 (Feb 1995): 8-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of Intersectionality argues that race, class, gender, and other markers of identity are social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;West, C. Z. (1987). Doing Gender. Gender and Society, 1 (2), 125-151.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory argues against the assumption that systems of power relations are normative and can hold individuals accountable for their own character and efforts.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

West &amp; Fenstermaker in their 1995 article ''[[Doing Difference]]'' offer that models that conceive gender, race and class as distinct axes are highly limiting in their understanding of the whole experience or identity of an individual. For example, they critique the additive model, in which the whole will never be greater (or lesser) than the sum of it parts. By analyzing each identity marker as an individual characteristic, we ignore the effect of the interconnection of these markers.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

Additional sociologists have written about the intersectionality of class, race, and gender. Joan Acker outlines four gendered processes of intersectionality. The first includes procedures that create hierarchies based on gender and race. Another is the process in which social images and ideas condone gendered institutions. The third is a process of interaction between individuals and groups that, through communication, creates gender. The fourth is the internal labeling of the self and others to gendered personas.&lt;ref&gt;Acker, J. (1992). From Sex Roles to Gendered Institutions. Contemporary Sociology, 21 (5), 565-569.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evelyn Nakano Glenn]] critiques both the patriarchy model of gender, which ignores racial differences among oppressed women, and the internal colonialism model, which focuses on minority populations in general, ignoring gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, E. N. (1985). Racial Ethnic Women's Labor: The Intersection of Race, Gender and Class Oppression. Review of Radical Political Economics, 17 (85), 86-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embodiment==

Embodiment may be defined as the ways in which cultural ideals of gender in a given society create expectations for and influence the form of our bodies. There is a bidirectional relationship between biology and culture; by embodying societally determined [[gender roles]] we reinforce cultural ideals and simultaneously shape, both temporarily and permanently, our bodies, which then perpetuates the cultural ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Connel, R.W. 2002. ''Gender: Short Introductions.'' Malden: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is actually more variation in body type within the male and female sexes than there is between the two sexes, embodiment exaggerates the perceived bodily differences between gender categories.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. ''The Gendered Society.'' New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social embodiment, for both men and women, is variable across cultures and over time. Examples of women embodying [[gender norms]] across cultures include [[foot binding]] practices in Chinese culture, [[neck rings]] in African and Asian cultures, and [[corsets]] in Western cultures. Another interesting phenomenon has been the practice of wearing [[high heels]], which shifted from a masculine fashion to a feminine fashion over time. In the United States, the ideal body image and dimensions have changed for both women and men, with the body ideal [[female body shape]] becoming progressively slimmer and the body ideal for men becoming progressively larger.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Susan. 1999. "Never Just Pictures" in ''Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.'' University of California Press, pp. 107-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

These differences are epitomized in the example of children's toys; [[G.I. Joe]] dolls depict the physical ideals for boys and [[Barbie]] dolls embody the ideals for girls. [[The Beauty Myth]], as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, refers to the unattainable standard of beauty for women, which sustains [[consumer culture]]. In contrast, men's bodies are also "dictated" by cultural ideals of gender, as is evident in consumer culture—especially beer commercials—in which men are portrayed as outdoorsy, tough, strong, and "manly."&lt;ref&gt;Buysse, J.A.M. and Embser-Herbert, M.S. "Construction of Gender in Sport: An Analysis of Intercollegiate Media Guide Cover Photographs." ''Gender and Society'', 18 (1), 2004, pp. 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==

Sexuality encompasses both sexual behavior and sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Pepper, and Virginia Rutter. 1998. The Gender of Sexuality. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Heteronormativity]] structures social life so that [[Heterosexuality]] is always assumed, expected, ordinary and privileged. Its pervasiveness makes it difficult for people to imagine other ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Stevi. 2006. Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: The complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity. Feminist Theory 7:105-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media works to glorify heterosexuality, which in turn lends to its pervasiveness and to its power.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"&gt;Martin, K.A., &amp; Kayzak, E. (2009). Hetero-Romantic Love and Heterosexiness in Children's G-Rated Films. Gender and Society, 23(3), 315-336.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ordinary and exceptional constructions of heterosexuality work to normalize heterosexuality; thus, it becomes difficult to imagine anything other than this form of social relationship or anyone outside of these bonds.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"/&gt;

There is a common perception of heterosexuality as the "natural" emotional and sensual inclination for [[Human sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence. Signs, 5(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, marital heterosexuality occupies the largely invisible core of normative and desirable sexuality, while all other sexualities are marginalized and considered perverse and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2008). State of our Unions: Marriage Promotion and the Contested Power of Heterosexuality. Gender &amp; Society, 23(1), 27-48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale called the [[Kinsey Scale]], which challenges the common perception of [[Human sexuality]] as strictly binary and directly linked to [[Gender]]. [[Drag queens]] are an example of "troubling" gender, complicating the understanding of sexuality in our society by causing people to think outside the binary of male/female.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, J. and Jasper, J.M. (eds). The Contexts Reader. New York: W.W. Norton, 2008. Pp. 247-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|title=Origin  of the Family, Private Property, and the State|date=1884|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that in hunter-gatherer societies the activities of men and women, although different, had the same importance. As technological advances let to productive surplus, social equality and communal sharing gave way to private property and ultimately class hierarchy. With the rise of agriculture, men gained significant power over women. With surplus wealth to pass on to their heirs, upper class men wanted to ensure their sons were indeed theirs, which led them to control the sexuality of women. The desire to control property brought about monogamous marriage and family. Women were taught to remain virgins until marriage and remain faithful to their husbands thereafter, and to build their lives around bearing and raising one man's children.

==Masculinity==

[[Masculinity]] is a performed gender identity. Contrary to popular perception{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, it is not the same as [[sex]] or [[sexual orientation]]. The contents and practices of masculinity are socially constructed and reproduced through daily interaction, especially on a more micro scale.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists West &amp; Zimmerman emphasized that gender is maintained through accountability. Men are expected to perform masculinity to the point that it is naturalized. Thus, a man's status depends on his performance. It is important to note, however, that masculinity can be performed by any sex.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinity and Crime"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krienert | first = Jessie L. | title = Masculinity and crime: a quantitative exploration of Messerschmidt's hypothesis | journal = [[Electronic Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | publisher = [[International Consortium for the Advancement of Academic Publication|ICAAP]] | date = July 2003 | url = http://www.sociology.org/content/vol7.2/01_krienert.html | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guyland&gt;{{cite book |last=Kimmel|first=Michael | author-link = Michael Kimmel |title= Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men |year=2008 |publisher= [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-06-083135-6  |url= https://archive.org/details/guylandperilousw00kimm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doing Difference"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Fenstermaker | first2 = Sarah | title = Doing difference | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&amp;ndash;37 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124395009001002 | date = February 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/089124395009001002 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant form of masculinity in a society is known as [[hegemonic masculinity]]. Men are constantly performing this to prove their status as men.&lt;ref name="hegemonic"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829&amp;ndash;859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not really possible to reach it, especially as peers are in constant surveillance of each other, looking for flaws in their performance.&lt;ref name="hegemonic" /&gt; Hegemonic masculinity is constructed in opposition to [[femininity]] and is dominant to all other gender identities (including alternative masculinities). Men are [[socialization|socialized]] from birth to perform it, especially through behavior and symbolism. One of the prominent behaviors is aggression in order to protect one's reputation. An example of symbols used would be clothing.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Undoing Gender"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Connell | first = Catherine | title = Doing, undoing, or redoing gender? Learning from the workplace experiences of transpeople | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 31&amp;ndash;55 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243209356429 | date = February 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243209356429 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes three cultures that support masculinity (especially in young men) in his 2008 book, ''Guyland'':
* The Culture of Entitlement: Men are raised to feel they deserve something. They feel entitled to power, sex and women.
* The Culture of Silence: Men are not to talk to outsiders (those not embedded in the cultures of masculinity) about drinking, bullying, rape, or any performance of masculinity by their peers that they may get in trouble for. If they do talk, they will be seen as unmanly traitors.
* The Culture of Protection: Communities do not hold men responsible for questionable and illegal actions. Many turn a blind eye, assuming their boys would never do that. Others write off dangerous acts as "boys will be boys".&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Some of the prominent attitudes and behaviors of western hegemonic masculinity are: power, sexual dominance and activity, wealth, aggression, independence, and lack of emotion. Less extreme sexual harassment is often seen as normal behavior.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt; Exemplifying [[control theory]], the norms of masculinity are so rigidly ingrained that men find little room to escape and end up constantly reproducing them.

Hegemonic masculinity is often reproduced and reinforced through media and culture. "Media representations of men…often glorify men's use of physical force, a daring demeanor, virility, and emotional distance." Contemporary [[rap music]] is a striking example of masculinity on display. Rappers boast about their sexual conquests of women (emphasizing [[heterosexuality]] as well), wealth, power and violence.&lt;ref name="Rap Music"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weitzer | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Kubrin | first2 = Charis E. | author-link1 = Ronald Weitzer | author-link2 = Charis E.

==Gender and violence==

Gender-based [[violence]] is the physical, [[Human sexuality|sexual]] or emotional harm or suffering enacted upon an individual as contextualized by societal [[gender]] norms. Violence affects the lives of millions worldwide, in all socio-economic and educational classes. It cuts across cultural and religious barriers, impeding the right of many to participate fully in society. Violence is about power, control, and domination. Systems of inequality and [[oppression]] interact positioning certain groups as particularly vulnerable to violence. Gendered violence takes place within a socially constructed power dynamic in which one ideology ([[masculinity]]) dominates another ([[femininity]]). What it means to be a woman in society is influenced and ascribed by the media, which acts a "powerful educational force". The media glamorizes [[violence against women]] cultivating a "toxic cultural environment" in which women are institutionally positioned as inferior and worthy objects of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Killing Us Softly 3: Advertising's Image of Women. Dir. Jean Kilbourne. Perf., 2000. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are disproportionally the offenders, and women disproportionally the victims. Those that commit violent crimes are overwhelmingly male—[[rape]] (98%), armed [[robbery]] (92%), drunk driving (90%), [[murder]] (88%), aggravated assault (87%), arson (86%), and family violence (83%).&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. The Gendered Society. New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Kimmel]], [[hegemonic masculinity]] creates a culture of entitlement, silence, and protection, which effectively normalizes violence against women and silences victims of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. Guyland: the Perilous World Where Boys Become Men. New York: Harpercollins, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence]] defines three social arenas in which violence commonly takes place (1) in the family—including [[domestic violence]], [[infanticide]], and traditional practices such as  [[female genital mutilation]], [[foot binding]], and [[bride burning]]; (2) in the community—including rape, sexual assault, [[sexual harassment]], and commercialized violence such as [[sexual slavery]], labor exploitation, female migrant workers; and (3) by the State—including violence against women in detention, and in situations of armed conflict such as [[systematic war rape]].&lt;ref&gt;"Women and Violence." Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.un.org/rights/dpi1772e.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address and end gendered violence, solutions must address both the root causes and interpersonal manifestations of gender roles and power relations in order to ensure a balance of power at all levels of society.

==Globalization and gender==

[[Globalization]] refers to the increasingly global relationships of culture, people and economic activity. Globalization impacts female equality on a large and international scale, both negatively and positively.  With continuous changes in international relations, the perception of [[feminism]] in Western and Nonwestern societies is frequently revised.  It is important to be wary of Western bias in sociological accounts of global feminism, as Modern [[Western society]] is not always due credit for feminist reform in other cultures and countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ferree, Myra Marx. 2006. "Globalization and Feminism: Opportunities and Obstacles for Activism in the Global Arena" in Ferree, M.M. &amp; Tripp, A.M. (Eds.) Global Feminism: Transnational women's activism, organizing, and human rights. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist sentiments – or a push for gender equality – emerge as a result of the nation-specific circumstances, not according to the exported beliefs of Western society.  Advances in female equality and status are often not the result of national groups or corporations, but of individuals and small groups.

One of the results of globalization is the increased use of female factory workers in nonwestern countries.  In Mexico, the female worker is ideal because she is seen as docile and inexpensive labor.  Stereotypical feminine traits such as beauty, domesticity, and docility are exaggerated and exploited for the production of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Salzinger, L. 2003. Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;  These gender traits then frame the behavior of the women beyond the occupational realm.  Despite increasing feminism, the lack of economic and [[social mobility]] prevents women in many nations from having equal status in society.

One of the solutions to erasing gender inequalities globally, is to provide resources and funds to impoverished women who will in turn use them for [[education]] as well as business ventures.  The [[global economy]] could benefit drastically from incorporating educated women into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|title=The Women’s Crusade|first1=Nicholas|last1=Kristof|first2=Sheryl|last2=WuDunn|date=17 August 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third gender ==
Throughout history, and around the world, the idea of a [[third gender]] has existed. In Native American culture, the [[Two-spirit|two spiririt]] had gender roles different from men and women. The [[muxe]] of southern Mexico are males who identify as neither male or female. In Samoa the [[Fa'afafine]] are biological males who identify as females. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] are biological males who identify as women. They are considered outsiders in their communities and have formed their own language. In the United States, the concept of a third gender is beginning to gain traction. California now allows for drivers licenses to have the gender "non-binary", see [[genderqueer]].

In [[anatomy]], a '''spatium''' or '''anatomic space''' is a space (cavity or gap). Anatomic spaces are often landmarks to find other important structures. When they fill with gases (such as air) or liquids (such as blood) in pathological ways, they can suffer conditions such as [[pneumothorax]], [[edema]], or [[pericardial effusion]]. Many anatomic spaces are [[potential space]]s, which means that they are potential rather than realized (with their realization being dynamic according to [[physiology|physiologic]] or [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] events). In other words, they are like an empty plastic bag that has not been opened (two walls collapsed against each other; no interior [[volume]] until opened) or a balloon that has not been inflated.

Examples of anatomic spaces (or potential spaces) include:

*[[Axillary space]]
*[[Buccal space]]

The '''Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences''' is the heart of the undergraduate program and grants the majority of [[Stanford University]]'s degrees. The School has 23 departments and
20 interdisciplinary degree-granting programs. The School was officially created in 1948, from the merger of the Schools of Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences.  Those schools date from the mid-1920s when the university first organized individual departments into schools.&lt;ref name=histoverall&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Schools of the University|url=http://histsoc.stanford.edu/su_schools.shtml|publisher=Stanford Historical Society|accessdate=18 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120133812/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/su_schools.shtml|archivedate=20 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==

The school is divided into three divisions: Humanities and Arts, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.

=== Humanities and Arts ===

* Art &amp; Art History - One of the original University departments under the name Drawing (1891), Drawing and Painting (1892-1900), back to Drawing (1901–1907), Graphic Arts (1908–1910), Graphic Art (1911–1913, 1927–1947), then Art and Architecture (1948–1969), Art (1970-?) and finally its current name.&lt;ref name="histoverall"/&gt;
* Classics - Stanford started with separate departments for Latin and Greek but these were merged in 1921
* Drama - Started as Public Speaking in 1927 became Speech and Drama in 1937 and Drama in 1971
* East Asian Languages and Cultures
* English - one of the original departments but under the name English Language and Literature
* History - one of the original departments
* Linguistics - established in 1971
* Music - established in 1936
* Philosophy - established sometime in the 1890s
* Religious Studies - started in 1941 as the department of Religion

Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages
* Comparative Literature
* French and Italian - one of the original departments under the name Romance Languages which became Romanic Languages.  Became French and Italian in 1963.
* German Studies - one of the original departments under the name Germanic Languages
* Iberian &amp; Latin American Cultures
* Slavic Languages and Literature - established in 1926

=== Natural Sciences ===

* Applied Physics - established in 1969
* Biology
* Chemistry - one of the original departments
* Mathematics - one of the original departments
* Physics - one of the original departments
* Statistics - established in 1936

The current Biology department was formed by merging Botany, Zoology, Entomology, and Physiology to form Biological Sciences.  The name of this department was changed to Biology in 2009.

=== Social Sciences ===

* Anthropology
* Communication - established in 1927 as Journalism
* Economics - established in 1892 as Economics and Social Sciences
* Political Science
* Psychology - one of the original departments with [[Frank Angell]] serving as its first chair. From 1922 to 1942, [[Lewis Terman]] served as its chair.&lt;ref name="psychhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://psychology.stanford.edu/historyofdepartment |title=History of the Psychology Department |newspaper=Https: |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, it was ranked as #1 in the country among all psychology graduate programs in the United States.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/psychology-rankings |title=Best Psychology Programs |newspaper=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sociology

Stanford was set up with a Political Science department but that was almost immediately renamed Economics and Social Science.  The forerunner of the current Political Science department was established in 1918.

Sociology and Anthropology were originally one department established in 1948.  They split in 1957.  Anthropology itself was split into Anthropological Sciences and Cultural and Social Anthropology from
1999 to 2007 but merged again.

Notable faculty in these departments other than those mentioned above include:
*[[Albert Bandura]] (1925-), David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science 
*[[Carol Dweck]] (1946-), Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology (2004-)
*[[Phillip Zimbardo]] (1933-), professor of Psychology (1968-200), known for the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]]
*[[Joseph Greenberg]] (1915-2001), Ray Lyman Wilbur Professor of Social Science, known for his classification of the [[Niger–Congo languages]]

==Core courses==
At times Stanford has required undergraduate students to take core courses in various subjects in the humanities and sciences.  Some of the core courses include
* Western Culture (1980-1988) - freshmen took courses in  both European and non-European cultures with  “a substantial historical dimension” and include works by women and minorities.&lt;ref name=st37-2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomew|first1=Karen|title=25 years ago (1988)|journal=Sandstone &amp; Tile|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://historicalsociety.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST37no1.pdf|page=22|date=2013|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cultures, Ideas and Values (CIV) (1988-2000)&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt;
* Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) (2000-2012),&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt; a core freshman  course sequence which consisted of one fall-quarter course followed by a 2-quarter pair of courses during the winter and spring quarters. Fall quarter courses were interdisciplinary while winter-spring focused on a specific disciplinary area.
* Thinking Matters (2012–2016)&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt;
* Ways of Thinking / Ways of Doing (2016–present)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways|title=Stanford Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12601">[[File:Comparison of surface area vs volume of shapes.svg|thumb|300px|Graphs of surface area, ''A'' against volume, ''V'' of the Platonic solids and a sphere, showing that the surface area decreases for rounder shapes, and the surface-area-to-volume ratio decreases with increasing volume.]]
The '''surface-area-to-volume ratio''', also called the '''surface-to-volume ratio''' and variously denoted '''sa/vol''' or '''SA:V''', is the amount of [[surface area]] per unit volume of an object or collection of objects.
In [[chemical reaction]]s involving a solid material, the surface area to volume ratio is an important factor for the [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], that is, the rate at which the chemical reaction will proceed.

For a given volume, the object with the smallest surface area (and therefore with the smallest SA:V) is the [[sphere]], a consequence of the [[Isoperimetric_inequality#Isoperimetric_inequality_in_higher_dimensions|isoperimetric inequality in 3 dimensions]]. By contrast, objects with tiny spikes will have very large surface area for a given volume.

== Dimension ==
The surface-area-to-volume ratio has [[physical dimension]] L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (inverse length) and is therefore expressed in units of inverse distance.  As an example, a [[cube]] with sides of length 1&amp;nbsp;[[centimeter|cm]] will have a surface area of 6&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a volume of 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The surface to volume ratio for this cube is thus
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SA:V} = \frac{6~\mbox{cm}^2}{1~\mbox{cm}^3} = 6~\mbox{cm}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a given shape, SA:V is inversely proportional to size.  A cube 2&amp;nbsp;cm on a side has a ratio of 3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, half that of a cube 1&amp;nbsp;cm on a side.  Conversely, preserving SA:V as size increases requires changing to a less [[compactness measure of a shape|compact]] shape.

==Physical chemistry==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
{{see also|Dust explosion}}
Materials with high [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratio (e.g. very small diameter, very [[porosity|porous]], or otherwise not [[compactness measure of a shape|compact]]) react at much faster rates than monolithic materials, because more surface is available to react. Examples include grain dust; while grain isn't typically flammable, [[Washburn A Mill|grain dust is explosive]]. Finely ground salt dissolves much more quickly than coarse salt.

High surface area to volume ratio provides a strong "driving force" to speed up thermodynamic processes that minimize [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].

==Biology==
[[File:Human jejunum microvilli 2 - TEM.jpg|thumb|[[Cell (biology)|Cells]] lining the [[small intestine]] increase the surface area over which they can absorb nutrients with a carpet of tuftlike [[microvilli]].]]

The ratio between the surface area and volume of [[Cell (biology)|cells]]  and [[organism]]s has an enormous impact on their [[biology]], including their [[physiology]] and [[behavior]]. For example, many aquatic microorganisms have increased surface area to increase their drag in the water. This reduces their rate of sink and allows them to remain near the surface with less energy expenditure.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

An increased surface area to volume ratio also means increased exposure to the environment. The finely-branched appendages of [[filter feeder]]s such as [[krill]] provide a large surface area to sift the water for food.&lt;ref&gt;Kils, U.: ''[[s:Author:Uwe Kils/polar/part1|Swimming and feeding of Antarctic Krill, ''Euphausia superba'' - some outstanding energetics and dynamics - some unique morphological details]]''. In ''Berichte zur Polarforschung'', [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], Special Issue 4 (1983): "On the biology of Krill ''Euphausia superba''", Proceedings of the Seminar and Report of Krill Ecology Group, Editor S. B. Schnack, 130-155 and title page image.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual organs like the [[lung]] have numerous internal branchings that increase the surface area; in the case of the lung, the large surface supports gas exchange, bringing [[oxygen]] into the blood and releasing [[carbon dioxide]] from the blood.&lt;ref name=tortora1&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P.| title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |pages=556–582|edition= Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|date= 1987 |isbn= 978-0-06-350729-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grays&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Peter L |last2=Warwick |first2=Roger |last3=Dyson|first3=Mary |last4=Bannister |first4=Lawrence H. |title=Gray's Anatomy| pages=1278–1282 |location=Edinburgh|publisher=Churchill Livingstone | edition=Thirty-seventh |date=1989|isbn= 0443 041776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[small intestine]] has a finely wrinkled internal surface, allowing the body to absorb nutrients efficiently.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 349–353|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells can achieve a high surface area to volume ratio with an elaborately convoluted surface, like the [[microvilli]] lining the [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name="William2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krause J. William|title=Krause's Essential Human Histology for Medical Students|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRayoldYrcUC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=25 November 2010|date=July 2005|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=978-1-58112-468-2|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased surface area can also lead to biological problems. More contact with the environment through the surface of a cell or an organ (relative to its volume) increases loss of water and dissolved substances. High surface area to volume ratios also present problems of temperature control in unfavorable environments.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The surface to volume ratios of organisms of different sizes also leads to some [[biological rule]]s such as [[Bergmann's rule]]&lt;ref name="Meiri2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00837.x | title=On the validity of Bergmann's rule | journal=Journal of Biogeography | volume=30 | issue=3 | pages=331–351 | date=2003-03-20 | last1=Meiri | first1=S. | last2=Dayan | first2=T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashton2000"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=10.1086/303400 | title=Is Bergmann's Rule Valid for Mammals? | date=October 2000 | first1=Kyle G. | last1=Ashton | last2=Tracy | first2=Mark C. | last3=Queiroz | first3=Alan de | journal=[[The American Naturalist]] | volume=156 | issue=4 | pages=390–415 | doi=10.1086/303400| pmid=29592141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millien2006"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ecotypic variation in the context of global climate change: Revisiting the rules | first1=Virginie | last1=Millien | last2=Lyons | first2=S.

==Fire spread==
In the context of [[wildfire]]s, the ratio of the surface area of a solid fuel to its volume is an important measurement. Fire spread behavior is frequently correlated to the surface-area-to-volume ratio of the fuel (e.g. leaves and branches). The higher its value, the faster a particle responds to changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature or moisture. Higher values are also correlated to shorter fuel ignition times, and hence faster fire spread rates.

==Planetary cooling==
A body of icy or rocky material in outer space may, if it can build and retain sufficient heat, develop a differentiated interior and alter its surface through volcanic or tectonic activity. The length of time through which a planetary body can maintain surface-altering activity depends on how well it retains heat, and this is governed by its surface area-to-volume ratio. For [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (r=263 km), the ratio is so high that astronomers were surprised to find that it ''did'' differentiate and have brief volcanic activity. The [[moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Mars]] have radii in the low thousands of kilometers; all three retained heat well enough to be thoroughly differentiated although after a billion years or so they became too cool to show anything more than very localized and infrequent volcanic activity, of which none is evident at present. [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] and [[Earth]] (r&gt;6,000 km) have sufficiently low surface area-to-volume ratios (roughly half that of Mars and much lower than all other known rocky bodies) so that their heat loss is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astro.uvic.ca/~venn/A201/maths.6.planetary_cooling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
In 1327, [[Franciscan|Franciscan friar]] [[William of Baskerville]] and Adso of [[Stift Melk|Melk]], a [[Benedictine]] [[Novice#Christianity|novice]] travelling under his protection, arrive at a Benedictine monastery in [[Northern Italy]] to attend a [[Disputation|theological disputation]]. This abbey is being used as an embassy between [[Pope John XXII]], and the Friars Minor, who are suspected of heresy. 

The monastery is disturbed by the death of Adelmo of Otranto, an illuminator revered for his illustrations. Adelmo was skilled at comical artwork, especially concerning religious matters. William is tasked by the monastery's [[abbot]], Abo of Fossanova to investigate the death, and he has a debate with one of the oldest monks in the abbey, Jorge of Burgos, about the theological meaning of laughter, which Jorge despises. 

The next day, a scholar of Aristotle and translator of Greek and Arabic, Venantius of Salvamec, is found dead in a vat of pig's blood. Previously, William and Adso had been prohibited from the library by the book keeper Malachi of Hildesheim, so they penetrate the labyrinth, discovering that there must be a hidden room, entitled the ''finis Africae.'' Bencio of Uppsala, a rhetoric scholar, reveals to William that Malachi, and his assistant Berengar of Arundel, had a homosexual relationship, until Berengar seduced Adelmo, who committed suicide out of religious shame. The only other monks who knew about the indiscretions were Jorge and Venantius.

By the day after, Berengar has gone missing, which puts pressure onto William. William learns of how Salvatore of Montferrat, and Remigio of Varagine, two cellarer monks, had a history with the [[Dulcinian|Dulcinian heretics]]. Meanwhile, Adso is seduced by a peasant girl, with whom he has his first sexual experience. After confessing to William, Adso is absolved, although he still feels guilty. Severinus of Sankt Wendel, the herbalist, tells William that Venantius's body had ink stains on the tongue and fingers, which suggests poison. William and Adso penetrate the library once more, discovering that Venantius had a book stolen from him, which they pursue. 

On the fourth day, Berengar is found drowned in a bath, although he bears ink stains similar to those of Venantius. Bernard Gui, a member of the [[Inquisition]], arrives to search for the murderer via Papal deduction. Due to this arrival, Gui arrests the peasant girl Adso loved, as well as Salvatore, accusing them both of heresy.

Remigio is interrogated by Gui, who scares him into revealing his heretic past, as well as falsely confessing to the crimes of the Abbey. Severinus then is found dead in his room, to which Jorge responds by leading a sermon about the coming of the Antichrist. 

Malachi returns to the early sermon that day near death, and his final words concern scorpions. Nicholas of Morimondo, the glazier, tells William that whoever is the librarian would then become the Abbot, and with new light, William goes to the library to search for evidence. The Abbot is distraught that William has not solved the crime, and that the Inquisition is undermining him, so he fires William. That night, William and Adso penetrate the library once more in search of the ''finis Africae.''

William and Adso discover Jorge waiting for them in the forbidden room. He says that he has been masterminding the Abbey for years, and his last victim is the Abbot himself, who has been led into the library. The Abbot suffocates, and Jorge tells them that Venantius's hidden book was [[Poetics_(Aristotle)|Aristotle's Second ''Poetics'']], which speaks of the virtues of laughter, something Jorge despises. Jorge poisoned the ink on the book, which is consumed when one turns the pages. Venantius was translating the book and died. Berengar found the body and disposed of it in pig's blood, fearing exposure, before reading the book himself and dying. Malachi was convinced by Jorge to retrieve the book, which was stashed with Severinus, so he kills Severinus and retrieves the book, before getting curious and dying as well. 

All of the murders time out with the [[Seven_trumpets|Seven Trumpets]], which call for objects falling from the sky (Adelmo threw himself from a tower), pools of blood, poison from water, bashing of the stars (Severinus was killed with his head bashed in with a celestial orb), scorpions, locusts, and fire. Jorge consumes the book's poisoned pages and uses Adso's lantern to start a fire, which burns down the library. As the fire spreads to the rest of the abbey, William laments his failure. Confused and defeated, William and Adso escape the abbey. Years later, Adso, now aged, returns to the ruins of the abbey and collects books that were salvaged from the fire, creating a lesser library.

== Major themes ==
{{essay-like|section|date=July 2011}}
Eco was a professor of [[semiotics]], and employs techniques of [[metanarrative]], partial fictionalization, and linguistic ambiguity to create a world enriched by layers of meaning. The solution to the central murder mystery hinges on the contents of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|book on Comedy]], which has been [[Lost work|lost]]. In spite of this, Eco speculates on the content and has the characters react to it. Through the motif of this lost and possibly suppressed book which might have aestheticized the farcical, the unheroic and the skeptical, Eco also makes an ironically slanted plea for tolerance and against dogmatic or self-sufficient metaphysical truths—an angle which reaches the surface in the final chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Gustafsson]], postscript to Swedish edition ''The Name of the Rose''&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Name of the Rose'' has been described as a work of [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[[Christopher Butler]]. ''Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction''. [[OUP]], 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280239-2}} — see pages 32 and 126 for discussion of the novel.&lt;/ref&gt; The quote in the novel, "books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told", refers to a postmodern idea that all texts perpetually refer to other texts, rather than external reality, while also harkening back to the medieval notion that citation and quotation of books was inherently necessary to write new stories. The novel ends with irony: as Eco explains in his ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', "very little is discovered and the detective is defeated."&lt;ref name="postscript"&gt;"Postscript to the Name of the Rose", printed in ''The Name of the Rose'' (Harcourt, Inc., 1984), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After unraveling the central mystery in part through coincidence and error, William of Baskerville concludes in fatigue that there "was no pattern." Thus Eco turns the modernist quest for finality, certainty and meaning on its head, leaving the overall plot partly the result of accident and arguably without meaning.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;

== The aedificium's labyrinth ==
The mystery revolves around the abbey library, situated in a fortified tower—the aedificium. This structure has three floors—the ground floor contains the kitchen and [[refectory]], the first floor a [[scriptorium]], and the top floor is occupied by the library.&lt;ref&gt;First Day, Terce, paragraph 37&lt;/ref&gt; The two lower floors are open to all, while only the librarian may enter the last. A catalogue of books is kept in the scriptorium, where [[manuscript]]s are read and copied. A monk who wishes to read a book would send a request to the librarian, who, if he thought the request justified, would bring it to the scriptorium. Finally, the library is in the form of a labyrinth, whose secret only the librarian and the assistant librarian know.&lt;ref&gt;First Day, Terce, paragraph 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The aedificium has four towers at the four cardinal points, and the top floor of each has seven rooms on the outside, surrounding a central room. There are another eight rooms on the outer walls, and sixteen rooms in the centre of the maze. Thus, the library has a total of fifty-six rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Third Day, Vespers, paragraphs 50-56&lt;/ref&gt; Each room has a scroll containing a verse from the [[Book of Revelation]]. The first letter of the verse is the letter corresponding to that room.&lt;ref&gt;Third Day, Vespers, paragraphs 64-68&lt;/ref&gt; The letters of adjacent rooms, read together, give the name of a region (e.g. [[Hibernia]] in the West tower), and those rooms contain books from that region. The geographical regions are:
[[File:Labyrinthus Aedificium.svg|thumb|The aedificium's labyrinth]]
* ''Fons Adae'', 'The earthly paradise' contains Bibles and commentaries, East Tower
* ''Acaia'', Greece, Northeast
* ''Iudaia'', Judea, East
* ''Aegyptus'', Egypt, Southeast
* ''Leones'', 'South' contains books from Africa, South Tower
* ''Yspania'', Spain, Southwest outer
* ''Roma'', Italy, Southwest inner
* ''Hibernia'', Ireland, West Tower
* ''Gallia'', France, Northwest
* ''Germania'', Germany, North
* ''Anglia'', England, North Tower
Two rooms have no lettering - the easternmost room, which has an altar, and the central room on the south tower, the so-called ''finis Africae,'' which contains the most heavily guarded books, and can only be entered through a secret door. The entrance to the library is in the central room of the east tower, which is connected to the scriptorium by a staircase.&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Day, After Compline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title ==
Much attention has been paid to the mystery the book's title refers to. In fact, Eco has stated that his intention was to find a "totally neutral title".&lt;ref name="postscript"/&gt; In one version of the story, when he had finished writing the novel, Eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one. They chose ''The Name of the Rose''.&lt;ref name="onLiterature"&gt;[[Umberto Eco]]. ''On Literature''. Secker &amp; Warburg, 2005, p. 129-130. {{ISBN|0-436-21017-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another version of the story, Eco had wanted the neutral title ''Adso of Melk'', but that was vetoed by his publisher, and then the title ''The Name of the Rose'' "came to me virtually by chance." In the ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', Eco claims to have chosen the title "because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left".&lt;ref name="postscript" /&gt;

The book's last line, {{lang|la|"Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus"}} translates as: "the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names." The general sense, as Eco pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Name of the Rose: Title and Last Line | url = http://www.umbertoeco.com/id-39/UmbertEco_Name_of_the_Rose_Umberto_Eco.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070121024505/http://www.umbertoeco.com/id-39/UmbertEco_Name_of_the_Rose_Umberto_Eco.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that from the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only the name. In this novel, the lost "rose" could be seen as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|book on comedy]] (now forever lost), the exquisite library now destroyed, or the beautiful peasant girl now dead.

The title is also an allusion to the [[nominalist]] position in the [[problem of universals]], taken by [[William of Ockham]]. According to nominalism, universals are bare names: there is not a universal rose, only the name ''rose''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crisismagazine.com/1987/war-of-the-rose-the-historical-context-of-the-name-of-the-rose&lt;/ref&gt;

This text has also been translated as "Yesterday's rose stands only in name, we hold only empty names." This line is a verse by twelfth century monk [[Bernard of Cluny]] (also known as Bernard of Morlaix). Medieval manuscripts of this line are not in agreement: Eco quotes one Medieval variant verbatim,&lt;ref&gt;Eco would have found this reading in, for example, the standard text edited by H.C. Hoskier (London 1929); only the Hiersemann manuscript preserves "Roma". For the verse quoted in this form before Eco, see e.g. Alexander Cooke, ''An essay on the origin, progress, and decline of rhyming Latin verse'' (1828), [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2_DthwIpvsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22stat+rosa+pristina%22 p. 59], and Hermann Adalbert Daniel, ''Thesaurus hymnologicus sive hymnorum canticorum sequentiarum'' (1855), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ScPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22stat+rosa+pristina%22 p. 290]. See further Pepin, Ronald E. "Adso's closing line in The Name of the Rose." ''American notes and queries'' (May–June 1986): 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; but Eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions, in which the reference is to [[Rome]] (''Roma''), not to a rose (''rosa'').&lt;ref&gt;As Eco wrote in [http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_author.html "The Author and his Interpreters"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101231523/http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_author.html |date=2008-01-01 }} "Thus the title of my novel, had I come across another version of Morlay's poem, could have been ''The Name of Rome'' (thus acquiring fascist overtones)".&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative text, with its context, runs: ''Nunc ubi Regulus aut ubi Romulus aut ubi Remus? / Stat Roma pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus''. This translates as "Where now is Regulus, or Romulus, or Remus? / Primordial Rome abides only in its name; we hold only naked names."&lt;ref name="cluny"&gt;See the source edition of 2009: Bernard of Cluny, De contemptu mundi: Une vision du monde vers 1144, ed. and trans. A. Cresson, Témoins de notre histoire (Turnhout, 2009), p.&amp;nbsp;126 (bk. 1, 952), and note thereto p.&amp;nbsp;257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the title of the book may be related to a poem by the Mexican poet and mystic [[Nun|Sor]] [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]] (1651–1695):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rosa que al prado, encarnada,&lt;br /&gt;
te ostentas presuntuosa&lt;br /&gt;
de grana y carmín bañada:&lt;br /&gt;
campa lozana y gustosa;&lt;br /&gt;
pero no, que siendo hermosa&lt;br /&gt;
también serás desdichada.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which appears in Eco's ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', and is translated into English in "Note 1" of that book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Red rose growing in the meadow,&lt;br /&gt;
you vaunt yourself bravely&lt;br /&gt;
bathed in crimson and carmine:&lt;br /&gt;
a rich and fragrant show.&lt;br /&gt;
But no: Being fair,&lt;br /&gt;
You will be unhappy soon.&lt;ref name="postscript" /&gt;&lt;!-- "soon", not "too", is the translation provided in Note 1; please do not alter it --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== To other works ===
The name of the central character, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] (compare ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' – also, Adso's description of William in the beginning of the book resembles, almost word for word, Dr. Watson's description of Sherlock Holmes when he first makes his acquaintance in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'') and to [[William of Ockham]] (see the next section). The name of the narrator, his apprentice Adso of Melk is among other things a pun on Simplicio from [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''Dialogue''; Adso deriving from "ad Simplicio" ("to Simplicio"). Adso's putative place of origin, Melk, is the site of a famous medieval library, at [[Melk Abbey]]. And his name echoes the narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Watson (omitting the first and last latters, with "t" and "d" being phonetically similar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ipbOrcd8q9UC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq|title=Reading Eco: An Anthology|editor-first=Rocco|editor-last=Capozzi|date=February 22, 1997|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=9780253112828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blind librarian Jorge of [[Burgos]] is a nod to [[Argentina|Argentinian]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], a major influence on Eco. Borges was blind during his later years and was also director of [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|Argentina's national library]]; his [[short story]] "[[The Library of Babel]]" is an inspiration for the secret library in Eco's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44089369|title=The library of Babel|last=1899-1986.|first=Borges, Jorge Luis,|date=2000|publisher=David R. Godine|others=Desmazières, Erik, 1948-, Hurley, Andrew, 1944-, Giral, Angela.|isbn=156792123X|location=Boston|oclc=44089369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Borges's stories, "[[The Secret Miracle]]", features a blind librarian. In addition, a number of other themes drawn from various of Borges's works are used throughout ''The Name of the Rose'': [[labyrinth]]s, mirrors, sects and obscure manuscripts and books.

The ending also owes a debt to Borges' short story "[[Death and the Compass]]", in which a detective proposes a theory for the behavior of a murderer. The murderer learns of the theory and uses it to trap the detective. In ''The Name of the Rose'', the librarian Jorge uses William's belief that the murders are based on the [[Revelation of John]] to misdirect William, though in Eco's tale, the detective succeeds in solving the crime.

The "poisoned page" motif may have been inspired by [[Alexandre Dumas]]' novel ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1845). It was also used in the film ''[[Il giovedì]]'' (1963) by Italian director [[Dino Risi]].&lt;ref name="Lolito"&gt;notes to {{cite book|title=Lolito|author=Daniele Luttazzi|pp=514–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story is associated with the Chinese erotic novel ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', translated as ''The Golden Lotus'' or ''The Plum in the Golden Vase''.

Eco seems also to have been aware of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story "[[Debits and Credits (Kipling)|The Eye of Allah]]", which touches on many of the same themes, like optics, manuscript illumination, music, medicine, priestly authority and the Church's attitude to scientific discovery and independent thought, and which also includes a character named John of Burgos.

Eco was also inspired by the 19th century Italian novelist [[Alessandro Manzoni]], citing ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' as an example of the specific type of historical novel he purposed to create, in which some of the characters may be made up, but their motivations and actions remain authentic to the period and render history more comprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postscript to The name of the rose|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1984|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|others=Eco, Umberto.|year=|isbn=9780151731565|edition=1st|location=San Diego|pages=|oclc=10996520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book, there are [[Latin]] quotes, authentic and apocryphal. There are also discussions of the philosophy of [[Aristotle]] and of a variety of [[Millenarism|millenarist]] heresies, especially those associated with the [[fraticelli]]. Numerous other philosophers are referenced throughout the book, often anachronistically, including [[Wittgenstein]].

=== To actual history and geography ===
[[File:La Sacra ammantata dalla neve.jpg|thumb|[[Sacra di San Michele|Saint Michael's Abbey]], in the [[Susa Valley]], [[Piedmont]]]]

William of Ockham, who lived during the time at which the novel is set, first put forward the principle known as [[Ockham's Razor]], often summarised as the ''[[dictum]]'' that one should always accept as most likely the simplest explanation that accounts for all the facts (a method used by William of Baskerville in the novel).

The book describes monastic life in the 14th century. The action takes place at a [[Benedictine]] abbey during the controversy surrounding the [[Apostolic poverty]] between branches of [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]; (see [[Franciscan#Renewed controversy on the question of poverty|renewed controversy on the question of poverty]]). The setting was inspired by monumental [[Sacra di San Michele|Saint Michael's Abbey]] in [[Susa Valley]], [[Piedmont]] and visited by Umberto Eco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avosacra.it/sito/curiosita_sulla_sacra.html|title=AVOSacra - Associazione volontari Sacra di San Michele|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2014}} The Spirituals abhor wealth, bordering on the [[Apostolics]] or [[Dulcinian]] [[heresy]]. The book highlights this tension that existed within [[Christianity]] during the medieval era: the Spirituals, one faction within the Franciscan order, demanded that the Church should abandon all wealth, and some heretical sects began killing the well-to-do, while the majority of the Franciscans and the clergy took to a broader interpretation of the gospel. Also in the background is the conflict between [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] and [[Pope John XXII]], with the Emperor supporting the Spirituals and the Pope condemning them.

A number of the characters, such as the [[Inquisitor]] [[Bernard Gui]], [[Ubertino of Casale]] and the [[Minorite]] [[Michael of Cesena]], are historical figures, though the novel's characterization of them is not always historically accurate. Eco notes in a companion book that he had to situate the monastery in mountains so it would experience early frosts, in order for the action to take place at a time when the historical Bernard Gui could have been in the area. For the purposes of the plot, Eco needed a quantity of pig blood, but at that time pigs were not usually slaughtered until a frost had arrived. Later in the year, Gui was known to have been away from Italy and could not have participated in the events at the monastery.

Part of the dialogue in the inquisition scene of the novel is lifted bodily from the historical Gui's own Manual for Inquisitors, the ''Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis'', for example the dialogue: "What do you believe?" "What do you believe, my Lord?" "I believe in all that the Creed teaches." "So I believe, my Lord." Bernardo then points out that what Remigius the cellarer is saying is not that Remigius believes in the Creed, but that Remigius believes that ''Bernardo'' believes in the Creed. This is an example given by the historical Gui in his book to warn inquisitors against the slipperiness and manipulation of words by heretics. This use of Gui's own book by Eco is self-consciously of a piece with his perspective that "books always speak of other books". In this case, the author integrates the historical Bernard Gui's text into his own through the fictional character of Bernardo.

Adso's description of the portal of the monastery is recognizably that of the portal of the church at [[Moissac|Moissac, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=cJRV1c57xfgC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=eglise+moissac+eco&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j21a4pin7R&amp;sig=DD4AIlhaW9YeYpObKApyUXvVsYE&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4-uj62f_YAhUxja0KHc0TBR4Q6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=eglise%20moissac%20eco&amp;f=false|title=Signs of Change: Transformations of Christian Traditions and Their Representation in the Arts, 1000-2000|last=Petersen|first=Nils Holger|last2=Clüver|first2=Claus|last3=Bell|first3=Nicolas|date=2004|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042009993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Alighieri]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy|Comedy]]'' are mentioned once in passing. There is also a quick reference to a famous "Umberto of Bologna"—Umberto Eco himself.

The three-axis acceleration switch was designed to obtain acceleration data more effectively than a conventional [[accelerometer]] in order to more accurately characterize the forces and shocks responsible for TBI.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While miniature accelerometers require a constant power draw, the three-axis acceleration switch only draws current when it senses an acceleration event, using up less energy and allowing the use of smaller batteries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The three-axis acceleration switch has shown to exhibit an expected battery lifetime that is about 100 times better than that of a digital accelerometer. In return, however, the acceleration switch has a lower resolution than that of a digital or analog accelerometer.

One potential application of the three-axis acceleration switch is in studying the head impacts of players in high-risk contact sports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the size of conventional accelerometers, measuring the acceleration requires the device to be implemented inside the player’s helmet, which is designed to mitigate the collision forces and thus may not accurately reflect the true level of injury potential. In contrast, the miniature nature of the acceleration switch makes it easier for the switch to be affixed directly onto the participant’s head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8610">In [[Astrophysics|astrophysic]]s, the '''virial mass''' is the mass of a gravitationally bound astrophysical system, assuming the [[virial theorem]] applies. In the context of [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]] and [[dark matter halo]]s, the virial mass is defined as the mass enclosed within the [[virial radius]] &lt;math&gt;r_{\rm vir}&lt;/math&gt; of a gravitationally bound system, a radius within which the system obeys the [[virial theorem]]. The virial radius is determined using a "top-hat" model. A spherical "top hat" density perturbation destined to become a galaxy begins to expand, but the expansion is halted and reversed due to the mass collapsing under gravity until the sphere reaches virial equilibrium–it is said to be ''virialized''. Within this radius, the sphere obeys the virial theorem which says that the average kinetic energy is equal to minus one half times the average potential energy, &lt;math&gt;\langle T \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle V \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and this radius defines the virial radius.

== Virial radius ==

The virial radius of a gravitationally bound astrophysical system is the radius within which the virial theorem applies. It is defined as the radius at which the density is equal to the critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; of the Universe at the redshift of the system, multiplied by an overdensity constant &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\rho(&lt;r_{\rm vir}) = \Delta_c \rho_c(t)=\Delta_{c}\frac{3 H^2(t)}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho(&lt;r_{\rm vir})&lt;/math&gt; is the halo's mean density within that radius, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{c}(t) = \frac{3 H^2(t)}{8 \pi G}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of the Universe, &lt;math&gt;H^2(t)=H_0^2[\Omega_r(1+z)^4+\Omega_m(1+z)^3+(1-\Omega_{tot})(1+z)^2+\Omega_{\Lambda}]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble parameter]], and &lt;math&gt;r_{\rm vir}&lt;/math&gt; is the virial radius.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxies and the Universe|last=Sparke|first=Linda S.|last2=Gallagher|first2=John S.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-67186-6|location=United States of America|pages=329, 331, 362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=M|date=3 February 2001|title=The mass of a halo|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=367|issue=1|pages=27–32|arxiv=astro-ph/0011495|bibcode=2001A&amp;A...367...27W|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20000357|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time dependence of the Hubble parameter indicates that the [[redshift]] of the system is important, as the Hubble parameter changes with time: today's Hubble parameter, referred to as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble Constant]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, is not the same as the Hubble parameter at an earlier time in the Universe's history, or in other words, at a different redshift. The overdensity &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt; is given by
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Delta_c=18\pi^2+82x-39x^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x=\Omega(z)-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Omega(z)=\frac{\Omega_0(1+z)^3}{E(z)^2},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0=\frac{8 \pi G \rho_0}{3 H_0^2},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E(z)=\frac{H(z)}{H_0}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryan|first=Greg L.|last2=Norman|first2=Michael L.|date=10 Oct 1997|title=Statistical Properties of X-ray Clusters: Analytic and Numerical Comparisons|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=495|issue=80|pages=80|arxiv=astro-ph/9710107|doi=10.1086/305262|bibcode=1998ApJ...495...80B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxy Formation and Evolution|last=Mo|first=Houjun|last2=van den Bosch|first2=Frank|last3=White|first3=Simon|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-521-85793-2|location=United States of America|pages=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it depends on the [[density parameter]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, its value depends on the cosmological model used. In an [[Einstein-de sitter cosmological model|Einstein-de Sitter model]] it equals &lt;math&gt;18\pi^2\approx 178&lt;/math&gt;. This definition is not universal, however, as the exact value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt; depends on the cosmology. In an Einstein-de Sitter model, it is assumed that the density parameter is due to matter only, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_m=1&lt;/math&gt;. Compare this to the currently accepted cosmological model for the Universe, [[ΛCDM]] model, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_m=0.3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7&lt;/math&gt;; in this case, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c\approx100&lt;/math&gt;. Nevertheless it is typically assumed that &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c = 200&lt;/math&gt; for the purpose of using a common definition, and this is denoted as &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt; for the virial radius and &lt;math&gt;M_{200}&lt;/math&gt; for the virial mass. Using this convention, the mean density is given by
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\rho(&lt;r_{200}) = 200  \rho_c(t)=200\frac{3 H^2(t)}{8 \pi G}.&lt;/math&gt;

Other conventions for the overdensity constant include &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c = 500&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c = 1000&lt;/math&gt;, depending on the type of analysis being done, in which case the virial radius and virial mass is signified by the relevant subscript.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Defining the virial mass ==

Given the virial radius and the overdensity convention, the virial mass &lt;math&gt;M_{\rm vir}&lt;/math&gt; can be found through the relation

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M_{\rm vir}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\rm vir}^3 \rho(&lt;r_{\rm vir})=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\rm vir}^3 \Delta_c \rho_{c}.&lt;/math&gt;If the convention that &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c = 200&lt;/math&gt; is used, then this becomes&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;M_{200}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{200}^3 200 \rho_{c}=\frac{100 r_{200}^3 H^2(t)}{G},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the Hubble parameter as described above, and G is the [[gravitational constant]]. This defines the virial mass of an astrophysical system.

== Applications to dark matter halos ==
Given &lt;math&gt;    M_{200}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt;, properties of dark matter halos can be defined, including circular velocity, the density profile, and total mass. &lt;math&gt;    M_{200}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt; are directly related to the [[Navarro–Frenk–White profile|Navarro-Frenk-White]] (NFW) profile, a density profile that describes dark matter halos modeled with the [[Cold dark matter|Cold Dark Matter]] paradigm. The NFW profile is given by&lt;math display="block"&gt;\rho(r)=\frac{\delta_c\rho_{c}}{r/r_s(1+r/r_s)^2},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; is the critical density, and the overdensity &lt;math&gt;\delta_c=\frac{200}{3}\frac{c_{200}^3}{\ln(1+c_{200})-\frac{c_{200}}{1+c_{200}}}&lt;/math&gt; (not to be confused with &lt;math&gt;\Delta_c&lt;/math&gt;) and the scale radius &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; are unique to each halo, and the concentration parameter is given by &lt;math&gt;c_{200}=\frac{r_{200}}{r_s}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Navarro|first=Julio F.|last2=Frenk|first2=Carlos S.|last3=White|first3=Simon D. M.|date=7 Aug 1995|title=The Structure of Cold Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=462|pages=563–575|arxiv=astro-ph/9508025|doi=10.1086/177173|bibcode=1996ApJ...462..563N}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of &lt;math&gt;\delta_c\rho_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is often used, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter unique to each halo. The total mass of the dark matter halo can then be computed by integrating over the volume of the density out to the virial radius &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;M=\int \limits_{0}^{r_{200}}4\pi r^2\rho(r)dr=4\pi \rho_s r_s^3[\ln(\frac{r_{200}+r_s}{r_s})-\frac{r_{200}}{r_{200}+r_s}]=4\pi \rho_s r_s^3[\ln(1+c_{200})-\frac{c_{200}}{1+c_{200}}].&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of the circular velocity, &lt;math&gt;V_c(r)=\sqrt{\frac{GM(r)}{r}},&lt;/math&gt; we can find the circular velocity at the virial radius &lt;math&gt;r_{200}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math display="block"&gt;V_{200}=\sqrt{\frac{GM_{200}}{r_{200}}}.&lt;/math&gt;Then the circular velocity for the dark matter halo is given by&lt;math display="block"&gt;V_c^2(r)=V_{200}^2\frac{1}{x}\frac{\ln(1+cx)-(cx)/(1+cx)}{\ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;x=r/r_{200}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Although the NFW profile is commonly used, other profiles like the [[Einasto profile]] and profiles that take into account the adiabatic contraction of the dark matter due to the baryonic content are also used to characterize dark matter halos.

To compute the total mass of the system, including stars, gas, and dark matter, the [[Jeans equations|Jeans Equations]] need to be used with density profiles for each component.

Women were professionally active in the academic discipline of [[art history]] already in the nineteenth century and participated in the important shift early in the century that began involving an "emphatically corporeal visual subject", with [[Vernon Lee]] as a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Hilary|date=1998–1999|title=Women and the Ends of Art History: Vision and Corporeality in Nineteenth-Century Critical Discourse|journal=[[Victorian Studies]]|volume=42|issue=1|pages=77–100|jstor=3829127|doi=10.2979/vic.1998.42.1.77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that in the twentieth century women art historians (and curators), by choosing to study women artists, "dramatically" "increased their visibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannenbaum|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Tannenbaum|year=1994|title=East Coast- C Is for Contemporary Art Curator: Curiosity, Contradiction, Collaboration, Challenge|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|volume=53|issue=3|pages=47, 49, 51, 53 55, 57, 59|jstor=777431|doi=10.2307/777431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, women art historians are one of two groups (besides authors of high-school texbooks) "who say there have been great women artists" in the first place, according to the authors of a study of the representations of women artists in US textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Roger|author2=Ashley Folgo |year=2006|title=Who Says There Have Been Great Women Artists? Some Afterthoughts|journal=[[Art Education (journal)|Art Education]]|volume=59|issue=2|pages=47–52|jstor=27696136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==
&lt;!--Obviously this needs to be a historical narrative, not just a single note--but hey, that's all I got right now--&gt;In the United States professional, academic employment for women art historians was, by the early 1970s, not commensurate with the number of female PhDs in art history. Between 1960 and 1969, 30.1% of PhDs were awarded to women but those numbers increased significantly during that period: between 1960 and 1965 it was 27%, but between 1966 and 1967 it had gone up to 43.5%. But in 1970-1971, women art historians in art departments in the US made up 23.1% of instructors, 21.6% of assistant professors, 17.5% of associate professors, and only 11.1% of full professors. Comparison with the numbers for the same years for women in the languages, from a study done by the [[Modern Language Association]], showed that "women in C.A.A. [College Art Association] professions face[d] rather more severe discrimination than women in M.L.A. fields". Similar tendencies were reported for salary and employment in studio teaching ("preliminary statistics...indicate that women artists receive a disproportionately small share of full-time studio jobs") and in museums ("particularly significant was a tendency to hire women with BAs to be secretaries and men with BAs for trainee programs which rapidly advanced them to more challenging positions).&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

The history of women in the profession also suggests that art education itself has benefited from the increased presence of professional women art historians, since women students sometimes found it necessary to "redo" an education in which only a male point of view had been provided given. [[Paula Harper]], "one of the first art historians to bring a feminist perspective to the study of painting and sculpture",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/arts/design/paula-hays-harper-feminist-art-historian-dies-at-81.html?_r=0|title=Paula Hays Harper, Art Historian, Is Dead at 81|last=Grady|first=Denise|date=25 June 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moira Roth shared the same experience of a "one-sided training", of feeling left out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Paula|year=1985|title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=10|issue=4|pages=762–81|jstor=3174313|doi=10.1086/494182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination against "women in college and university art departments and art museums" was, in the early 1970s, the immediate cause for the foundation of the [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (see below).&lt;ref name=harris&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Ann Sutherland|year=1973|title=Women in College Art Departments and Museums|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|volume=32|issue=4|pages=417–19|jstor=775692|doi=10.2307/775692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statistical study of US employment among art faculties published in 1977, Sandra Packard notes that "in art departments women have been decreasing in number since the 1930's", and that the number of women in art faculties at institutes of higher education "decreas[ed] from 22% in 1963 to a low of 19.5% in 1974", and cites statistics suggesting that "although women are concentrated at the lower ranks in art faculties, they have more Ph.D. degrees than their male colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Analysis of Current Statistics and Trends as They Influence the Status and Future for Women in the Art Academe|first=Sandra|last=Packard|journal=[[Studies in Art Education]]|volume=18|issue=2|year=1977|pages=38–48|jstor=1319477|doi=10.2307/1319477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
The [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (WCA), a caucus for woman art historians, artists, and curators was founded at the 1972 meeting of the [[College Art Association]] (CAA), but re-established itself as an independent organization in 1974 after the CAA told them they could not use the CAA name anymore. According to Judith Brodsky, the CAA was, at the time, very much a male-dominated organization; she notes, though, in a 1977 article that the Caucus is given space and time at the annual CAA conference and in the CAA's journal, ''Art Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=Judith K.|year=1977|title=The Women's Caucus for Art|journal=[[Women's Studies Newsletter]]|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=13–15|jstor=40042430}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] was installed in 1979. The organization's objectives include "providing women with leadership opportunities and professional development" and "expanding networking and exhibition opportunities for women", and to that purpose publishes a newsletter, organizes sessions at conferences, and runs databases for "art and activism". In 2012 the WCA celebrated its 40th anniversary, and published a pamphlet for the annual awards ceremony that also includes a number of historical essays and reflections from the past presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalwca.org/LTA/LTA2012.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2014|publisher=Women's Caucus for Art|title=Women's Caucus for Art: 40th Anniversary Celebration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women art historians and feminist art theory==
Feminist scholars have argued that the role of women art historians is connected to the study of women (as artists and as subjects) by art historians.&lt;ref name=schleif/&gt; In 1974, Lise Vogel noted that there were few feminist art historians, and that women art historians in general seemed unwilling to ask "the more radical critiques" a feminist scholar should engage in.&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Lise|editor1-first=Arlene|editor1-last=Raven|editor2-first=Cassandra L.|editor2-last=Langer|editor3-first=Joanna|editor3-last=Frueh|title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GT9-qWARitsC&amp;pg=PA24|year=1991|publisher=IconEditions|isbn=9780064302166|pages=21–58|chapter=Fine Arts and Feminism: The Awakening Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 essay, [[Corine Schleif]] argued that women and feminist scholars need to challenge the "Great Master" canon, and that they need to focus less on "style as evidence of authorship", seen as a traditionally masculine way of viewing the history of art, but rather on style as "one of many sites on the production of meaning". The topic of women scholars in art history is thus intricately connected with what scholars have called [[feminist art theory]];&lt;ref name=schleif&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUQF7T5nXBkC|title=Attending to Early Modern Women|editor1-first=Susan Dwyer|editor1-last=Amussen|editor2-first=Adele F.|editor2-last=Seeff|first=Corine |last=Schleif|chapter=The Role of Women in Challenging the Canon of 'Great Master' Art History|year=1998|publisher=U of Delaware P|isbn=9780874136500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry Freedman, for example, claims that "women art historians often interpret art that is about and by women differently than their male colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Kerry|year=1994|title=About This Issue: The Social Reconstruction of Art Education|journal=[[Studies in Art Education]]|volume=35|issue=3|pages=131–34|jstor=1320214|doi=10.2307/1320214}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Carol Armstrong]] and [[Catherine de Zegher]], in ''Women artists at the millennium'' (2006), argue that by the 1980s many "women art history scholars" had begun to think of feminism as irrelevant to the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|chapter=Art and Architecture: Art History|pages=142–43|last=Mathews|first=Patricia|editor1-first=Bonnie G.|editor1-last=Smith|year=2008|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195148909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3168">The '''World Conference on Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity as an Aid to their Survival (WCBESCAS)''' is the world's first conference on [[captive breeding]]. Started by the [[Fauna and Flora Preservation Society]], due to efforts by the famous naturalist and pioneer of captive breeding [[Gerald Durrell]], the first conference was held in 1972 at [[Jersey]] (the location of Durrell's [[Durrell Wildlife Park|Jersey Zoo]], one of the few [[zoo]]s of the world to practise captive breeding at that time). The conference provided a common scientific meeting ground for captive breeding issues for the first time. The conference has been held at:
*1st WCBESCAS; [[Jersey]], 1972
*2nd WCBESCAS; [[London]], 1976
*3rd WCBESCAS; [[San Diego]], 1979
*4th WCBESCAS; [[Harderwijk]], 1984
*5th WCBESCAS; [[Cincinnati]], 1988
*6th WCBESCAS; [[Jersey]], 1992, 'The Roles of Zoos in Global Conservation'
*7th WCBESCAS; [[Cincinnati]], 1999, 'Linking Zoos and Field Research to Advance Conservation'

'''Žemaičių Alkas''' ('''Samogitian sanctuary''') is a [[pagan sanctuary]] in [[Lithuania]], a reconstruction of a medieval [[pagan observatory]]. The poles corresponding to the gods and goddesses of the Balts can be used to observe the main calendar holidays.&lt;ref name="visitlithuania"&gt;[http://www.visitlithuania.net/routes/amber-road/798-emaii-alkas Visit Lithuania - Žemaičių Alkas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://zemaitiualka.lt/ Žemaičių Alkas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is located in the northern part on [[Šventoji, Lithuania]]. It is based on archeological records of the paleoastronomic observatory and pagan shrine that existed on Birutė Hill in [[Palanga]] until the 16th century. The wooden poles were carved by Lithuanian folk artists and were installed in June 1998.&lt;ref name="visitlithuania" /&gt; [[Modern Paganism|Neopagans]] use the sanctuary for devotional ceremonies during the major holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truelithuania.com/sventoji-resort-328 Šventoji Resort].
