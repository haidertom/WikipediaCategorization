'''Architectural mythology''' means the [[symbol]]ism of real-world [[architecture]], as well as architecture described in [[mythology|mythological]] stories.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Lethaby, 1892&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to language a myth could be represented by a painting, a sculpture or a building.

It is about the overall story of an [[architecture|architectural]] work, often revealed through art.  Not all stories surrounding an architectural work incorporate a level of [[mythology|myth]]. These stories can also be well hidden to the casual viewer and are often built into the conceptual design of the architectural statement.

[[File:Parthenon frieze w facade in situ.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Parthenon Frieze]]]]
Before 600 BC worship was done in the open. But when the Greeks began to represent their Gods by large statues, it was necessary to provide a building for this purpose. This led to the development of temples.&lt;ref name= Strong2&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek temple|ancient Greek temples]] were often enhanced with mythological decorations from the columns to the roof. The architectural functions of the temple mainly concentrated on the cella with the cult statue. The architectural elaboration served to stress the dignity of the cella.

 [[File:Aberlemnokirkyardcropped.jpg|thumb|300px|The Class II Kirkyard stone c. 800, [[Aberlemno]]]]
'''Art in Medieval Scotland''' includes all forms of [[Scottish art|artistic production]] within the modern borders of Scotland, between the fifth century and the adoption of the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century. In the [[early Middle Ages]], there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. [[Pictish art]] was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; it can be seen in the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] suggests that it was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.

[[Insular art]] is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved [[high cross]]es found particularly in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of [[Iona]].

Scotland adopted the Romanesque style relatively late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items. Visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands.

===Pictish stones===
{{Main|Pictish stones}}
[[File:DunnichenMeffan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Dunnichen Stone]], a Class I incised stone, with [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double disc and z-rod]], [[Mirror and comb (Pictish symbol)|mirror and comb]] and flower Pictish symbols]]
About 250 Pictish stones survive and have been assigned by scholars to three classes.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0748602917}}, pp. 161–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the [[Pictish beast]], everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the [[Dunrobin Castle|Dunrobin]] (Sutherland) and [[Aberlemno]] stones ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]).&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8&gt;[[James Graham-Campbell|J. Graham-Campbell]] and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include [[Glamis]] 2, which contains a finely executed [[Celtic cross]] on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt; Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt; Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt;

===Pictish metalwork===
Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so. The very large hoard of late Roman [[hacksilver]] found at [[Traprain Law]] may have originated in either way. The largest hoard of early Pictish metalwork was found in 1819 at Norrie's Law in Fife, but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 26–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Over ten heavy silver chains, some over {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} long, have been found from this period; the double-linked [[Whitecleuch Chain]] is one of only two that have a penannular ring, with symbol decoration including enamel, which shows how these were probably used as "choker" necklaces.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8/&gt; The [[St Ninian's Isle]] Treasure of 28 silver and silver-gilt objects, contains perhaps the best collection of late Pictish forms, from the Christian period, when Pictish metalwork style, as with stone-carving, gradually merged with Insular, Anglo-Saxon and Viking styles.&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Laing, ''Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), {{ISBN|0852638744}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish-Scots art===
{{See also|Irish art}}
[[File:Hunterston BroochDSCF6363.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The front of the [[Hunterston Brooch]], found near [[Hunterston]], [[North Ayrshire]], which shows Irish elements of style and may have been made in the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]]]]
[[Thomas Charles-Edwards]] has suggested that the kingdom of Dál Riata was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0521363950}}, pp. 331–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the [[Hunterston brooch]], found in Ayrshire, which may have been made in Dál Riata, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed.&lt;ref name=Lane2001&gt;A. Lane, [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba62/feat1.shtml "Citadel of the first Scots"], ''British Archaeology'', 62, December 2001. Retrieved 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth and ninth centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular [[brooch]]es with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish [[pseudo-penannular]] brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The eighth century [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has elements of Pictish and Irish style.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp109-1123&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 109–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Anglo-Saxon art===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon art}}
Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone [[Franks Casket]], thought to have been produced in [[Northumbria]] in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C. R. Dodwell]], ''Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at [[Dalmeny]] Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with [[filigree]] and [[garnet]], similar to sword harness mounts found at [[Sutton Hoo]]. There is also a bun-shaped loom from [[Yetholm]], Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian [[runes|runic]] inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] from [[Culbin Sands]], Moray and the [[Burghead]] drinking horn mount.&lt;ref&gt;L. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400–1200 AD'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975), {{ISBN|0416823602}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Christianisation of Scotland|Christianisation]] in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;C. E Karkov, ''The Art of Anglo-Saxon England'' (Boydell Press, 2011), {{ISBN|1843836289}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insular art===
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The opening page from the [[Gospel of John]] from the [[Book of Kells]], usually thought to have been made in [[Iona]].]]
Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art, is the name given to the common style produced in Scotland, Britain and Anglo-Saxon England from the seventh century, with the combining of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon forms.&lt;ref&gt;H. Honour and J. Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (London: Macmillan), {{ISBN|0333371852}}, pp. 244–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving examples of Insular art are found in metalwork, carving, but mainly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. In manuscripts surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession. The best examples include the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been wholly or partly created in Iona, and the [[Book of Durrow]], which may be from Ireland or Northumbria. [[Carpet pages]] are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although [[historiated initial]]s (an Insular invention), [[canon table]]s and figurative miniatures, especially [[Evangelist portrait]]s, are also common. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800–1200'' (Yale UP, 1993), {{ISBN|0300064934}}, pp. 85 and 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so the majority of examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;C.

The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with [[amber]] and [[rock crystal]] among the commonest, and some [[garnet]]s. Coloured glass, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[millefiori]] glass, probably imported, are also used.&lt;ref&gt;S.

The most significant survivals in sculpture are in [[High cross]]es, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition may have begun in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland.&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19&gt;J. T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1–5'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}, pp. 915–19.&lt;/ref&gt; They are found throughout the British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a [[Celtic cross]], apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that may have begun at [[Iona]].&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Wilson, ''Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest'' (Overlook Press), 1984, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution in Scotland is heaviest in the Highlands and Islands and they can be dated to the period c. 750 to 1150.&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19/&gt; All the surviving crosses are of stone, but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed. In Scotland biblical iconography is less common than in Ireland, but the subject of [[King David]] is relatively frequently depicted. In the east the influence of Pictish sculpture can be seen, in areas of Viking occupation and settlement, crosses for the tenth to the twelfth centuries have distinctive Scandinavian patterns, often mixed with native styles. Important examples dated to the eighth century include St Martin's Cross on Iona, the [[Kildalton Cross]] from the Hebrides and the Anglo-Saxon [[Ruthwell Cross]].&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19/&gt; Through the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] to the continent, insular art was highly influential on subsequent European Medieval art, especially the decorative elements of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;G. Henderson, ''Early Medieval Art'' (London: Penguin, 1972), pp. 63–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 "pagan" burials in the north and west from the mid-ninth to the mid-tenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Jesch, ''Women in the Viking Age'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1991), {{ISBN|0851153607}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the most impressive of these is the [[Scar boat burial]], on Orkney, which contained an elaborate sword, quiver with arrows, a brooch, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar Dragon Plaque, made from whalebone, most of which were probably made in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;K. Holman, ''The Northern [I. E. Northern] Conquest: Vikings in Britain and Ireland'' (Signal Books, 2007), {{ISBN|1904955347}}, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; From the west, another boat burial at Kiloron Bay in [[Colonsay]] revealed a sword, shield, iron cauldron and enamelled scales, which may be Celtic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;L.

It is about two inches in diameter, with traces of gilding, and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;W. Nolan, L. Ronayne and M. Dunlevy, eds, ''Donegal: History &amp; Society: Interdisciplinary Essays on the History of an Irish County'' (Geography, 1995), {{ISBN|0906602459}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion to Christianity, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, stone crosses and cross-slabs in Viking occupied areas of the Highlands and Islands were carved with successive styles of Viking ornament.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Architectural evidence suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked in much of Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland in the second half of the twelfth century&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth-Century Renaissance'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0719042569}}, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the [[English Gothic architecture|English perpendicular]] style that had come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0191624330}}, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt;

The interiors of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell.&lt;ref name=Whyte&amp;Whyte1991p117&gt;I.

Many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels, including members of the clergy, knights and often their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to brass etchings, they continued to be produced until the end of the Medieval period, with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;R.

Common motifs were ships, swords, harps and Romanesque vine leaf tracery with Celtic elements.&lt;ref&gt;M.

===Decorative arts===
{{Main|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Financrozier2.jpg|thumb|upright|The 12th century "Loch Shiel Crozier Drop", hollow for a relic, with the bust of a king.&lt;ref&gt;V. Glenn, ''Romanesque and Gothic: Decorative Metalwork and Ivory Carvings in the Museum of Scotland'' (National Museums of Scotland, 2003), {{ISBN|1901663558}}, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Survivals from late Medieval church fittings and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even compared to those from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the [[Scottish Reformation]]. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as [[Limoges enamel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 1–4; Chapter III on enamels&lt;/ref&gt; It is often difficult to decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.

Two secular small chests with carved whalebone panels and metal fittings illustrate some aspects of the Scottish arts. The Eglington and Fife Caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the caskets follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with "simple decorations of [[fleuron (architectural)|fleuron]]s and debased [[egg and dart]]" while the whalebone panels are carved in [[relief]] with a late form of Insular interwoven [[strapwork]] characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 147, 186–191; both now [[Museum of Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key examples of native craftsmanship on items include the [[Bute mazer]], the earliest surviving drinking cup of its type, made of maple-wood and with elaborate silver-gilt ornamentation, dated to around 1320.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 34–38, and 16th century cover, 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; The Savernake Horn was probably made for the earl of Moray in the fourteenth century and looted by the English in the mid-sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0333567617}}, pp. 127–9.&lt;/ref&gt; A few significant [[reliquaries]] survive from West Scotland, examples of the habit of the [[Celtic church]] of treating the possessions rather than the bones of saints as [[relic]]s. As in Irish examples these were partly reworked and elaborated at intervals over a long period. These are St Fillan's Crozier and its "Coigreach" or [[reliquary]], between them with elements from each century from the eleventh to the fifteenth, the [[Guthrie, Angus|Guthrie]] Bell Shrine, Iona, twelfth to fifteenth century, and the Kilmichael Glassary Bell Shrine, Argyll, mid-twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 92–115, all Museum of Scotland; MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Skye Chess piece is a single elaborate piece in carved [[walrus]] ivory, with two warriors carrying heraldic shields in a framework of openwork vegetation. It is thought to be Scottish, of the mid-thirteenth century, with aspects similar to both English and Norwegian pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 146–147, 178–181; now Museum of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest groups of surviving works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, beginning at the royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 116–144; C. J. Neville, ''Land, Law and People in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748639586}}, pp. 83–99.&lt;/ref&gt; and seal matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], the vestments and hangings in Holyrood&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; and the Medieval maces of the Universities of [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[Glasgow university|Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt;

===Illumination and painting===
[[File:Trinity Altarpiece.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Trinity Altarpiece]], attributed to Flemish artist [[Hugo van der Goes]] for the [[Trinity College Kirk]] in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the late fifteenth century]]
Manuscript illumination continued into the late Middle Ages, moving from elaborate gospels to charters, like that confirming the rights of [[Kelso Abbey]] from 1159.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brydall, ''Art in Scotland: its Origins and Progress'' (Edinburgh and London: Blackwood, 1889), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Very little painting from Scottish churches survives.

'''Behaviouralism''' (or '''behavioralism''') is an approach in [[political science]] that emerged in the 1930s in the United States. It represented a sharp break from previous approaches in emphasizing an objective, quantified approach to explain and predict political behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 58 says, "Behaviouralism emphasized the systematic understanding of all identifiable manifestations of political behaviour. But it also meant the application of rigorous scientific and statistical methods to standardize testing and to attempt value free inquiry of the world of politics... For the behaviouralist, the role of political science is primarily to gather and analyze facts as rigorously and objectively as possible."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petro, p. 6 says, "Behavioralists generally felt that politics should be studied much in the same way hard sciences are studied."&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences|behavioural sciences]], modeled after the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy p. 58 says, "The term behaviouralism was recognized as part of a larger scientific movement occurring simultaneously in ''all'' of the social sciences, now referred to as the behavioural sciences."&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviouralism claims it can explain political behaviour from an unbiased, neutral point of view.

Behaviouralism seeks to examine the behaviour, actions, and acts of individuals – rather than the characteristics of institutions such as legislatures, executives, and judiciaries  – and groups in different social settings and explain this behavior as it relates to the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
From 1942 through the 1970s, behaviouralism gained support. It was David Easton who started it in the study of political systems.  It was the site of discussion between traditionalist and new emerging approaches to political science.&lt;ref&gt;Eulau, pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of behaviouralism is often attributed to the work of [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Charles Merriam]] who in the 1920s and 1930s, emphasized the importance of examining political behaviour of individuals and groups rather than only considering how they abide by legal or formal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a political approach ==
Prior to the "behaviouralist revolution", political science being a science at all was disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, p. 763&lt;/ref&gt; Critics saw the study of politics as being primarily qualitative and normative, and claimed that it lacked a scientific method necessary to be deemed a science.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 57 says, "On the basis of the philosophical approach, traditionalists prescribe normative solutions to political problems. In their view, no political inquiry into social problems can remain neutral or completely free of normative judgements or prescriptions."&lt;/ref&gt;
Behaviouralists used strict methodology and empirical research to validate their study as a [[social science]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy p 58&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviouralist approach was innovative because it changed the attitude of the purpose of inquiry. It moved toward research that was supported by verifiable facts.&lt;ref&gt;Kegley, p 48&lt;/ref&gt; During its rise in popularity in the 1960s and '70s, behaviouralism challenged the realist and liberal approaches, which the behaviouralists called "traditionalism", and other studies of political behaviour that was not based on fact.

To understand political behaviour, behaviouralism uses the following methods: sampling, interviewing, scoring and scaling and statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Petro, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviouralism studies how individuals behave in group positions realistically rather than how they should behave. For example, a study of the [[United States Congress]] might include a consideration of how members of Congress behave in their positions. The subject of interest is how Congress becomes an 'arena of actions' and the surrounding formal and informal spheres of power.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the term ==
[[David Easton]] was the first to differentiate behaviouralism from [[behaviourism]] in the 1950s (behaviourism is the term mostly associated with psychology).&lt;ref&gt;Easton (1953) p 151&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s, behaviourism itself was referred to as a behavioural science and later referred to as behaviourism. However, Easton sought to differentiate between the two disciplines:&lt;ref name="Berndtson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|title=Behavioralism: Origins of the Concept|last=Berndtson|accessdate=2009-04-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514010256/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|archivedate=14 May 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behavioralism was not a clearly defined movement for those who were thought to be behavioralists. It was more clearly definable by those who were opposed to it, because they were describing it in terms of the things within the newer trends that they found objectionable. So some would define behavioralism as an attempt to apply the methods of natural sciences to human behavior. Others would define it as an excessive emphasis upon quantification. Others as individualistic reductionism. From the inside, the practitioners were of different minds as what it was that constituted behavioralism. [...] And few of us were in agreement.&lt;ref&gt;David Easton in Baer et al. eds, 1991 p 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this in mind, behaviouralism resisted a single definition. [[Dwight Waldo]] emphasized that behaviouralism itself is unclear, calling it "complicated" and "obscure."&lt;ref&gt;Waldo, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; Easton agreed, stating, "every man puts his own emphasis and thereby becomes his own behaviouralist" and attempts to completely define behaviouralism are fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;Easton (1962) p 9&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, behaviouralism was a political, not a scientific concept. Moreover, since behaviouralism is not a research tradition, but a political movement, definitions of behaviouralism follow what behaviouralists wanted.&lt;ref name="Berndtson" /&gt; Therefore, most introductions to the subject emphasize value-free research. This is evidenced by Easton's eight "intellectual foundation stones" of behaviouralism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.jccc.net/bwright1/Introreview2.htm|title=Introduction to Political Science. Exam 2 Study guide|accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riemer, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Regularities'' - The generalization and explanation of regularities.
# ''Commitment to Verification'' - The ability to verify ones generalizations.
# ''Techniques'' - An experimental attitude toward techniques.
# ''Quantification'' - Express results as numbers where possible or meaningful.
# ''Values'' - Keeping ethical assessment and empirical explanations distinct.
# ''Systemization'' - Considering the importance of theory in research.
# ''Pure Science'' - Deferring to pure science rather than applied science.
# ''Integration'' - Integrating social sciences and value.

Subsequently, much of the behavioralist approach has been challenged by the emergence of [[postpositivism]] in political (particularly international relations) theory.

== Objectivity and value-neutrality ==
According to David Easton, behaviouralism sought to be "analytic, not substantive, general rather than particular, and explanatory rather than ethical."&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 101"&gt;Riemer, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the theory seeks to evaluate political behaviour without "introducing any ethical evaluations."  Rodger Beehler cites this as "their insistence on distinguishing between facts and values."&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"&gt;Beehler p 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The approach has come under fire from both conservatives and radicals for the purported value-neutrality. Conservatives see the distinction between values and facts as a way of undermining the possibility of [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"/&gt;  Neal Riemer believes behaviouralism dismisses "the task of ethical recommendation"&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 101"/&gt; because behaviouralists believe "truth or falsity of values (democracy, equality, and freedom, etc.) cannot be established scientifically and are beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Somit, pp 176–180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Bay]] believed behaviouralism was a pseudopolitical science and that it did not represent "genuine" political research.&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 51"&gt;Riemer, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Bay objected to empirical consideration taking precedence over normative and moral examination of politics.&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 51"/&gt;

Behaviouralism initially represented a movement away from "[[naive empiricism]]", but as an approach has been criticized for "naive scientism".&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, p 116&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, radical critics believe that the separation of fact from value makes the empirical study of politics impossible.&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"/&gt;

===Crick's critique===
British scholar [[Bernard Crick]] in ''The American Science of Politics'' (1959), attacked the behavioural approach to politics, which was dominant in the United States, but little known in Britain.  He identified and rejected six basic premises and in each case argued the traditional approach was superior to behaviouralism:
#research can discover uniformities in human behaviour,
#these uniformities could be confirmed by empirical tests and measurements,
#quantitative data was of the highest quality, and should be analyzed statistically,
#political science should be empirical and predictive, downplaying the philosophical and historical dimensions,
#value-free research was the ideal, and
#social scientists should search for a macro theory covering all the social sciences, as opposed to applied issues of practical reform.&lt;ref&gt;"Crick, Bernard," in John Ramsden, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics'' (2002)  p 174&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flintenbreite constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland in an ecological settlement in Flintenbreite near Lübeck, Germany]]

A '''constructed wetland''' ('''CW''') is an artificial [[wetland]] to treat municipal or industrial [[wastewater]], [[greywater]] or [[stormwater]] runoff. It may also be designed for land reclamation after [[mining]], or as a [[Flood mitigation|mitigation]] step for natural areas lost to [[land development]].

Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that use natural functions [[vegetation]], [[soil]], and organisms to treat wastewater. Depending on the type of wastewater the design of the constructed wetland has to be adjusted accordingly. Constructed wetlands have been used to treat both centralized and on-site wastewater. Primary treatment is recommended when there is a large amount of suspended solids or soluble organic matter (measured as [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] and [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Similarly to natural wetlands, constructed wetlands also act as a [[biofilter]] and/or can remove a range of [[pollutant]]s (such as organic matter, [[Nutrient pollution|nutrients]], [[pathogen]]s, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]) from the water. Constructed wetlands are a [[sanitation]] technology that have not been designed specifically for [[pathogen]] removal, but instead, have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; All types of pathogens (i.e., bacteria, viruses, protozoan and helminths) are expected to be removed to some extent in a constructed wetland. Subsurface wetland provide greater pathogen removal than surface wetlands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are two main types of constructed wetlands: subsurface flow and surface flow constructed wetlands. The planted vegetation plays an important role in contaminant removal. The filter bed, consisting usually of [[sand]] and [[gravel]], has an equally important role to play.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; Some constructed wetlands may also serve as a [[habitat]] for native and migratory [[wildlife]], although that is not their main purpose. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands are designed to have either horizontal flow or vertical flow of water through the gravel and sand bed. Vertical flow systems have a smaller space requirement than horizontal flow systems.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Terminology ==

Many terms are used to denote constructed wetlands, such as [[reed bed]]s, soil infiltration beds, treatment wetlands, engineered wetlands, man-made or artificial wetlands.&lt;ref name="hoffmann"&gt;Hoffmann, H., Platzer, C., von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011): [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/930 Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment]. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; A [[biofilter]] has some similarities with a constructed wetland, but is usually without plants.

The term of constructed wetlands can also be used to describe restored and recultivated land that was destroyed in the past through draining and converting into farmland, or mining.

== Overview ==
[[File:Hamburg-Allermöhe, effluent from constructed wetland (3252520051).jpg|thumb|Effluent from a constructed wetland for [[greywater]] treatment at an ecological housing estate in Hamburg-Allermoehe, Germany]]
[[File:Constructed wetland Bayawan City (4113800865).jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland for domestic wastewater treatment in Bayawan City, the Philippines]]
A constructed wetland is an engineered sequence of water bodies designed to filter and treat [[water pollution|waterborne pollutants]] found in [[sewage]], industrial effluent or [[stormwater|storm water runoff]]. Constructed wetlands are used for [[wastewater treatment]] or for [[greywater]] treatment.&lt;ref name="Dotro"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.iwapublishing.com/open-access-ebooks/3567|title=Volume 7. Biological Wastewater Treatment Series|last1=Dotro|first1=G.|last2=Langergraber|first2=G.|last3=Molle|first3=P.|last4=Nivala|first4=J.|last5= Puigagut Juárez|first5=J.|last6=Stein|first6=O. R.|last7=von Sperling|first7=M.|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9781780408767|location=London|pages=|chapter=Treatment wetlands|oclc=984563578}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used after a [[septic tank]] for primary treatment (or other types of systems) in order to separate the solids from the liquid effluent. Some constructed wetland designs however do not use upfront primary treatment.

Vegetation in a wetland provides a substrate (roots, stems, and leaves) upon which [[microorganism]]s can grow as they break down organic materials. This community of microorganisms is known as the [[periphyton]]. The periphyton and natural chemical processes are responsible for approximately 90 percent of [[pollutant]] removal and waste breakdown.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The plants remove about seven to ten percent of pollutants, and act as a [[carbon]] source for the microbes when they decay. Different species of [[aquatic plant]]s have different rates of heavy metal uptake, a consideration for plant selection in a constructed wetland used for water treatment. Constructed wetlands are of two basic types: subsurface flow and surface flow wetlands.

Constructed wetlands are one example of [[nature-based solutions]] and of [[phytoremediation]].

Many regulatory agencies list treatment wetlands as one of their recommended "[[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]]" for controlling [[urban runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, Denver, CO. "Treatment BMP Fact Sheets:"
* [http://udfcd.org/wp-content/uploads/uploads/vol3%20criteria%20manual/09_T-08%20Constructed%20Wetland%20Pond.pdf "T-08. Constructed Wetland Pond" (Nov. 2015)] and

==Removal of contaminants==

Physical, chemical, and biological processes combine in wetlands to remove contaminants from wastewater. An understanding of these processes is fundamental not only to designing wetland systems but to understanding the fate of chemicals once they enter the wetland. Theoretically, [[wastewater treatment]] within a constructed wetland occurs as it passes through the wetland medium and the plant [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]]. A thin film around each root hair is [[Oxygen|aerobic]] due to the leakage of oxygen from the [[rhizome]]s, [[root]]s, and rootlets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] micro-organisms facilitate decomposition of organic matter. Microbial [[nitrification]] and subsequent [[denitrification]] releases [[nitrogen]] as gas to the [[atmosphere]]. [[Phosphorus]] is [[Coprecipitation|coprecipitated]] with [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and [[calcium]] compounds located in the root-bed medium.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brix, H., Schierup, H. (1989): Danish experience with sewage treatment in constructed wetlands. In: Hammer, D.A., ed. (1989): Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Lewis publishers, Chelsea, Michigan, pp. 565–573&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, T.H., Hart, B.T. (1990): [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080407845500127 Use of aeration to promote nitrification in reed beds treating wastewater]. Advanced Water Pollution Control 11: 77–84. doi:10.1016/b978-0-08-040784-5.50012-7. {{ISBN|9780080407845}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suspended solids]] filter out as they settle in the water column in surface flow wetlands or are physically filtered out by the medium within subsurface flow wetlands. Harmful [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es are reduced by filtration and adsorption by [[biofilm]]s on the gravel or sand media in subsurface flow and vertical flow systems.

===Nitrogen removal===
The dominant forms of nitrogen in wetlands that are of importance to [[wastewater]] treatment include [[organic nitrogen]], [[ammonia]], [[ammonium]], [[nitrate]] and [[nitrite]]. Total nitrogen refers to all nitrogen species. Wastewater nitrogen removal is important because of ammonia’s toxicity to fish if discharged into watercourses. Excessive nitrates in drinking water is thought to cause [[methemoglobinemia]] in infants, which decreases the blood's oxygen transport ability. Moreover, excess input of N from point and non-point sources to surface water promotes eutrophication in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans which causes several problems in aquatic ecosystems e.g. toxic algal blooms, oxygen depletion in water, fish mortality, loss of aquatic biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.R., Caraco, N.F., Correll, D.L., Howarth, R.W., Sharpley, A.N. &amp; Smith, V.H. (1998)[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008%5B0559:NPOSWW%5D2.0.CO;2/abstract  Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus and nitrogen].Ecological Applications, 8, 559–568.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia removal occurs in constructed wetlands – if they are designed to achieve biological nutrient removal – in a similar ways as in [[sewage treatment]] plants, except that no external, energy-intensive addition of air (oxygen) is needed.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; It is a two-step process, consisting of [[nitrification]] followed by [[denitrification]]. The [[nitrogen cycle]] is completed as follows: ammonia in the wastewater is converted to ammonium ions; the aerobic bacterium ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' sp. oxidizes ammonium to nitrite; the bacterium ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' sp. then converts nitrite to nitrate. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is reduced to relatively harmless nitrogen gas that enters the atmosphere.

==== Nitrification ====
{{Further|Nitrification}}
Nitrification is the biological conversion of organic and inorganic nitrogenous compounds from a reduced state to a more oxidized state, based on the action of two different bacteria types.&lt;ref name="Wetzel-1983"&gt;Wetzel, R.G. (1983): Limnology. Orlando, Florida: Saunders college publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrification is strictly an aerobic process in which the end product is nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}). The process of nitrification oxidizes ammonium (from the wastewater) to nitrite ({{chem|NO|2|-}}), and then nitrite is oxidized to nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}).

==== Denitrification ====
{{Further|Denitrification}}
Denitrification is the biochemical reduction of oxidized nitrogen anions, nitrate and nitrite to produce the gaseous products nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide ({{chem|N|2|O}}) and nitrogen gas ({{chem|N|2}}), with concomitant oxidation of organic matter.&lt;ref name="Wetzel-1983" /&gt; The end product, {{chem|N|2}}, and to a lesser extent the intermediary by product, {{chem|N|2|O}}, are gases that re-enter the atmosphere.

====Ammonia removal from mine water====
Constructed wetlands have been used to remove ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from contaminated [[mine water]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, S., Hellman, M., Choudhury, M.I. &amp; Ecke, F. (2015) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135415302116 Relative importance of plant uptake and plant associated denitrification for removal of nitrogen from mine drainage in sub-arctic wetlands]. Water Research, 85, 377–383.
&lt;/ref&gt; including cyanide and nitrate.

===Phosphorus removal===
[[Phosphorus]] occurs naturally in both organic and inorganic forms. The analytical measure of biologically available [[Phosphate|orthophosphates]] is referred to as soluble reactive phosphorus (SR-P). Dissolved organic phosphorus and insoluble forms of organic and inorganic phosphorus are generally not biologically available until transformed into soluble inorganic forms.&lt;ref name="Mitsch-Gosselink-1986"&gt;Mitsch, J.W., Gosselink, J.G. (1986): Wetlands. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, p. 536&lt;/ref&gt;

In freshwater [[aquatic ecosystem]]s phosphorus is typically the major limiting nutrient. Under undisturbed natural conditions, phosphorus is in short supply. The natural scarcity of phosphorus is demonstrated by the explosive growth of [[algae]] in water receiving heavy discharges of phosphorus-rich wastes. Because phosphorus does not have an atmospheric component, unlike nitrogen, the [[phosphorus cycle]] can be characterized as closed. The removal and storage of phosphorus from wastewater can only occur within the constructed wetland itself. Phosphorus may be sequestered within a wetland system by:
# The binding of phosphorus in organic matter as a result of incorporation into living biomass,
# [[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]] of insoluble phosphates with [[ferric]] iron, [[calcium]], and [[aluminium]] found in wetland soils.&lt;ref name="Mitsch-Gosselink-1986" /&gt;

====Biomass plants incorporation====
Aquatic vegetation may play an important role in phosphorus removal and, if harvested, extend the life of a system by postponing phosphorus saturation of the sediments.&lt;ref name="gunten89"&gt;Guntensbergen, G.R., Stearns, F., Kadlec, J.A. (1989): Wetland vegetation. In Hammer, D.A., ed. (1989): Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Lewis publishers, Chelsea, Michigan, pp. 73–88&lt;/ref&gt; Plants create a unique environment at the biofilm's attachment surface. Certain plants transport oxygen which is released at the biofilm/root interface, adding oxygen to the wetland system. Plants also increase soil or other root-bed medium hydraulic conductivity. As roots and rhizomes grow they are thought to disturb and loosen the medium, increasing its porosity, which may allow more effective fluid movement in the rhizosphere. When roots decay they leave behind ports and channels known as macropores which are effective in channeling water through the soil.

===Metals removal===
Constructed wetlands have been used extensively for the removal of dissolved metals and [[metalloids]]. Although these contaminants are prevalent in mine drainage, they are also found in [[stormwater]], [[Leachate|landfill leachate]] and other sources (e.g., leachate or FDG washwater{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} at [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]]), for which treatment wetlands have been constructed for mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.infomine.com/enviromine/wetlands/Welcome.htm |title=Wetlands for Treatment of Mine Drainage |publisher=Technology.infomine.com |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mine water—Acid drainage removal====
Constructed wetlands can also be used for treatment of [[acid mine drainage]] from coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Hedin, R.S., Nairn, R.W.; Kleinmann, R.L.P. (1994): Passive treatment of coal mine drainage. Information Circular (Pittsburgh, PA.: U.S. Bureau of Mines) (9389).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathogen removal ===
Constructed wetlands are a sanitation technology that have not typically been designed for pathogen removal, but instead, have been designed to remove other water quality constituents such as suspended solids, organic matter (BOD/COD) and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

All types of pathogens are expected to be removed in a constructed wetland; however, greater pathogen removal is expected to occur in a subsurface wetland. In a free water surface flow wetland one can expect 1 to 2 [[Common logarithm|log10]] reduction of pathogens; however, bacteria and virus removal may be less than 1 log10 reduction in systems that are heavily planted with vegetation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is because constructed wetlands typically include vegetation which assists in removing other pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, the importance of sunlight exposure in removing viruses and bacteria is minimized in these systems.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Removal in a properly designed and operated free water surface flow wetland is reported to be less than 1 to 2 log10 for bacteria, less than 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 1 to 2 log10 for protozoa:, and 1 to 2 log10 for helminths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In subsurface flow wetlands, the expected removal of pathogens is reported to be 1 to 3 log10 for bacteria, 1 to 2 log10 for viruses, 2 log10 for protozoa, and 2 log10 for helminths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The log10 removal efficiencies reported here can also be understood in terms of the common way of reporting removal efficiencies as percentages: 1 log10 removal is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 90%; 2 log10 = 99%; 3 log10 = 99.9%; 4 log10 = 99.99% and so on.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

==Types and design considerations==
The main three broad types of constructed wetlands include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stefanakis|first1=Alexandros|last2=Akratos|first2=Christos|last3=Tsihrintzis|first3=Vassilios|title=Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands: Eco-engineering Systems for Wastewater and Sludge Treatment|date=5 August 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-404612-2|pages=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/vertical-flow-constructed-wetlands/stefanakis/978-0-12-404612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;
* Subsurface flow constructed wetland - this wetland can be either with vertical flow (the effluent moves vertically, from the planted layer down through the substrate and out) or with horizontal flow (the effluent moves horizontally, parallel to the surface)
* Surface flow constructed wetland (this wetland has horizontal flow)
* Floating treatment wetland

The former types are placed in a basin with a substrate to provide a surface area upon which large amounts of waste degrading biofilms form, while the latter relies on a flooded treatment basin upon which aquatic plants are held in flotation till they develop a thick mat of roots and rhizomes upon which biofilms form. In most cases, the bottom is lined with either a polymer [[geomembrane]], concrete or clay (when there is appropriate clay type) in order to protect the water table and surrounding grounds. The substrate can be either [[gravel]]—generally limestone or pumice/volcanic rock, depending on local availability, [[sand]] or a mixture of various sizes of media (for vertical flow constructed wetlands).

===Subsurface flow ===

[[File:Tilley et al 2014 Schematic of the Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Schematic of the Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland: Effluent flows horizontally through the bed.&lt;ref name="eawag.ch" /&gt;]]
[[File:Final tags.jpg|thumb|right|Vertical flow type of constructed wetlands (subsurface flow)]]

In subsurface flow constructed wetlands the flow of wastewater occurs between the roots of the plants and there is no water surfacing (it is kept below gravel). As a result, the system is more efficient, does not attract mosquitoes, is less odorous and less sensitive to winter conditions. Also, less area is needed to purify water. A downside to the system are the intakes, which can clog or [[bioclogging|bioclog]] easily, although some larger sized gravel will often solve this problem.

Subsurface flow wetlands can be further classified as horizontal flow or vertical flow constructed wetlands. In the vertical flow constructed wetland, the effluent moves vertically from the planted layer down through the substrate and out (requiring air pumps to aerate the bed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stefanakis|first1=Alexandros|last2=Akratos|first2=Christos|last3=Tsihrintzis|first3=Vassilios|title=Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands: Eco-engineering Systems for Wastewater and Sludge Treatment|date=5 August 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780124046122|pages=392|edition=1st|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/vertical-flow-constructed-wetlands/stefanakis/978-0-12-404612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the horizontal flow constructed wetland the effluent moves horizontally via gravity, parallel to the surface, with no surface water thus avoiding mosquito breeding. Vertical flow constructed wetlands are considered to be more efficient with less area required compared to horizontal flow constructed wetlands. However, they need to be interval-loaded and their design requires more know-how while horizontal flow constructed wetlands can receive wastewater continuously and are easier to build.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

Due to the increased efficiency a vertical flow subsurface constructed wetland requires only about {{convert|3|m2|sqft}} of space per [[Population equivalent|person equivalent]], down to 1.5 square metres in hot climates.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

The "French System" combines primary and secondary treatment of raw wastewater. The effluent passes various filter beds whose grain size is getting progressively smaller (from gravel to sand).&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

==== Applications ====
Subsurface flow wetlands can treat a variety of different wastewaters, such as household wastewater, agricultural, paper mill wastewater, mining [[runoff (water)|runoff]], [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] or [[meat]] processing wastes, [[storm water]].&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

The quality of the effluent is determined by the design and should be customized for the intended reuse application (like irrigation or toilet flushing) or the disposal method.

==== Design considerations ====
Depending on the type of constructed wetlands, the wastewater passes through a gravel and more rarely [[sand]] medium on which plants are rooted.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; A [[gravel]] medium (generally limestone or volcanic rock [[Lava filter|lavastone]]) can be used as well (the use of lavastone will allow for a surface reduction of about 20% over limestone) is mainly deployed in horizontal flow systems though it does not work as efficiently as sand (but sand will clog more readily).&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

Constructed subsurface flow wetlands are meant as [[secondary treatment]] systems which means that the effluent needs to first pass a primary treatment which effectively removes solids. Such a primary treatment can consist of sand and grit removal, grease trap, [[compost]] filter, [[septic tank]], [[Imhoff tank]], anaerobic baffled reactor or u[[Upflow  anaerobic sludge blanket|pflow anaerobic sludge  blanket]]  (UASB) reactor.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; The following treatment is based on different biological and physical processes like filtration, adsorption or nitrification. Most important is the biological filtration through a biofilm of [[Aerobic bacteria|aerobic]] or [[facultative bacteria]]. Coarse sand in the filter bed provides a surfaces for microbial growth and supports the adsorption and filtration processes. For those microorganisms the oxygen supply needs to be sufficient.

Especially in warm and dry climates the effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation are significant. In cases of water loss, a vertical flow constructed wetland is preferable to a horizontal because of an unsaturated upper layer and a shorter retention time, although vertical flow systems are more dependent on an external energy source. Evapotranspiration (as is rainfall) is taken into account in designing a horizontal flow system.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt;

The effluent can have a yellowish or brownish colour if [[sewage|domestic wastewater]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] is treated. Treated [[greywater]] usually does not tend to have a colour. Concerning pathogen levels, treated greywater meets the standards of pathogen levels for safe discharge to surface water.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Maiga, Y., von Sperling, M., Mihelcic, J. 2017. [http://www.waterpathogens.org/book/constructed-wetlands Constructed Wetlands]. In: J.B. Rose and B. Jiménez-Cisneros, (eds) [http://www.waterpathogens.org Global Water Pathogens Project]. (C. Haas, J.R. Mihelcic and M.E. Verbyla) (eds) Part 4 Management Of Risk from Excreta and Wastewater) Michigan State University, E. Lansing, MI, UNESCO.

Plantings of [[reedbed]]s are popular in European constructed subsurface flow wetlands, although at least twenty other plant species are usable. Many fast growing timer plants can be used, as well for example as Musa spp., Juncus spp., cattails (''[[Typha]]'' spp.) and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]].

==== Operation and maintenance ====
Overloading peaks should not cause performance problems while continuous overloading lead to a loss of treatment capacity through too much suspended solids, sludge or fats.

Subsurface flow wetlands require the following maintenance tasks: regular checking of the pretreatment process, of pumps when they are used, of influent loads and distribution on the filter bed.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

==== Comparisons with other types ====
Subsurface wetlands are less hospitable to [[mosquito]]es compared to surface flow wetlands, as there is no water exposed to the surface. Mosquitos can be a problem in surface flow constructed wetlands. Subsurface flow systems have the advantage of requiring less land area for water treatment than surface flow. However, surface flow wetlands can be more suitable for wildlife habitat.

For urban applications the area requirement of a subsurface flow constructed wetland might be a limiting factor compared to conventional municipal [[wastewater treatment plants]]. High rate aerobic treatment processes like [[activated sludge]] plants, trickling filters, rotating discs, submerged aerated filters or [[membrane bioreactor]] plants require less space. The advantage of subsurface flow constructed wetlands compared to those technologies is their operational robustness which is particularly important in developing countries. The fact that constructed wetlands do not produce secondary sludge ([[sewage sludge]]) is another advantage as there is no need for [[sewage sludge treatment]].&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt; However, primary sludge from primary settling tanks does get produced and needs to be removed and treated.

==== Costs ====
The costs of subsurface flow constructed wetlands mainly depend on the costs of sand with which the bed has to be filled.&lt;ref name="Dotro" /&gt; Another factor is the cost of land.

===Surface flow ===
[[File:Schematic of the Free Water Surface Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a free-water surface constructed wetland: It aims to replicate the naturally occurring processes, where particles settle, pathogens are destroyed, and organisms and plants utilize the nutrients.]]
Surface flow wetlands, also known as free water surface constructed wetlands, can be used for tertiary treatment or polishing of effluent from [[wastewater treatment]] plants. They are also suitable to treat stormwater drainage.

Surface flow constructed wetlands always have horizontal flow of wastewater across the roots of the plants, rather than vertical flow. They require a relatively large area to purify water compared to subsurface flow constructed wetlands and may have increased smell and lower performance in winter.

Surface flow wetlands have a similar appearance to ponds for wastewater treatment (such as "[[waste stabilization pond]]s") but are in the technical literature not classified as ponds.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogens are destroyed by natural decay, predation from higher organisms, sedimentation and UV irradiation since the water is exposed to direct sunlight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The soil layer below the water is anaerobic but the roots of the plants release oxygen around them, this allows complex biological and chemical reactions.

Surface flow wetlands can be supported by a wide variety of soil types including [[bay mud]] and other [[silt]]y [[clay]]s.

Plants such as  Water Hyacinth (''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'') and ''[[Pontederia]]'' spp. are used worldwide (although Typha and Phragmites are highly invasive).

However, surface flow constructed wetlands may encourage mosquito breeding. They may also have high algae production that lowers the effluent quality and due to open water surface mosquitos and odours, it is more difficult to integrate them in an urban neighbourhood.

===Hybrid systems===
A combination of different types of constructed wetlands is possible to use the specific advantages of each system.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

[[File:Newly planted constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Newly planted constructed wetland]]
[[File:Mature Constructed Wetland.jpg|thumb|Same constructed wetland, two years later]]

===Others===
====Integrated constructed wetland====
An integrated constructed wetland (ICW) is an unlined free surface flow constructed wetland with emergent vegetated areas and local soil material. Its objectives is not only to treat wastewater from farmyards and other wastewater sources, but also to integrate the wetland infrastructure into the landscape and enhancing its [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]].&lt;ref name=Scholz07b&gt;Scholz M., Sadowski A. J., Harrington R. and Carroll P. (2007b), Integrated Constructed Wetlands Assessment and Design for Phosphate Removal. ''Biosystems Engineering'', 97 (3), 415–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated constructed wetland facilitates may be more robust treatment systems compared to other constructed wetlands.&lt;ref name=Mustafa09&gt;Mustafa A., Scholz M., Harrington R. and Carrol P. (2009) Long-term Performance of a Representative Integrated Constructed Wetland Treating Farmyard Runoff. ''Ecological Engineering'', 35 (5), 779–790.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholz07a&gt;Scholz M., Harrington R., Carroll P. and Mustafa A. (2007a), The Integrated Constructed Wetlands (ICW) Concept. ''Wetlands'', 27 (2), 337–354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scholz07b/&gt; This is  due to the greater biological complexity and generally relatively larger land area use and associated longer hydraulic [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] of integrated constructed wetland compared to conventional constructed wetlands.&lt;ref name=Carty08&gt;Carty A., Scholz M., Heal K., Gouriveau F. and Mustafa A. (2008), The Universal Design, Operation and Maintenance Guidelines for Farm Constructed Wetlands (FCW) in [[Temperate|Temperate Climates]]. ''Bioresource Technology'', 99 (15), 6780–6792.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integreated constructed wetlands are used in [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the [[United States]] since about 2007. Farm constructed wetlands, which are a subtype of integrated constructed wetlands, are promoted by the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] and the [[Northern Ireland]] [[Environment Agency]] since 2008.&lt;ref name=Carty08/&gt;

==Plants and other organisms==
{{See also|Organisms used in water purification}}

===Plants===

[[File:Newly planted constructed wetland - details (3110372910).jpg|thumb|Newly planted constructed wetland for [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] treatment (Lima, Peru)]]
[[File:Constructed wetland (5547294390).jpg|thumb|The large roots of this uprooted plant growing in a constructed wetlands indicate a healthy plant (Lima, Peru)]]
Typhas and Phragmites are the main species used in constructed wetland due to their effectiveness, even though they can be [[Invasive species|invasive]] outside their native range.

In North America, cattails (''[[Typha latifolia]]'') are common in constructed wetlands because of their widespread abundance, ability to grow at different water depths, ease of transport and transplantation, and broad tolerance of water composition (including pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and contaminant concentrations). Elsewhere, Common Reed (''[[Phragmites australis]]'') are common (both in blackwater treatment but also in [[greywater treatment]] systems to purify wastewater).

Plants are usually [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] in that location for [[Ecology|ecological]] reasons and optimum workings.

===Animals===

[[File:Flowform.jpg|thumb|right|A hybrid system using Flowforms in a treatment pond, in [[Norway]].]]
Locally grown non-[[predator]]y [[fish]] can be added to surface flow constructed wetlands to eliminate or reduce [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, such as [[mosquito]]s. 

[[Stormwater]] wetlands provide habitat for amphibians but the pollutants they accumulate can affect the survival of larval stages, potentially making them function as "ecological traps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |last2=Parris |first2=Kirsten M. |last3=Swearer |first3=Stephen E. |last4=Hale |first4=Robin |title=Stormwater wetlands can function as ecological traps for urban frogs |journal=Ecological Applications |date=June 2018 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=1106–1115 |doi=10.1002/eap.1714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs ==
Since constructed wetlands are self-sustaining their lifetime costs are significantly lower than those of conventional treatment systems. Often their capital costs are also lower compared to conventional treatment systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite report |date=December 2003 |title=Technical and Regulatory Guidance Document for Constructed Treatment Wetlands |url=http://www.itrcweb.org/GuidanceDocuments/WTLND-1.pdf |publisher=Interstate Technology &amp; Regulatory Council |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do take up significant space, and are therefore not preferred where real estate costs are high.

== History ==
Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with sand filter bed have their origin in Europe and are now used all over the world. Subsurface flow constructed wetlands with a gravel bed are mainly found in North Africa, South Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Austria ===
The total number of constructed wetlands in [[Austria]] is 5,450 (in 2015).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langergraber|first=Guenter|last2=Weissenbacher|first2=Norbert|date=2017-05-25|title=Survey on number and size distribution of treatment wetlands in Austria|url=http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/75/10/2309|journal=Water Science and Technology|language=en|volume=75|issue=10|pages=2309–2315|doi=10.2166/wst.2017.112|issn=0273-1223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to legal requirements (nitrification), only vertical flow constructed wetlands are implemented in Austria as they achieve better [[nitrification]] performance than horizontal flow constructed wetlands. Only about 100 of these constructed wetlands have a design size of 50 [[population equivalent]]s or more. The remaining 5,350 treatment plants are smaller than that.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
The [[Arcata Marsh]] in Arcata, California is a sewage treatment and wildlife protection marsh.

=== Australia ===
The [[Urrbrae Wetland]] in Australia was constructed for urban flood control and environmental education.

At the Ranger Uranium Mine, in Australia, ammonia is removed in "enhanced" natural wetlands (rather than fully engineered constructed wetlands), along with manganese, uranium and other metals.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

'''Digital artifact''' in information science, is any undesired or unintended alteration in data introduced in a digital process by an involved technique and/or technology. In anthropology and archeology a digital artifact is an artifact that is of a digital nature or creation. For example, a gif is such an artifact.  

Digital artifact can be of any content types including text, audio, video, image, animation or a combination. 

== Information science ==
In information science, digital artifacts result from:
*Hardware malfunction: In computer graphics, [[visual artifact]]s may be generated whenever a hardware component such as the processor, memory chip, cabling malfunctions, etc., corrupts data. Examples of malfunctions include physical damage, overheating, insufficient voltage and [[GPU]] [[overclocking]]. Common types of hardware artifacts are [[Texture mapping|texture]] corruption and [[T-vertices]] in 3D graphics, and [[pixelization]] in MPEG compressed video.
*Software malfunction: Artifacts may be caused by algorithm flaws such as decoding/encoding audio or video, or a poor pseudo-random number generator that would introduce artifacts distinguishable from the desired noise into statistical models.
*[[Compression artifact|Compression]]: Controlled amounts of unwanted information may be generated as a result of the use of [[lossy compression]] techniques. One example is the artifacts seen in [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]] compression algorithms that produce [[compression artifact|compression artifacts]].
*[[Aliasing]]: Digital imprecision generated in the process of converting analog information into digital space is due to the limited granularity of digital numbering space. In computer graphics, aliasing is seen as [[pixelation]].
*[[Rolling shutter]], the line scanning of an object that is moving too fast for the image sensor to capture a unitary image.
*[[Error diffusion]]: poorly-weighted kernel coefficients result in undesirable visual artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1403">The first idea of a digital administrative law was born in Italy in 1978 by Giovanni Duni and was developed in 1991 with the name [[teleadministration]] (look).
In the [[public administration]] [[debate]] about [[New Public Management]] (NPM), the concept of '''digital era governance''' (or '''DEG''') is claimed by [[Patrick Dunleavy]], [[Helen Margetts]] and their co-authors as replacing NPM since around 2000-05. DEG has three key elements: reintegration (bringing issues back into government control, like US airport security after 9/11); needs-based holism (reorganizing government around distinct client groups); and [[digitizing|digitization]] (fully exploiting the potential of digital storage and Internet communications to transform governance).

The '''Dunton Technical Centre''' (informally '''Ford Dunton''' or '''Dunton''') is a major automotive research and development facility located in [[Dunton Wayletts]], [[Laindon]], [[Essex]], [[United Kingdom]] owned and operated by [[Ford Motor Company]]. It was the largest automotive technical centre in the United Kingdom and takes its name from the nearby [[Dunton Wayletts]].&lt;ref name=theengin1/&gt; Ford Dunton houses the main design team of [[Ford of Europe]] alongside its [[Merkenich Technical Centre]] in [[Cologne]], Germany. In 2007, Dunton had around 3,000 staff working at the site.&lt;ref name=gaz1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/1754626.ford_dunton_turns_40/|title=Ford Dunton turns 40|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Daily Gazette|date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[Image:Approach Road to Ford's Dunton - geograph.org.uk - 927711.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The entrance to Ford Dunton.]]
Ford Dunton is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2116413 situated] at the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2140424 junction] of ''West Mayne'' (B148) and the [[A127 road|A127]] Southend Arterial Road, in [[Dunton Wayletts]] in the district of [[Basildon (borough)|Basildon]]. An electricity pylon line straddles the site. In front of the building, to the north, is a vehicle test track. To the south is the Southfields Business Park. The site lies in the religious parish of Laindon with Dunton, formerly in Dunton and [[Bulphan]] before 1976. Dunton is a small hamlet to the west, with a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2135721 former church] near Dunton Hall. There is a Ford dealership on the B148 on the north-west corner of the site.

==History==
===Construction===
Ford Dunton was constructed by [[George Wimpey]] for a contracted price of £6.5 million. The total cost of the centre was around £10 million. The centre originally had {{convert|45,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of space for design work, making it the largest engineering research centre in Europe. Another development site at [[Aveley]] had been opened in 1956 which made prototype cars and spare parts, and closed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/3431869.stm Aveley site closes in 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's earlier UK design site was at Dagenham (5 start building) and it previously had seven engineering sites around the UK, with five in Essex; these all moved to Dunton.

Ford Dunton was opened by [[Harold Wilson]], then the British Prime Minister, on 12 October 1967.&lt;ref name=gaz1/&gt;

===1967 to 2000===
At the time of its opening, Dunton was assigned responsibility within Ford of Europe for vehicle design, interior styling, chassis and body interior engineering, engine calibration and product planning. Ford's Merkenich Centre in Cologne, Germany was given principal responsibility for body and electrical engineering, base engine design, advanced engine development, exterior styling, homologation, vehicle development (ride, handling, NVH) and transmission engineering. This was a 'systems' approach to the engineering process intended to eliminate the duplication of engineering responsibility within Ford of Europe.

In the late 1960s Dunton worked on an experimental electric car, first shown on 7 June 1967, and called the [[Ford Comuta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAkQhbgpkpIC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Ford+Comuta+dunton&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GHvtTcDACIGa8QPstoG-Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ford%20Comuta%20dunton&amp;f=false|title=Battery-car progress - at 8 mile an hour in 25 years|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=New Scientist|date=9 December 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 1971 Peter Walker opened a £1 million engine emissions laboratory at Dunton, the largest of its type in Europe. In November 1974 the world's first automated (computerised) multiple engine (six) test bed was constructed at Dunton, built in co-operation with the engineering department of [[Queen Mary, University of London]]. In 1974 a [[GE-600 series|Honeywell 6050]] computer was installed at Dunton at a cost of £820,000. The computer was linked to Merkenich and to the Ford test track at [[Lommel Proving Grounds|Lommel]] in Belgium. From 1978 Dunton had access to a [[CDC Cyber|CDC Cyber 176]] computer at the USA base in Dearborn.

By 1984 staff at Dunton were conducting video-conferences with colleagues at Merkenich, using the ECS-1 satellite, and enabled by British Telecom International. In 1988 Dunton prepared the way for design of the Mondeo (codename [[Ford CDW27 platform|CDW27]]) by pioneering, in collaboration with Merkenich, the World Engineering Release System (WERS). Dunton at this time was the most advanced automotive development centre in Europe.

In 1995 Dunton, in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]], developed a device which is capable of detecting different [[List of synthetic polymers|types of plastic]] (for recycling) using the [[triboelectric effect]], including polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon and [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS).

On 16 December 1997 [[Alexander Trotman, Baron Trotman]] opened a £128 million environmental engine testing facility at Dunton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/39990.stm|title=Motorists face fines for dirty fumes|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=16 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 to present===
In 2003 a [[Silicon Graphics International]] (SGI) Reality Centre was constructed at Dunton, incorporating [[SGI Origin 3000 and Onyx 3000|SGI Onyx 3000]] [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualisation]] supercomputers, using the [[InfiniteReality|InfiniteReality3]] graphics rendering system.

In March 2010 Ford announced plans to develop a new generation of environmentally friendly engines and vehicle technologies at Dunton following an announcement by the UK Government that it would underwrite £360 million of a £450 million loan to Ford from the European Investment Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.essexcountystandard.co.uk/news/localnews/5067894.Jobs_safeguarded_at_Ford_in_Essex/|title=Jobs safeguarded at Ford in Essex|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Essex County Standard|date=18 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003154239/http://www.essexcountystandard.co.uk/news/localnews/5067894.Jobs_safeguarded_at_Ford_in_Essex/|archivedate=3 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 the new coalition government confirmed that it would honour the loan commitment, and the contract was signed in a ceremony at Dunton attended by the business minister Mark Prisk on 12 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.basildonrecorder.co.uk/news/echo/8268255.Coalition_to_honour___360m_loan_to_Ford_Dunton/|title=Coalition to honour £360m loan to Ford Dunton|accessdate=7 June 2011|publisher=Basildon Recorder|date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years Dunton has been responsible for the development of the [[ECOnetic]] range of vehicles, and has contributed to development of the [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost]] range of engines.

==Activities==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Dunton houses the main design team of Ford of Europe, alongside its [[Merkenich Technical Centre]] in Cologne. Currently Dunton has responsibility for the design of the [[Ford Fiesta]], the [[Ford Ka]], engines for Ford of Europe (powertrain), commercial vehicles and the interior of Ford of Europe cars. It has facilities to simultaneously test fifteen cars and around one hundred engines. Around 3,000 engineers currently work at Dunton.

Ford Dunton is also the home of [[Ford Team RS]], and as part of the Special Vehicle Engineering section of Ford created by [[Rod Mansfield]], developed the [[Hot hatch|XR family]] of '[[hot hatch]]' vehicles with the [[Ford Fiesta RS Turbo]], more recently becoming the RS family of vehicles. Ford also notably worked in this area of design with [[Cosworth]] of [[Northampton]].

== History ==

=== Concept ===
Interest in combining education with entertainment, especially in order to make learning more enjoyable, has existed for hundreds of years, with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] being movements in which this combination was presented to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Edutainment or Education: Education Possibilities of Didactic Games in Science Education|format=pdf|date=September 2007|location=Brno, Czech Republic|url=http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|access-date=12 April 2017|editor=Němec, J.|pages=55–64|conference=ICCP Brno Conference|last1=Trna|first1=Josef|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817210858/http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Amos Comenius|Komenský]] in particular is affiliated with the “school as play” concept, which proposes [[pedagogy]] with dramatic or delightful elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739.jpg|link=[[:File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739]].jpg|left|thumb|213x213px|''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'']]
[[Poor Richard's Almanack|''Poor Richard’s Almanack'']] demonstrates early implementation of edutainment, with [[Benjamin Franklin]] combining entertaining and educational content, such as puzzles and rules of conduct, into an instructional entity for colonists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|title=Turning to Education for Fun|last=Beato|first=Greg|date=2015-03-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-12|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105130008/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|archivedate=2017-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later development of the concept of edutainment can be tied to [[Walt Disney]], with his first educational short film, [[Tommy Tucker's Tooth|''Tommy Tucker’s Tooth'']], being commissioned and shot in 1922 for the Deneer Dental Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Diane Disney (1957).

Modern forms of edutainment include television productions, film, museum exhibits, and computer software which use entertainment to attract and maintain an audience, while incorporating deliberate educational content or messages. It is also apparent that educational elements are becoming implemented into traditionally recreational realms, such as vacations and games.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Terminology ===
The term edutainment was used as early as 1954 by [[Walt Disney]] to describe the ''[[True Life Adventures]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DISNEY|first=WALT|date=1954-01-01|title=EDUCATIONAL VALUES IN FACTUAL NATURE PICTURES|jstor=42922993|journal=Educational Horizons|volume=33|issue=2|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noun]] ''edutainment'' is a [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] used by Robert Heyman in 1973 while producing documentaries for the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Marta Rey-López et al. A Model for Personalized Learning. In: Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems. Springer. Berlin. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by Dr. Chris Daniels in 1975 to encapsulate the theme of his Millennium Project. This project later became known as The Elysian World Project.&lt;ref name="elysianworld2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elysianworld.com|title=Elysian World|publisher=elysianworld.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217052758/http://elysianworld.com/|archivedate=December 17, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offshoot word "Edutainer" has been used by Craig Sim Webb since before the turn of the millennium to describe an individual who offers edutainment presentations and performances.&lt;ref name="edutainer2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutainer.ca|title=Inspirational speakers – Professional Inspirational Speaker, Performer, Songwriter &amp; Author|publisher=edutainer.ca|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027001013/http://edutainer.ca/|archivedate=October 27, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==

=== Audio and video ===
''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' are examples of shows that use [[music]] and video to teach topics like math, science, and history. Using music to aid memory dates back to the passing of ancient oral traditions, including the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Much of what edutainment can offer through audio and video especially, is accessible over the internet on platforms such as [[YouTube]], with such channels as ''[[Vsauce]]'', ''[[CGP Grey]]'', ''[[MinutePhysics]]'', ''Meet Arnold, ''[[Veritasium]]'', and ''[[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]]''.

[[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]] is a band that incorporates audio and footage from the [[British Film Institute]] into their music and performances, and this partnership helps the British Film Institute showcase its material; their album ''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|Inform—Educate—Entertain]]''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|,]] which covers topics such as the climbing of [[Mount Everest]] and [[highway safety]], demonstrates the connection between the concept of edutainment and their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|title=The Archival Delights of Public Service Broadcasting|date=2015-02-24|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422133120/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|archivedate=2017-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film and television ===
{{Main|Educational television}}

Motion pictures with educational content appeared as early as 1943, such as ''[[Private Snafu]]'', and can still be seen in films such as ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. After [[World War II]], educational entertainment shifted towards television. Television programs can be divided into three main categories: those with primarily educational intentions, those with a high degree of both education and entertainment, and entertainment shows with incidental or occasional educational value.

Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s a form of edutainment via [[telenovelas]], "soap operas for social change". The "Sabido  method" has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, "Life Lessons: How Soap Operas Can Change the World", ''The New Yorker'', June 5, 2006, pp. 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, the government in the 1970s successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning to curb the country's high birthrate.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world." ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy''. September 2007, vol. 4,, no. 3 pp. 19-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third season of the television show ''MTV Shuga'' was analyzed by researchers and then published online in 2017 in terms of its effects related to its goal of educating African youth about [[Sexual Health|sexual health]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV]], and secondarily, [[Gender based violence|gender-based violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|title=MTV Shuga Soap Opera Turns Edutainment into a Tool to Fight HIV and Gender-Based Violence|last=|first=|date=2017-02-27|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422212033/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|archive-date=2017-04-22|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]], those in the treatment group who watched the show for six months were “almost twice as likely” to get tested at HIV testing centers; mixed results were found in regards to the show’s effects on gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|title=EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF MTV SHUGA: CHANGING SOCIAL NORMS AND BEHAVIORS WITH ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit|last2=La Ferrara|first2=Eliana|date=2017|website=World Bank|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174725/http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-15|dead-url=no|access-date=|last3=Orozco|first3=Victor|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article [["Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning"]] Walt Disney believed in education through the entertainment of film and television. He is known as the master of communications who brought both entertainment and education into the world in distinctive ways. His creation of mickey mouse and his adventures taught his audience that life is not always so simple, there will be obstacles that will stand in your way. Mickey mouse's is unpolished and imperfect which make him so realistic to his audience. In many of his stories we see him battle and adventure which he overcomes teach a value in life for viewers, keep going in life. Disney achieved and educational characteristic in his work through the picture series of live animals in their natural habitat by which some film techniques added to the drama of the series. This series was one that satisfied Walt Disney the most as it obtained both the qualities of entertainment and education, which was the characteristics of this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1491447|title=Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning|first=Ralph S.|last=Izard|date=12 May 1967|publisher=|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=45|issue=1|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Educating the public about health issues is a focus for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, several initiatives have used educational entertainment principles to highlight specific conditions or wider healthcare issues. Examples include In Memory about dementia,&lt;ref name="HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY"&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY|url=https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|website=Bedrock|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022823/https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millefeuille about psoriasis&lt;ref name="Millefeuille"&gt;{{cite web|title=Millefeuille|url=http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|website=Millefeuille|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030657/http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and This is Axiom about the challenges facing the UK's National Health Service.&lt;ref name="This is Axiom"&gt;{{cite web|title=This is Axiom|url=http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|website=This is Axiom|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020639/http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
{{Main|Educational game}}

Games fulfill a number of educational purposes. Some games may be explicitly designed with education in mind, while others may have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games, including [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and video games, may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.

According to Paraskeva (2010), at least 68% of American households play video games. Many recent research articles postulate education and gaming can be joined to provide academic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paraskeva | first1 = F. | last2 = Mysirlaki | first2 = S. | last3 = Papgianni | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Multiplayer online games as educational tools: Facing new challenges in learning | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131509002413 | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 498–505 | doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Van Eck (2006), there are three reasons why games are considered learning tools: 1. Ongoing research that has included the last 20 years of educational findings have proven that digital games can be educational; 2. The new generation of today wants "multiple streams of information" (p.&amp;nbsp;1), which includes quick and frequent interaction that allows inductive reasoning; and 3. The mere popularity of games has created a billion-dollar industry. The idea of playing a game assumes the person is engaging in that activity by choice. The activity should have some value of "fun". This does not mean that the person is engaging in the activity only for leisure pursuits; it can also include the desire to learn a skill, connect with other gamers (social community), and spend time in a chosen activity. The activity needs to remain one of choice for the gamer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Eck|first=R.|year=2006|title=Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless...|publisher=Educase Review|volume=41|issue=2|pages=1–16|url=http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229182518/http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|archivedate=2016-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim (2008) supports the use of off-the-shelf games with [[Metacognition|meta-cognitive]] strategies to provide an increase in students' cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, B., Park, H., &amp; Baek, Y. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers and Education, 52, 800-810&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio and podcasts ===

[[Radio]] can serve as an effective vehicle for educational entertainment. The British radio soap opera ''[[The Archers]]'' has for decades been systematically educating its audience on agricultural matters; likewise, the [[Tanzania]]n radio soap opera ''Twende na Wakati'' ("Let's Go With the Times") was written primarily to promote [[family planning]].

Likewise, [[podcast]]s have begun to exemplify the concept of edutainment, with some radio programs also becoming available in this digital format. Not only are there are series with educational elements that are listened to recreationally, but there are also [[Uses of podcasting#Education and academia|podcasts used as an educational tool]]. Lessons based on podcasts have increased in popularity, with [[Teacherspayteachers.com|''TeachersPayTeachers'']] finding that lesson plans relating to podcasts rose in downloads by 21 percent and 650 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, which corresponded with the release of ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|title=Using 'Serial' to Get Students to Read More|last=Godsey|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209125945/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|archivedate=2017-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toys ===
{{Main|Educational toy}}

Toys are perhaps the earliest "edutainment" objects a person encounters, as many toys have also an educational aspect beside their [[aesthetic]] appeal. They can teach children literacy, numerical, conceptual or motor skills. Many toys (e.g., a miniature [[piano]]) are simply colorful, scaled-down versions of more complex objects, and thus can base children in skills and benefits associated with the latter. It is up to grown-ups to guide children to the toy's proper use in order to make the most out of it.

Toys are often employed in the context of [[mimicry]] and [[roleplay]] to partially experience personalities or situations not otherwise possible, very akin to [[simulation]] in video games. They can be used as primitive means to nurture an [[instinct]] or a [[character trait]] in children. Often, toys work simultaneously the other way, providing children with the means to ''express'' those things: a doll may be used by a girl to mimic her mother or express [[motherhood]] as much as to explore it.

Even for toys that don't possess explicit educational value, a thoughtful parent or teacher can turn a static [[figurine]], for example, into an object of interest, by pointing out its features or costumes, or referring to its history or science (e.g., a figurine of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] may be a starting point for exploring American history; a [[Santa Claus]] may be used to explore the roots of Christmas; a toy [[astronaut]] to explore science...), which can be done in conjunction with a more-explicitly "edutaining" object, such as a [[picture book]]. Most children are naturally inquisitive (possibly why they sometimes break their toys; simply to know what is inside or how it moves or what produces that sound), and caregivers should not waste this opportunity.

Even ''grown-ups'' can learn through toys about children: what are their [[Aptitude|talents]] or interests; if they are more [[extrovert]] or [[introvert]]; indeed if they dislike toys and prefer social activities or sport, and thus capitalize on the children's abilities and correct what is wrong or lacking.

Some toys are of considerable appeal and benefit to both children and adults, such as [[Lego]] or [[Rubik's Cube]], as their design and implementation can range from the simple to the sophisticated.

=== Hip hop culture ===
The term "edutainment" was first made popular amongst the hip hop community by [[KRS-One]] (a.k.a. The Teacha) thanks to his [[Boogie Down Productions]] [[Edutainment (album)|album by the same name]].

The term has since been borrowed to describe hip hop culture's innate pedagogical aesthetics. Examples of this include how Hip Hop uniquely combines both thought and action (see [[Paulo Freire]]'s use of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] in ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'') and values both Eurocentric values of rational thought and Afrocentric epistemology of kinetic, affective and emotional ways of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New York|pages=72|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is in the transmission of technical and historical knowledge, the manner in which Hip Hop practitioners learn and exchange by sharing moments of performance together through ''building'' or ''building sessions.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New-York|pages=76–77|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporations ===
The concept of educational entertainment is being used for building learning programs for organizations. High technology is used to make the programs entertaining and educational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|last=Nagy|first=Atilla|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2006|isbn=3-540-25093-X|location=|pages=79–96|chapter=The Impact of E-Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, [[PowerPoint]] presentations may become more entertaining with the addition of flashy animations or graphics. An article in a satirical newspaper, ''[[The Onion]]'', poked fun at the concept of embellishing boring presentations with attention-catching effects.&lt;ref name="Onion2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|title=Wow Factor Added To Corporate Presentation &amp;#124; The Onion – America's Finest News Source|publisher=theonion.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106232425/http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|archivedate=November 6, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional marketing executive in the article noted the previous lack of excitement in the presentation, saying "When we first finished the PowerPoint, the content was all there, but it still lacked that certain something."&lt;ref name="Onion2" /&gt;

Theme parks are a specific kind of setting in which the combination of entertaining and educational elements can be prevalent. [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]], which is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], is highly based on edutainment; the park features attractions that teach about the past, conservation, imagination, future technologies, and the world. The park's dedication plaque, written by [[Marty Sklar]] and Erwin Okun, states the following: “May [[EPCOT Center]] entertain, inform and inspire. And above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in man’s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dream It! Do It!: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms|last=Sklar|first=Marty|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4231-7406-6|location=|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offerings and promotions at [[SeaWorld]] associated with the educational topics of [[marine biology]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and animal rescue efforts are increasing at their current locations and in plans for the upcoming [[SeaWorld Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi theme park]], which is likely due to activism for animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld Shifts to Educational Entertainment, Adds Virtual-Reality Ride; Theme-park moves further away from controversial orca shows|last=Hufford|first=Austen|date=27 September 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal (Online)|access-date=|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld writes a new chapter with first killer whale-free park|last=Lindsay|first=Rowena|date=14 December 2016|work=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=|location=Boston, Mass.|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable theme parks that incorporate educational elements and topics are [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], [[Holy Land Experience]], [[Dinosaur World (theme parks)|Dinosaur World]], [[Busch Gardens]], and [[Puy du Fou]].

=== Museums and public access areas ===

Edutainment is also a growing [[paradigm]] within the [[Science museum|science center]] and [[children's museum]] community in the United States, as well as in many other locations such as the [[zoo]] or a [[botanical garden]]. Educational locations such as these are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to reach the surrounding public and get them interested in areas such as the fine arts, science, literature, and history. Additionally, [[field trip]] visits to these educational places provide participants with interactional stimulus to learn about the content offered there. Since people are used to flashy, polished entertainment venues like movie theaters and theme parks, they demand similar experiences at science centers or museums. Consequently, interactive experiences, such as games and [[mobile app]]s, are implemented in museums in order to more effectively help people learn about what they are seeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ART; TAP AND TOUR; Museums are quietly adapting to the app-happy 'selfie culture'|last=Gelt|first=Jessica|date=25 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museums are also embracing the ability to use storytelling to engage people, especially those who are young, in hopes to increase attendance; all the while, though, it is possible for the focus and purpose of museums to be diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ARENA --- The Museum of The Future --- From 3-D headsets to holograms, new technologies are revolutionizing exhibits; is it entertainment or education?|last=Gamerman|first=Ellen|date=16 October 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=|location=New York, N.Y.|edition= Eastern|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a museum or a zoo can be seen as just another business competing for entertainment dollars from the public, rather than as an institution that serves the public welfare through education or historical preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=High Tech Heretic|last=Stoll|first=Clifford|publisher=Doubleday|year=1999|isbn=0-385-48975-7|location=|pages=485–499|doi=|id=|coauthors=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects in the classroom ==
{{Main|Entertainment in education}}Much research has been done in association with edutainment and its effectiveness in its various forms. Particularly, the effects of the implementation of the concept of edutainment in the classroom setting have been studied on multiple occasions. The concept of [[flipped classroom]]s, in association with edutainment, was studied by Retta Guy and Gerald Marquis (2016), in which students were assigned [[video lesson]]s and podcasts as opposed to projects prior to class; it was found that these students outperformed those in traditional classrooms, found the actual time in class to prompt more interaction, and thought the class to be more enjoyable, although there was a noticeable period of adaption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Retta|last2=Marquis|first2=Gerald|date=2016|title=The Flipped Classroom: A Comparison of Student Performance Using Instructional Videos and Podcasts Versus the Lecture-Based Model of Instruction|url=|journal=Issues in Informing Science &amp; Information Technology|volume= 13|pages= 1–13|issn=1547-5840|doi=10.28945/3461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Ruby Lynch-Arroyo and Joyce Asing-Cashman (2016), ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', which is an example of edutainment in the form of a television show, was integrated into the education of [[Pre-service teacher education|preservice]] mathematics teachers. The subsequent results exemplified the potential for edutainment to promote [[critical thinking]], increased engagement, and [[growth mindset]]s.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Arroyo|first=Ruby|last2=Asing-Cashman|first2=Joyce|date=2016|title=Using Edutainment to Facilitate Mathematical Thinking and Learning: An Exploratory Study|url=http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematics Education|volume=9|pages= 37–52|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817203754/http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Craig D. Cox, ''et al''. (2017) conducted a study in which a mini-series that combined educational and entertaining elements was developed and presented to pharmacy [[preceptor]]s; it was effective in increasing the confidence of the participants and was an honorable mention for the [[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy]] Innovations in Teaching Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Craig D.|last2=Cheon|first2=Jongpil|last3=Crooks|first3=Steven M.|last4=Lee|first4=Jaehoon|date=2017|title=Use of Entertainment Elements in an Online Video Mini-Series to Train Pharmacy Preceptors|url=|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume= 81|issue=1|pages= 1–13|issn=0002-9459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system that incorporated the concept of edutainment through the use of games has also been studied in association with [[Disability|disabled]] students by Amal Dandashi, ''et al''. (2015), and it was found that the system had a positive impact in terms of scores, coordination, communication, and memorization skills; after replaying, higher scores were often achieved as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dandashi|first=Amal|last2=Karkar|first2=Abdel Ghani|last3=Saad|first3=Sawsan|last4=Barhoumi|first4=Zaara|last5=Al-Jaam|first5=Jihad|last6=Saddik|first6=Abdulmotaleb El|date=2015-01-01|title=Enhancing the Cognitive and Learning Skills of Children with Intellectual Disability through Physical Activity and Edutainment Games|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1155/2015/165165|journal=International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|doi=10.1155/2015/165165|page=165165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for podcasts and narration specifically, according to a study conducted by Trish L. Varao Sousa, Jonathan S. A. Carriere, and Daniel Smilek (2013) with student participants, these forms may not be particularly helpful, as their use can result in both less information actually internalized and less engagement overall when compared to other "reading encounters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varao Sousa|first=Trish L.|last2=Carriere|first2=Jonathan S.

== Criticism ==
Debate regarding the value of educational entertainment and its implementation has been had for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|title=That's Edutainment|last=Rozen|first=Joel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323160117/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|archivedate=2016-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback received by Walt Disney for his ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series represents the views of some skeptics of the concept of edutainment. For example, the use of music along with the footage of animals, such as the circumstance in which "The courtship of tarantulas was set to a tango, while the movements of two scorpions were showcased with square dance music in the background" was criticized at the time; the purpose of the music was to enhance the footage, but some people took issue with this humanization. Additionally, without approval, some of the film crew of ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'' prompted unnatural behavior in lemmings that would be filmed, which then generated a negative response.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|title=Walt and the True-Life Adventures|last=admin|date=2012-02-09|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419053222/http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|archivedate=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television show that demonstrates the concept of edutainment, has also specifically been subject to criticism. For instance, in an article published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in May 1971, [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] criticizes the promotion of "Right Answers" in the television show without actual action being taken by the children, and also argues that it is nonsensical and perplexing to have adults convey to children that everything that is to be discovered is logical and easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|title=Big Bird, Meet Dick and Jane|last=Holt|first=John|date=May 1971|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523172022/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|archive-date=2016-05-23|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that the concept of edutainment hurts the actual value of education has been prevalent as well. The book entitled ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by theorist [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates this notion, as it is claimed that areas of study have been “transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.”&lt;ref&gt;Neil., Postman, (1986-01-01). {{oclc|14271773}} ''Amusing ourselves to death : public discourse in the age of show business''.

Retrieved 2017-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Museum professionals especially have faced this dilemma, as in study conducted by Pierre Balloffet, François H. Courvoisier, and Joëlle Lagier (2014), museum professionals did not have severe negative opinions of the incorporation of educational entertainment, but individuals nevertheless had varying viewpoints on "the appropriateness or potential risks of edutainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balloffet|first=Pierre|last2=Courvoisier|first2=François H.|last3=Lagier|first3=Joelle|date=2014|title=From Museum to Amusement Park: The Opportunities and Risks of Edutainment|url=|journal=International Journal of Arts Management|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Space Research and Technology Centre''' ('''ESTEC''') is the [[European Space Agency]]'s main technology development and test centre for spacecraft and space technology. It is situated in [[Noordwijk]], [[South Holland]], in the western [[Netherlands]], although several kilometers off the village but immediately linked to the most Northern district of the nearby town [[Katwijk]].

At ESTEC, about 2500 engineers, technicians and scientists work hands-on with mission design, spacecraft and space technology. ESTEC provides extensive testing facilities to verify the proper operation of spacecraft, such as the Large Space Simulator (LSS), acoustic and electromagnetic testing bays, multi-axis vibration tables and the ESA Propulsion Laboratory (EPL). Prior to launch, almost all of the equipment that ESA launches is tested in some degree at ESTEC.

The Space Expo is ESTEC's visitors centre. It has a permanent exhibition about [[space exploration]].

== History ==
[[File:ExoMars (14042710527).jpg|thumb|Models of ExoMars [[Schiaparelli EDM lander|EDM ''Schiaparelli'']] and the [[ExoMars (rover)|ExoMars Rover]] at ESTEC, 2014]]
The European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) was founded in 1968. The centre was to be a facility at the very core of [[ESRO]]. Its responsibilities included the engineering and testing of satellites and their payloads, the integration of scientific instruments in these payloads, and making arrangements for their launch. In some cases member states were to produce the scientific instruments for ESRO or produce them as part of their own national effort and compensate ESTEC for its service. In practice, national organisations simply used ESTEC as a service organisation and left it to pay for their efforts from the ESRO budget. After the [[ESRO#The Bannier report and its consequences|Bannier Report]] the facility gained overall executive authority for spacecraft development and was merged with ESLAB. The satellite control centre was also moved to [[ESOC]]. ESTEC was originally to be located in [[Delft]] (South Holland) but because of unforeseen difficulties, [[Noordwijk]] was chosen instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=European Space Policy and Programs Handbook|author=Usa Ibp Usa|page=65|isbn=1433015323|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ESA Test Centre ==
In 1964 the ESRO (European Space Research Organization) decided to create an independent test centre that would be part of ESTEC. The first building with vibration and thermal vacuum facilities (named F-building) was completed in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_history/History_ESTEC_Noordwijk_1966|title=History: ESTEC, Noordwijk, 1966|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first satellite to be tested was the ESRO-1 satellite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_history/History_ESRO-1_satellite_1968|title=History: ESRO-1 satellite, 1968|publisher=ESA|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1968. From the 1970s to the late 1980s the test centre was enlarged by following facilities: The Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC) in 1975, The Multishaker in 1983, The EMC facility in 1985, The Large Space simulator (by extending the DTC) in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Large_Space_Simulator_LSS|title=Large Space Simulator (LSS)|publisher=ESA|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Large European Acoustic Facility (LEAF) in 1989 and the Compact Payload Test Range (CPTR) in 1990.

In the 1990s and 2000s the following major facilities have been added: The hydraulic shaker system (HYDRA), The Fr building with additional clean rooms (2000), The Large EMC facility (Maxwell) and the QUAD Shaker in 2008.

In 1997 the test operations and facilities maintenance activities were subcontracted to the COMET consortium and in the year 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-test-services.net/aboutus-overview.html|title=Overview European Test Services (ETS) B.V.|publisher=European Test Services|accessdate=10 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628010633/http://www.european-test-services.net/aboutus-overview.html|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the test management, maintenance, operations and marketing of the test centre has been taken over by [[European Test Services]] B.V. (a subsidiary of [[IABG]] mbH and [[Intespace]] SA); The facilities are still belonging to ESA which is responsible for the facility development, test methodologies, test related engineering and subcontractor control.

Since the year 2000 not only tests for space industry have been performed but the facilities are also used for aerospace-, railway-, transport-, marine- and power- testing for customers like ABB, ALSTOM, Airbus, Bombardier and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-test-services.net/aboutus-references.html|title=References Projects|publisher=European Test Services|accessdate=10 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628020417/http://www.european-test-services.net/aboutus-references.html|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Flynn effect]] has been often cited as an example of euthenics. Another example is the steady increase in body size in industrialized countries since the beginning of the 20th century.

Euthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not.&lt;ref name="definitionsnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/Euthenics|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Definitions for Euthenics|website=definitions.net|year=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Ellen Swallow Richards]], the first female student and instructor at MIT.]]
The term was derived in the late 19th century from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''eutheneo'', εὐθηνέω (''eu'', well; the, root of τίθημι ''tithemi'', to cause).

(To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;)

Also from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;

The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]], Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards|Ellen H. Swallow Richards]] (1842&amp;ndash;1911; Vassar Class of '70) was one of the first writers to use the term, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="askdefine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | authorlink = John K.

===Vassar College Institute of Euthenics===
[[File:Julia Clifford Lathrop first chief US Childrens Bureau.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Julia Clifford Lathrop as the first chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau.]]
After Richards' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932; VC '80)—one of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae—continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in euthenics at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna [[Minnie Cumnock Blodgett]] (1862–1931; VC '84), who with her husband, [[John W. Blodgett|John Wood Blodgett]], offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]]. Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar president [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923, under the direction of Professor Annie Louise Macleod (Chemistry; First woman PhD, McGill University, 1910).&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory" /&gt;

According to Vassar's chronology entry for March 17, 1924, "the faculty recognized euthenics as a satisfactory field for sequential study (major). A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary program]] [radical at the time] focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. Students in euthenics could take courses in horticulture, food chemistry, sociology and statistics, education, child study, economics, economic geography, physiology, hygiene, public health, psychology and domestic architecture and furniture. With the new division came the first major in child study at an American liberal arts college."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1924/1924-03-17-euthenics.html |title= A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a multidisciplinary program focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a typical major in child study in euthenics includes introductory psychology, laboratory psychology, applied psychology, child study and social psychology in the Department of Psychology; the three courses offered in the Department of Child Study; beginning economics, programs of social reorganization and the family in Economics; and in the Department of Physiology, human physiology, child hygiene, principles of public health.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;*{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = Helen Drusilla | authorlink = Helen Drusilla Lockwood | title = The Meaning of Euthenics; An Essay on Action as a Tool of Knowledge. | publisher = [[Vassar College]] | location = [[Poughkeepsie, NY]] | year = 1929 | isbn = | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015019910382;view=1up;seq=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vassar [[Summer Institute of Euthenics]] accepted its first students in June 1926. Created to supplement the controversial euthenics major which began February 21, 1925, it was also located in the new Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics ([[York &amp; Sawyer]], architects; ground broke October 25, 1925). Some Vassar faculty members (perhaps emotionally upset with being displaced on campus to make way, or otherwise politically motivated) contentiously "believed the entire concept of euthenics was vague and counter-productive to women's progress."&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |title= The Vassar Summer Institute |author= Vassar Historian |date=  |website= vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher=  |accessdate= 26 August 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011536/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |archivedate= 4 March 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having overcome a lukewarm reception, Vassar College officially opened its Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics in 1929.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth Wheeler (Physiology and Nutrition – VC '99) took over as director of euthenics studies in 1924. Wheeler remained director until [[Mary Shattuck Fisher Langmuir]] (VC '20) succeeded her in 1944, until 1951.&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute" /&gt;

The college continued for the 1934–35 academic year its successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls.  Intended to help students meet their college costs by working in their residences. For example, in Main, students earned $40 a year by doing relatively light work such as cleaning their rooms.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle1934"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1934/1934-03-10-coops.html |title= The college announced the trustees' decision to continue for the 1934-35 academic year this year's successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, through the [[Rubicon Foundation]], to Vassar to help fund operating deficits in the current and succeeding years and to improve faculty salaries.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicleMay1951"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1951/1951-05-23-blodgett-gift.html |title= President Blanding announced a $400,000 gift to the college from the chair of the board of trustees, Katharine Blodgett Hadley '20, through the Rubicon Foundation. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elmira College===
[[Elmira College]] is noted as the oldest college still in existence which (as a [[Timeline of women's colleges in the United States#First and oldest|college for women]]) granted degrees to women which were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the now-defunct [[Mary Sharp College]]).&lt;ref name="WomensCollegesUS"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969.

A special article was written in the December 12, 1937 ''[[New York Times]]'', quoting recent graduates of Elmira College, urging for courses in colleges for men on the care of children. Reporting that "preparation for the greatest of all professions, that of motherhood and child-training, is being given the students at Elmira College in the Nursery School which is Conducted as part of the Department of Euthenics."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

Elmira College was one of the first of the liberal arts colleges to recognize the fact that women should have some special training, integrated with the so-called liberal studies, which would prepare them to carry on, with less effort and fewer mistakes, a successful family life. Courses in nutrition, household economics, clothing selection, principles of foods and meal planning, child psychology, and education in family relations are a part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst"&gt;{{cite web

The Elmira College nursery school for fifteen children between the ages of two and five years was opened primarily as a laboratory for college students, but it had become so popular with parents in the community that there was always a long waiting list.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

The ''New York Times'' article notes how the nursery had become one of the essential laboratories of the college, where recent mothers testified to the value of the training they received while in college. "Today," one graduate said, "when it is often necessary for young women to continue professional work outside the home after marriage, it is important that young fathers, who must share in the actual care and training of the children, should have some knowledge of correct methods."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

===Today===
Many factors led to the movement never getting the funding it needed to remain relevant, including: vigorous debate about the exact meaning of euthenics, a strong [[antifeminism]] movement paralleling even stronger [[women's rights]] movements, confusion with the term eugenics, the economic impact of the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars. These factors also prevented the discipline from gaining the attention it needed to put together a lasting, vastly [[interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] curriculum. Therefore, it split off into separate disciplines. Child Study is one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that "Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the end of euthenics as originally defined by Ellen Swallow Richards ensued.

==Relationship with eugenics==
According to Ellen Richards, in her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910):&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;
{{quote|The betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings, is what the author means by Euthenics.

"Human vitality depends upon two primary conditions—[[heredity]] and [[hygiene]]—or conditions preceding birth and conditions during life."

[[Eugenics]] deals with race improvement through heredity.

Euthenics deals with race improvement through environment.

Eugenics is hygiene for the future generations.

Euthenics is hygiene for the present generation.

Eugenics must await careful investigation.

Euthenics has immediate opportunity.

Euthenics precedes eugenics, developing better men now, and thus inevitably creating a better race of men in the future. Euthenics is the term proposed for the preliminary science on which Eugenics must be based.}}

==Debate, misconceptions and opposition==
[[File:ЛестерФВорд.jpeg|200px|left|thumb|[[Lester Frank Ward]]]][[Image:aflexner21.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Abraham Flexner]], c. 1895.]]
[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Margaret Sanger]], 1922]]
[[File:Charles Benedict Davenport.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Charles Benedict Davenport]], ca. 1929]]
Debate over misconceptions about the movement started almost from the beginning. In his comparison "Eugenics, Euthenics, And Eudemics", ([[American Journal of Sociology]], Vol. 18, No. 6, May 1913), [[Lester Frank Ward|Lester F. Ward]] of [[Brown University]] opens the second section regarding euthenics lamenting: 
{{quote|Is there, then, nothing to do? Are we to accept that modem scientific fatalism known as [[laissez faire]], which enjoins the folding of the arms? Are we to preach a gospel of inaction? I for one certainly am not content to do so, and I believe that nothing I have thus far said [about eugenics] is inconsistent with the most vigorous action, and that in the direction of the betterment of the human race. The end and aim of the eugenists cannot be reproached. The race is far from perfect. Its condition is deplorable. Its improvement is entirely feasible, and in the highest degree desirable. Nor do I refer merely to economic conditions, to the poverty and misery of the disinherited classes. The intellectual state of the world is deplorable, and its improvement is clearly within the reach of society itself. It is therefore a question of method rather than of principle that concerns us.}}

Ward later noted about the organic environment that:
{{quote|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] has taught us that the chief barrier to the advance of any species of plants or animals is its competition with other plants and animals that contest the same ground. And therefore the fiercest opponents of any species are the members of the same species which demand the same elements of subsistence. Hence the chief form of relief in the organic world consists in the thinning-out of competitors. Any species of animals or plants left free to propagate at its normal rate would overrun the earth in a short time and leave no room for any other species. Any species that is sufficiently vigorous to resist its organic environment will crowd out all others and monopolize the earth. If nature permitted this there could be no variety, but only one monotonous aspect devoid of interest or beauty. Whatever we may think of the harsh method by which this is prevented, we cannot regret that it is prevented, and that we have a world of variety, interest, and aesthetic attractiveness.}}

Vassar historians note that "critics faulted the new program as a weakening of science and a slide into vocationalism.  The influential educator and historian of education, [[Abraham Flexner]]—one of the founders of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study—attacked the program, along with other “ad hoc” innovations like intercollegiate athletics and student governments, in Universities, American, English, German (1930)."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle" /&gt;{{cquote|
"Well, what is euthenics?  Euthenics is the 'science of efficient living;' and the 'science' is artificially pieced together of bits of mental hygiene, child guidance, nutrition, speech development and correction, family problems, wealth consumption, food preparation, household technology, and horticulture....  The institute is actually justified in an official publication by the profound question of a girl student who is reported as asking, 'What is the connection of Shakespeare with having a baby?'  The Vassar Institute of Euthenics bridges this gap!"}}

In the summer of 1926, [[Margaret Sanger]] created a stir when she gave a radio address, called "Racial Betterment", in the first Euthenics Institute, where she praised attempts to "close our gates to the so-called 'undesirables'" and proposed efforts to "discourage or cut down on the rapid multiplication of the unfit and undesirable at home", by government-subsidized voluntary sterilization.  (from ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger'', vol. 1 (2003), Esther Katz, ed.)

Eugenicist, [[Charles Benedict Davenport]], noted in his article "Euthenics and Eugenics," found reprinted in the ''Popular Science Monthly'' of January 1911, page 18, 20:&lt;ref name="CharlesBenedictDavenport"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davenport | first = Charles Benedict | authorlink = Charles Benedict Davenport | title = Euthenics and Eugenics | journal = [[Popular Science Monthly]] | volume = 78 | location = New York |date=January 1911 | pages =16–20 | url = https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo78newyuoft#page/2/mode/2up | accessdate=September 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus the two schools of euthenics and eugenics stand opposed, each viewing the other unkindly.  Against eugenics it is urged that it is a fatalistic doctrine and deprives life of the stimulus toward effort.  Against euthenics the other side urges that it demands an endless amount of money to patch up conditions in the vain effort to get greater efficiency.  Which of the two doctrines is true?

The thoughtful mind must concede that, as is so often the case where doctrines are opposed, each view is partial, incomplete and really false.  The truth does not exactly lie between the doctrines; it comprehends them both. What a child becomes is always the resultant of two sets of forces acting from the moment the fertilized egg begins its development—one is the set of internal tendencies and the other is the set of external influences.  What the result of an external influence—a particular environmental condition—shall be depends only in part upon the nature of the influence; it depends also upon the internal nature of the reacting [[protoplasm]].

Incest, cousin marriage, the marriage of defectives and tuberculous persons, are, in wide circles, taboo.  This fact affords the basis for the hope that, when the method of securing strong offspring, even from partially defective stock—and where is the strain without any defect?—is widely known, the teachings of science in respect even to marriage matings will be widely regarded and that in the generations to come the teachings and practice of euthenics will yield greater result because of the previous practice of the principles of eugenics.}}

{{cquote|From intensive study we realize the importance of eugenics—the right of birth, and also the subject of euthenics—the right to environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36818">'''Fan fiction''' or '''fanfiction''' (also abbreviated to '''fan fic''', '''fanfic''', '''fic''' or '''ff''') is [[fiction]] about characters or settings from an original work of fiction, created by [[Fan (person)|fans]] of that work rather than by its creator. Fans may maintain the creator's characters and settings or add their own. It is a popular form of [[fan labor]], particularly since the advent of the Internet.

Fan fiction is rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work's creator or publisher and is rarely professionally published. It may or may not [[Copyright infringement|infringe on the original author's copyright]], depending on the jurisdiction and on such questions as for whether or not it qualifies as "[[fair use]]" (see [[Legal issues with fan fiction]]). Attitudes of authors and copyright owners of original works to fan fiction have ranged from indifference to encouragement to rejection. Copyright owners have occasionally responded with legal action.

The term "fan fiction" came into use in the 20th century as [[copyright|copyright laws]] began to delineate between stories using established characters that were authorized by the copyright holder and those that were unauthorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reporter.rit.edu/views/fanfiction-legal-battle-creativity|title=Fanfiction: A Legal Battle of Creativity|date=2016-02-05|work=Reporter Magazine|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For earlier works with similar characteristics, see [[Sequel#Unofficial sequels|unofficial sequel]] or [[pastiche]].

Fan fiction is defined by being both related to its subject's [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] [[fictional universe]]  (often referred to as "canon") and simultaneously existing outside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fan-Fiction-TV-Viewers-Have-It-Their-Way-1518184 |title=Fan Fiction—TV Viewers Have It Their Way |author=Schulz, Nancy | date=2001-12-31| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based.

==Earlier meanings of the term==
The term "fan fiction" has been attested in print as early as 1939; in this earliest known citation, it is used in a disparaging way to refer to amateurish science fiction (as opposed to "pro fiction").&lt;ref name="bravenewwords"&gt;{{cite book | title = Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction | editor = Jeff Prucher | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press, Inc. | location = New York | page = 57 | isbn = 978-0-19-530567-8 | url = https://books.google.pl/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in the 1944 ''Fancyclopedia'', an encyclopedia of fandom [[jargon]]. It is defined there as "fiction about fans, or sometimes about pros, and occasionally bringing in some famous characters from [science fiction] stories". The book also mentions that the term is "[s]ometimes improperly used to mean fan science fiction, that is, ordinary fantasy published in a fan magazine".&lt;ref name="bravenewwords" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fancyclopedia1944"&gt;{{cite book | title = Fancyclopedia | author = "John Bristol" | year = 1944 | publisher = The Fantasy Foundation | url = http://fanac.org/Fannish_Reference_Works/Fancyclopedia/Fancyclopedia_I/f1.html#8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Spockanalia2.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Star Trek'' fanzine ''Spockanalia'' contained the first fan fiction in the modern sense of the term.]]
The modern phenomenon of fan fiction as an expression of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fandom]] and their [[fanzine]]s published in the 1960s. The first ''[[Star Trek]]'' fanzine, ''Spockanalia'' (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example.&lt;ref name="verba2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan &amp; Zine History, 1967-1987 | author=Verba, Joan Marie | year=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka MN | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | isbn=0-9653575-4-6 | access-date=2017-04-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042451/http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | archive-date=2016-09-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} These fanzines were produced via offset printing and [[mimeograph]]y, and mailed to other fans or sold at [[science fiction conventions]] for a small fee to help recoup costs. Unlike other aspects of fandom, women dominated fan fiction authoring; 83% of ''Star Trek'' fan fiction authors were female by 1970, and 90% by 1973.&lt;ref name = "Coppa in Hellekson and Busse"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Francesca  | last = Coppa  | editor-last = Hellekson  | editor-first = Karen  | editor2-last = Busse  | editor2-first = Kristina  | contribution = A Brief History of Media Fandom  | title = Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet  | year = 2006  | pages = 41–59  | place = Jefferson, North Carolina  | publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]]  | isbn = 978-0-7864-2640-9 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar states that fan fiction "fill[s] the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen."&lt;ref name="cbs2000"&gt;{{cite book | title=Science Fiction Culture | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | author=Bacon-Smith, Camille | pages=112–113 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan fiction has become more popular and widespread since the advent of the World Wide Web; according to one estimate, fan fiction comprises one third of all content about books on the Web.&lt;ref name="boog20080918"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |title=Brokeback 33 Percent |work=Mediabistro |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |author=Boog, Jason |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210011535/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional fanzines and conventions, [[Usenet group]] [[electronic mailing lists]] were established for fan fiction as well as fan discussion. Online, searchable fan fiction archives were also established. The online archives were initially non-commercial hand-tended and fandom- or topic-specific. These archives were followed by non-commercial automated databases. In 1998, the not-for-profit site [[FanFiction.Net]] came online, which allowed anyone to upload content in any fandom.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news |last=Buechner |first=Maryanne Murray |title=Pop Fiction |date=March 4, 2002 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001950,00.html |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to self-publish fan fiction at an easily accessible common archive that did not require insider knowledge to join, and the ability to review the stories directly on the site, became popular quite quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bradley, Karen|date=Winter 2005|title=Internet lives: Social context and moral domain in adolescent development|journal=New Directions for Youth Development|volume=2005|issue=108|pages=57–76|pmid=16570878|doi=10.1002/yd.142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One popular example of modern fan fiction is [[E. L. James]]' ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]''. This series was originally written as fan fiction for the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series of books and movies and played off the characters of Bella and Edward. In order to not infringe on copyright issues, James changed the character names to Anna and Christian for the purposes of her novels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/holy-crow-fifty-shades-grey-crazy-similar-its-twil-215185|title=Holy crow!

On May 22, 2013, the online retailer [[Amazon.com]] established a new publishing service, [[Kindle Worlds]]. This service would enable fan fiction stories of certain licensed media properties to be sold in the [[Kindle Store]] with terms including 35% of net sales for works of 10,000 words or more and 20% for short fiction ranging from 5000 to 10,000 words. However, this arrangement includes restrictions on content, copyright violations, poor document formatting and/or using misleading titles.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|title=Amazon's "Kindle Worlds" lets fan fiction writers sell their stories|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/technology/amazon-fan-fiction/?iid=HP_LN&amp;hpt=us_bn5|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=CNN Money|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese dōjinshi===
A similar trend in [[Japanese literature|Japan]] also began appearing around the 1960s and 1970s, where [[Self-published|independently published]] [[manga]] and novels, known as ''[[dōjinshi]]'', are frequently published by [[dōjin]] circles; many of these dōjinshi are based on existing [[manga]], [[anime]], and [[video game]] franchises. [[Mangaka|Manga authors]] like [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and [[Fujiko Fujio]] formed dōjin groups such as Fujio's {{nihongo|New Manga Party|新漫画党|Shin Manga-tō}}. At this time, dōjin groups were used by artists to make a professional debut. This changed in the coming decades with dōjin groups forming as school clubs and the like. This culminated in 1975 with the [[Comiket]] in Tokyo.

===Genres===
In addition to the "regular" [[list of genres]], which for fanfiction are usually determined by the work they're based on, there are a few genres that are closely associated with fanfic. Often, they also overlap. The genres include:

====Angst====
A story with an angsty mood centered on a character/characters who are brooding, sad, or in anguish.

====AU or alternate universe====
{{Main|Alternative universe (fan fiction)}}
Characters set in a universe other than their own canonical one.

====Crossover====
Works featuring characters, items, or setpieces from multiple fandoms.

====Darkfic====
Stories which are considerably grimmer and/or more depressing than the original, often in deliberate contrast to the canonical work(s). Not all stories tagged as "[[Darkness#Literature|dark]]" count as darkfic.  This is sometimes done with fandoms which are meant to be light-hearted or for children.

====Fix-fic====
A counterpart to darkfic, or perhaps its supergenre, fix-fic or more commonly known as "fix-it", refers to stories which rewrite canonical events that the author disliked, often because they were depressing or incomprehensible.

====Fluff or WAFF====
A story designed to be happy, and nothing else. The plot is usually less relevant in these types of works, as the main focus is to be cheerful. WAFF is short for "Warm And Fuzzy Feelings," and the two terms are quite similar in usage.

====Fusion====
Works blending two settings, and sometimes their casts, into a cohesive whole.

====Hurt/comfort====
A story in which a character is put through a traumatizing experience in order to be comforted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peggy Sue====
A story in which one of the characters is sent back in time, getting a second chance with knowledge of the original plot. Named after the movie ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', in which this happens to the titular character. [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] is an example of this happening repeatedly. Refers to both the story and the character in this situation. Not related to [[Mary Sue]].

====Rationalist rewrite====
Rebuild fiction that heavily features critical thinking skills and deductive reasoning. Also popularized by ''Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality''.

====Rebuild fiction====
A subtype of fix-fic, wherein aspects of the setting and/or characters are rewritten to be more cohesive. Named for the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' series, which originally qualified, and popularized by ''[[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]''.

====Self-insert====
A genre of fanfiction in which a version of the author is transported to, or discovers they are inside, the world the fanfiction is based on. Almost always [[first-person narration|written in the first person]]. Fanfictions of this type are often also fix-fics.

====Multicross self-insert====
Instead of a single fictional universe, the inserted author is taken to many in a row, and must usually solve some problem or complete some challenge in each place before moving on. Gaining new powers and occasionally companions from each world is common.

====Shipping====
A variant of [[list of genres#romance|romance]], focused on exploring a relationship between two or more characters from the original fandom(s). It has several subgenres, including Slash (which focuses on homosexual pairings, usually of the male variety), [[Femslash]]/Femmeslash/Yuri (same as Slash, but exclusively female/female), Crossover Shipping, which focuses on a romance between characters from multiple fandoms, and "friendshipping", which focuses on platonic relationships.

====Curtainfic====
A subcategory of shipping; describes romantic couples in mundane domestic situations such as picking out [[curtains]].

====Smut====
Smut is sexually explicit or pornographic writing. This could refer to a small portion of a story, or in its entirety.  The terms "lemon" and "lime" are often used to allude to the upcoming sexual scene.

====Songfic====
Songfic, also known as a song fic or a song-fic, is a genre of fan fiction that features a fictional work interspersed with the lyrics of a relevant song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfOTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter|last=Heilman|first=Elizabeth E.|date=2008-09-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135891541|pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbcqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Media Convergence Handbook - Vol. 2: Firms and User Perspectives|last=Lugmayr|first=Artur|last2=Zotto|first2=Cinzia Dal|date=2016-07-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642544873|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[portmanteau]] of "song" and "fiction"; as such, one might also see the genre referred to as "songfiction". As many lyrics are under [[copyright]], whether songfics are a violation of that copyright law is a subject of debate. Some fan fiction websites, such as FanFiction.Net, have barred authors from posting songfics with lyrics outside the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/|title=Guidelines|website=FanFiction.net|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay in ''Music, Sound, and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', [[University of Sydney]] professor [[Catherine Driscoll]] commented that the genre was "one of the least distinguished modes of fan production" and that "within fan fiction excessive attachment to or foregrounding of popular music is itself dismissed as immature and derivative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKxBuIcAoeEC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Music, Sound and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer|last=Attinello|first=Paul Gregory|last2=Halfyard|first2=Janet K.|last3=Knights|first3=Vanessa|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754660415|pages=114, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vent====
Vent refers to literature written by an author under duress or for therapeutic purposes, normally to calm themselves following a stressful or upsetting situation.

==Other related terms==

===A/N===
An abbreviation of "author's note".  Author's notes can be written at any point during a fanfiction (in some cases interrupting the flow of the piece by appearing within the body of a fanfiction), but are typically found directly before the beginning of a fanfiction or after it has concluded, and also at the starts or ends of chapters if the story is updated periodically. A/N's are used to convey direct messages from the author to the reader regarding the piece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Canon===
Canon is the original story. This means anything related to the original source including the plot, settings, and character developments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html|title=Common Fandom Terms|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclaimer ===
{{see also|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
[[Disclaimer]]s are author's notes typically informing readers about who deserves credit for the original source material,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|last=Freeman|first=Morgan|date=|website=|access-date=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often containing pseudo-legal language disavowing any intent of [[copyright infringement]] or alluding to [[fair use]]. Such "disclaimers" are legally ineffective and based on misunderstandings of [[copyright law]], particularly confusion between illegal copyright infringement and unethical [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/fan-fiction-plagiarism-and-copyright/|title=Fan Fiction, Plagiarism, and Copyright|date=18 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fandom ===
A [[fandom]] is a group of fans of a particular work of fiction (e.g. novel, film, television show or video game). Members of a fandom are typically interested in even minor details of the plot/characters of their fandom and often spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, that is why most fanfictions are written by members of a particular fandom(s).

===Fangirl/fanboy===
A female/male that is a part of one or more fandoms. Furthermore, the term fangirling/fanboying refers to a moment where a person "geeks out" or gets quite excited about a fandom.

===Fanon===
Fanon is an idea that is widely believed to be true among fans, but is unconfirmed, preventing it from being labelled as canon. Fanon may refer to a whole interpretation of the original work, or to specific details within it.

===Headcanon===
Headcanon is a fan's personal, idiosyncratic interpretation of canon, such as the backstory of a character, or the nature of relationships between characters. It may represent a teasing out of subtext present in the canon, or it may directly contradict canon. If many other fans share this interpretation, it may become fanon.

===Mary Sue===
Also of note is the concept of the "[[Mary Sue]]", a term credited as originating in ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan fiction that has crossed over to the mainstream, at least among editors and writers. In early ''Trek'' fan fiction, a common plot was that of a minor member of the USS ''Enterprise''{{'}}s crew saving the life of Captain Kirk or Mister Spock, often being rewarded with a sexual relationship as a result. The term "Mary Sue", originating in a parody of stories in this [[wish fulfillment]] genre, thus tends to refer to an idealized or fictional character lacking flaws, often representing the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segall |year=2008 |title=Fan Fiction Writing: New Work Based on Favorite Fiction |publisher=Rosen Pub. |page=26 |isbn=1404213562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OTP===
An abbreviation of the term "one true pairing", where the author or reader ships (wishes for a romantic relationship between) certain characters from a fandom. Additionally, OTPs are also subsetted as OT3s, which reference the reader's one true bonding with three people; this number can be changed to refer to larger bondings.

===RPF===
An abbreviation of "real person fanfiction". Describes fanfiction-like works written about real people, usually celebrities, instead of fictional characters.

===SI===
An abbreviation of self-insert, usually referring to either a story in the eponymous genre or to the author avatar within one.

===TW===
An abbreviation of "[[trauma trigger|trigger warning]]". Trigger warnings are meant to warn people of content in fics that could be harmful or "triggering" to those who have dealt with situations such as abuse. Fan fiction is tagged using various TWs so that readers may prepare for or avoid certain content. Sometimes CW, an abbreviation of "content warning", is used instead of or in addition to a TW. Trigger warnings are usually inserted when the subject matter of a work deals with things issues like drug abuse, mental illness, abuse, or extreme violence.

==Interactivity in the online era==
Reviews can be given by both anonymous and registered users of most sites, and sites are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback, making them a common way for readers and authors online to communicate directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/secure/review.php?storyid=3058878&amp;chapter=1&amp;storytextid=9301416' |title=Fanfiction.Net Review Form |publisher=[[Fanfiction.net]] |accessdate=April 24, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is intended for a type of bond between the reader and the writer, as well as helping the author improve their writing skills through [[constructive criticism]], enabling their to produce a better work next time.&lt;ref name="Merlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |title=Dr. Merlin's Guide to Fanfiction |author=Merlin, Missy |publisher=[[Firefox]] |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523223635/http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, unmoderated review systems are abused to send [[Flaming (Internet)|flames]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], or [[Internet troll|trolling]] messages. As a result, the author of the story can either disable or enable anonymous reviews, depending on their preference. Internet fan fiction gives young writers a wider audience for their literary efforts than ever before, resulting in improved literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Tosenberger, Catherine (2008) "Homosexuality at the Online Hogwarts: Harry Potter Slash Fanfiction" ''Children's Literature'' 36 pp. 185-207 {{doi|10.1353/chl.0.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{Main|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
Fan fiction is a [[derivative work]] under [[United States copyright law]].&lt;ref name="legal-derivativeWork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoosh.org/issue25/lee1a.html#41 |title=What's "Derivative Work?" |work=A Brief Introduction to Copyright for Fanfiction Authors |author=Lee, A.T. |publisher=Woosh! |date=October 1998 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that fan fiction does not fall under [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6673573.html Burns, Elizabeth, and Webbr, Carlie. "When Harry Met Bella: Fan fiction is all the rage. But is it plagiarism? Or the perfect thing to encourage young writers?"

Batts, permanently prohibiting publication in the United States of a book by Ryan Cassidy, a Swedish writer whose protagonist is a 76-year-old version of [[Holden Caulfield]] of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', may be seen as upholding this position regarding publishing fan fiction, as the judge stated, "To the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of Mr. C direct parodied comment or criticism at ''Catcher'' or Holden Caulfield, as opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Sewell |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/judge-rules-for-salinger-in-copyright-suit/?hp |title=Chan, Sewell.

Others such as the [[Organization for Transformative Works]] uphold the legality of non-profit fan fiction under the fair use doctrine, as it is a creative, [[Transformation (law)|transformative]] process.&lt;ref name="legal-fairUse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Legal |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]] |url=http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001030602/http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |archivedate=October 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Lucasfilm]] Ltd. sent out a letter to several [[fanzine]] publishers, asserting Lucasfilm's copyright to all [[List of Star Wars characters|''Star Wars'' characters]] and insisting that no fanzine publish [[pornography]]. The letter also alluded to possible legal action that could be taken against fanzines that did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |title=Quentin Tarantino's Star Wars?: Digital Cinema, Media Convergence, and Participatory Culture |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309235553/http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harry Potter Lexicon is one case where the encyclopedia-like website about everything in the Harry Potter series, moved towards publishing and commercializing the Lexicon as a supplementary and complementary source of information to the series. Rowling and her publishers levied a lawsuit against the website creator, Steven Vander Ark, and the publishing company, RDR Books, for a breach of copyright. While the lawsuit did conclude in Vander Ark's favor, the main issue in contention was the majority of the Lexicon copied a majority of the Series' material and does not transform enough of the material to be held separately from the series itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwabach|first=Aaron|title=The Harry Potter Lexicon and the World of Fandom: Fan Fiction, Outsider Works and, Copyright|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|year=2009|volume=70|issue=3|pages=387–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the HP Lexicon case is an example of Western culture treatment of fan fiction and copyright law, in China, Harry Potter fan fiction is less addressed in legal conflicts but is used as a cultural and educational tool between Western and Chinese cultures. More specifically, while there are a number of "fake" Harry Potter books in China, most of these books are treated as addressing concepts and issues found in Chinese culture. This transformative usage of Harry Potter in fan fiction is mainly from the desire to enhance and express value to Chinese tradition and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gupta |first=Suman |title=Re-Reading Harry Potter 2nd Ed. |year=2009 |publisher=Basingstoke (UK); New York (US): Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent authors have given their blessings to fan fiction, notably [[J.K. Rowling]]. Rowling said she was "flattered" that people wanted to write their own stories based on her fictional characters.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3753001.stm |title=Rowling backs Potter fan fiction |author=Waters, Darren |publisher=BBC |date=May 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Stephenie Meyer]] has put links on her website to fan fiction sites about her characters from the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |title=Twilight Series Fansites |publisher=StephenieMeyer.com |accessdate=October 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006021434/http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifty Shades (novel series)|''Fifty Shades'' trilogy]] was developed from a ''Twilight'' fan fiction originally titled ''Master of the Universe'' and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name "Snowqueen's Icedragon". The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in ''Twilight'', [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=mediabistro.com|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|title=The Lost History of ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|author=GalleyCat|access-date=2015-06-30|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140727045638/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|archive-date=2014-07-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=mtv.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685954/fifty-shades-of-grey-stephenie-meyer.jhtml |title=''Fifty Shades of Grey'': Stephenie Meyer Speaks Out |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of changing views on the subject, author [[Orson Scott Card]] (best known for the ''[[Enders Game]]'' series) once stated on his website, "to write fiction using my characters is morally identical to moving into my house without invitation and throwing out my family." He changed his mind completely and since has assisted fan fiction contests, arguing to the ''Wall Street Journal'' that "Every piece of fan fiction is an ad for my book. What kind of idiot would I be to want that to disappear?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano |first=Aja |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/ |title=Orson Scott Card’s long history of homophobia |publisher=Salon.com |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Anne Rice]] has consistently and aggressively prevented fan fiction based on any of her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' and its sequels in ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]''). She, along with [[Anne McCaffrey]] (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and [[Raymond Feist]], have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"/&gt; [[George R.R. Martin]], who was selected by ''Time'' magazine as one of the "2011 Time 100" and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgerrmartin.com/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions - George R.

==History==
The Fembot Collective was initially developed at the University of Oregon, where it was originally a research interest group led by [[Carol Stabile]] located in the Center for the Study of Women in Society.&lt;ref name=StabileSawchuk /&gt; Officially founded in 2011, the group grew out of conversations about the use of [[feminist ethics]] to guide transformations in [[open access]] and [[new media]] pedagogy that began as early as 2008.&lt;ref name=Bitch /&gt; Early projects for Fembot included the short zine series ''Laundry Day'' edited by Carol Stabile and Chelsea Bullock, and a feminist works series that spotlighted new media artists and critics.&lt;ref name=StockingsCrush&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekpo|first1=Patricia|title=Currently Crushing On: Fembot Collective|url=http://bluestockingsmag.com/2013/03/22/currently-crushing-on-fembot-collective/|work=Blue Stockings Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fembot launched its first issue of ''Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology'' in November 2012.&lt;ref name=NovLaunchSOJC&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of Oregon School of Journalism &amp; Communication |title=Research Newsletter |url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/research-newsletter/11-0/ |accessdate=31 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920221752/http://journalism.uoregon.edu/research-newsletter/11-0/ |archivedate=20 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FemBot Editathon LA 2015 1.jpg|thumbnail|Ms. FemBot edit-a-thon in Los Angeles in 2015]]
Since 2015, Fembot has established a partnership with ''Ms.'' magazine around writing women academics, theorists, and athletes into Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rhee|first1=Margaret|title=Hacking Feminism|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/fembot-collective-profile-tech-and-feminism|accessdate=11 March 2016|work=Bitch Magazine|date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adamovic|first1=Lea|title=Fembot Initiative to again join Wikipedia Edit-a-thon|url=https://around.uoregon.edu/content/fembot-initiative-again-join-wikipedia-edit-thon|work=Around the O|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is currently led by Carol Stabile.

==''Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology and Controversy''==
''Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology'' is a feminist open access journal published in collaboration with the Fembot Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=JOURNAL-TOC|title=Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology|url=http://www.journaltocs.ac.uk/index.php?action=search&amp;subAction=hits&amp;journalID=27454&amp;userQueryID=14401&amp;high=1&amp;ps=30&amp;page=1&amp;items=0&amp;journal_filter=0&amp;journalby=0|website=JournalTOC:|publisher=Heriott-Watt University|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been housed at [[Knight Library|UO Libraries]] and now is administered through the University of Maryland. Notably, the journal challenges conventional academic journal practices by using an open peer review process.&lt;ref name=CampusTech&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fredette|first1=Michelle|title=Rewriting the Journal|url=http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2012/08/28/Rewriting-the-Journal.aspx?Page=1|accessdate=31 March 2015|agency=Campus Technology|issue=Academic Publishing|date=28 August 2012|ref=CampusTech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]] supporters targeted ''Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology'' as a site of "feminist propaganda," arguing that "feminist scholars have used the journal as an outlet for propaganda, allowing them to avoid the peer review processes of traditional journals."&lt;ref name="Inside Higher Ed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Straumsheim|first1=Carl|title=#Gamergate and Games Research|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/11/11/gamergate-supporters-attack-digital-games-research-association|accessdate=31 March 2015|work=Inside Higher Education|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Fembot members and others created a bibliography of critical resources for studying the gendered dimensions of the Gamergate controversy, published by the International Communication Association.&lt;ref name=ICA&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chess|first1=Shira|last2=Consalvo|first2=Mia|last3=Huntemann|first3=Nina|last4=Shaw|first4=Adrienne|last5=Stabile|first5=Carol|last6=Strommer-Galley|first6=Jenny|title=GamerGate and Academia|url=http://www.icahdq.org/membersnewsletter/NOV14_ART0009.asp|accessdate=31 March 2015|agency=ICA Newsletter|issue=9|publisher=International Communication Association|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Future Worlds Center''' (FWC) is a non-profit, non-Governmental independent organization active in programs with future orientation in areas related to [[Social change|positive social change]], [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[Social transformation|transformation]].

==Founding history==
Future Worlds Center was founded in 1991 as [[Cyprus Neuroscience and Technology Institute]]. In the late 90's, it expanded its operations pioneering in a number of humanitarian, multicultural and peace related projects,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MulticulturalCyprus.net/ Building A Multi-Ethnic and Multi-National Cyprus to Promote European Values and Regional and International Peace]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eucitizenship.net/ Extending EU Citizenship to the Eastern End of Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2005, with a new Constitution, it evolved into a larger organization with a pure international orientation integrating all humanitarian, peace, and multicultural activities under one umbrella.

==Notable Operations==
According to its new Constitution, Future Worlds Center is an incubator of ideas, projects, social entrepreneurs and organizations committed to socio-technical reforms&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/Future_Worlds_Center_Vision_and_Mission&lt;/ref&gt;. Since its inception it has envisioned, designed and implemented more than 100 projects&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/List_of_Future_Worlds_Center_Contracts&lt;/ref&gt;, employed more than 200 young scientists&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/Future_Worlds_Center#Future_Worlds_in_a_snapshot&lt;/ref&gt;, and founded several organizations, including [[CYBER KIDS]]&lt;ref&gt;www.cyber-kids.net CYBER KIDS Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/CYBER_KIDS CYBER KIDS page at Future Worlds Wiki; previously named [[Cyprus Neuroscience and Technology Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Technology for peace]], the Cyprus Safer Internet Center along with the [[Cyprus Safer Internet Hotline]] and [[Cyprus Safer Internet Helpline| Helpline]], the Cyprus Community Media Centre&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cypruscommunitymedia.org Cyprus Community Media Centre Website&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the United Nations, Youth Power&lt;ref&gt;http://youthpowercyprus.org/about-us/member-organizations Youth Power website&lt;/ref&gt;, Cyprus NGO Platform "Development"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/CYINDEP:_Cyprus_NGO_Platform_%22Development%22 Cyprus NGO Platform "Development" page in Future Worlds Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;, the Cyprus Refugee Council&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/cyrefugeecouncil/ Cyprus Refugee Council in facebook&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Innovations in Education===
The organization has developed the curriculum for CYBER KIDS, a chain of computer learning centers, that started in Cyprus and expanded in 7 countries in the early 90s. CYBER KIDS was a mass-scale experiment to achieve massive social change in a whole country. 

Future Worlds Center also implements many EC-funded projects that conduct research and inform societies about the safer use of the Internet; Cyberethics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberethics.info the Cyprus’ Safer Internet Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyprus’ Safer Internet Center, which includes a [[Cyprus Safer Internet Hotline|Hotline]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberethics.info/cyethics2/page.php?pageID=15 Cyprus’ Safer Internet Hotline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731064153/http://www.cyberethics.info/cyethics2/page.php?pageID=15 |date=2011-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Cyprus Safer Internet Helpline|Helpline]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpline.cyberethics.info Cyprus’ Safer Internet Helpline] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803204314/http://www.helpline.cyberethics.info/ |date=2012-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. 
In a 1976 study, Gwen Broude and Sarah Greene compared attitudes towards and frequency of homosexuality in the ethnographic studies available in the [[Standard cross-cultural sample]]. They found that out of 42 communities: homosexuality was accepted or ignored in 9; 5 communities had no concept of homosexuality; 11 considered it undesirable but did not set punishments; and 17 strongly disapproved and punished. Of 70 communities, homosexuality was reported to be absent or rare in frequency in 41, and present or not uncommon in 29.&lt;ref&gt;Gwen J. Broude and Sarah J. Greene, "Cross-Cultural Codes on Twenty Sexual Attitudes and Practices", ''Ethnology'', Vol. 15, No. 4 (Oct., 1976), pp. 409-429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Gwen J., and Sarah J. Greene, (1980). "Cross-Cultural Codes on Twenty Sexual Attitudes and Practices", In: ''Cross-Cultural Samples and Codes''. Herbert Barry III and Alice Schlegel, eds. pp. 313-334. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was frequent in ancient Greece. However, in later cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality#History of Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]].

Many historical figures, including [[Socrates]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Homosexuality'', Craig Arthur Williams, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; have had terms such as ''gay'' or ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'' applied to them; some scholars, such as [[Michel Foucault]], have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary [[social construct]] of sexuality foreign to their times,&lt;ref name="foucault"&gt;{{harv|Foucault|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others challenge this.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, Review of David M. Halperin, ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality.'' in ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]'' 2003.09.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. [[John Boswell]] has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=boswell1&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Boswell |date=1980 |title=Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

==The Americas==

Among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] prior to European colonization, a number of Nations had respected ceremonial and social roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals in their communities; in many contemporary [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] communities, these roles still exist.&lt;ref name=Estrada&gt;Estrada, Gabriel S. 2011.

Accessed 23 Sep 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a modern, pan-Indian term that has been adopted by consensus is "[[Two-Spirit]]".&lt;ref name=NativeOut101&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20141210110520/http://nativeout.com/twospirit-rc/two-spirit-101/ Two Spirit 101]" at ''NativeOut'': "The Two Spirit term was adopted in 1990 at an Indigenous lesbian and gay international gathering to encourage the replacement of the term berdache, which means, 'passive partner in sodomy, boy prostitute.'"

Homosexual and gender-variant individuals were also common among other pre-[[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest]] civilizations in [[Latin America]], such as the [[Aztec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[Quechuas]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], and the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] of Brazil.&lt;ref name=glbtqlatinamerica&gt;{{citation|first=Ben |last=Pablo |year=2004 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/latin_america_colonial.html |title=Latin America: Colonial |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211012339/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/latin_america_colonial.html |archivedate=2007-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glbtqmex&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Murray |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen O.

[[File:Balboamurder.jpg|thumb|left|Balboa setting his [[war dog]]s upon Indian practitioners of sodomy in 1513; New York Public Library]]
The Spanish conquerors were horrified to discover sodomy openly practiced among native peoples, and attempted to crush it out by subjecting the ''[[Two-Spirit|berdache]]s'' (as the Spanish called them) under their rule to severe penalties, including public [[execution]], burning and being torn to pieces by dogs.&lt;ref name=coello&gt;Mártir de Anglería, Pedro. (1530). ''[http://www.udel.edu/LAS/Vol3-2Coello.html#Introduction Décadas del Mundo Nuevo]''. Quoted by Coello de la Rosa, Alexandre. "Good Indians", "Bad Indians", "What Christians?": The Dark Side of the New World in Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés (1478–1557), ''[[Delaware]] Review of Latin American Studies'', Vol. 3, No. 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Asia==
In [[East Asia]], same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.

[[Homosexuality in China]], known as the ''pleasures of the bitten peach,'' ''the cut sleeve,'' or ''the southern custom,'' has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. These euphemistic terms were used to describe behaviors, not identities (recently some fashionable young Chinese tend to euphemistically use the term "brokeback," 斷背 ''duanbei'' to refer to homosexual men, from the success of director [[Ang Lee]]'s film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'').&lt;ref name=jongo&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0820/30157/MzAxNTcoluZIoia.html |title=Most frequently used new coinages in daily Chinese |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-07 |periodical=Jongo News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175158/http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0820/30157/MzAxNTcoluZIoia.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships were marked by differences in age and social position. However, the instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' seem as familiar to observers in the present, as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period.

[[Homosexuality in Japan#Ancient Japan|Homosexuality in Japan]], variously known as [[shudo]] or [[nanshoku]], has been documented for over one thousand years and had some connections to the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic life and the [[samurai]] tradition. This same-sex love culture gave rise to strong traditions of [[Ukiyo-e|painting]] and literature documenting and celebrating such relationships.

Similarly, in [[Thailand]], ''[[kathoey]]'', or "ladyboys," have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries, and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers. While ''kathoey'' may encompass simple [[effeminacy]] or [[transvestite|transvestism]], it most commonly is treated in [[Thai culture]] as a [[third gender]]. They are generally accepted by society, and Thailand has never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality or homosexual behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and [[Greek mythology|mythographic materials]]) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

The formal practice, an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free-born (i.e. not a slave or [[freedman]]) adult male and a free-born [[adolescent]], was valued for its [[pedagogy|pedagogic benefits]] and as a means of [[population control]], though occasionally blamed for causing [[societal disorder|disorder]]. [[Plato]] praised its benefits in his early writings&lt;ref name=plato1&gt;[[Plato]], Phaedrus in the ''[[Symposium]]''&lt;/ref&gt; but in his late works proposed its prohibition.&lt;ref name=plato2&gt;Plato, Laws, 636D &amp; 835E&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'' (182B-D), Plato equates acceptance of homosexuality with [[democracy]], and its suppression with [[despotism]], saying that homosexuality "is shameful to [[barbarian]]s because of their despotic governments, just as [[philosophy]] and [[athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] are, since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or physical unions, all of which love is particularly apt to produce".&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

Aristotle, in his ''Politics'', dismissed Plato's ideas about abolishing homosexuality (2.4); he explains that barbarians like the [[Celt]]s accorded it a special honour (2.6.6), while the [[Cretan]]s used it to regulate the population (2.7.5).&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

Little is known of [[lesbianism|female homosexuality]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. [[Sappho]], born on the island of [[Lesbos]], was included by later [[Classical Greek people|Greeks]] in the canonical list of [[nine lyric poets]]. The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth (''sapphic'' and ''lesbian'') came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lesbian&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lesbian|title=Lesbian|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sapphic&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Sapphic|title=Sapphic|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sappho's poetry centers on [[passion (emotion)|passion]] and love for various personages and both genders. The [[narrator]]s of many of her poems speak of [[infatuation]]s and love (sometimes requited, sometimes not) for various females, but descriptions of [[sexual act|physical acts]] between women are few and subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Denys Page, ''Sappho and Alcaeus'', Oxford UP, 1959, pp. 142–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that she ran an academy for girls.

In [[ancient Rome]], the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, but [[pederasty|relationships]] were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex.&lt;ref&gt;Prioreschi, Plinio (1996). A History of Medicine. Horatius Press. pp. 21–23, 29. {{ISBN|1-888456-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[Roman emperor|emperor]] with the exception of [[Claudius]] took male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward (1781). The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenophile]] emperor [[Hadrian]] is renowned for his relationship with [[Antinous]]. However, by 390 A.D., Emperor [[Theodosius I]] made homosexuality a legally punishable offense for the passive partner: "All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people." &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Robert Thornton, Bowers v. Hardrick: An Incomplete Constitutional Analysis, 65 U.N.C. L. Rev. 1100, 1100 n. 11 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In 558, toward the end of his reign, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] expanded the proscription to the active partner as well, warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the "[[Divine retribution|wrath of God]]". Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on [[brothels]] of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] in 618.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius: Secret History: XIX.

During the [[Renaissance]], wealthy cities in northern [[Italy]]—[[Florence]] and [[Venice]] in particular—were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, Michael, (1996), ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', {{ISBN|0-19-512292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Guido, (1985), ''The Boundaries of Eros'', {{ISBN|0-19-503465-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the [[Officers of the Night]], were [[prosecution|prosecuting]], [[fine (penalty)|fining]], and [[imprisonment|imprisoning]] a good portion of that population.&lt;ref&gt;Florentine proverb, ca. 1480.

Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', Oxford, 1996; p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The eclipse of this period of relative [[artistic freedom|artistic]] and [[sexual freedom|erotic freedom]] was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralizing monk [[Girolamo Savonarola]].&lt;ref&gt;On homoeroticism in Florence and Savonarola's campaign against it, Michael Rocke, Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence (New York, 1996).

The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as [[Personal relationships of James I of England|King James I]] and the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: "The world is chang'd I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now;...Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov'd Ganimede" &lt;ref&gt;''Mundus Foppensis, or The Fop Display'd'', 1691&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymous ''Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson'' was published in 1723 in England and was presumed by some modern scholars to be a novel.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S.

The 1749 edition of [[John Cleland]]'s popular novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' includes a homosexual scene, but this was removed in its 1750 edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill:_Memoirs_of_a_Woman_of_Pleasure ''Fanny Hill'' at WikiSource] (1749) by [[John Cleland]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, Stephen J.

It includes the passage: "Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts."&lt;ref&gt;Gladfelder, Hal (May 2006) ''In Search of Lost Texts: Thomas Cannon's 'Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified"'', Institute of Historical Research&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1785 [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote another defense, but this was not published until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Homosexuality ({{ISSN|0091-8369}}) Volume: 3 Issue: 4, Volume: 4 Issue: 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Execution]]s for sodomy continued in the [[Netherlands]] until 1803 and in [[England]] until 1835.

Between 1864 and 1880 [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled ''Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love.'' In 1867 he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the [[Congress of German Jurists]] in [[Munich]] for a resolution urging the repeal of [[anti-homosexual law]]s. ''Sexual Inversion'' by [[Havelock Ellis]], published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as stereotypes, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement.&lt;ref name=sexualinversion&gt;{{citation |title=Sexual Inversion |first=Havelock |last=Ellis |first2=John Addington |last2=Symonds |year=1975 |publisher=Arno Press |isbn=0-405-07363-1}} (reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[medical text]]s like these (written partly in [[Latin]] to obscure the sexual details) were not widely read by the general public, they did lead to the rise of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against [[Paragraph 175|anti-sodomy laws in Germany]], as well as a much more informal, unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers, led by such figures as [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Addington Symonds]]. Beginning in 1894 with ''Homogenic Love'', [[Socialist]] activist and poet [[Edward Carpenter]] wrote a string of pro-homosexual articles and pamphlets, and "came out" in 1916 in his book ''My Days and Dreams''. In 1900, [[Elisar von Kupffer]] published an [[anthology]] of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, ''[[Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur]]''. His aim was to broaden the public perspective of homosexuality beyond its being viewed simply as a medical or biological issue, but also as an ethical and cultural one.

There are a handful of accounts by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid-1800s. Two of these travelers, Rifa'ah al-Tahtawi and Muhammad sl-Saffar, show their surprise that the French sometimes deliberately mis-translated love poetry about a young boy, instead referring to a young female, to maintain their social norms and morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Rouayheb|first=Khaled|title=Before Homosexuality in the Arab-Islamic World, 1500-1800|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-72988-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many [[Middle East]]ern [[Muslim]] cultures egalitarian or age-structured homosexual practices were, and remain, widespread and thinly veiled. The prevailing pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were—and are—either gender-structured or age-structured or both. In recent years, egalitarian relationships modeled on the western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare. Same-sex intercourse officially carries the death penalty in several Muslim nations: Saudi Arabia, Iran, [[Mauritania]], northern [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 ILGA:7 countries still put people to death for same-sex acts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029185853/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 |date=2009-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, governments in the Middle East often ignore, deny the existence of, or criminalize homosexuality. Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], during his [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad#U.S. Visit and speech at Columbia University|2007 speech at Columbia University]], asserted that there were no gay people in Iran.

In many societies of [[Melanesia]], especially in [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the last century. The [[Etoro people|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies, however, have become hostile towards same-sex relationships since the introduction of [[Christianity]] by [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[missionaries]].&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mastaba of Niankhkhum and Khnumhotep embrace.jpg|thumb|Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep kissing.]]
[[Homosexuality in ancient Egypt]] is a passionately disputed subject within [[Egyptology]]: historians and egyptologists alike debate what kind of view the Ancient Egyptians society fostered about [[homosexuality]]. Only a handful of direct hints have survived to this day and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation.

The best known case of possible homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials [[Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum|Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep]]. Both men lived and served under [[pharaoh]] [[Niuserre]] during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]] (c. 2494&amp;ndash;2345 BC).&lt;ref name=RPH&gt;Richard Parkinson: ''Homosexual Desire and Middle Kingdom Literature''. In: ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (JEA)'', vol. 81, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same [[mastaba]] tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in Ancient Egypt the [[Eskimo kissing|nose-on-nose touching]] normally represented a kiss.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

Egyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the Ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101020071548/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/africa/niankhkhnum_and_khnumhotep.html Dena Connors-Millard: ''Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep - Evidence of Gay Relationships Exists as Early as 2400 B.C.?''] (English).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were [[twin]]s, even possibly [[conjoined twins]]. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

It remains unclear, what exact view the Ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any document and literature that actually contains sexual orientated stories, never name the nature of the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. And no Ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=EBT&gt;Emma Brunner-Traut: ''Altägyptische Märchen. Mythen und andere volkstümliche Erzählungen''. 10th Edition. Diederichs, Munich 1991, {{ISBN|3-424-01011-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ethiopia Bieber (1909) “encountered Uranism” among the Semitic Harari people and noted that “sodomy is not foreign to the Harari. Albeit not as commonly, it also occurs among the Galla [Oromo] and Somal[i].” He also noted mutual masturbation by both sexes and all ages for all three peoples, and specified that among the Harari, Uranism was practiced as often between
men as between men and boys. More recently, Gamst (1969) reported homosexual relations among shepherd boys of the Cushitic-speaking Qemant (Kemant) of central Ethiopia. Among Amhara peasants, Messing (1957) found (better-accepted) male transvestites, who they view as “god’s mistakes.” Wändarwäräd (“literally male-female”) with visible male sexual characteristics, but whose structure is popularly believed to be defective. Among the Maale of southern Ethiopia, “a small minority [of men] crossed over to feminine roles. Called ashtime, these (biological) males dressed like women, performed female tasks, cared for their own houses, and apparently had sexual relations with men,” according to Donald Donham (1990).

Cross-gender homosexuality not tied to possession cults has been reported in a number of East African societies. Needham (1973) described a religious leadership role called mugawe among the Meru of Kenya which includes wearing women's clothes and hairstyle. Mugawe are frequently homosexual, and sometimes are married to a man. Bryk (1964) reported active (i.e., insertive)
Kikuyu pederasts called onek. and also mentioned “homoerotic bachelors” among the pastoralist Nandi and Maragoli (Wanga).

== Historiographic considerations ==
The term ''homosexuality'' was invented in the 19th century, with the term ''heterosexuality''  invented later in the same century to contrast with the earlier term. The term ''bisexuality'' was invented in the 20th century as sexual identities became defined by the predominate sex to which people are attracted and thus a label was needed for those who are not predominantly attracted to one sex. This points out that the history of sexuality is not solely the history of different-sex sexuality plus the history of same-sex sexuality, but a broader conception viewing of historical events in light of our modern concept or concepts of sexuality taken at its most broad and/or literal definitions.

Historical personalities are often described using modern sexual identity terms such as ''straight'', ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'', ''[[gay]]'' or ''[[queer]]''. Those who favour the practice say that this can highlight such issues as discriminatory historiography by, for example, putting into relief the extent to which same-sex sexual experiences are excluded from biographies of noted figures, or to which sensibilities resulting from same-sex attraction are excluded from literary and artistic consideration of important works, and so on. As well as that, an opposite situation is possible in the modern society: some LGBT-supportive researchers stick to the homosexual theories, excluding other possibilities.

However, many, especially in the academic world, regard the use of modern labels as problematic, owing to differences in the ways that different societies constructed sexual orientation identities and to the connotations of modern words like ''queer''. For example, in many societies same-sex sex acts were expected, or completely ignored, and no identity was constructed on their basis at all. Academic works usually specify which words will be used and in which context. Readers are cautioned to avoid making assumptions about the identity of historical figures based on the use of the terms mentioned above.

=== Ancient Greece ===
{{Main|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Pederasty in ancient Greece}}
Greek men had great latitude in their sexual expression, but their wives were severely restricted and could hardly move about the town unsupervised if she was old enough that people would ask whose mother she was, not whose wife she was.

Men could also seek adolescent boys as partners as shown by some of the earliest documents concerning same-sex [[pederasty|pederastic]] relationships, which come from [[Ancient Greece]]. Often adolescent boys were favored over women. One ancient saying claimed that "Women are for business, boys are for pleasure." Though slave boys could be bought, free boys had to be courted, and ancient materials suggest that the father also had to consent to the relationship. Such relationships did not replace marriage between man and woman, but occurred before and during the marriage. A mature man would not usually have a mature male mate, but there were exceptions (among whom [[Alexander the Great]]) He would be the ''erastes'' (lover) to a young ''eromenos'' (loved one). Dover suggests that it was considered improper for the eromenos to feel desire, as that would not be masculine. Driven by desire and admiration, the erastes would devote himself unselfishly by providing all the education his eromenos required to thrive in society. In recent times, Dover's theory suggests that [[#Outside Reading|questioned]] in light of massive evidence of ancient art and love poetry, a more emotional connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge. Some research has shown that ancient Greeks believed semen to be the source of knowledge and that these relationships served to pass wisdom on from the erastes to the eromenos.

=== The Middle Ages ===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Two males accused of sodomy burned at the stake, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]
Through the medieval period, homosexuality was generally condemned and thought to be the moral of the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. Historians debate if there were any prominent homosexuals and bisexuals at this time, but it is argued that figures such as [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], [[Richard the Lionheart]], [[Philip II Augustus]], and [[William Rufus]] were engaged in same-sex relationships.

Also, historian Allan A. Tulchin recently argued that a form of male same-sex marriage existed in Medieval France, and possibly other areas in Europe, as well. There was a legal category called "enbrotherment" (affrèrement) that allowed two men to share living quarters, pool their resources, and effectively live as a married couple. The couple shared "one bread, one wine, one purse."&lt;ref&gt;Allan A. Tulchin, "Same-Sex Couples Creating Households in Old Regime France: The Uses of the Affrèrement," ''The Journal of Modern History''. Volume 79, Issue 3, Page 613–647, Sep 2007. [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/action/doSearch?searchText=tulchin&amp;filter=all&amp;x=0&amp;y=0]&lt;/ref&gt; The article received considerable attention in the English-language press, since Tulchin may have discovered the earliest form of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph {{cite web|url=http://my.telegraph.co.uk/go/tag/view/blog_post/humanity?num=10&amp;pg=3|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126082839/http://my.telegraph.co.uk/go/tag/view/blog_post/humanity?num=10&amp;pg=3|archivedate=2009-01-26|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-06-18|df=}}, NPR [https://www.npr.org/blogs/news/2007/08/could_the_idea_of_civil_unions.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Tulchin's views have also sparked significant controversy, as they challenge the generally held view that the medieval period was one of the most anti-gay in history.

Freud, among others, argued that neither predominantly different- nor same-sex sexuality were the norm, instead that what is called "bisexuality" is the normal human condition thwarted by society.

In 1948 [[Alfred Kinsey]] publishes ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'', popularly known as the [[Kinsey Reports]].

Homosexuality was deemed to be a psychiatric disorder for many years, although the studies this theory was based on were later determined to be flawed. In 1973 homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1986 all references to homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder were removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

During the [[Sexual Revolution]], the different-sex sexual ideal became completely separated from procreation, yet at the same time was distanced from same-sex sexuality. Many people viewed this freeing of different-sex sexuality as leading to more freedom for same-sex sexuality.

[[File:Emblemata 1624.jpg|thumb|275px|Early depiction of a "Dutch telescope" from 1624.]]

The earliest known [[telescope]] appeared in 1608 in the [[Netherlands]] when an [[eyeglass]] maker named [[Hans Lippershey]] tried to obtain a patent on one. Although Lippershey did not receive his patent, news of the new invention soon spread across Europe. The design of these early [[refracting telescope]]s consisted of a convex [[Objective (optics)|objective]] lens and a concave [[eyepiece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] improved on this design the following year and applied it to astronomy. In 1611, [[Johannes Kepler]] described how a far more useful telescope could be made with a convex objective lens and a convex eyepiece lens and by 1655 astronomers such as [[Christiaan Huygens]] were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of the telescope'' Henry C. King, Harold Spencer Jones Publisher Courier Dover Publications {{ISBN|0-486-43265-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] is credited with building the first reflector in 1668 with a design that incorporated a small flat diagonal mirror to reflect the light to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope. [[Laurent Cassegrain]] in 1672 described the design of a reflector with a small convex secondary mirror to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

The [[achromatic lens]], which greatly reduced color aberrations in objective lenses and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes, first appeared in a 1733 telescope made by [[Chester Moore Hall]], who did not publicize it. [[John Dollond]] learned of Hall's invention&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, D. J.; '[https://books.google.com/books?id=97m3IxXmT-oC&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Optical anecdotes]', pp.40-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ray N.; '[https://books.google.com/books?id=PuN7l2A2uzQC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Reflecting Telescope Optics: Basic design theory and its historical development]', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities, starting in 1758.

Important developments in reflecting telescopes were [[John Hadley]]'s production of larger [[paraboloid]]al mirrors in 1721; the process of [[silvering]] glass mirrors introduced by [[Léon Foucault]] in 1857;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/inventorbios/39/Jean-Bernard-L-on-Foucault.html |title=Inventor Biographies – Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault Biography (1819–1868) |publisher=madehow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the adoption of long-lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/astronomy/features/amateur/files/p28-4.pdf |title=Bakich sample pages Chapter 2 |page=3 |quote=John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, was one of the first to coat a mirror with aluminum. He did it by thermal vacuum evaporation. The first mirror he aluminized, in 1932, is the earliest known example of a telescope mirror coated by this technique. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ritchey-Chretien]] variant of [[Cassegrain reflector]] was invented around 1910, but not widely adopted until after 1950; many modern telescopes including the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] use this design, which gives a wider field of view than a classic Cassegrain.

During the period 1850–1900, reflectors suffered from problems with speculum metal mirrors, and a considerable number of "Great Refractors" were built from 60&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 metre aperture, culminating in the [[Yerkes Observatory]] refractor in 1897; however, starting from the early 1900s a series of ever-larger reflectors with glass mirrors were built, including the Mount Wilson 60-inch (1.5 metre), the 100-inch (2.5 metre) [[Hooker Telescope]] (1917) and the 200-inch (5 metre) [[Hale telescope]] (1948); essentially all major research telescopes since 1900 have been reflectors. A number of 4-metre class (160 inch) telescopes were built on superior higher altitude sites including Hawaii and the Chilean desert in the 1975–1985 era. The development of the computer-controlled [[alt-azimuth mount]] in the 1970s and [[active optics]] in the 1980s enabled a new generation of even larger telescopes, starting with the 10-metre (400 inch) [[Keck telescopes]] in 1993/1996, and a number of 8-metre telescopes including the [[ESO]] [[Very Large Telescope]], [[Gemini Observatory]] and [[Subaru Telescope]].

The era of [[radio telescope]]s (along with [[radio astronomy]]) was born with [[Karl Guthe Jansky]]'s [[Serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery of an astronomical radio source in 1931. Many types of telescopes were developed in the 20th century for a wide range of wavelengths from radio to [[gamma-ray telescope|gamma-rays]].  The development of [[space observatories]] after 1960 allowed access
to several bands impossible to observe from the ground, including [[X-rays]] and longer wavelength [[infrared]] bands.

===Invention===
[[File:Lipperhey.jpg|thumb|left|Notes on Hans Lipperhey's unsuccessfully requested a patent on the telescope in 1608]]

The first record of a telescope comes from the Netherlands in 1608. It is in a patent filed by [[Middelburg]] spectacle-maker [[Hans Lippershey]] with the [[States General of the Netherlands]] on 2 October 1608 for his instrument "''for seeing things far away as if they were nearby''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bo.astro.it/dip/Museum/english/can_int.html Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna - TELESCOPES]&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later another Dutch instrument-maker, [[Jacob Metius]] also applied for a patent. The States General did not award a patent since the knowledge of the device already seemed to be ubiquitous&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bo.astro.it/dip/Museum/english/can_int.html Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna - TELESCOPES "''The request however was turned down, also because other spectacle-makers had made similar claims at the same time''."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"The Hague discussed the patent applications first of Hans Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar... another citizen of Middelburg'' [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope''' by Al Van Helden]&lt;/ref&gt; but the Dutch [[government]] awarded Lippershey with a contract for copies of his [[design]].

The original Dutch telescopes were composed of a [[Biconcave|convex]] and a [[Biconcave lens|concave lens]]—telescopes that are constructed this way do not invert the image. Lippershey's original design had only 3x [[magnification]]. Telescopes seem to have been made in the Netherlands in considerable numbers soon after this date of "invention", and rapidly found their way all over Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==== Claims of prior invention ====
[[File:Jaansen Microscope.jpg|thumbnail|right|Reproduction of one of the four optical devices that Zacharias Snijder in 1841 claimed were early telescopes built by [[Zacharias Janssen]]. Its actual function and creator has been disputed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch biologist and naturalist [[Pieter Harting]] claimed in 1858 that this shorter tube was an early microscope which he also attributed to Janssen, perpetuating the ''Janssen'' claim to both devices.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Telescope p.32-36"/&gt;]]

In 1655 Dutch diplomat [[Willem Boreel|William de Boreel]] tried to solve the mystery of who invented the telescope. He had a local magistrate in Middelburg follow up on Boreel's childhood and early adult recollections of a spectacle maker named "Hans" who he remembered as the inventor of the telescope. The magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, who testified that his father, [[Zacharias Janssen]] invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590. This testimony seemed convincing to Boreel, who now recollected that Zacharias and his father, Hans Martens, must have been who he remembered.&lt;ref name="HeldenDupré2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boreel's conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope a little ahead of another spectacle maker, [[Hans Lippershey]], was adopted by [[Pierre Borel]] in his 1656 book ''De vero telescopii inventore''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Henry C.

In 1682,&lt;ref&gt;July 26, 1682&lt;/ref&gt; the minutes of the [[Royal Society]] in London [[Robert Hooke]] noted [[Thomas Digges]]' 1571 ''Pantometria'', (a book on measurement, partially based on his father [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]' notes and observations) seemed to support an English claim to the invention of the telescope, describing Leonard as having a ''fare seeing glass'' in the mid 1500s based on an idea by [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter D.

A 1959 research paper by Simon de Guilleuma claimed that evidence he had uncovered pointed to the French born spectacle maker [[Juan Roget]] (died before 1624) as another possible builder of an early telescope that predated Hans Lipperhey's patent application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7617426.stm|title=Controversy over telescope origin|publisher=BBC News|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; inventing early telescope-like devices.

==== Spread through Europe ====
Lippershey's application for a patent was mentioned at the end of a diplomatic report on an embassy to Holland from the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] sent by the Siamese king [[Ekathotsarot]]: ''Ambassades du Roy de Siam envoyé à l'Excellence du Prince Maurice, arrivé à La Haye le 10 Septemb. 1608'' (''Embassy of the King of Siam sent to his Excellency Prince Maurice, arrived at The Hague on 10 September 1608''). This report was issued in October 1608 and distributed across Europe, leading to experiments by other scientists, such as the Italian [[Paolo Sarpi]], who received the report in November, and the English mathematician and astronomer [[Thomas Harriot]], who used a six-powered telescope by the summer of 1609 to observe features on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aol.com/article/old-moon-map-corrects-history/307394 |title=Old Moon Map Corrects History |publisher=News.aol.com |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119004546/http://news.aol.com/article/old-moon-map-corrects-history/307394 |archivedate=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galileo Donato.jpg|thumb|left|200px|19th-century painting depicting [[Galileo Galilei]] displaying his [[telescope]] to [[Leonardo Donato]] in 1609.]]

The Italian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] was in [[Venice]] in June 1609&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OwOlRPbrZeQC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=Galileo++happened+to+be+in+Venice+Dutch+telescope |title=Galileo at Work |author=Stillman Drake |page=137 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-02-20 |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-0-486-49542-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there heard of the "Dutch perspective glass" by means of which distant objects appeared nearer and larger. Galileo states that he solved the problem of the construction of a telescope the first night after his return to [[Padua]] from Venice and made his first telescope the next day by fitting a convex lens in one extremity of a leaden tube and a concave lens in the other one. A few days afterwards, having succeeded in making a better telescope than the first, he took it to Venice where he communicated the details of his invention to the public and presented the instrument itself to the [[Doge of Venice|doge]] [[Leonardo Donato]], who was sitting in full council. The [[senate]] in return settled him for life in his lectureship at Padua and doubled his salary.

[[File:Galileo-picture.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Galileo Galilei]].]]

Galileo spent his time to improving the telescope, producing telescopes of increased power. His first telescope had a 3x magnification, but he soon made instruments which magnified 8x and finally, one nearly a meter long with a 37mm objective (which he would stop down to 16mm or 12mm) and a 23x magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Quinn, Stargazing with Early Astronomer Galileo Galilei, Sky &amp; Telescope, July 31, 2008 [http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/stargazing-with-galileo/]&lt;/ref&gt; With this last instrument he began a series of astronomical observations in October or November 1609, discovering the [[Galilean moon|satellites]] of [[Jupiter]], hills and valleys on the [[Moon]], the phases of [[Venus]]&lt;ref name=palmieri&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmieri |first1=Paolo |title=Galileo and the discovery of the phases of Venus |journal=[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]] |date=2001 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=109–129 |bibcode=2001JHA....32..109P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observed [[sunspot|spots on the sun]] (using the projection method rather than direct observation). Galileo noted that the revolution of the satellites of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, rotation of the [[Sun]] and the tilted path its spots followed for part of the year pointed to the validity of the sun-centered [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] over other [[Geocentric model|Earth-centered systems]] such as the one proposed by [[Ptolemy]]. Galileo's instrument was the first to be given the name "telescope". The name was invented by the Greek poet/theologian [[Giovanni Demisiani]] at a banquet held on April 14, 1611 by Prince [[Federico Cesi]] to make [[Galileo Galilei]] a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Edward, ''The Naming of the Telescope'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; The word was created from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tele'' = 'far' and ''skopein'' = 'to look or see'; ''teleskopos'' = 'far-seeing'.

These observations, together with Galileo's improvement of the instrument, led to the adoption of the name of the [[Galilean telescope]] for these early forms of telescope that employed a [[negative lens]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;This paragraph is adapted from the 1888 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further refinements ===
==== Refracting telescopes ====
[[Johannes Kepler]] first explained the theory and some of the practical advantages of a telescope constructed of two convex lenses in his ''Catoptrics'' (1611). The first person who actually constructed a telescope of this form was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Christoph Scheiner]] who gives a description of it in his ''Rosa Ursina'' (1630).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

[[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] was the first who commanded a chief advantage of the form of telescope suggested by Kepler: that a small material object could be placed at the common [[focal plane]] of the objective and the eyepiece. This led to his invention of the [[micrometer]], and his application of telescopic sights to precision astronomical instruments. It was not till about the middle of the 17th century that Kepler's telescope came into general use: not so much because of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but because its [[field of view]] was much larger than in the [[Galilean telescope]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The first powerful telescopes of Keplerian construction were made by [[Christiaan Huygens]] after much labor—in which his brother assisted him. With one of these: an objective diameter of {{convert|2.24|in|mm}} and a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} focal length,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/bigtel/LargestTelescope.html |title=Largest optical telescopes of the world |author=Paul Schlyter |publisher=Stjarnhimlen.se |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discovered the brightest of Saturn's satellites ([[Titan (moon)|Titan]]) in 1655; in 1659, he published his "''Systema Saturnium''" which, for the first time, gave a true explanation of Saturn's [[planetary ring|ring]]—founded on observations made with the same instrument.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===== Long focal length refractors =====
[[File:Houghton Typ 620.73.451 - Johannes Hevelius, Machinae coelestis, 1673.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut illustration of a {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} focal length Keplerian astronomical refracting telescope built by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. From his book, "''Machina coelestis''" (first part), published in 1673.]]

The [[sharpness (visual)|sharpness]] of the image in Kepler's telescope was limited by the [[chromatic aberration]] introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of the objective lens. The only way to overcome this limitation at high magnifying powers was to create objectives with very long focal lengths. [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]] discovered [[Saturn's]] fifth satellite ([[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]]) in 1672 with a telescope {{convert|35|ft|m}} long. Astronomers such as [[Johannes Hevelius]] were constructing telescopes with focal lengths as long as {{convert|150|ft|m}}. Besides having really long tubes these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's frame "tube" flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.&lt;ref name="AIP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartage"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Astronomy/Equipementdevices/Telescope/Historyoftelescope/howtelescopeimproved/howtelescopeimproved.htm |publisher=Cartage |work=History of Telescopes |title=How Telescopes Improved |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311032203/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Astronomy/Equipementdevices/Telescope/Historyoftelescope/howtelescopeimproved/howtelescopeimproved.htm |archivedate=2009-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Aerial telescopes =====
{{Main|Aerial telescope}}
In some of the very long refracting telescopes constructed after 1675, no tube was employed at all. The objective was mounted on a swiveling ball-joint on top of a pole, tree, or any available tall structure and aimed by means of string or connecting rod. The eyepiece was handheld or mounted on a stand at the focus, and the image was found by trial and error. These were consequently termed [[aerial telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga/astronomyclubaugusta/History/telescope.html |title=The Telescope |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been attributed to [[Christiaan Huygens]] and his brother [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/tools/tools-first-telescopes.htm | work = Cosmic Journey: A History of Scientific Cosmology | title = The First Telescopes | publisher = Center for History of Physics, a Division of the American Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Christiaan+Huygens+Aerial+telescope | title = The history of the telescope | first = Henry C. | last = King | year = 2003 | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | isbn = 978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not clear that they invented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://archive.org/stream/christianhuygens029504mbp/christianhuygens029504mbp_djvu.txt | first = A.

Telescopes of such great length were naturally difficult to use and must have taxed to the utmost the skill and patience of the observers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Aerial telescopes were employed by several other astronomers. Cassini discovered Saturn's third and fourth satellites in 1684 with aerial telescope objectives made by [[Giuseppe Campani]] that were {{convert|100|and|136|ft|m|abbr=on}} in focal length.

==== Reflecting telescopes ====
{{See also|Reflecting telescope}}

The ability of a [[curved mirror]] to form an image may have been known since the time of [[Euclid]]&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Euclid'' by J. B. Calvert, 2000 [http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/classics/nugreek/contents.htm Duke U.] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and had been extensively studied by [[Alhazen]] in the 11th century. Galileo, [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo]], and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins#PPA108,M1 |title=Stargazer |author=Fred Watson |page=108 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-1-74176-392-8 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Zucchi]], an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book ''Optica philosophia'' of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Niccol%C3%B2+Zucchi#PPA109,M1 |title=Stargazer |author=Fred Watson |page=109 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-1-74176-392-8 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanature1873 telescope gregory.png|thumb|left|350px|Light path in a [[Gregorian telescope]].]]

In 1636 [[Marin Mersenne]] proposed a telescope consisting of a paraboloidal primary mirror and a paraboloidal secondary mirror bouncing the image through a hole in the primary, solving the problem of viewing the image.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4-GErgSbU0C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Marin+Mersenne+reflecting+telescope&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GGocBEbf9P&amp;sig=Bmk8GLC46HdSoeYKq6wyz3jaoZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA88,M1] ''[[Mirror Mirror: A History of the Human Love Affair With Reflection]]'' by [[Mark Pendergrast]] Page 88&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] went into further detail in his book ''Optica Promota'' (1663), pointing out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was shaped like the part of a [[conic section]], would correct [[spherical aberration]] as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refractors. The design he came up with bears his name: the "[[Gregorian telescope]]"; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of realizing his ideas and after some fruitless attempts, was obliged to abandon all hope of bringing his telescope into practical use.

[[File:LaNature1873 coupe telescope foucault.png|thumb|right|350px|Light path in a [[Newtonian telescope]].]]

[[File:NewtonsTelescopeReplica.jpg|thumb|A replica of Newton's second reflecting telescope which was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in 1672.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;dq=history+of+the+telescope&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA74,M1 |title=The History of the Telescope |author=Henry C.

In 1666 [[Isaac Newton]], based on his theories of refraction and color, perceived that the faults of the refracting telescope were due more to a lens's varying refraction of light of different colors than to a lens's imperfect shape. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations, although he incorrectly concluded from some rough experiments&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''Optics'', bk. i. pt. ii. prop. 3&lt;/ref&gt; that ''all'' refracting substances would diverge the prismatic colors in a constant proportion to their mean refraction. From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on Optics'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's experiments with mirrors showed that they did not suffer from the chromatic errors of lenses, for all colors of light the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] reflected in a mirror was equal to the [[angle of reflection]], so as a proof to his theories Newton set out to build a reflecting telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=Isaac+Newton+demonstration+reflecting+telescope+in#PPA168,M1 |title=Isaac Newton By Michael White |page=170 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-0-7382-0143-6 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton completed his [[Newton's Reflector|first telescope]] in 1668 and it is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.&lt;ref name="mymathdone.com"&gt;[http://www.mymathdone.com/isaac-newton-adventurer-in-thought/ '''Isaac Newton: adventurer in thought''', by Alfred Rupert Hall, page 67]&lt;/ref&gt;  After much experiment, he chose an [[alloy]] ([[speculum metal]]) of [[tin]] and [[copper]] as the most suitable material for his [[Objective (optics)|objective]]  mirror. He later devised means for grinding and polishing them, but chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a "''Newtonian telescope''", a secondary "diagonal" mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an [[eyepiece]] mounted on the side of the telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the tube, [[Telescope mount|mount]], and fittings. Newton's first compact reflecting telescope had a mirror diameter of 1.3&amp;nbsp;inches and a [[F-number#Focal ratio in telescopes|focal ratio]] of f/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telescope-optics.net/reflecting.htm |title=Reflecting telescopes: Newtonian, two- and three-mirror systems |publisher=Telescope-optics.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With it he found that he could see the four [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] and the [[Venus#Observation|crescent phase of the planet Venus]]. Encouraged by this success, he made a second telescope with a magnifying power of 38x which he presented to the [[Royal Society of London]] in December 1672. This type of telescope is still called a [[Newtonian telescope]].

[[File:Lanature1873 telescope cassegrain.png|thumb|left|350px|Light path in a [[Cassegrain telescope]].]]

A third form of reflecting telescope, the "[[Cassegrain reflector]]" was devised in 1672 by [[Laurent Cassegrain]]. The telescope had a small convex [[hyperboloid]]al secondary mirror placed near the prime focus to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

No further practical advance appears to have been made in the design or construction of the reflecting telescopes for another 50 years until [[John Hadley]] (best known as the inventor of the [[octant (instrument)|octant]]) developed ways to make precision aspheric and [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] speculum metal mirrors. In 1721 he showed the first parabolic Newtonian reflector to the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/explorations//groundup/lesson/scopes/hadley/index.php |title=Hadley’s Reflector |publisher=amazing-space.stsci.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter, {{convert|62+3/4|in|cm|adj=on}} focal length speculum metal objective mirror. The instrument was examined by [[James Pound]] and [[James Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;Pound reported upon it in ''Phil. Trans.'', 1723, No. 378, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; After remarking that Newton's telescope had lain neglected for fifty years, they stated that Hadley had sufficiently shown that the invention did not consist in bare theory. They compared its performance with that of a {{convert|7.5|in|mm}} diameter aerial telescope originally presented to the Royal Society by Constantijn Huygens, Jr. and found that Hadley's reflector, "will bear such a charge as to make it magnify the object as many times as the latter with its due charge", and that it represents objects as distinct, though not altogether so clear and bright.

Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]], having been instructed by Hadley in his methods of polishing speculum metal, succeeded in producing large reflecting telescopes of their own, one of which had a focal length of {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}}. These methods of fabricating mirrors were passed on by Molyneux to two London opticians —Scarlet and Hearn— who started a business manufacturing telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert, ''Compleat system of opticks in four books'', bk, iii. ch. I. (Cambridge, 1738)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British mathematician, optician [[James Short (mathematician)|James Short]] began experimenting with building telescopes based on Gregory's designs in the 1730s. He first tried making his mirrors out of glass as suggested by Gregory, but he later switched to speculum metal mirrors creating Gregorian telescopes with original designers [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] and [[elliptic]] figures. Short then adopted telescope-making as his profession which he practised first in Edinburgh, and afterward in London. All Short's telescopes were of the Gregorian form. Short died in London in 1768, having made a considerable fortune selling telescopes.

Since speculum metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors greatly reduced the light that reached the eyepiece, several reflecting telescope designers tried to do away with them. In 1762 [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] presented a reflecting telescope before the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted at the front of the telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by [[William Herschel]].&lt;ref&gt;"On an optic pipe improvement" — Lomonosov M.V.

About the year 1774 William Herschel (then a teacher of music in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[England]]) began to occupy his leisure hours with the construction of reflector telescope mirrors, finally devoted himself entirely to their construction and use in astronomical research. In 1778, he selected a {{convert|6+1/4|in|cm|adj=on}} reflector mirror (the best of some 400 telescope mirrors which he had made) and with it, built a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} focal length telescope. Using this telescope, he made his early brilliant astronomical discoveries. In 1783, Herschel completed a reflector of approximately {{convert|18|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} focal length. He observed the heavens with this telescope for some twenty years, replacing the mirror several times. In 1789 Herschel finished building his largest reflecting telescope with a mirror of {{convert|49|in|cm}} and a focal length of {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}, (commonly known as his [[40-foot telescope]]) at his new home, at [[Observatory House]] in [[Slough]], England. To cut down on the light loss from the poor reflectivity of the speculum mirrors of that day, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This design has come to be called the [[Reflecting telescope#Reflecting telescope designs|Herschelian telescope]]. He discovered Saturn's sixth known moon, [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], the first night he used it (August 28, 1789), and on September 17, its seventh known moon, Mimas. This telescope was world's largest telescope for over 50 years. However, this large scope was difficult to handle and thus less used than his favorite 18.7-inch reflector.

In 1845 [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]] built his {{convert|72|in|cm|adj=on}} Newtonian reflector called the "[[Leviathan of Parsonstown]]" with which he discovered the spiral form of [[galaxies]].

All of these larger reflectors suffered from the poor reflectivity and fast tarnishing nature of their speculum metal mirrors. This meant they need more than one mirror per telescope since mirrors had to be frequently removed and re-polished. This was time consuming since the polishing process could change the curve of the mirror so it usually had to be "[[Figuring|re-figured]]" to the correct shape.

==== Achromatic refracting telescopes ====
{{See also|Achromatic lens}}
[[File:Achromat doublet en.svg|thumb|Light path through an [[achromatic lens]].]]

From the time of the invention of the first refracting telescopes it was generally supposed that chromatic errors seen in lenses simply arose from errors in the spherical figure of their surfaces. Opticians tried to construct lenses of varying forms of curvature to correct these errors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Isaac Newton discovered in 1666 that chromatic colors actually arose from the un-even refraction of light as it passed through the glass medium. This led opticians to experiment with lenses constructed of more than one type of glass in an attempt to canceling the errors produced by each type of glass. It was hoped that this would create an "[[achromatic lens]]"; a lens that would focus all colors to a single point, and produce instruments of much shorter focal length.

The first person who succeeded in making a practical achromatic refracting telescope was [[Chester Moore Hall]] from [[Essex, England]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He argued that the different humours of the human eye refract rays of light to produce an image on the [[retina]] which is free from color, and he reasonably argued that it might be possible to produce a like result by combining lenses composed of different refracting media. After devoting some time to the inquiry he found that by combining two lenses formed of different kinds of glass, he could make an achromatic lens where the effects of the unequal refractions of two colors of light (red and blue) was corrected. In 1733, he succeeded in constructing telescope lenses which exhibited much reduced [[chromatic aberration]]. One of his instruments had an objective measuring {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm}} with a relatively short focal length of {{convert|20|in|cm}}.

Hall was a man of independent means and seems to have been careless of fame; at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to [[John Dollond]] (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by [[Lord Mansfield]] that it was not the original inventor who ought to profit from such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.

In 1747, [[Leonhard Euler]] sent to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] a paper in which he tried to prove the possibility of correcting both the chromatic and the spherical aberration of a lens. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a perfect image, it should be possible by suitable combinations of lenses of different refracting media to construct a perfect telescope [[Objective (optics)|objective]]. Adopting a hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently colored rays of light, he proved analytically the possibility of constructing an achromatic objective composed of lenses of glass and water.

All of Euler's efforts to produce an actual objective of this construction were fruitless—a failure which he attributed solely to the difficulty of procuring lenses that worked precisely to the requisite curves.&lt;ref&gt;''Mem. Acad. Berlin'', 1753.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dollond]] agreed with the accuracy of Euler's analysis, but disputed his hypothesis on the grounds that it was purely a theoretical assumption: that the theory was opposed to the results of Newton's [[Scientific method|experiments]] on the refraction of light, and that it was impossible to determine a [[physical law]] from analytical reasoning alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Phil. Trans.'', 1753, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, Euler sent to the Berlin Academy a further paper in which starting from the hypothesis that light consists of vibrations excited in an elastic fluid by luminous bodies—and that the difference of color of light is due to the greater or lesser [[electromagnetic spectrum|frequency]] of these vibrations in a given time— he deduced his previous results. He did not doubt the accuracy of Newton's experiments quoted by Dollond.

Dollond did not reply to this, but soon afterwards he received an abstract of a paper by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] mathematician and astronomer, [[Samuel Klingenstierna]], which led him to doubt the accuracy of the results deduced by Newton on the dispersion of refracted light. Klingenstierna showed from purely geometrical considerations (fully appreciated by Dollond) that the results of Newton's experiments could not be brought into harmony with other universally accepted facts of refraction.

[[File:Göttingen-Dollond-Teleskop.JPG|thumb|right|Dollond telescope.]]

As a practical man, Dollond at once put his doubts to the test of experiment: he confirmed the conclusions of Klingenstierna, discovered a difference far beyond his hopes in the refractive qualities of different kinds of glass with respect to the [[refraction|divergence]] of colors, and was thus rapidly led to the construction of lenses in which first the chromatic aberration—and afterwards—the spherical aberration were corrected.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''Phil. Trans.'', 1758, p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

Dollond was aware of the conditions necessary for the attainment of achromatism in refracting telescopes, but relied on the accuracy of experiments made by Newton. His writings show that with the exception of his [[Courage|bravado]], he would have arrived sooner at a discovery for which his mind was fully prepared. Dollond's paper&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; recounts the successive steps by which he arrived at his discovery independently of Hall's earlier invention—and the logical processes by which these steps were suggested to his mind.

In 1765 Peter Dollond (son of John Dollond) introduced the triple objective, which consisted of a combination of two convex lenses of crown glass with a concave [[Flint glass|flint]] lens between them. He made many telescopes of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The difficulty of procuring disks of glass (especially of flint glass) of suitable purity and homogeneity limited the diameter and light gathering power of the lenses found in the achromatic telescope. It was in vain that the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered prizes for large perfect disks of optical flint glass.

The difficulties with the impractical metal mirrors of reflecting telescopes led to the construction of large refracting telescopes. By 1866 refracting telescopes had reached {{convert|18|in|cm}} in aperture with many larger "''[[Great refractor]]s''" being built in the mid to late 19th century. In 1897, the refractor reached its maximum practical limit in a research telescope with the construction of the [[Yerkes Observatory]]s' {{convert|40|in|cm|adj=on}} refractor (although a larger refractor [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]] with an objective of {{convert|49.2|in|m}} diameter was temporarily exhibited at the [[Paris 1900 Exposition]]). No larger refractors could be built because of [[gravity]]'s effect on the lens. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens will sag due to gravity, distorting the image it produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OJclbOHqrD0C&amp;pg=PT532&amp;lpg=PT532&amp;dq=the+largest+telescope+lens+sag |title=Physics Demystified |author=Stan Gibilisco |isbn=0-07-138201-1 |page=515 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2002-08-01|accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large reflecting telescopes ===
{{See also|List of largest optical telescopes historically}}
[[File:Palomar arp 600pix.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|200|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hale telescope]] at [[Palomar Observatory|Mount Palomar]]]]

In 1856–57, [[Karl August von Steinheil]] and [[Léon Foucault]] introduced a process of depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors. The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on speculum mirrors, it had the advantage of being able to be removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate. Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on glass mirror reflecting telescopes were built.

The beginning of the 20th century saw construction of the first of the "modern" large research reflectors, designed for precision photographic imaging and located at remote high altitude clear sky locations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtwilson.edu/Simmons3.php |title=Building the 60-inch Telescope |author=Mike Simmons |origyear=Written in 1984 |date=2008&lt;!--Updated in--&gt; |publisher=Mtwilson.edu |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805001558/http://www.mtwilson.edu/Simmons3.php |archivedate=2013-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[60-inch Hale telescope]] of 1908, and the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] in 1917, both located at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode=1956ASPL....7..249P |title=Pettit, E., Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets, Vol. 7 |journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets |volume=7 |page=249 |publisher=Articles.adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |author1=Pettit |first1=Edison |year=1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other telescopes of this size had to have provisions to allow for the removal of their main mirrors for re-silvering every few months. John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the [[California Institute of Technology]], developed a technique for coating a mirror with a much longer lasting aluminum coating using thermal [[vacuum evaporation]]. In 1932, he became the first person to "aluminize" a mirror; three years later the {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|100|in|mm|adj=on}} telescopes became the first large astronomical telescopes to have their mirrors aluminized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/news/2001/10aug03.html |title=New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology - "Resurfacing the {{convert|100|in|mm|adj=on}} Telescope" by George Zamora |publisher=nmt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013030537/http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/news/2001/10aug03.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1948 saw the completion of the {{convert|200|in|cm|adj=on}} [[Hale telescope|Hale reflector]] at [[Palomar Observatory|Mount Palomar]] which was the largest telescope in the world up until the completion of the massive {{convert|605|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[BTA-6]] in Russia twenty-seven years later. The Hale reflector introduced several technical innovations used in future telescopes, including [[hydrostatic bearings]] for very low friction, the [[Serrurier truss]] for equal deflections of the two mirrors as the tube sags under gravity, and the use of [[Pyrex]] low-expansion glass for the mirrors. The arrival of substantially larger telescopes had to await the introduction of methods other than the rigidity of glass to maintain the proper shape of the mirror.

==== Active and adaptive optics ====
{{See also|Adaptive optics|List of largest optical reflecting telescopes}}

The 1980s saw the introduction of two new technologies for building larger telescopes and improving image quality,
known as [[active optics]] and [[adaptive optics]]. In active optics, an image analyser senses the aberrations of a star image
a few times per minute, and a computer adjusts many support forces on the primary mirror and the location of the secondary mirror
to maintain the optics in optimal shape and alignment. This is too slow to correct for atmospheric blurring effects, but enables the use of thin single mirrors up to 8&amp;nbsp;m diameter, or even larger segmented mirrors. This method was pioneered by the ESO [[New Technology Telescope]] in the late 1980s.

The 1990s saw a new generation of giant telescopes appear using active optics, beginning with the construction of the first of the two {{convert|10|m|in|abbr=on}} [[Keck telescope]]s in 1993. Other giant telescopes built since then include: the two [[Gemini telescope]]s, the four separate telescopes of the [[Very Large Telescope]], and the [[Large Binocular Telescope]].

[[File:ESO Very Large Telescope.jpg|thumb|[[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] boasts advanced [[adaptive optics]] systems, which counteract the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere.]]

Adaptive optics uses a similar principle, but applying corrections several hundred times per second to
compensate the effects of rapidly changing optical distortion due to the motion of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and then compensating for them by rapid changes of [[actuator]]s applied to a small deformable mirror or with a [[liquid crystal]] array filter. AO was first envisioned by [[Horace W. Babcock]] in 1953, but did not come into common usage in astronomical telescopes until advances in computer and detector technology during the 1990s made it possible to calculate the compensation needed in [[Real-time computing|real time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Telescopes Have Grown from Huge to Humongous [Slide Show]|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/telescopes-have-grown-from-huge-to-humongous-slide-show/|website = www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adaptive optics, the high-speed corrections needed mean that a fairly bright star is needed very close to the target of interest (or an artificial star is created by a laser). Also, with a single star or laser the corrections are only effective over a very narrow field (tens of arcsec), and current systems operating on several 8-10m telescopes work mainly in near-infrared wavelengths for single-object observations.

Developments of adaptive optics include systems with multiple lasers over a wider corrected field, and/or working above kiloHertz rates for good correction at visible wavelengths; these are currently in progress but not yet in routine operation as of 2015.

== Other wavelengths ==
The twentieth century saw the construction of telescopes which could produce images using wavelengths other than [[visible light]] starting in 1931 when [[Karl Jansky]] discovered astronomical objects gave off radio emissions; this prompted a new era of observational astronomy after World War II, with telescopes being developed for other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from radio to [[gamma-rays]].

=== Radio telescopes ===
{{See also|Radio telescope|Radio astronomy}}
[[File:Lovell Telescope 2.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} Lovell radio telescope at [[Jodrell Bank]] Observatory.]]

Radio astronomy began in 1931 when [[Karl Jansky]] discovered that the [[Milky Way]] was a source of radio emission while doing research on terrestrial static with a direction antenna. Building on Jansky's work, [[Grote Reber]] built a more sophisticated purpose-built radio telescope in 1937, with a {{convert|31.4|ft|m|adj=on}} dish; using this, he discovered various unexplained radio sources in the sky. Interest in radio astronomy grew after the Second World War when much larger dishes were built including: the {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Jodrell bank]] telescope (1957), the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Green Bank Telescope]] (1962), and the {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Effelsberg]] telescope (1971). The huge {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Arecibo telescope]] (1963) is so large that it is fixed into a natural depression in the ground; the central antenna can be steered to allow the telescope to study objects up to twenty degrees from the [[zenith]]. However, not every radio telescope is of the dish type. For example, the [[Mills Cross Telescope]] (1954) was an early example of an array which used two perpendicular lines of antennae {{convert|1500|ft|m}} in length to survey the sky.

High-energy radio waves are known as [[microwaves]] and this has been an important area of astronomy ever since the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964. Many ground-based [[radio telescopes]] can study microwaves. Short wavelength microwaves are best studied from space because water vapor (even at high altitudes) strongly weakens the signal. The [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (1989) revolutionized the study of the microwave background radiation.

Because radio telescopes have low resolution, they were the first instruments to use [[interferometry]] allowing two or more widely separated instruments to simultaneously observe the same source. [[Very long baseline interferometry]] extended the technique over thousands of kilometers and allowed resolutions down to a few [[arcseconds|milli-arcseconds]].

A telescope like the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] (active since 2006) observes from {{convert|0.85|to|4|mm|um|abbr=on}}, bridging between the far-infrared/[[submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter telescopes]] and longer wavelength radio telescopes including the microwave band from about {{convert|1|mm|um|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1000|mm|m|abbr=on}} in wavelength.

=== Infrared telescopes (700 nm/ 0.7 µm – 1000 µm/1 mm) ===
{{See also|Infrared telescope|Infrared astronomy|Far-infrared astronomy}}
Although most [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, infrared astronomy at certain wavelengths can be conducted on high mountains where there is little absorption by atmospheric [[water vapor]]. Ever since suitable detectors became available, most optical telescopes at high-altitudes have been able to image at infrared wavelengths. Some telescopes such as the {{convert|3.8|m|in|adj=on}} [[UKIRT]], and the {{convert|3|m|in|adj=on}} [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility|IRTF]] — both on [[Mauna Kea]] — are dedicated infrared telescopes. The launch of the [[IRAS]] satellite in 1983 revolutionized infrared astronomy from space. This reflecting telescope which had a {{convert|60|cm|in|adj=on}} mirror, operated for nine months until its supply of coolant ([[liquid helium]]) ran out. It surveyed the entire sky detecting 245,000 infrared sources—more than 100 times the number previously known.

=== Ultra-violet telescopes (10 nm – 400 nm) ===
{{See also|Ultraviolet astronomy}}
Although optical telescopes can image the near ultraviolet, the [[ozone layer]] in the [[stratosphere]] absorbs [[ultraviolet]] radiation shorter than 300&amp;nbsp;nm so most ultra-violet astronomy is conducted with satellites. Ultraviolet telescopes resemble optical telescopes, but conventional [[aluminium]]-coated mirrors cannot be used and alternative coatings such as [[magnesium fluoride]] or [[lithium fluoride]] are used instead. The [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] satellite carried out observations in the ultra-violet as early as 1962. The [[International Ultraviolet Explorer]] (1978) systematically surveyed the sky for eighteen years, using a {{convert|45|cm|in|adj=on}} aperture telescope with two [[spectroscope]]s. Extreme-ultraviolet astronomy (10–100&amp;nbsp;nm) is a discipline in its own right and involves many of the techniques of X-ray astronomy; the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer]] (1992) was a satellite operating at these wavelengths.

=== X-ray telescopes (0.01 nm – 10 nm) ===
{{See also|X-ray telescope|X-ray astronomy}}
[[X-rays]] from space do not reach the Earth's surface so X-ray astronomy has to be conducted above the Earth's atmosphere. The first X-ray experiments were conducted on [[sub-orbital]] [[rocket]] flights which enabled the first detection of X-rays from the [[Sun]] (1948) and the first galactic X-ray sources: [[Scorpius X-1]] (June 1962) and the [[Crab Nebula]] (October 1962). Since then, X-ray telescopes ([[Wolter telescope]]s) have been built using nested grazing-incidence mirrors which deflect X-rays to a detector. Some of the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory|OAO satellites]] conducted X-ray astronomy in the late 1960s, but the first dedicated X-ray satellite was the [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] (1970) which discovered 300 sources. More recent X-ray satellites include: the [[EXOSAT]] (1983), [[ROSAT]] (1990), [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] (1999), and [[XMM-Newton|Newton]] (1999).

=== Gamma-ray telescopes (less than 0.01 nm) ===
{{See also|Gamma-ray astronomy}}
[[Gamma rays]] are absorbed high in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] so most gamma-ray astronomy is conducted with [[satellites]]. Gamma-ray telescopes use [[scintillation counters]], [[spark chamber]]s and more recently, [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] detectors. The angular resolution of these devices is typically very poor. There were [[balloon]]-borne experiments in the early 1960s, but gamma-ray astronomy really began with the launch of the [[OSO 3]] satellite in 1967; the first dedicated gamma-ray satellites were [[Second Small Astronomy Satellite|SAS B]] (1972) and [[Cos-B|Cos B]] (1975). The [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (1991) was a big improvement on previous surveys. Very high-energy gamma-rays (above 200&amp;nbsp;GeV) can be detected from the ground via the [[Cerenkov radiation]] produced by the passage of the gamma-rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Several Cerenkov imaging telescopes have been built around the world including: the [[HEGRA]] (1987), [[STACEE]] (2001), [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|HESS]] (2003), and [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]] (2004).

== Interferometric telescopes ==
{{See also|Astronomical interferometry}}

In 1868, [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] noted that the purpose of the arrangement of mirrors or glass lenses in a conventional telescope was simply to provide an approximation to a [[Fourier transform]] of the optical wave field entering the telescope. As this mathematical transformation was well understood and could be performed mathematically on paper, he noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array— a technique which later became known as [[astronomical interferometry]]. It was not until 1891 that [[Albert A. Michelson]] successfully used this technique for the measurement of astronomical angular diameters: the diameters of Jupiter's satellites (Michelson 1891). Thirty years later, a direct interferometric measurement of a stellar diameter was finally realized by Michelson &amp; [[Francis G. Pease]] (1921) which was applied by their 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6.1 m) interferometer mounted on the [[Hooker telescope|100 inch Hooker Telescope]] on Mount Wilson.

The next major development came in 1946 when [[Martin Ryle|Ryle]] and Vonberg (Ryle and Vonberg 1946) located a number of new cosmic radio sources by constructing a radio analogue of the [[Michelson interferometer]]. The signals from two radio antennas were added electronically to produce interference. Ryle and Vonberg's telescope used the rotation of the Earth to scan the sky in one dimension. With the development of larger arrays and of computers which could rapidly perform the necessary Fourier transforms, the first [[aperture synthesis]] imaging instruments were soon developed which could obtain high resolution images without the need of a giant parabolic reflector to perform the Fourier transform. This technique is now used in most radio astronomy observations. Radio astronomers soon developed the [[closure phase|mathematical methods]] to perform [[aperture synthesis]] Fourier imaging using much larger arrays of telescopes —often spread across more than one continent. In the 1980s, the [[aperture synthesis]] technique was extended to visible light as well as infrared astronomy, providing the first very high resolution optical and infrared images of nearby stars.

In 1995 this imaging technique was demonstrated on [[Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope (COAST)|an array of separate optical telescopes]] for the first time, allowing a further improvement in resolution, and also allowing even higher resolution [https://web.archive.org/web/19971021083400/http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/telescopes/coast/astronomy.html#supergiants02-04 imaging of stellar surfaces]. The same techniques have now been applied at a number of other astronomical telescope arrays including: the [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer]], the [[CHARA array]], and the [[Infrared Optical Telescope Array|IOTA]] array. A detailed description of the development of astronomical optical interferometry can be found here [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/2309/page1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:32:14].

In 2008, [[Max Tegmark]] and [[Matias Zaldarriaga]] proposed a "[[Fast Fourier Transform Telescope]]" design in which the lenses and mirrors could be dispensed with altogether when computers become fast enough to perform all the necessary transforms.

Research done by Dr. [[Katey Walter]] (second from right) found that melting [[permafrost]] will release [[methane]], one of the most potent [[greenhouse gases]].]]
The '''International Arctic Research Center''', or '''IARC''', established in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/about/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; is a research institution focused on integrating and coordinating study of [[Climate change in the Arctic]]. The primary partners in IARC are [[Japan]] and the [[United States]]. Participants include organizations from [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], Japan, [[Norway]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the United States.

==Overview==
The Center is located at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], in the [[Syun-Ichi Akasofu]] Building. The '''Keith B. Mather Library''' is the science library housed in the Akasofu Building, serving IARC and the [[Geophysical Institute]] of UAF. The building also houses the UAF atmospheric sciences department, the Center for Global Change and the Fairbanks forecast office of the [[National Weather Service]].

Study projects are focused within four major themes:
* Arctic [[ocean]] models and observation
* Arctic [[atmosphere]]: feedbacks, [[radiation]], and [[weather]] analysis
* [[Permafrost]]/Frozen soil models and observations
* Arctic [[biota (ecology)|biota]]/[[vegetation]] ([[ecosystem model]]s)

IARC is devoting specific effort to answering the following three questions:
#To what extent is climate change due to natural vs man-made causes? 
#What parameters, processes and interactions are needed to understand and predict future climate change? 
#What are the likely impacts of climate change?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14632">'''Knud Jeppesen''' (15 August 1892 in [[Copenhagen]] – 14 June 1974 in [[Risskov]]) was a Danish [[musicologist]], [[composer]], and writer on the [[music history|history of music]].

==Biography==
Jeppesen demonstrated early musical talent at age 10 when he was first encouraged by [[Hakon Andersen]] and [[Paul Hellmuth]], although he was largely self-taught. Completing primary education in 1911, he first worked in Elbing and Liegnitz (Eastern Germany) as an opera coach and conductor. He found employment in Berlin in 1914, but returned to Denmark because of the outbreak of war. In Copenhagen he became a pupil of prominent Danish composers [[Carl Nielsen]] and [[Thomas Laub]], and studied musicology at Copenhagen University with Angul Hammerich. He passed the organist exam at the Royal Danish Conservatory of music in 1916. Owing to Hammerich's retirement, there was nobody on the faculty of the university to examine Jeppesen's work; therefore, he submitted his dissertation to the University of Vienna, where it was reviewed by [[Guido Adler]] and Jeppesen was awarded a doctorate in 1922.

He was organist at Copenhagen's [[Ludvig Knudsen|St. Stephens church]] from 1917 to 1932 and at the [[Church of Holmen|Holmen church]] from 1932 to 1947.&lt;ref name=GroveOnline&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergsagel|first=John|title=Jeppesen, Knud|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/14267|work=[[Grove Music Online]]|publisher=Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught music theory at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] from 1920 to 1947, also serving on its board of directors. In 1946, he was appointed to the new post of professor of musicology at [[Aarhus University]], where he founded (in 1950) an Institute of Musicology which he directed until 1957.&lt;ref name=GroveOnline/&gt; His students included the composers [[Vagn Holmboe]] (in Copenhagen) and [[Bent Lorentzen]] (in Aaarhus).&lt;ref name="WhiteChristensen2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Jean |editor=White, John David|title=New Music of the Nordic Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyUOv6EQrWcC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=31 July 2013|year=2002|publisher=Pendragon Press|isbn=978-1-57647-019-0|pages=17, 61|chapter=New Music of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his retirement in 1957, Jeppesen resided in Italy, enabling him to make several discoveries in Italian libraries culminating in his magnum opus, ''La frottola'' (1968–70), a detailed study and bibliography of [[frottole]], the leading genre of Italian popular, secular songs in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. From 1927 until his death he was active in the International Musicological Society, serving as president from 1949 to 1952. He was also a member (from 1963) of the Italian [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knud Jeppesen|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/knud-jeppesen/|work=[[Enciclopedia Treccani]]|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musicology==
Jeppesen's name is invariably associated with the study of musical [[counterpoint]], particularly in the style of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], of whom he was the leading scholar of his day.&lt;ref name=GroveOnline/&gt; His 1930 work ''Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century'' has been a standard textbook since its appearance in German (1935) and English (1939), and remains in print today (the third and final edition remains untranslated). His doctoral thesis was expanded in 1923 and appeared in English in 1927 as ''The Style of Palestrina and the Dissonance'' – a work which [[Grove Music Online|''The New Grove'']] cites as being the "most distinguished and influential example of [[Musical analysis|stylistic analysis]] at this time".&lt;ref name=GroveOnline-Analysis&gt;{{cite web|last=Bent|first=Ian D|author2=Pople, Anthony |title=Analysis|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/41862pg2#S41862.2.4|work=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His published writings mostly regard music by Italian and Danish composers from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Jeppesen engaged in much primary research – locating early manuscript and print copies of old scores and preparing editions with annotations and commentary. In 1962 he finished the first complete thematic catalog of Palestrina's oeuvre. Among his accomplishments were the discovery of ten previously unknown masses by Palestrina in 1949.

==Music==
Jeppesen's early efforts at composition were poorly received and he turned away from composition in 1919, only to resume after a fifteen-year hiatus. He is known for well-crafted songs set to Danish texts, church music, and motets. He also wrote cantatas, organ music, and an opera, ''Rosaura,'' which was performed by the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] on September 20, 1950. He also made many contributions to Danish hymnology, and his ''Bygen flygter, Forunderligt så sødt et smil'' is a classic with Danish church choirs. His style incorporates his knowledge of early counterpoint but also the style of late Viennese romantics including [[Gustav Mahler]], to whom he was introduced by Guido Adler. From 1916 to 1931 Jeppesen was Nielsen's closest associate, and Jeppesen wrote several important articles about that composer.

'''Letter frequency effect''' - the effect of [[letter frequency]] according to which the frequency with which the letter is encountered influences the recognition time of a letter. Letters of high frequency show a significant advantage over letters of low frequency in letter naming,&lt;ref&gt;Cosky, M. J. (1976). The role of letter recognition in word recognition. Memory &amp; Cognition, 4 , 207-214.&lt;/ref&gt; same-different matching,&lt;ref&gt;Egeth, H., &amp; Blecker, D.  (1971). Differential effects of familiarity on judgments of sameness and difference.  Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 9 (4), 321-326.&lt;/ref&gt; and visual search.&lt;ref&gt;Latimer, C. R. (1972). Search time as a function of context letter frequency. Perception, 1 , 57-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Letters of high frequency are recognized faster than letters of low frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Miozo, Michele &amp; Bastiani, Pierluigi de (2002). The Organization of Letter-Form Representations in Written Spelling: Evidence from Acquired Dysgraphia. Brain and Language 80, 366–392&lt;/ref&gt; Appelman and Mayzner (1981) in their re-analysis of the studies concerning letter frequency effect have found that in 3 out of 6 studies using [[mental chronometry|reaction times]] (RTs) as a [[dependent variable]] the letter frequency correlated significantly with RTs.&lt;ref&gt;Appelman, I. B., &amp; Mayzner , M. S. (1981). The letter-frequency effect and the generality of familiarity effects on perception.Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 30, 436 – 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussion ==

Majority of studies on letter frequency effect failed to find a significant letter frequency effect.&lt;ref name="frequency"&gt;Boris, New &amp; Grainger, Johnatan (2011). On letter frequency effects. Acta Psychologica 138, 322 –328&lt;/ref&gt; These studies, however, used the [[same-different matching task]]&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt; in which the participants see two letters and are to respond if these letters are same or different.&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt; Therefore, the absence of letter frequency effect in these studies may be due to the participants using the visual form of a letter instead of a letter itself to match the letters.&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt;

'''Mimesis criticism''' is a method of interpreting texts in relation to their literary or cultural models. Mimesis, or '''imitation''' (''imitatio''), was a widely used rhetorical tool in antiquity up until the 18th century's [[Romanticism|romantic]] emphasis on originality. Mimesis criticism looks to identify [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] relationships between two texts that go beyond simple echoes, [[allusion]]s, [[citation]]s, or [[redaction]]s. The effects of imitation are usually manifested in the later text by means of distinct [[characterization]], [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and/or [[plot (narrative)|plot]] structure.

As a critical method, '''mimesis criticism''' has been pioneered by [[Dennis MacDonald]], especially in relation to [[New Testament]] and other early Christian narratives imitating the "canonical" works of [[Classics|Classical]] Greek literature.

==History==

===Aristotle===
Greek rhetorician [[Aristotle]] (4th century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}) discusses the rhetorical technique of mimesis or imitation; what Aristotle describes, however, is the author's imitation of nature, not earlier literary or cultural models.

===Philodemus===
[[Philodemus|Philodemus of Gadara]] (1st century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}), an [[Epicurean]] philosopher and poet and one of [[Virgil]]'s teachers, affirms that writers of prose histories and fictions used literary models. He writes (rhetorically) in book five of ''On Poetry'', "Who would claim that the writing of prose is not reliant on the Homeric poems?" (5.30.36-31.)

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
A Greek historian and rhetorician from the late first century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}/early first century {{smallcaps|c.e.}}, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] represents a change from the Aristotelian rhetorical notion of [[mimesis]], from imitation of nature to imitation of literature. His most important work in this respect, ''[[Dionysian imitatio|On Mimesis]]'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ μιμήσεως}}, ''Perì mimēseōs''), survives only in fragments. Apparently, most of this work concerned the proper selection of literary models.

===Quintilian===
Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian|M. Fabius Quintilianus]] published his twelve-volume [[Institutio Oratoria|''Institutio oratoria'']] around 95 {{smallcaps|c.e}}. In book 10, Quintilian - who was well-read with respect to both Greek and Latin rhetoricians, including [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] - gives advice to teachers who are instructing students in oration. He tells them that, by the time students begin composition, they should be so well-versed in exemplary models that are able to imitate them without physically consulting them (10.1.5). Quintilian writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;For in everything which we teach examples are more effective even than the rules which are taught in the schools, so long as the student has reached a stage when he can appreciate such examples without the assistance of a teacher, and can rely on his own powers to imitate them. (10.1.15; Butler, LCL)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also advises that students constantly reread the exemplary models (10.1.19), not only in sections but all the way through (10.1.20), so that they might be empowered to imitate these models with more craft and subtlety.

Of course, the selection of one's literary model is of the utmost importance. In Quintilian's opinion, one could find no better model than Homer, "for he has given us a model and an inspiration for very department of eloquence" (10.1.46; Butler, LCL). When it comes to the act of imitation itself, he writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no doubt that in art no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since, although invention came first and is all-important, it is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented with success. And it is a universal rule of life that we should wish to copy what we approve in others. It is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of letters that they may learn to write, and that musicians take the voices of their teachers, painters the works of their predecessors, and peasants the principles of agriculture which have been proved in practice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we may note that the elementary study of every branch of learning is directed by reference to some definite standard that is placed before the learner. (10.2.1-2; Butler, LCL)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, students are encouraged to ''improve'' upon their chosen models (10.2.12). One way for students to accomplish this task, Quintilian says, is to imitate several models in eclectic fashion: "We shall do well to keep a number of different excellences before our eyes, so that different qualities from different authors may impose themselves on our minds, to be adopted for use in the place that becomes them best" (10.2.26; Butler, LCL). On this point, Quintilian was at odds with Cicero, who felt it best for authors to imitate a single author.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knowles Ruthven, ''Critical Assumptions'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1979), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
In order to circumvent the capriciousness of subjectivity, [[Dennis MacDonald|MacDonald]] suggests six criteria for determining whether a claim for a mimetic connection between texts is reasonable: accessibility, analogy, density, order, distinctive traits, and interpretability. The first two criteria concern the status of the text used as a model ("ante-text"); the final four concern the later text that may have used the antetext.

*'''Accessibility''': One must demonstrate that the author of the later text would have been reasonably able to access a copy of the text being imitated. Was the antetext well known or obscure at the time of the later text's composition?
*'''Analogy''': If one text is discovered to imitate a certain antetext, it is probable that other texts have also done so. Are there examples of other authors using this antetext as a literary model?
*'''Density''': The greater number of parallels one can induce between the two texts, the stronger one's case will be for a mimetic relationship between them.
*'''Order''': The more frequently the parallels between the two texts follow the same order, the less likely it becomes that the parallels are just coincidental.
*'''Distinctive Traits''': If there are parallels between two texts, but none of the parallels are anything but one would expect in their respective contexts, then it becomes difficult to argue for a mimetic connection. Especially helpful are [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequiturs]] or other unusual elements present in the later text which parallel the proposed model. It is also typical for authors to use significant names to alert the reader to the textual interplay.
*'''Interpretability''': A common motivation for imitating an earlier text is to rival that text, whether philosophically, theologically, politically, or otherwise. If one can determine such a motivation in a compelling fashion, then there is a stronger case for imitation.

==Mimesis in Early Christianity==

===New Testament===
Two examples of imitation within the New Testament will be outlined. The first pertains to Luke's use of 1 Kings 17 as a literary model. The second outlines Luke's imitation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' 10-12 in Acts 20.&lt;ref&gt;These examples come from MacDonald and can be found in his various publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 1 Kings 17:9-24
! Luke 7:11-16
|-
| Elijah went to Sarepta.
| Jesus went to Nain.
|-
| Elijah saw a widow after approaching the city gate. Her son later becomes sick and dies.
| Jesus saw a widow's dead son after approaching the city gate being carried out on a bier.
|-
| Elijah told the widow, "Give me your son."
| Jesus told the widow, "Do not weep."
|-
| Elijah took the corpse and cried out angrily to God.
| Jesus took the corpse and spoke directly to him.
|-
| The dead son revived and cried out ({{smallcaps|lxx}}).
| The dead son sat up and began to speak.
|-
| "And he gave him to his mother."
| "And he gave him to his mother."
|-
| The widow praised Elijah as "a man of God."
| The crowd glorified God, calling Jesus "a great prophet."
|}

One can justifiably argue that Luke used 1 Kings 17:9-24 as a model for Luke 7:11-16 because it meets the criteria of '''mimesis criticism'''. '''Criterion 1''' ('''Accessibility'''): Luke cites this very story in Luke 4:25-26. '''Criterion 2''' ('''Analogy'''): Mark provides an analogous imitation of 1 Kings 17 with his story about the raising of Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:35-43). '''Criteria 3''' ('''Density'''), '''4''' ('''Order'''), and '''5''' ('''Distinctive Traits''') can be identified in the above table. The most important aspect for '''criterion 5''' is the identical Greek wording for "And he gave him to his mother." '''Criterion 6''' ('''Interpretability'''): Luke improves upon his model in the following ways. In 1 Kings, the widow initiates the miracle by castigating Elijah for causing her son's death; in Luke, Jesus is the one to initiate the miracle. In 1 Kings, Elijah then reproaches God, asking if God has "brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son" (17:20); in Luke, Jesus does not blame God for the boy's death but instead has compassion for her. In 1 Kings, it is the {{smallcaps|Lord}} who raises the boy, not Elijah; in Luke, it is Jesus himself. In 1 Kings, only the widow responds to the miracle; in Luke, a "large crowd" responds positively.

|}

In the same way, one can justifiably argue that Luke has used the story of Elpenor from ''Odyssey'' 10-12 as a model for his account of Eutychus in Acts 20:5-12 using the criteria. '''Criterion 1''' ('''Accessibility'''): Books 10-12 of ''Odyssey'' were among the most popular in antiquity. '''Criterion 2''' ('''Analogy'''): Among the many imitations of these books in antiquity, Virgil's ''Aeneid'' contains two, the stories about Palinurus and Misenus. '''Criteria 3''' ('''Density'''), '''4''' ('''Order'''), and '''5''' ('''Distinctive Traits''') can be seen to be met by referring to the above table. Of particular significance is Luke's name choice: Homer often called Elpenor "unlucky" (''Odyssey'' 11.61, 76, 80); Luke's Eutychus literally means "good fortune." Furthermore, the raising of Luke's Eutychus occurs in the Troad, the cite of the Trojan War. '''Criterion 6''' ('''Interpretability'''): Luke emulates Homer in the following ways. Elpenor fell to his death because he was in a drunken stupor; Eutychus appeared to die after falling asleep (out a window) while listening to Paul preach deep into the night. Odysseus was unaware of Elpenor's misfortune; Paul knew immediately about Eutychus' fall and also that "his soul [was] still in him." Later in Homer's story, Elpenor's body was buried at dawn; at dawn, the other believers lifted up Eutychus alive.

In addition to imitating the [[Septuagint]] and Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', MacDonald proposes that Mark's Gospel and Luke-Acts used the following literary models: Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', several [[Homeric hymns|''Homeric Hymns'']], [[Euripides]]' [[The Bacchae|''Bacchae'']] and [[Herakles (Euripides)|''Madness of Heracles'']], and dialogues by [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] about [[Socrates]].

===Christian Apocrypha===
In his seminal work ''Christianizing Homer:'' The Odyssey'', Plato, and'' The Acts of Andrew, MacDonald argues that the second-century {{smallcaps|c.e.}} apocryphal work, the [[Acts of Andrew]], was a Christian version of Homer's [[Iliad]]. Elsewhere, MacDonald has also argued for the presence of Homeric imitations in the [[Acts of Peter]], another second-century {{smallcaps|c.e.}} apocryphal work.

==Controversy==

===Scholarly Opposition===
Karl Olav Sandnes, the most vocal of MacDonald's critics, objects that MacDonald's "reading of both Mark's Gospel and Acts assumes a readership with an in-depth as well as extensive familiarity with the Homeric epics. This implies that the curriculum of encyclical studies had penetrated into the Christian movement to an extent which the present study has not confirmed. Ancient education was designed for the upper strata of the population."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olav Sandnes, ''The Challenge of Homer: School, Pagan Poets, and Early Christianity'' (Library of New Testament Studies; T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2009), 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Sandnes argues deductively: Since such familiarity with Homer was limited to the upper stratum of society, and since the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts (nor their audiences) are not believed to belong to this stratum, then the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts simply ''could not'' have imitated Homer in the way MacDonald suggests.

MacDonald's response has been threefold. First, a more sure decision about the education of the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts would result from an [[Inductive reasoning|''inductive'']] approach to the question, rather than Sandnes' [[Deductive reasoning|''deductive'']] approach. Second, access to Homer was ''not'' restricted to the cultural elite. According to a first-century {{smallcaps|ce}} writer, "From the earliest age, children beginning their studies are nursed on Homer's teaching. One might say that while we were still in swathing bands we sucked from his epics as from fresh milk. He assists the beginner and later the adult in his prime. In no stage of life, from boyhood to old age, do we ever cease to drink from him."&lt;ref&gt;Ps.-Heraclitus, ''Quaest. Hom.'' 1.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, MacDonald notes that Sandnes does not offer any other explanation for the parallels between the New Testament writings and Homer.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. MacDonald, ''Homer, Vergil, and the New Testament'' (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret M. Mitchell]] has also published a critical response to MacDonald's work on Homeric imitation within the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. Mitchell, "Homer in the New Testament?" ''The Journal of Religion'' 83 (2003): 244-60.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald addresses Mitchell's critiques, as well as earlier criticism from Sandnes,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olav Sandnes, "''Imitatio Homeri''? An Appraisal of Dennis R. MacDonald's 'Mimesis Criticism,'" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 124 (2005): 715-32.&lt;/ref&gt; in an article titled, "My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism.'"&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. MacDonald, "My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism,'" (Occasional Papers of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity 53; The Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for Historicity of Jesus===
MacDonald's arguments for the mimetic nature of the Gospel narratives have influenced how some view the question of the [[historicity of Jesus]]. Some have taken the extremist position that all of the Gospel narratives are exclusively the byproduct of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists']] literary imagination, influenced by [[Homer]] and the [[Septuagint|Septuagintal narratives]], and not historical memory. Perhaps this is due to a misunderstanding of MacDonald's claim that the Gospel of [[Gospel of mark|Mark]] was an "intentional fiction." MacDonald believes that such a stance is taking matters too far, although he himself holds to a minimalist view of the [[Historical Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. MacDonald, "My Turn," 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This debate is usually generated in non-academic circles, such as [[YouTube]] [[Vlogs|video blogs]].&lt;ref&gt;One such prolific video blogger on YouTube, with the username [https://www.youtube.com/user/TruthSurge TruthSurge], has posted a number of vlogs on this topic. Particularly relevant are the videos titled, "Excavating the Empty Tomb (beyond a reasonable doubt)," parts 4-9b.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}

In communication studies, '''organizational communication''' is the study of communication within organizations. The flow of communication could be either formal or informal.  

==History==

The field traces its lineage through business information, business communication, and early mass communication studies published in the 1930s through the 1950s. Until then, organizational communication as a discipline consisted of a few professors within speech departments who had a particular interest in [[Speech communication|speaking]] and [[writing]] in business settings. The current field is well established with its own theories and empirical concerns distinct from other fields.

Several seminal publications stand out as works broadening the scope and recognizing the importance of communication in the organizing process, and in using the term "organizational communication". [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Laureate [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1947 about "organization communications systems", saying communication is "absolutely essential to organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Herbert A. |date=1997 |origyear=1947 |title=Administrative Behavior: A Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organizations |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0684835827 |oclc=35159347}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} [[W. Charles Redding]] played a prominent role in the establishment of organizational communication as a discipline.

In the 1950s, organizational communication focused largely on the role of communication in improving organizational life and organizational output. In the 1980s, the field turned away from a business-oriented approach to communication and became concerned more with the constitutive role of communication in organizing. In the 1990s, [[critical theory]] influence on the field was felt as organizational communication scholars focused more on communication's possibilities to oppress and liberate organizational members.

==Early underlying assumptions==

Some of the main assumptions underlying much of the early organizational communication research were:

* Humans act rationally. Some people do not behave in rational ways, they generally have no access to all of the information needed to make rational decisions they could articulate, and therefore will make unrational decisions, unless there is some breakdown in the communication process—which is common. Irrational people rationalize how they will rationalize their communication measures whether or not it is rational.
* Formal logic and empirically verifiable data ought to be the foundation upon which any theory should rest. All we really need to understand communication in organizations is (a) observable and replicable behaviors that can be transformed into variables by some form of measurement, and (b) formally replicable syllogisms that can extend theory from observed data to other groups and settings
* Communication is primarily a mechanical process, in which a message is constructed and encoded by a sender, transmitted through some channel, then received and decoded by a receiver. Distortion, represented as any differences between the original and the received messages, can and ought to be identified and reduced or eliminated.
* Organizations are mechanical things, in which the parts (including employees functioning in defined roles) are interchangeable. What works in one organization will work in another similar organization. Individual differences can be minimized or even eliminated with careful management techniques.
* Organizations function as a container within which communication takes place. Any differences in form or function of communication between that occurring in an organization and in another setting can be identified and studied as factors affecting the communicative activity.

[[Herbert A. Simon]] introduced the concept of ''[[bounded rationality]]'' which challenged assumptions about the perfect rationality of communication participants. He maintained that people making decisions in organizations seldom had complete information, and that even if more information was available, they tended to pick the first acceptable option, rather than exploring further to pick the optimal solution.

In the early 1990s [[Peter Senge]] developed new theories on organizational communication.  These theories were [[learning organization]] and [[systems thinking]].  These have been well received and are now a mainstay in current beliefs toward organizational communications.

===Communication networks===

Networks are another aspect of direction and flow of communication. Bavelas has shown that communication patterns, or networks, influence groups in several important ways. Communication networks may affect the group's completion of the assigned task on time, the position of the de facto leader in the group, or they may affect the group members' satisfaction from occupying certain positions in the network. Although these findings are based on laboratory experiments, they have important implications for the dynamics of communication in formal organizations.

There are several patterns of communication, such as "chain", "wheel", "star", "all-channel" network, and "circle".&lt;ref name="multiple3"&gt;Summarized from concepts developed by Alex Bavelas, "Communication Patterns in Task-Oriented Groups," pp. 503–11; Harold Guetzkow, "Differentiation of Roles in Task-Oriented Groups," pp. 512–26, in Cartwright and Zander, Group Dynamics; H.J. Leavitt, "Some Effects of Certain Communication Patterns on Group Performance," Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology vol.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Interorganization communication==

===Flow nomenclature===
Abbreviations are used to indicate the two-way flow of information or other transactions, e.g. ''B2B'' is "business to business". [[Duplex (telecommunications)|Duplex]] [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] communication systems, [[computer network]]s, non-electronic telecommunications, and meetings in person are all possible with the use of these terms. Examples:

==Interpersonal communication==
{{Main|Interpersonal communication}}
One-to-one or ''interpersonal communication'' between individuals may take several forms- messages may be [[Words|verbal]] (that is, expressed in words), or non-verbal such as gestures, facial expressions, and postures ("body language"). [[Nonverbal]] messages may even stem from silence.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn= 9780876205402|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Managers do not need answers to operate a successful business; they need questions. Answers can come from anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world thanks to the benefits of all the electronic communication tools at our disposal.  This has turned the real job of management into determining what it is the business needs to know, along with the who/what/where/when and how of
learning it. To effectively solve problems, seize opportunities, and achieve objectives, questions need to be asked by managers—these are the people responsible for the operation of the enterprise as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, J. F. (2008). ''The Art of Asking: Ask Better Questions, Get Better Answers''. FT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the meanings sent are the meanings received. This is most often the case when the [[message]]s concern something that can be verified objectively. For example, "This piece of pipe fits the threads on the coupling." In this case, the receiver of the message can check the sender's words by actual trial, if necessary. However, when the sender's words describe a feeling or an opinion about something that cannot be checked objectively, meanings can be very unclear. "This work is too hard" or "Watergate was politically justified" are examples of opinions or feelings that cannot be verified. Thus they are subject to interpretation and hence to distorted meanings. The receiver's background of experience and learning may differ enough from that of the sender to cause significantly different perceptions and evaluations of the topic under discussion. As we shall see later, such differences form a basic barrier to [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

[[Nonverbal]] content always accompanies the verbal content of messages.  When speaking about nonverbal communication, Birdwhistell says "it is complementary to (meaning "adds to") rather than redundant with (or repeating of) the verbal behavior". For example, if someone is talking about the length of an object, they may hold out their hands to give a visual estimate of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birdwhistell|first1=Ray L.|title=Kinesics and Context: Essays on Body Motion Communication|date=1970|publisher=University of Pensilvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reasonably clear in the case of face-to-face communication. As [[Virginia Satir]] has pointed out, people cannot help but communicate symbolically (for example, through their clothing or possessions) or through some form of body language. In messages that are conveyed by the telephone, a messenger, or a letter, the situation or context in which the message is sent becomes part of its non-verbal content. For example, if the [[company]] has been losing [[money]], and in a letter to the production division, the [[front office]] orders a reorganization of the shipping and receiving departments, this could be construed to mean that some people were going to lose their jobs — unless it were made explicitly clear that this would not occur.&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;{{cite book |author= Virginia Satir|title= Conjoint family therapy; a guide to theory and technique|publisher= Science and Behavior Books|location= Palo Alto, Calif.|year=1967|pages=76–81|isbn=|oclc=187068|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of variables influence the [[effectiveness]] of [[communication]]. Some are found in the environment in which communication takes place, some in the personalities of the sender and the receiver, and some in the relationship that exists between [[sender]] and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. These different variables suggest some of the difficulties of communicating with understanding between two people. The sender wants to formulate an idea and communicate it to the receiver. This desire to communicate may arise from his thoughts or feelings or it may have been triggered by something in the environment. The [[communication]] may also be influenced by the relationship between the sender and the receiver, such as status differences, a staff-line relationship, or a learner-teacher relationship.&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt;

Whatever its origin, [[information]] travels through a series of filters, both in the sender and in the receiver, and is affected by different channels, before the idea can be transmitted and re-created in the receiver's mind. Physical capacities to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch vary between people, so that the image of reality may be distorted even before the mind goes to work. In addition to physical or sense filters, cognitive filters, or the way in which an individual's mind interprets the world around him, will influence his assumptions and feelings. These filters will determine what the sender of a message says, how he says it, and with what purpose. Filters are present also in the receiver, creating a double complexity that once led [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] to say that human communication is "doubly relative". It takes one person to say something and another to decide what he said.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book |author=James G March;  Herbert A Simon|title= Organizations|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1958|pages=9–11|isbn= 9780471567936|oclc=1329335|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical and cognitive, including semantic [[wiktionary:Filter|filter]]s (which decide the meaning of words) combine to form a part of our memory system that helps us respond to reality. In this sense, March and Simon compare a person to a data processing system. Behavior results from an interaction between a person's internal state and environmental stimuli. What we have learned through past experience becomes an inventory, or data bank, consisting of values or goals, sets of expectations and preconceptions about the consequences of acting one way or another, and a variety of possible ways of responding to the situation. This memory system determines what things we will notice and respond to in the environment. At the same time, stimuli in the environment help to determine what parts of the memory system will be activated. Hence, the memory and the environment form an interactive system that causes our behavior. As this interactive system responds to new experiences, new learnings occur which feed back into memory and gradually change its content. This process is how people adapt to a changing world.&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt;

==Formal and informal==
Informal and formal communication are used in an organization. Communication flowing through formal channels are downward, horizontal and upward whereas communication through informal channels are generally termed as grapevine.

Informal communication, generally associated with interpersonal, horizontal communication, was primarily seen as a potential hindrance to effective organizational performance. This is no longer the case. Informal communication has become more important to ensuring the effective conduct of work in modern organizations.

Grapevine is a random, unofficial means of informal communication. It spreads through an organization with access to individual interpretation as gossip, rumors, and single-strand messages. Grapevine communication is quick and usually more direct than formal communication. An employee who receives most of the grapevine information but does not pass it onto others is known as a ''dead-ender''. An employee that receives less than half of the grapevine information is an ''isolate''. Grapevine can include destructive miscommunication, but it can also be beneficial from allowing feelings to be expressed, and increased productivity of employees. 

Top-down approach: This is also known as downward communication. This approach is used by the top level management to communicate to the lower levels. This is used to implement policies, guidelines, etc. In this type of organizational communication, distortion of the actual information occurs. This could be made effective by feedbacks.

Additionally, [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|McPhee and Zaug]] (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=R.|author2=Zaug, P.|title=The Communicative Constitution of Organizations: A framework for explanation|journal=Electronic Journal of Communication/La Revue Electronique de Communication|year=2000|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  take a more nuanced view of communication as constitutive of organizations (also referred to as [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|CCO]]). They identify four constitutive flows of communication, formal and informal, which become interrelated in order to constitute organizing and an organization:
* organizational self-structuring
* membership negotiation
* activity coordination
* institutional positioning.

== Perspectives==
Shockley-Zalabak identified the following two perspectives, essentially as ways of understanding the organizational communication process as a whole.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shockley-Zalabak|first1=Pamela S.|title=Fundamentals of Organizational Communication|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|location=United States of America|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}}

=== The functional tradition===
According to Shockley-Zalabak, the functional tradition is "a way of understanding organizational communication by describing what messages do and how they move through organizations." There are different functions within this process that all work together to contribute to the overall success of the organization, and these functions occur during the repetition of communication patterns in which the members of the organization engage in.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|28}} The first types of functions are message functions which are "What communication does or how it contributes to the overall functioning of the organization", and we describe message functions in three different categories which are organizational functions, relationship functions, and change functions.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Organizing functions as Shockley-Zalabak states, are "Messages that establish the rules and regulations of a particular environment". These messages can include items such as newsletters or handbooks for a specific organization, that individuals can read to learn the policies and expectations for a certain company.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|31}} Relationship functions are "Communication that helps individuals define their roles and assess the compatibility of individual and organizational goals". These relationship functions are a key aspect to how individuals identify with a company and it helps them develop their sense of belonging which can greatly influence their quality of work.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|31–32}} The third and final subcategory within message functions are change functions, which are defined as "messages that help organizations adapt what they do and how they do it". Change messages occur in various choice making decisions, and they are essential to meet the employee's needs as well as have success with continual adaptations within the organization.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

===The meaning centered approach===
According to Shockley-Zalabak, the meaning centered approach is "a way of understanding organizational communication by discovering how organizational reality is generated through human interaction". This approach is more concerned with what communication is instead of why and how it works, and message functions as well as message movement are not focused on as thoroughly in this perspective.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

==Research==

===Research methodologies===
Historically, organizational communication was driven primarily by quantitative research methodologies. Included in functional organizational communication research are [[statistical]] analyses (such as [[Statistical survey|surveys]], text indexing, [[network mapping]] and [[behavior]] [[scientific model|modeling]]). In the early 1980s, the [[interpretive]] revolution took place in organizational communication. In Putnam and Pacanowsky's 1983 text ''Communication and Organizations: An Interpretive Approach''. they argued for opening up methodological space for [[qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches such as [[narrative]] analyses, participant-observation, [[interviewing]], [[rhetorical|rhetoric]] and textual approaches readings) and philosophic inquiries.

In addition to qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, there is also a third research approach called mixed methods. "Mixed methods is a type of procedural approach for conducting research that involves collecting, analyzing, and mixing quantitative and qualitative data within a single program of study. Its rationale postulates that the use of both qualitative and quantitative research provides a better and richer understanding of a research problem than either traditional research approach alone provides."&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abeza |first1=Gashaw |last2=O'Reilly |first2=Norm |last3=Dottori |first3=Mark |last4=Séguin |first4=Benoit |last5=Nzindukiyimana |first5=Ornella |date=January 2015 |title=Mixed methods research in sport marketing |journal=International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=40–56 |doi=10.1080/18340806.2015.1076758}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} Complex contextual situations are easier to understand when using a mixed methods research approach, compared to using a qualitative or quantitative research approach. There are more than fifteen mixed method design typologies that have been identified.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|42}} Because these typologies share many characteristics and criteria, they have been classified into six different types. Three of these types are sequential, meaning that one type of data collection and analysis happens before the other. The other three designs are concurrent, meaning both qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

===Sequential explanatory design===
To achieve results from a sequential explanatory design, researchers would take the results from analyzing quantitative data and get a better explanation through a qualitative follow up. They then interpret how the qualitative data explains the quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

===Sequential exploratory design===
Although sequential exploratory design may resemble sequential explanatory design, the order in which data is collect is revered. Researchers begin with collecting qualitative data and analyzing it, then follow up by building on it through a quantitative research method. They use the results from qualitative data to form variables, instruments and interventions for quantitative surveys and questionnaires.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

===Sequential transformative design===
Researchers in line with sequential transformative design are led by a "theoretical perspective such as a conceptual framework, a specific ideology, or an advocacy position and employs what will best serve the researcher's theoretical or ideological perspective".&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|44}} Therefore, with this research design, it could be either the qualitative or quantitative method that is used first and priority depends on circumstance and resource availability, but can be given to either.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

===Concurrent triangulation design===
With a concurrent triangulation design, although data is collected through both quantitative and qualitative methods at the same time, they are collected separately with equal priority during one phase. Later, during the analysis phase, the mixing of the two methods takes place.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

===Concurrent embedded design===
In a concurrent embedded design, again, both qualitative and quantitative data is collected, although here one method supports the other. Then, one of the two methods (either qualitative or quantitative) transforms into a support for the dominant method.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

===Concurrent transformative design===
The concurrent transformative design allows the researcher to be guided by their theoretical perspective, so their qualitative and quantitative data may have equal or unequal priority. Again, they are both collected during one phase.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Mixed methods capitalizes on maximizing the strengths of qualitative and quantitative research and minimizing their individual weaknesses by combining both data.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt; Quantitative research is criticized for not considering contexts, having a lack of depth and not giving participants a voice. On the other hand, qualitative research is criticized for smaller sample sizes, possible researcher bias and a lack of generalizability.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s critical organizational scholarship began to gain prominence with a focus on issues of [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Social class|class]], and power/knowledge. In its current state, the study of organizational communication is open methodologically, with research from [[postpositivism|post-positive]], [[interpretive]], [[critical theory|critical]], [[postmodern]], and [[discourse|discursive]] paradigms being published regularly.

Organizational communication scholarship appears in a number of communication journals including but not limited to ''[[Management Communication Quarterly]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Communication Research]]'', ''[[Communication Monographs]]'', ''[[Academy of Management Journal]]'', ''[[Communication Studies]]'', and ''Southern Communication Journal''.

==Current research topics==
In some circles, the field of organizational communication has moved from acceptance of mechanistic models (e.g., information moving from a sender to a receiver) to a study of the persistent, hegemonic and taken-for-granted ways in which we not only use communication to accomplish certain tasks within organizational settings (e.g., public speaking) but also how the organizations in which we participate affect us.

These approaches include "postmodern", "critical", "participatory", "feminist", "power/political", "organic", etc. and adds to disciplines as wide-ranging as sociology, philosophy, theology, psychology, business, business administration, institutional management, medicine (health communication), neurology (neural nets), semiotics, anthropology, international relations, and music.

Currently, some topics of research and theory in the field are:

'''Constitution''', e.g.,
* how communicative behaviors construct or modify organizing processes or products
*how communication itself plays a [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|constitutive role in organizations]]
* how the organizations within which we interact affect our communicative behaviors, and through these, our own identities
* structures other than organizations which might be constituted through our communicative activity (e.g., markets, cooperatives, tribes, political parties, social movements)
* when does something "become" an organization? When does an organization become (an)other thing(s)? Can one organization "house" another? Is the organization still a useful entity/thing/concept, or has the social/political environment changed so much that what we now call "organization" is so different from the organization of even a few decades ago that it cannot be usefully tagged with the same word&amp;nbsp;– "organization"?

'''Narrative''', e.g.,
*how do group members employ narrative to acculturate/initiate/indoctrinate new members?
*do organizational stories act on different levels? Are different narratives purposively invoked to achieve specific outcomes, or are there specific roles of "organizational storyteller"? If so, are stories told by the storyteller received differently from those told by others in the organization?
*in what ways does the organization attempt to influence storytelling about the organization? under what conditions does the organization appear to be more or less effective in obtaining a desired outcome?
*when these stories conflict with one another or with official rules/policies, how are the conflicts worked out? in situations in which alternative accounts are available, who or how or why are some accepted and others rejected?

'''Identity''', e.g.,
* who do we see ourselves to be, in terms of our organizational affiliations?
* do communicative behaviors or occurrences in one or more of the organizations in which we participate effect changes in us?  To what extent do we consist of the organizations to which we belong?
* is it possible for individuals to successfully resist organizational identity? what would that look like?
* do people who define themselves by their work-organizational membership communicate differently within the organizational setting than people who define themselves more by an avocational (non-vocational) set of relationships?
* for example, researchers have studied how human service workers and firefighters use humor at their jobs as a way to affirm their identity in the face of various challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tracy |first= S.J. |author2=K. K. Myers |author3=C. W. Scott |year= 2006 |journal=Communication Monographs |volume= 73|pages=283–308 |doi= 10.1080/03637750600889500 |title= Cracking Jokes and Crafting Selves: Sensemaking and Identity Management Among Human Service Workers |issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have examined the identities of police organizations, prison guards, and professional women workers.

'''Interrelatedness''' of organizational experiences, e.g.,
* how do our communicative interactions in one organizational setting affect our communicative actions in other organizational settings?
* how do the phenomenological experiences of participants in a particular organizational setting effect changes in other areas of their lives?
* when the organizational status of a member is significantly changed (e.g., by promotion or expulsion) how are their other organizational memberships affected?
* what kind of future relationship between business and society does organizational communication seem to predict?

'''[[Power (sociology)|Power]]''' e.g.,
* How does the use of particular communicative practices within an organizational setting reinforce or alter the various interrelated power relationships within the setting? Are the potential responses of those within or around these organizational settings constrained by factors or processes either within or outside of the organization&amp;nbsp;– (assuming there is an "outside")?
* Do taken-for-granted organizational practices work to fortify the dominant [[hegemonic]] narrative? Do individuals resist/confront these practices, through what actions/agencies, and to what effects?
* Do status changes in an organization (e.g., promotions, demotions, restructuring, financial/social strata changes) change communicative behavior? Are there criteria employed by organizational members to differentiate between "legitimate" (i.e., endorsed by the formal organizational structure) and "illegitimate" (i.e., opposed by or unknown to the formal power structure) behaviors? When are they successful, and what do we mean by "successful" when there are "pretenders" or "usurpers" who employ these communicative means?

[[File:Mating Pseudobiceros bedfordi.png|thumb|Two flatworms of the species ''[[Pseudobiceros bedfordi]]'' preparing for penis fencing. ''P. bedfordi'' is exceptional in that it applies sperm onto the partner's skin rather than injecting it.]]
'''Penis fencing''' is a [[mating]] [[ethology|behavior]] engaged in by many species of [[flatworm]], such as ''[[Pseudobiceros hancockanus]]''. Species which engage in the practice are [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]]; each individual has both egg-producing [[ovaries]] and sperm-producing [[testes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/shapeoflife/episodes/hunt_explo2.html |title=Fighting to mate: flatworm penis fencing |author=Leslie Newman |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flatworms "[[fencing|fence]]" using extendable two-headed [[dagger]]-like stylets.  These stylets are pointed (and in some species hooked) in order to pierce their mate's epidermis and inject sperm into the [[Circulatory system|haemocoel]] in an act known as intradermal hypodermic insemination, or [[traumatic insemination]].  Pairs can either compete, with only one individual transferring sperm to the other, or the pair can transfer sperm bilaterally.  Both forms of sperm transfer can occur in the same species, depending on various factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mating behaviour in the sea slug Elysia timida (Opisthobranchia, Sacoglossa): hypodermic injection, sperm transfer and balanced reciprocity|journal = Frontiers in Zoology|date = 2007-07-04|issn = 1742-9994|pmc = 1934903|pmid = 17610714|pages = 17|volume = 4|doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-4-17|first = Valerie|last = Schmitt|first2 = Nils|last2 = Anthes|first3 = Nico K|last3 = Michiels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unilateral sperm transfer ==
One organism will inseminate the other, with the inseminating individual acting as the "father". The sperm is absorbed through pores or sometimes wounds in the skin from the partner's stylet, causing fertilization in the second, who becomes the "mother".&lt;ref name="Michiels"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michiels | first1 = N.K. | last2 = Newman | first2 = L.J. | year = 1998 | title = Sex and violence in hermaphrodites | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = | page = 647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc98/2_14_98/fob2.htm Hermaphrodites duel for manhood], ''Science News Online''.

Parturition, while necessary for successful offspring production, requires a considerable [[parental investment]] in time and energy, and according to [[Bateman's principle]], almost always burdens the "mother".  Thus, from an [[optimality model]] it is usually preferable for an organism to inseminate than to be inseminated.  However, in many species that engage in this form of copulatory competition, each "father" will continue to fence with other partners until it is inseminated.  In ''[[Alderia modesta]]'', individuals will [[Sperm storage|store sperm]] from several "fencing matches" before laying their eggs, and smaller individuals will more often inseminate a larger partner, with larger individuals spending more energy on laying eggs when paired with a smaller partner on the occasion that they transfer sperm unilaterally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/angelonilab/Site/Publications_files/Angeloni2003.pdf|title = Sexual selection in a simultaneous hermaphrodite with hypodermic insemination: body size, allocation to sexual roles and paternity|last = Angeloni|first = Lisa|date = 21 October 2002|journal = Animal Behaviour|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 417–426|doi = 10.1006/anbe.2003.2255|pmid = |access-date = 1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bilateral sperm transfer ==
Commonly, many hermaphroditic species mutually inseminate, or trade sperm, rather than compete, ''[[Chelidonura sandrana]]'' as an example.&lt;ref name="sn" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Evolutionary Conflict: Sperm Wars, Phantom Inseminations|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982205010882|accessdate = 2015-12-02|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.019|volume=15|issue = 19|journal=Current Biology|pages=R801–R803|pmid=16213811 | last1 = Dall | first1 = SR | last2 = Wedell | first2 = N|date = 2005-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tiger flatworm, [[Maritigrella crozierae|''Maritigrella crozieri'']], also transfers sperm bilaterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the geometric probability of mating success in flatworms, Platyhelminthes?|url = http://dspace.nelson.usf.edu/xmlui/handle/10806/11724|website = dspace.nelson.usf.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-02|language = en-US|first = Nguyen|last = Danh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many species that engage in bilateral insemination, sperm trading is conditional.  If one partner "cheats", and does not transfer sperm, the other partner will either prematurely abandon the partner, or will engage in typical mating behavior without transferring sperm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender trading in a hermaphrodite|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098220501105X|journal = Current Biology|date = 2005-10-11|pages = R792–R793|volume = 15|issue = 19|doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.035|first = Nils|last = Anthes|first2 = Annika|last2 = Putz|first3 = Nico K.|last3 = Michiels|pmid=16213807}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other species will alternate which partner transfers sperm, engaging in multiple bouts of fencing with the same partner over time.

'''Permaculture''' is a set of design principles centered around [[Systems thinking|whole systems thinking]] simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and [[resilience|resilient]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} features observed in natural [[ecosystem]]s. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from [[regenerative agriculture]], [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] to [[Community resilience|community]] and [[Organization|organizational]] design and development.

With its system of applied education, research and citizen- led [[Design thinking|design]] permaculture has grown a popular web of global networks and developed into a global [[social movement]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn | King | 1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy.

It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[ecological design]], [[ecological engineering]], [[regenerative design]], [[environmental design]], and [[construction]]. Permaculture also includes [[integrated water resources management]] that develops [[sustainable architecture]], and regenerative and self-maintained [[habitat]] and agricultural systems modelled from natural ecosystems.{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gxW0MGXha6cC&amp;pg=PA5  5]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mars | first = Ross| title= The Basics of Permaculture Design|publisher=Chelsea Green |year=2005|isbn=978-1-85623-023-0|page=1|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWb6i-G6QAkC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mollison has said: "Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a [[Monocropping|single product system]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mollison, B. (1991). ''Introduction to permaculture''. Tasmania, Australia: Tagari.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12 principles of permaculture most commonly referred to are first described by David Holmgren in his book ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'' (2002). They include: Observe and Interact, Catch and Store Energy, Obtain a Yield, Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback, Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services, Produce No Waste, Design From Patterns to Details, Integrate Rather Than Segregate, Use Small and Slow Solutions, Use and Value Diversity, Use Edges and Value the Marginal, and Creatively Use and Respond to Change.

==History==
Several individuals revolutionized the branch of permaculture. In 1929, [[Joseph Russell Smith]] added an antecedent term as the subtitle for ''Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture'', a book which sums up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed.&lt;ref name = jrsjs&gt;{{cite book | first1=Joseph Russell |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Smith | title=Tree Crops: A permanent agriculture| publisher=Island Press | year= 1987|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0PQvqpVnFbAC&amp;lpg=PP1 | isbn = 978-1-59726873-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath. This book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable, such as [[Toyohiko Kagawa]] who pioneered [[forest farming]] in [[Japan]] in the 1930s.{{Sfn | Hart| 1996|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA41  41]}}

In Australian P.A. Yeomans' 1964 book ''Water for Every Farm'', he supports the definition of permanent agriculture, as one that can be sustained indefinitely. Yeomans introduced both an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s and the Keyline Design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s.

Holmgren noted [[Stewart Brand]]’s works as an early influence to permaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Essence of Permaculture | url = http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/weeds.html | first = David | last = Holmgren | publisher = Holmgren Design Services | accessdate = 10 September 2011 | year = 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526225318/http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.holmgren.com.au%2Fhtml%2FWritings%2Fweeds.html | archivedate = 26 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early influences include [[Ruth Stout]] and [[Esther Deans]], who pioneered [[no-dig gardening]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating [[no-till]] orchards and gardens and [[natural farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The One-Straw Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka |first=Bill |last=Mollison |newspaper=[[Nation Review]] |date= 15–21 September 1978 |page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill Mollison 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Mollison]] in 2008.]]
In the late 1960s, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of [[Tasmania]]. Dangers of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods sparked these ideas.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"&gt;''Introduction to Permaculture'', 1991, Mollison, p.v&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, these methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing [[biodiversity]], and removing billions of tons of [[topsoil]] from previously fertile landscapes. They responded with a design approach called ''permaculture.'' This term was first made public with their publication of their 1978 book ''Permaculture One''.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"/&gt;

Among some of the more recognizable names who received their original training within Mollison's PDC system would include [[Geoff Lawton]] and [[Toby Hemenway]], each of whom have more than 25 years experience teaching and promoting permaculture as a sustainable way of growing food. [[Simon J Fjell]] was a Founding Director of the Permaculture Institute in late 1979 and a teacher of the first Permaculture Design Course, having first met Mollison in 1976. He has since worked internationally and is currently listing a major social enterprise on NASDAQ.

By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards [[Sustainable habitat|sustainable human habitats]]. After ''Permaculture One'', Mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books, such as ''Permaculture: A Designers Manual''. Mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to hundreds of students. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Mollison "encouraged graduates to become teachers themselves and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites. This multiplier effect was critical to permaculture’s rapid expansion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 = Lillington| first1 = Ian| last2 = Holmgren | first2 = David |last3=Francis|first3=Robyn|last4=Rosenfeldt|first4= Robyn|title= The Permaculture Story: From ‘Rugged Individuals’ to a Million Member Movement|url= https://www.pipmagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/what-is-permaculture.pdf | format = PDF | work =Pip Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permaculture movement also spread throughout Asia and Central America, with Hong Kong-based Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA),&lt;ref&gt;[https://daforum.wordpress.com/aisa/ Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rony Lec leading the foundation of the Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://imapermaculture.org Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Guatemala and Juan Rojas co-founding the Permaculture Institute of El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permacultura.com.sv Permaculture Institute of El Salvador]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core tenets and principles of design==
The three core tenets of permaculture are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Greenblott | first1 = Kara | first2 = Kristof | last2 = Nordin | year = 2012 | title = Permaculture Design for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming: Low-Cost, Sustainable Solutions for Food and Nutrition Insecure Communities | place = Arlington, VA | publisher = USAID | series = AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources, AIDSTAR-One | number = Task Order 1 | url = http://www.aidstar-one.com/focus_areas/ovc/resources/technical_briefs/permaculture_for_OVC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Mollison | 1988 | p =2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: Principles &amp; Pathways Beyond Sustainability |last=Holmgren |first=David |year=2002 |publisher=Holmgren Design Services |isbn = 0-646-41844-0 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Care for the earth''': Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply. This is the first principle, because without a healthy earth, [[human]]s cannot flourish.
* '''Care for the people''': Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence
* '''Fair share''': By governing our own needs, we can set resources aside to further the above principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: a Designer's Manual |last=Mollison |first=Bill |year=1988 |publisher=Tagari Press |isbn = 0-908228-01-5 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mollison|first=Bill|title=Permaculture: A Quiet Revolution | type = interview |url=http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/mollison.html|work= Scott London |accessdate= 17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third ethic is  referred to as Fair Share, which reflects that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus.

Permaculture design emphasizes patterns of [[landscape]], function, and species assemblies.  It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. Permaculture maximizes useful connections between components and [[synergy]] of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on each separate element, but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together; the whole becomes [[Emergence|greater than the sum of its parts]]. Permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize [[waste]], human labor, and energy input by building systems, and maximizes benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of [[synergy]]. Permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can evolve into extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/|title=Edible Forest Gardening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design principles, which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture, were derived from the science of [[systems ecology]] and study of pre-industrial examples of [[sustainable]] land use. Permaculture draws from several disciplines including [[organic farming]], [[agroforestry]], [[integrated farming]], [[sustainable development]], and [[applied ecology]].&lt;ref name="David Holmgren 1997"&gt;{{cite web | title = Weeds or Wild Nature | url = http://holmgren.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23_weeds_or_wild_nature.pdf | first = David | last = Holmgren |publisher= Permaculture International Journal |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping, integrating techniques such as [[agroforestry]], [[natural building]], and [[rainwater harvesting]] within the context of permaculture design principles and theory. {{FACT|date=January 2018}}

==Theory==
===Twelve design principles===
Twelve Permaculture design principles articulated by David Holmgren in his ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holmgren.com.au/product/principles/ |title=Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability |publisher=Holmgren Design |accessdate= 21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Observe and interact'': By taking time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation.
# ''Catch and store energy'': By developing systems that collect resources at peak abundance, we can use them in times of need.
# ''Obtain a yield'': Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.
# ''Apply self-regulation and accept feedback'': We need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well.
# ''Use and value [[renewable]] resources and services'': Make the best use of nature's abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources.
# ''Produce no waste'': By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.
# ''Design from patterns to details'': By stepping back, we can observe patterns in nature and society. These can form the backbone of our designs, with the details filled in as we go.
# ''Integrate rather than segregate'': By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other.
# ''Use small and slow solutions'': Small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones, making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes.
# ''Use and value diversity'': Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
# ''Use edges and value the marginal'': The interface between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the most valuable, diverse and productive elements in the system.
# ''Creatively use and respond to change'': We can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing, and then intervening at the right time.

===Layers===
[[File:Claire Gregorys Permaculture garden.jpg|thumb|238px|Suburban permaculture garden in [[Sheffield]], UK with different layers of vegetation]]
Layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans. A mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts: trees, [[understory]], [[ground cover]], [[soil]], [[fungi]], insects, and animals.  Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space, as the vegetation occupies different layers.  There are generally seven recognized layers in a [[forest gardening|food forest]], although some practitioners also include [[fungi]] as an eighth layer.&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tcpermaculture.com/site/2013/05/27/nine-layers-of-the-edible-forest-garden/ | title = Nine layers of the edible forest garden | date = 27 May 2013 | publisher = TC permaculture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]: the tallest trees in the system. Large trees dominate but typically do not saturate the area, i.e. there exist patches barren of trees.
# [[Understory]] layer: trees that flourish in the dappled light under the canopy.
# [[Shrub layer]]: a diverse layer of woody perennials of limited height. Includes most berry bushes.
# [[Herbaceous layer]]: Plants in this layer die back to the ground every winter (if winters are cold enough, that is). They do not produce woody stems as the Shrub layer does. Many culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer. A large variety of beneficial plants fall into this layer. May be annuals, biennials or perennials.
# Soil surface/[[Groundcover]]: There is some overlap with the [[Herbaceous layer]] and the [[Groundcover layer]]; however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground, grow densely to fill bare patches of soil, and often can tolerate some foot traffic. [[Cover crop]]s retain soil and lessen [[erosion]], along with [[green manure]]s that add nutrients and [[organic matter]] to the soil, especially [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen]].
# [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|Rhizosphere]]: Root layers within the soil. The major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots and [[rhizomes]] (including [[root crop]]s such as [[potato]]es and other edible [[tuber]]s), fungi, insects, nematodes, worms, etc.
# Vertical layer: climbers or [[vine]]s, such as [[runner bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s (vine varieties).&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://permacultureschool.ca/food-forests/seven-layers-of-a-forest/ | title = Food forests | contribution = Seven layers of a forest | publisher = Permaculture school | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilds===
A guild is a group of species where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction or harmony. There are many forms of guilds, including guilds of plants with similar functions that could interchange within an ecosystem, but the most common perception is that of a mutual support guild. Mutual support guilds are groups of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[insect]]s, etc. that work well together. Plants may be grown for food production, draw nutrients from deep in the soil through tap roots, are nitrogen-fixing [[legumes]], attract [[beneficial insects]], and repel harmful insects. When grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement, these plants form a guild.  See Dave Jacke's work on edible forest gardens for more information on other guilds, specifically resource-partitioning and community-function guilds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=D|last2=Dayan|first2=T|title=The Guild Concept and the Structure of Ecological Communities|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22|page=115|year=1991|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70591/community-ecology | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Guilds | accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=SE|last2=Hero|first2=JM|title=Rainforest frogs of the Australian Wet Tropics: guild classification and the ecological similarity of declining species|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences | publisher = The Royal Society|volume=265|issue=1396|pages=597–602|year=1998|pmid=9881468|pmc=1689015|doi= 10.1098/rspb.1998.0336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge effect===
The [[edge effect]] in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition, or placing contrasting [[natural environment|environments]] on an ecosystem. Permaculturists argue that where vastly differing systems meet, there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections. An example of this is the coast; where the land and the sea meet, there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs.  This idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in herb gardens, or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval (thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/10-edge-effect/|title=10. Edge Effect|date=3 April 2013|newspaper=Deep Green Permaculture|language=en-US|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zones===
[[File:Permaculture Zones.svg|thumb|Permaculture zones 0-5]]

Zones intelligently organize design elements in a human environment based on the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2.  Manipulated elements located further away are used less frequently. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5 based on positioning.{{Sfn | Burnett, Graham, ''Permaculture A Beginners Guide', Spiralseed, 2001 p.26}}
; Zone 0: The house, or home center.  Here permaculture principles would be applied in terms of aiming to reduce energy and water needs, harnessing natural resources such as sunlight, and generally creating a harmonious, sustainable environment in which to live and work.  Zone 0 is an informal designation, which is not specifically defined in [[Bill Mollison]]’s book.
; Zone 1: The zone nearest to the house, the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention, or that need to be visited often, such as salad crops, [[herb]] plants, soft fruit like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[greenhouse]] and [[cold frame]]s, propagation area, [[Vermicompost|worm compost]] bin for kitchen waste, etc. [[Raised bed gardening|Raised beds]] are often used in zone 1 in [[Urban agriculture|urban areas]].
; Zone 2: This area is used for siting [[perennial]] plants that require less frequent maintenance, such as occasional [[weed control]] or [[pruning]], including currant bushes and orchards, pumpkins, sweet potato, etc.  This would also be a good place for [[beehive]]s, larger scale [[compost]]ing bins, etc.
; Zone 3: The area where main-crops are grown, both for domestic use and for trade purposes. After establishment, care and maintenance required are fairly minimal (provided [[mulch]]es and similar things are used), such as watering or weed control maybe once a week.
; Zone 4: A semi-wild area. This zone is mainly used for [[forage]] and collecting wild food as well as production of timber for construction or firewood.
; Zone 5: A wilderness area. There is no human intervention in zone 5 apart from the observation of natural [[ecosystem]]s and cycles. Through this zone we [[Biological pest control|build up a natural reserve of bacteria, moulds and insects]] that can aid the zones above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://edepot.wur.nl/115721 | title = Permacultuur course | publisher = WUR | place = [[Netherlands|NL]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===People and permaculture===
Permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems, and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape. There has been a growing awareness though that firstly, there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic, as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects, and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant, healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes.

===Domesticated animals===
[[List of domesticated animals|Domesticated animals]] are often incorporated into site design, ensuring the efficiency and productivity of the system.{{Sfn | Mollison| 1988|p =5| ps =: ‘[[Deer]], [[rabbit]]s, [[sheep]], and [[herbivorous]] [[fish]] are very useful to us, in that they convert unusable herbage to acceptable human food. Animals represent a valid method of storing inedible vegetation as food.’}}Animals, domestic or wild are a critical component of any wild or designed sustainable ecosystem. Research indicates that without the animal’s participation and contribution, ecological integrity is diminished or impossible.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217221136/http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 December 2014|title=Backyard Animals {{!}} Permaculture Institute|website=www.permaculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the activities that contribute to the system include: foraging to cycle nutrients, clear fallen fruit, weed maintenance, spreading seeds, and pest maintenance. The nutrients are cycled by animals, transformed from their less digestible form (such as grass or twigs) into more nutrient-dense manure.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"/&gt;

Several animals can be incorporated into a permaculture system, including cows, goats, chickens, geese, turkey, rabbits, and worms. A more specific explanation of how the animals can be used is seen in the chicken design. Chickens can be used to scratch over the soil, thus breaking down the top soil and using the fecal matter as manure creating a sustainable system. However, in the domestication of these animals, the complexity and elegance lie in an effectiveness and efficiency of the design, including factors like timing and habits to specific areas of a farm. For example, animals require daily attention in a way that is much more demanding than plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2016/03/07/permaculture-animals-as-a-discipline-to-the-system/|title=Permaculture Animals as a Discipline to the System|date=7 March 2016|website=The Permaculture Research Institute|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common practices==
===Agroforestry===
[[Agroforestry]] is an integrated approach of permaculture, which uses the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops or livestock. It combines agricultural and [[forestry]] technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nac.unl.edu |title=USDA National Agroforestry Center (NAC) |publisher=UNL |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agroforestry systems, trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems, or [[non-timber forest product]]s are cultured in forest settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/documents/OC/FactSheet_final_8-1-11.pdf|title=USDA Agroforestry Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=1 August 2011|website=|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forest gardening]] is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests.  Forest gardens, like other permaculture designs, incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems.  The terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature.  Numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens, such as Graham Bell, [[Patrick Whitefield]], Dave Jacke, Eric Toensmeier and [[Geoff Lawton]]. Bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book ''The Permaculture Garden'' in 1995, Whitefield wrote the book ''How to Make a Forest Garden'' in 2002, Jacke and Toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set ''Edible Forest Gardening'' in 2005, and Lawton presented the film ''Establishing a Food Forest'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|work=Permaculture|title=Graham Bell’s Forest Garden|publisher=Media mice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060346/http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Transition culture | url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/11/film-review-%E2%80%9Cestablishing-a-food-forest-the-permaculture-way-series/| date = 11 February 2009 | title= Establishing a Food Forest | type = film review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree Gardens, such as Kandyan tree gardens, in South and Southeast Asia, are often hundreds of years old.  It is not self-evident whether these tree gardens derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry, as is the case in agroforestry, or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems, as is the case for permaculture systems.  Many studies of these systems, especially those that predate the term permaculture, consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry.  Permaculturalists may obscure the distinction of permaculture and agroforestry when they include existing and ancient systems of polycropping as examples of food forests.

Food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs.

===Hügelkultur===
[[Hügelkultur]] is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention. The porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground. During the rainy season, masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul. [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ "Raised garden beds: hugelkultur instead of irrigation"] Richsoil. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has been used by permaculturalists [[Sepp Holzer]], [[Toby Hemenway]], [[Paul Wheaton]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | pp = 84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Feineigle, Mark. [http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 "Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease"]. Permaculture Research Institute of Australia. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural building===
A [[natural building]] involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability.  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality.

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort, health, or [[aesthetics]]. Natural building primarily utilizes abundantly available natural materials (e.g., clay, rock, sand, straw, wood, reeds), and draws heavily on traditional architectural strategies from various climates across the world.  In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment, and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Most materials are sourced regionally, locally, or even on-site. Straw bales, and various earthen masonry techniques such as adobe bricks, cob (or monolithic adobe), rammed earth and clay-straw infill are common choices for wall material. Roofing coverings often used include sod or "living" roofs, thatch, and wooden shakes or shingles. Rubble trench foundations are popular, as they do not require concrete; likewise, dry-stacked or lime mortared stem walls are common. Natural builders also regularly combine different wall systems in a single building, making best use of different materials' thermal or water resistant properties, for example, where they are most needed in the structure.

===Rainwater harvesting===
[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aramo.de/rain.html |title= Rainwater harvesting |year= 2012 |place= [[Germany|DE]] |publisher= Aramo |accessdate= 19 August 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130606063516/http://aramo.de/rain.html |archivedate= 6 June 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide [[drinking water]], water for [[livestock]], water for [[irrigation]], as well as  other typical uses. Rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water. It can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery. Water collected from the ground, sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose, is called [[stormwater harvesting]].{{citation needed |date=June 2012}}

[[Greywater]] is [[wastewater]] generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and [[constructed wetland]]s. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] to indicate it contains [[human waste]]. Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused. There are, however, continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste. The most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure; a combination of the words human and manure. Additionally, the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel, such as for heating or cooking, and is commonly referred to as biogas. Biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure.  Some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel. This process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

===Sheet mulching===
In agriculture and [[gardening]], mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil. Any material or combination can be used as mulch, such as stones, leaves, cardboard, wood chips, gravel, etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions.  These include absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. [[Sheet mulching]] is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within [[forest]]s. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.&lt;ref name="agroforestry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |title=Sheet Mulching: Greater Plant and Soil Health for Less Work |publisher=Agroforestry |date=3 September 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210053204/http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |archivedate=10 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "mason"&gt;{{Citation | title = Sustainable Agriculture | first = J | last = Mason | publisher = Landlinks | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

Sheet mulch serves as a "nutrient bank," storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down. It also improves the soil by attracting and feeding [[earthworms]], [[woodlouse|slaters]] and many other soil micro-organisms, as well as adding [[humus]]. Earthworms "till" the soil, and their [[worm castings]] are among the best fertilizers and [[soil conditioner]]s. Sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate non-desired plants by starving them of light, and can be more advantageous than using [[herbicide]] or other methods of control. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stratton|first1=Margie Lynn|last2=Barker|first2=Allen|last3=Ragsdale|first3=James|title=Sheet composting overpowers weeds in restoration project|journal=BioCycle|date=April 2000|volume=41|issue=4|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensive rotational grazing===
Grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment. However, it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature, the opposite effect can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress|url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|work=International Union for Conservation of Nature|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland birds: Fostering habitat using rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as cell grazing, [[managed intensive rotational grazing]] (MIRG) is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture, range, or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth. This disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, geese, turkeys, ducks, and other animals depending on the natural [[ecological community]] that is being mimicked. [[Sepp Holzer]] and [[Joel Salatin]] have shown how the disturbance caused by the animals can be the spark needed to start [[ecological succession]] or prepare ground for planting. [[Allan Savory]]'s [[holistic management]] technique has been likened to "a permaculture approach to [[rangeland management]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Meat: A Benign Extravagance | first=Simon | last= Fairlie | publisher= Chelsea Green | year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-60358325-1 | pages = 191–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Kirsten|title=Holistic Management: Herbivores, Hats, and Hope|url=http://milkwood.net/2010/04/27/holistic_management_herbivores_hats_and_hope/|publisher=Milkwood|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One variation on MIRG that is gaining rapid popularity is called eco-grazing. Often used to either control invasives or re-establish native species, in eco-grazing the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals can be, but are not necessarily, used for meat, milk or fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munching sheep replace lawn mowers in Paris| url= http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/munching-sheep-replace-lawn-mowers-paris-20130404| work= The Sunday Times | date =  4 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ash|first=Andrew|others=et al.|title=The Ecograze Project – developing guidelines to better manage grazing country|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|url=http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|isbn=0-9579842-0-0|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=7 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410052228/http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Caroline|title=Things to make you happy: Google employs goats|url= http://news.cnet.com/things-to-make-you-happy-google-employs-goats/?tag=mncol;title | work = CNET | accessdate =7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Ian|title=A systems approach to livestock/resource  interactions in tropical pasture systems|url=http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203081104/http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2014|work=The James Hutton Institute|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Littman|first= Margaret|title= Getting your goat: Eco-friendly mowers | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-26/classified/sc-home-0725-garden-goat-20110726_1_goats-invasive-plants-gardeners |work=Chicago Tribune News|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Alexis|title= Kudzu-eating sheep take a bite out of weeds|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/kudzu-eating-sheep-take-a-bite-out-of-weeds/nQwKL/ |work= The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klynstra|first=Elizabeth|title= Hungry sheep invade Candler Park|url=http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/19864571/100-sheep|work=CBS Atlanta|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keyline design===
[[Keyline design]] is a technique for maximizing the beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in Australia by farmer and engineer [[P. A. Yeomans]]. The ''Keyline'' refers to a specific [[topography|topographic feature]] linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | type = video | url = http://www.permaculture.co.uk/videos/creating-permaculture-keyline-water-systems-don-tipping | title = Creating Permaculture Keyline Water Systems | first = Don | last = Tipping | place = UK | publisher =Beaver State Permaculture | date= 4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential factor in this system, the Keyline, is a level or sloping line extending in both directions from a point or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same vertical interval, that a valley bears to its ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Keyline plan|last=Yeomas|first=P.A|publisher=Authour|year=1954|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fruit tree management===
Some proponents of permaculture advocate no, or limited, pruning. One advocate of this approach is [[Sepp Holzer]] who used the method in connection with [[Hügelkultur]] [[berms]].  He has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes (approximately {{convert |9000|ft|m}}) far above their normal altitude, temperature, and snow load ranges.  He notes that the Hügelkultur berms kept or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions.  The point of having unpruned branches, he notes, was that the longer (more naturally formed) branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground, thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter, pruned, branch.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Masanobu Fukuoka]], as part of early experiments on his family farm in Japan, experimented with no-pruning methods, noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go, which made them become convoluted and tangled, and thus unhealthy.&lt;ref name="Natural Way Farming-Pruning"&gt;{{Citation | last = Masanobu | first = Fukuoka | origyear = 1985 | edition = rev | year = 1987 | title = The Natural Way of Farming – The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy | publisher = Japan Publications | place = Tokyo | page = 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978 | pp = 13, 15–18, 46, 58–60}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}} Then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}  He concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning, so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination. This is part of his implementation of the [[Tao]]-philosophy of [[Wu wei|Wú wéi]] translated in part as no-action (against nature), and he described it as no unnecessary pruning, nature farming or "do-nothing" farming, of fruit trees, distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning. He ultimately achieved yields comparable to or exceeding standard/intensive practices of using pruning and chemical fertilisation.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}&lt;ref name = "Ramon Magsaysay Award-Bio"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyFukuokaMas.htm | year = 1988 | title = Public Service | type = biography | contribution = Masanobu Fukuoka | publisher = The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation | place = [[The Philippines|PH]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Permaculture Action'''&lt;/big&gt;

Permaculture helps generate plans that are easy and cheap when it comes to production. Permaculture allows creativity and innovation in farming. The action of permaculture looks and all becoming consciously involved in the process of producing and ensuring abundant food nearby, problem on malnutrition caused by the world hunger problem will inevitably lessen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasarinlan|first=|year=2011|title=Permaculture as Alternative Agriculture|url=http://www.journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/kasarinlan/article/viewFile/3511/pdf_149|journal=Philippine|volume=26|pages=422–434|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture principles in action are powerful forces to help right the environmental wrongs of the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.solscape.co.nz/permaculture-sustainability/|title=Permaculture and Sustainability - Solscape|work=Solscape|access-date=6 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark and copyright issues==
There has been contention over who, if anyone, controls legal rights to the word ''permaculture'': is it [[trademark]]ed or [[copyright]]ed? If so, who holds the legal rights to the use of the word? For a long time Bill Mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word, and his books said on the [[copyright page]], "The contents of this book and the word PERMACULTURE are copyright." These statements were largely accepted at face value within the permaculture community. However, copyright law does not protect names, ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of doing something; it only protects the expression or the description of an idea, not the idea itself. Eventually Mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word ''permaculture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Permaculture Papers 5: time of change and challenge — 2000-2004 | url = http://pacific-edge.info/the-permaculture-papers-5-time-of-change-and-challenge-%E2%80%94-2000-2004/ | first = Russ | last = Grayson | publisher= Pacific edge |accessdate=8 September 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Mollison's US based Permaculture Institute sought a [[service mark]] (a form of trademark) for the word ''permaculture'' when used in educational services such as conducting classes, seminars, or workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)| url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:o81il1.2.1 |author= [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |publisher= US Department of Commerce |accessdate=8 September 2011|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service mark would have allowed Mollison and his two Permaculture Institutes (one in the US and one in Australia) to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it, particularly with relation to the PDC, despite the fact that he had instituted a system of certification of teachers to teach the PDC in 1993. The service mark failed and was abandoned in 2001. Also in 2001 Mollison applied for trademarks in Australia for the terms "Permaculture Design Course"&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Result | url = http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/Falcon.Result |publisher =[[IP Australia]] |accessdate=8 September 2011| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Permaculture Design".&lt;ref name ="IPA"/&gt; These applications were both withdrawn in 2003. In 2009 he sought a trademark for "Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual"&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; and "Introduction to Permaculture",&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; the names of two of his books. These applications were withdrawn in 2011. There has never been a trademark for the word ''permaculture'' in Australia.&lt;ref name="IPA" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
===General criticisms===
In 2011, Owen Hablutzel argued that "permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance," and that "the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant."

In his books ''Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture'' and ''Farming in Ponds and Dams'', Nick Romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in Bill Mollison's books is unrealistic and misleading.&lt;ref name="Romanowski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Romanowski|title=Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture: The Complete Guide from Backyard to Investor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOCHj_b16jgC|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-835-4|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agroforestry===
Greg Williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests declines as they mature due to [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2001"&gt;{{cite news| work=Whole Earth | title= Gaia’s Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture | first=Greg | last= Williams | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data between woodland forest and climax vegetation, but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, ecological succession generally results in a forest's productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the ''woodland state'' (67% tree cover), before declining until ''full maturity''.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening" /&gt;

'''Pharyngeal aspiration''' is the introduction of a substance into the [[pharynx]] and its subsequent [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] into the lungs.  It is used to test the [[Inhalation exposure|respiratory toxicity]] of a substance in [[animal testing]].  It began to be used in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=G.

Pharyngeal aspiration has benefits over the alternative methods of [[inhalation]] and [[intratracheal instillation]], the introduction of the substance directly into the [[trachea]].  Inhalation studies have the disadvantages that they are expensive and technically difficult, the dose and location of the substance has poor reproducibility, they require large amounts of material, and they potentially allow exposure to laboratory workers and to the skin of laboratory animals.  Intratracheal instillation overcomes some of these difficulties, but because a needle or tube is needed to access the trachea, it remains technically challenging and causes trauma to the animal, which can be a [[confounding factor]].  It also results in a less uniform distribution of the substance than inhalation, and bypasses effects from the [[upper respiratory tract]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driscoll|first=Kevin E.|last2=Costa|first2=Daniel L.|last3=Hatch|first3=Gary|last4=Henderson|first4=Rogene|last5=Oberdorster|first5=Gunter|last6=Salem|first6=Harry|last7=Schlesinger|first7=Richard B.|date=2000-05-01|year=|title=Intratracheal Instillation as an Exposure Technique for the Evaluation of Respiratory Tract Toxicity: Uses and Limitations|url=https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/toxsci/55.1.24|journal=Toxicological Sciences|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=24–35|doi=10.1093/toxsci/55.1.24|issn=1096-6080|pmid=10788556|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pharyngeal aspiration, the substance is placed in the pharynx, which is higher in the respiratory tract, avoiding the major source of technical difficulty and trauma to the animal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The deposition pattern of pharyngeal aspiration is also more dispersed than that of intratracheal instillation, making it more similar to inhalation, and the lung responses are qualitatively similar.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-145/|title=Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers|last=|first=|date=April 2013|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|pages=15–17, 48|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, pharyngeal aspiration still leads to more particle agglomeration than inhalation, making its effects less potent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXwZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA466|title=Natural Mineral Nanotubes: Properties and Applications|last=Pasbakhsh|first=Pooria|last2=Churchman|first2=G.

A liquid suspension of particles in [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]] is usually used, in a typical volume of 50 μL.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Sometimes the substance is introduced into the [[larynx]] instead of the pharynx to avoid contamination from food particles and other contaminants present in the mouth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Phototrophic biofilms''' occur on contact surfaces in a range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Phototrophic biofilms can best be described as surface attached microbial communities (see also [[Biofilm]] and [[Chemistry of Biofilm Prevention]]) mainly driven by light as the energy source with [[phototroph]]ic organisms clearly present. Eukaryotic [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] generate energy and reduce carbon dioxide, providing organic substrates and [[oxygen]]. The [[photosynthetic]] activity fuels processes and conversions in the total biofilm community, including the [[heterotrophic]] fraction.

Thick laminated multilayered phototrophic biofilms are usually referred to as [[microbial mat]]s or phototrophic mats (see also [[biofilm]]). Phototrophic biofilms and microbial mats have been described in extreme environments like thermal springs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roeselers G, Norris TB, Castenholz RW |title=Diversity of phototrophic bacteria in microbial mats from Arctic hot springs (Greenland) |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=26–38 |date=Jan 2007 |pmid=17227409 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01103.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; hyper saline ponds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sørensen KB, Canfield DE, Teske AP, Oren A |title=Community composition of a hypersaline endoevaporitic microbial mat |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=7352–65 |date=Nov 2005 |pmid=16269778 |pmc=1287706 |doi=10.1128/AEM.71.11.7352-7365.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; desert soil crusts, and in lake ice covers in Antarctica. The 3.4-billion-year fossil record of [[benthic]] phototrophic communities, such as microbial mats and [[stromatolites]], indicates that these associations represent the Earth's oldest known ecosystems. It is thought that these early ecosystems played a key role in the build-up of [[oxygen]] in the [[Earth’s atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoehler TM, Bebout BM, Des Marais DJ |title=The role of microbial mats in the production of reduced gases on the early Earth |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6844 |pages=324–7 |date=Jul 2001 |pmid=11460161 |doi=10.1038/35085554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing interest in the application of phototrophic biofilms, for instance in wastewater treatment in [[constructed wetlands]], [[bioremediation]], [[aquaculture]], and [[biohydrogen]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roeselers G, van Loosdrecht MC, Muyzer G |title=Phototrophic biofilms and their potential applications |journal=Journal of Applied Phycology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=227–35 |date=Jun 2007 |doi=10.1007/s10811-007-9223-2|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n518x09k16133052/ |pmid=19396356 |pmc=2668646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Population density''' (in [[agriculture]]: [[Stock (disambiguation)|standing stock]] and [[standing crop]]) is a measurement of [[population]] per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type [[number density]]. It is frequently applied to [[living organisms]], and most of the time to [[human]]s. It is a key geographical term.&lt;ref name=about&gt;Matt Rosenberg [http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm Population Density]. Geography.about.com. March 2, 2011. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In simple terms population density refers to the number of people living in an area per kilometer square.

== Biological population densities ==
Population density is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

Low densities may cause an [[extinction vortex]] and lead to further reduced fertility. This is called the [[Allee effect]] after the scientist who identified it. Examples of the causes in low population densities include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Minimum_viable_population_size Minimum viable population size]. Eoearth.org (March 6, 2010).

{{main|List of countries and territories by population density}}
For [[human]]s, population density is the number of people per unit of area, usually quoted per square kilometer or square mile (which may include or exclude, for example, areas of water or glaciers). Commonly this may be calculated for a [[county]], [[list of cities by population density|city]], [[country]], another [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] or the [[Earth|entire world]].

The [[world's population]] is around 7,500,000,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]. Census.gov. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510,000,000 square kilometers (197,000,000 sq. mi.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html World]. CIA World Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is around 7,500,000,000 ÷ 510,000,000 = 14.7 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (38 per sq. mi). If only the Earth's land area of 150,000,000  km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (58,000,000 sq. mi.) is taken into account, then human population density is 50 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (129 per sq. mile). This includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to over 55 people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (over 142 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about/&gt; However, over half{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human habitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh-water sources. Thus, this number by itself does not give any helpful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-state]]s, [[microstate]]s and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories have a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]

The potential to maintain the agricultural aspects of deserts is extremely limited as there is not enough precipitation to support a sustainable land. The population in these areas are extremely low. Therefore cities in the Middle East, such as Dubai, have been increasing in population and infrastructure growth at a fast pace. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/41320143|title=Desert regions : population, migration, and environment|last=1923-2009.|first=Portnov, B. A. (Boris Adolʹfovich) Hare, A. Paul (Alexander Paul),|date=1999|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=3540657800|location=|pages=|oclc=41320143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with high population densities are, by some, considered to be overpopulated, though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/issue/198/human-population Human Population]. Global Issues. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the most densely populated cities are in [[Southeast Asia]], though [[Cairo]] and [[Lagos]] in [[Africa]] also fall into this category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-density-125.html The largest cities in the world by land area, population and density]. Citymayors.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

City population and especially area are, however, heavily dependent on the definition of "urban area" used: densities are almost invariably higher for the central city area than when suburban settlements and the intervening rural areas are included, as in the areas of [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] or [[metropolitan area]], the latter sometimes including neighboring cities. For instance, [[Milwaukee]] has a greater population density when just the inner city is measured, and the surrounding suburbs excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconline.com/greenmap/milwaukee/population.html The Population of Milwaukee County]. Wisconline.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, based on a world population of seven billion, the world's inhabitants, as a loose crowd taking up ten square feet (one square metre) per person ([[Jacobs Method]]), would occupy a space a little larger than [[Delaware]]'s land area.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Other methods of measurement ===

Although arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density, several other methods have been developed to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area.
* '''Arithmetic density''': The total number of people / area of land (measured in square miles or square kilometers)
* '''[[Physiological density]]''': The total population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Agricultural density''': The total ''rural'' population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Residential density''': The number of people living in an urban area / area of residential land
* '''[[Urban density]]''': The number of people inhabiting an urban area / total area of urban land
* '''Ecological optimum''': The density of population that can be supported by the natural resources

It has some relation to the [[problem play]]. The viewer of the picture is invited to speculate about several different possible explanations of the scene.  The genre has much in common with that of [[book illustration]], then at its most popular, but with the text belonging to the illustration omitted.&lt;ref&gt;See David Skilton,“The Centrality of Literary Illustration in Victorian Visual Culture: the example of Millais and Trollope from 1860 to 1864.” Journal of Illustration Studies (December 2007). 14 May 2014. &lt;http://jois.uia.no/articles.php?article=30&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The genre began to emerge in the second half of the nineteenth century, along with the development of book illustrations that depicted "pregnant" moments in a narrative. One of the earliest problem pictures is [[John Everett Millais]]' ''Trust Me'', which depicts an older man demanding that a young woman hand him a letter she has received. Either character might be uttering the words. The significance and content of the letter is left to the imagination.  Their relationship is also unclear; in view of their ages, they might be a married couple, or a father and daughter. 

Other artists who worked in the genre included [[William Frederick Yeames]], whose ''"[[And When Did You Last See Your Father? (picture)|And when did you last see your father?]]"'' became the most famous example of the genre. It depicts a young boy of the [[English civil war]] period being gently interrogated by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] troops who are looking for his Royalist father. It is implied that they are asking a trick question designed to discover his location. The painting is poised at the moment the child is about to answer. Yeames painted many other works of this type, including ''Amy Robsart'' and ''Defendant and Counsel''. When the latter was exhibited a newspaper ran a competition for readers to guess what crime the woman was accused of.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/biog/yeames.htm Obituary of Yeames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822202258/http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/biog/yeames.htm |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sickert.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Walter Sickert, ''The Camden Town Murder'', originally titled, ''What Shall We Do for the Rent?'' or ''What Shall We Do to Pay the Rent'' 1908]]
Some [[avant garde]] artists also experimented with the genre, notably [[Edgar Degas]] and his follower [[Walter Sickert]]. Degas's [[Interior (Degas)|''Interior'']] (1869) depicts an ambiguous scene suggestive of sexual transgression and violence (hence the alternative title of "the Rape"). Similar ambiguity is found in Sickert's ''[[The Camden Town Murder]]'' (1908), in which the two figures can be interpreted as a couple, or a killer and his victim.

The genre continued to be popular into the early twentieth century, but was by this time increasingly seen as old fashioned and as over-literary, against the emphasis on pictorial style and form characteristic of [[impressionism]] and [[post-impressionism]].

'''Punk ideologies''' are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the [[punk subculture]] and [[punk rock]]. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles.  It was primarily concerned with concepts such as [[poverty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[humanitarianism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[anti-corporatism]], [[anti-consumerism]], [[anti-war]], [[media culture|anti-media culture]], [[mainstream media|anti-mainstream or mainstream media]], [[anti-intellectualism]], against [[selling out]], [[anti-conservative]],  [[anti-nationalism]], anti-[[corporate greed]], anti-infatuation, against vagrancy laws, [[anti-racism]], anti-[[sexism]], [[gender equality]], [[racial equality]], [[civil rights]], [[animal rights]], [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]], [[social rights]], [[free-thought]] and [[non-conformity]]. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left wing]] views (e.g., [[NOFX]]) to [[right wing]] beliefs (e.g., [[No Remorse (band)|No Remorse]]) or [[apolitical]] (e.g., [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]).

Punk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective house's with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values or philosophy.

Because [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.

On religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], but some punk bands have promoted religions such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Taqwacore|Islam]], the [[Rastafari movement]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].

==Specific ideologies and philosophies==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}
[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed "peace punks" or "[[anarcho-punk]]s." While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' ''[[Anarchy in the UK]]'', they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Animal Liberation Front]]- or [[Earth Liberation Front]]-style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].

===Animal rights and veganism===
In the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133–151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="descartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilbürger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title="Nailing Descartes to the Wall": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with [[animal rights]]. Consequently, [[vegetarianism]] and [[veganism]] became a feature of the punk subculture.&lt;ref name="descartes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haenfler|first=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3851-3|ref=harv|page=53 and 427–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as [[Fluff Fest]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=YWb7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics|page=137|last=Kuhn|first=Gabriel|publisher=PM Press|date=2010|isbn=1604860510|author-link=Gabriel_Kuhn|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/09/20/czech-diy-list/|title=The Sincere and Vibrant World of the Czech DIY Scene|publisher=Bandcamp|first=Jacopo|last=Sanna|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apoliticism===
Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band [[Charged GBH]] and the singer [[G.G. Allin]], although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song "Violence Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Lyrics - Violence Now - Assassinate The President |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094628/http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]]. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[liberalism|liberal]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian punk}}
[[Christian punk]] is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music industry]],&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/christian-punk-ma0000002639/artists|title=Christian Punk Music Artists - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently [[Crashdog]], [[Ballydowse]] and [[The Psalters]], the latter two of whom identified as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bramboniusinenglish.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/the-lost-psalters-interview-from-august-11-kortrijk/ |title=The Lost Psalters Interview |date=March 14, 2012 |publisher=Brambonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://londoncelticpunks.wordpress.com/tag/ballydowse/ |title=Tribute to Ballydowse |publisher=London Celtic Punks Web-Zine |date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include [[Altar Boys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/altar-boys-mn0000793617/biography |title=Altar Boys |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Crucified]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crucified-mn0000135837|title=The Crucified - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five Iron Frenzy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-iron-frenzy-mn0000178494 |title=Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flatfoot 56]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flatfoot-56-mn0000921885 |title=Flatfoot 56 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk band [[MxPx]], who earned a [[Music recording certification|gold record]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mxpx-mn0000521851 |title=MxPx |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism ===
{{see also|Conservative Punk}}
A small number are [[Conservatism|conservative]], rejecting leftist-[[anarchism]], [[liberalism]], [[communism]] and [[socialism]] in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Forgotten Rebels]], [[Billy Zoom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/zoom-i.htm |title=Billy Zoom interview |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Escalante]], [[Bobby Steele]], [[Duane Peters]] and [[Dave Smalley]]. Some [[Christian punk]] and hardcore bands have [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political stances, in particular some of the [[New York hardcore|NYHC]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=https://www.vice.com/read/survival-of-the-streets-137-v16n9 |title=Survival Of The Streets &amp;#124; VICE United States |publisher=Vice.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Filipino punk band the [[Krishnacore|Wuds]] which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wuds-mn0001790200&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some notable members of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, including [[Ray Cappo]] ([[Youth of Today]], [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and other bands), [[John Joseph (rock singer)|John Joseph]] ([[Cro-Mags]]) and [[Harley Flanagan]] (Cro-Mags) converted to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823161134/http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.

===Islam===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Taqwacore]] is a punk subgenre centred on [[Islam]], its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]], [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].

===Liberalism===
[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Crashdog]],  [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Jared Gomes]] of [[Hed PE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035243/http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Latest-hed-p-e-album-has-plenty-of-messages-116661.php|title=Latest (hed) p.e. album has plenty of messages|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1025867/hedp-e|title=(Hed)p.e - Interviews - Killyourstereo.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034734/http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]]. Some punks participated in the [[Rock Against Bush]] movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]].

===Libertarianism===
Libertarian punks advocate [[free market]] [[capitalism]], a [[Night-watchman state|minimal government]] and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band [[Antiseen]],&lt;ref name=slug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slugmag.com/articles/106/ANTiSEEN.html |title=SLUG Magazine &amp;#124; ANTiSEEN |publisher=Slugmag.com |date=2004-09-29 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exene Cervenka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/24-7/2012/10/13/punk-icon-exene-cervenka-endorses-gary-j |title=Punk Icon Exene Cervenka Endorses Gary Johnson - Reason 24/7 |publisher=Reason.com |date=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mojo Nixon]] have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative,  [[Michale Graves]] has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.

===Neo-Nazism===
{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}
[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.

===Nihilism===
Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some early punk rock and [[protopunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/interview-with-simon-critchley/|title=Nihilism, Punk and the International Necronautical Society: an interview with Simon Critchley -|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sex Pistols]] were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'' writing that their "confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Ira, "Sex Pistols", in ''The Trouser Press Record Guide'', 4th ed., ed. Ira Robbins, p.585, Collier, 1991. {{ISBN|0-02-036361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though "much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said",&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical-review/19801802.htm|title=Popular Culture and Revolutionary Theory: Understanding Punk Rock|first=|last=EROL|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.

=== Situationism ===
[[File:DUST Flyer.jpg|thumb|Flyer for DUST happening circa. 1992]]
The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989"&gt;Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-571-23228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. [[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989" /&gt; [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around [[Hulme]] and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' [[Jamie Reid]]'s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

===Socialism===
[[The Clash]] were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing [[socialism]] to the punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMIaUCBTWMC&amp;pg=PA47 Ensminger, David, ''Left of the Dial: Conversations with Punk Icons'' (Oakland, CA: PM Press) p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qfACzulTwIC&amp;pg=PT327 |title=Seventies Unplugged - Gerard DeGroot - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]] said of his socialist views "I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salewicz|first1=Chris|title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0865479821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original [[Oi!]] bands expressed a rough form of socialist [[working class]] [[populism]] — often mixed with [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxzén]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], Joe Strummer, [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: "... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

[[Bernie Sanders]], a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] running for [[president of the United States]] in 2016, was endorsed by various bands and musicians including [[Jello Biafra]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], [[Keith Morris]], [[Cheetah Chrome]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Belinda Carlisle]] and [[Pussy Riot]] among others. In April 2016, a [[Richmond, VA]] artist named Mickael Broth, created a large mural of a Sanders which was inspired by a classic [[Circle Jerks]]   logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/Studi/archives/2016/04/05/punk-rock-bernie-sanders-mural-goes-up-on-broad-street|title=Punk Rock Bernie Sanders Mural Goes Up on Broad Street|first=Brent|last=Baldwin|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders has also been credited as having a major impact on the east coast punk scene in the United States. In the early 1980s as mayor of [[Burlington, VT]], Sanders fought a government ban on live music and had a major goal of building a youth center. That center became [[242 Main Street]], which is currently one of the United States longest running all-ages youth-run DIY punk venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/how-bernie-sanders-242-main-street-shaped-the-northeast-punk-scene-515|title=How Bernie Sanders Shaped the Northeast Punk Scene|website=Vice|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Straight edge===
{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}
[[Straight edge]], which originated in the [[Washington DC]] hardcore punk scene with [[Minor Threat]] song "Straight Edge" written by frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. (Although the Washington DC straight-edge scene exhibited a fierce allegiance for Coca-Cola, with supporters rarely, if ever, seen drinking anything else in public.) Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].

==Criticism of punk ideologies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]" and "[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]". [[Crass]]'s song "White Punks on Hope" criticized the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accused [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier socialist principles. Their song "Punk is Dead" attacked corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''"Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...''

[[Misfits (band)|Misfit]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become "[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.

Author [[Jim Goad]] has been very critical of punk ideologies in many of his writings. In his essay "The Underground is A Lie!", Goad argued that many punks are hypocrites, and he claimed that many punks act poor while hiding the fact they come from [[middle class|middle]] to [[upper class]] backgrounds. In ''Farts from Underground'', Goad claimed that the [[DIY ethic]] never produces anything original, and it allows poor quality work to be championed.

In their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argued that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argued that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8248">'''Quantitative history''' is an approach to [[history|historical research]] that makes use of [[Quantitative research|quantitative]], [[statistical]] and [[computer]] tools. It is considered a branch of ''social science history'' and has four leading journals: ''Historical Methods'' (1967- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heldref.org/hm.php Historical Methods online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216043317/http://www.heldref.org/hm.php |date=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of Interdisciplinary History]]'' (1968- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jih/ Journal of Interdisciplinary History online]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Social Science History'' (1976- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssh.dukejournals.org/ Social Science History online]&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution''] (2010- ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative historians start with databases. Large quantities of economic and demographic data are available in print format. Quantifiers move these into computerized databases. The largest repository is the [[Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research]] (ICPSR) at the [[University of Michigan]], which provides access to an extensive collection of downloadable political and social data for the [[United States]] and the world.

== Data bases: economic ==

[[Economic historian]]s use major data sets, especially those collected by governments since the 1920s. Historians of slavery have used census data, sales receipts and price information to reconstruct the economic history of slavery.

''[[Content analysis]]'' is a technique borrowed from journalism research whereby newspapers, magazines or similar sources are numerically coded according to a standardized list of topics. [Neuendorf, ''The Content Analysis Guidebook'' (2002)]

== Political history ==

Quantifiers study topics like voting behavior of groups in elections, the roll call behavior of legislators, public opinion distribution, and the occurrence rate of wars and legislation.  '''Collective biography'' uses standardized information on a large group to deduce patterns of thought and behavior.

== New social history ==

The "new [[social historian]]s" (new in the 1960s) use census data and other data sets to study entire populations. Topics include demographic issues such as population growth rates, rates of birth, death, marriage and disease, occupational and education distributions, and migrations and population changes.

An especially challenging technique is linking names ("nominal record linkage") of the same person whose information appears in multiple source such as censuses, city directories, employment files and voting registration lists.

== Cliodynamics ==
[[Cliodynamics]] employs a scientific approach to the study of history and combines insights from [[cultural evolution]], [[macrosociology]], and [[economic history]]/[[cliometrics]] to produce and analyse large quantitative datasets and identify general principles about the evolutionary dynamics and functioning of historical societies.

== Topics ==

'''Quedlinburg''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkveːdlɪnbʊʁk}}) is a town situated just north of the [[Harz]] mountains, in the [[Harz (district)|district of Harz]] in the west of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. In 1994, the castle, church and old town were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]].

Quedlinburg has a population of more than 24,000. The town was the capital of the [[Quedlinburg (district)|district of Quedlinburg]] until 2007, when the district was dissolved. Several locations in the town are designated stops along a scenic holiday route, the [[Romanesque Road]].

==History==
[[File:Quedlinburg Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Castle]]

The town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as ''Gross Orden'' on the eastern bank of the River [[Bode River|Bode]]. It was first mentioned as a town in 922 as part of a donation by King [[Henry the Fowler]] (''Heinrich der Vogler''). The records of this donation were held by the abbey of [[Corvey]].

According to legend, Henry had been offered the German crown at Quedlinburg in 919 by Franconian nobles, giving rise to the town being called the "cradle of the German Reich".&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

After Henry's death in 936, his widow [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Saint Matilda]] founded a religious community for women (''[[Frauenstift]]'') on the castle hill, where daughters of the higher nobility were educated. The main task of this collegiate foundation, [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], was to pray for the memory of King Henry and the rulers who came after him. The ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]'' were also compiled there. The first abbess was Matilda, a granddaughter of King Henry and St. Matilda.

The Quedlinburg castle complex, founded by King Henry I and built up by [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]] in 936, was an imperial ''[[Kaiserpfalz|Pfalz]]'' of the Saxon emperors. The ''Pfalz'', including the  male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of ''St. Wiperti'' is situated, while the women's convent was located on the castle hill.

In 973, shortly before the death of [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]], a ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Imperial Convention) was held at the imperial court in which [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]], duke of [[Polans (western)|Polans]], and [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslav]], duke of [[Bohemia]], as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as [[Byzantium]] and [[Bulgaria]], gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law [[Theophanu]], a Byzantine princess whose marriage to [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.

In 994, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.

The town became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the [[Bishopric of Halberstadt]]. In 1477, [[Hedwig, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Hedwig]], aided by her brothers [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]], broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishop's forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. Both town and abbey converted to [[Lutheranism]] in 1539 during the [[Protestant Reformation]].

In 1697, Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]] of Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]] for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]'s claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the [[German Mediatisation]], and Quedlinburg passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg.&lt;!--(? -- this might be Halberstadt as there is no evidence that Quedlinburg ever became a principality) --&gt; Part of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807–13, it was included within the new Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without "taking the veil"; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for women's rights, [[Sophia Albertina, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Sofia Albertina]].

During the [[Nazism|Nazi regime]], the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as [[Heinrich Himmler]] saw himself as the reincarnation of the "most German of all German" rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed from 1938 and during the war. The local [[crematory]] was kept busy burning the victims of the [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] concentration camp. [[Georg Ay]] was local party chief from 1931 until the end of the war. Liberation in 1945 brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was taken down from the tower.

During the last months of World War II, the [[United States military]] had occupied Quedlinburg. In the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the [[theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg]] came to light.

Quedlinburg was administered within [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic|Bezirk]] [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] while part of the Communist [[East Germany]] from 1949 to 1990. It became part of the state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] upon [[German reunification]] in 1990.

During Quedlinburg's Communist era, restoration specialists from [[Poland]] were called in during the 1980s to carry out repairs on the old architecture. Today, Quedlinburg is a center of restoration of [[Timber framing#German tradition or Fachwerkhäuser|''Fachwerk'']] houses.

===Climate===
Quedlinburg has a [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb) resulting from prevailing [[westerlies]], blowing from the high-pressure area in the central Atlantic towards Scandinavia. Snowfall occurs almost every  winter. January and February are the coldest months of the year, with an average temperature of 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C and 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C. July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 17&amp;nbsp;°C (63&amp;nbsp;°F) and 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64&amp;nbsp;°F). The average annual precipitation is close to 438&amp;nbsp;mm with rain occurring usually from May to September. This precipitation is one of the lowest in Germany, which has an annual average close to 700&amp;nbsp;mm. In August 2010, Quedlinburg was the driest  place in Germany, with only 72,4 l/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/generator/DWDWWW/Content/Oeffentlichkeit/KU/allgemeines/spitzenreiter/2010/bms__201008,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/bms_201008.pdf Press release of the Deutsche Wetterdienst]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (pdf, German)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quedlinburg Hohe Straße 8.jpg|thumb|[[Half-timbered]] house]]
[[File:Quedlinburg Markt.JPG|thumb|Quedlinburg (in the old town)]]

In the centre of the town are a wide selection of [[half-timbered]] buildings from at least five different centuries (including a 14th-century structure, one of Germany's oldest), while around the outer fringes of the old town are examples of [[Art Nouveau|''Jugendstil'']] buildings, dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Since December 1994, the old town of Quedlinburg and the castle mount with the ''[[Quedlinburg Abbey|Stiftskirche]]'' (collegiate church) are listed as one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/535 Unesco World heritage list]&lt;/ref&gt; Quedlinburg is one of the best-preserved medieval and Renaissance towns in Europe, having escaped major damage in World War II.

In 2006, the Selke valley branch of the [[Harz Narrow Gauge Railways]] was extended to Quedlinburg from [[Gernrode]], giving access to the historic steam [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge railway]], Alexisbad and the [[high Harz]] plateau.

The castle and ''Stifstkirche St. Servatius'' still dominate the town like in the early Middle Ages. The church is a prime example of German [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. The treasure of the church, containing ancient Christian religious artifacts and books, was stolen by an American soldier but brought back to Quedlinburg in 1993 and is again on display here.

The former ''Stiftskirche St. Wiperti'' was established in 936 when the ''Kanonikerstift St. Wigpertus'' (of male canons) was moved from the castle hill to make way for what became Quedlinburg Abbey. The church was built at the location of the first Ottonian Royal palace at Quedlinburg. Around 1020, a three-aisled crypt was added to the basilica. The crypt, which survived all later alterations to the church, is also a designated stop on the Romanesque Road today.&lt;ref name="Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|last=Antz (ed.)|first=Christian|title=Strasse der Romanik (German)|publisher=Verlag Janos Stekovics|year=2001|isbn=3-929330-89-X|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|91}}

The '''renewable-energy industry''' is the part of the [[energy industry]] focusing on new and appropriate [[renewable energy]] technologies. [[Investors]] worldwide have paid greater attention to this emerging industry in recent years. In many cases, this has translated into rapid [[renewable energy commercialization]] and considerable industry expansion. The [[wind power]] and solar [[photovoltaics]] ([[Photovoltaic system|PV]]) industries provide good examples of this.

Renewable energy industries expanded during most of 2008, and by August 2008, there were at least 160 publicly traded renewable energy companies with a [[market capitalization]] greater than $100 million. An estimated $120 billion was invested in renewable energy globally in 2008. 
[[File:GlobalREPowerCapacity-exHydro-Eng.png|thumb|400px|Renewable energy power growth in GW (2004-2011)]]

==Overview==
During 2006/2007, several renewable energy companies went through high profile [[Initial Public Offerings]] (IPOs), resulting in market capitalization near or above $1 billion. These corporations included the solar PV companies [[First Solar]] (USA), [[Trina Solar]] (USA), [[Centrosolar]] (Germany), and [[Renesola]] (U.K.), wind power company [[Iberdrola]] (Spain), and U.S. biofuels producers [[VeraSun Energy]], [[Aventine Renewable Energy|Aventine]], and [[Pacific Ethanol]].&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;

Renewable energy industries expanded during most of 2008, with large increases in manufacturing capacity, diversification of manufacturing locations, and shifts in leadership.&lt;ref name=re/&gt; By August 2008, there were at least 160 publicly traded renewable energy companies with a market capitalization greater than $100 million. The number of companies in this category has expanded from around 60 in 2005.&lt;ref name=ren21-2009&gt;Renewables Global Status Report: 2009 Update. REN21. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|15}}

Some $150 billion was invested in renewable energy globally in 2009, including new capacity (asset finance and projects) and biofuels refineries. This is more than double the 2006 investment figure of $63 billion. Almost all of the increase was due to greater investment in wind power, solar PV, and biofuels.&lt;ref name=ren21-2010&gt;Renewables Global Status Report: 2010. REN21. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 27}}

In 2000, [[venture capital]] (VC) investment in [[renewable energy]] was about 1% of total VC investment. In 2007 that figure was closer to 10%, with solar power alone making up about 3% of the entire Venture Capital asset class of ~$33B. More than 60 start-ups have been funded by
VCs in the last three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greentechmedia.com/assets/pdfs/executivesummaries/VC-Investment-in-Solar-Update-Executive-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Venture capital and [[private equity investments]] in renewable energy companies increased by 167 percent in 2006, according to investment analysts at [[New Energy Finance]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=10528 EERE News: Clean Energy Investments More Than Double in 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

New investment into the sector jumped US$148 billion in 2007, up 60 per cent over 2006, noted a report by the [[Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative]] (SEFI). Wind energy attracted one-third of the new capital and solar one-fifth. But interest in solar is growing rapidly on the back of major technological advances which saw solar investment increase 254 per cent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.financialstandard.com.au/news/view/23561/ Financial Standard - Energy investments surge]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] predicts US$20 trillion will be invested into alternative energy projects over the next 22 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Concentrating solar power==

[[Image:PS10 solar power tower 2.jpg|right|thumb|The 11MW [[PS10 solar power tower]] near Seville in Spain.]]

Since 2004 there has been renewed interest in [[concentrating solar power]] (CSP) and three plants were completed during 2006/2007: the 64 MW [[Nevada Solar One]], a 1 MW trough plant in Arizona, and the 11 MW [[PS10 solar power tower]] in Spain. [[Andasol 1 solar power station|Three 50 MW trough plants]] were under construction in Spain at the end of 2007 with ten additional 50 MW plants planned. In the United States, utilities in California and Florida have announced plans (or contracted for) at least eight new projects totaling more than 2,000 MW. Companies involved in new projects include [[Abengoa|Abengoa Solar]], [[Acciona]], [[Ausra (company)|Ausra]], [[BrightSource Energy]], [[Iberdrola]], [[Solar Euromed]], [[Solar Millennium]] and [[Stirling Energy Systems]].&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp|12 and 19}}&lt;ref name=emerging&gt;[http://www.emerging-energy.com/uploadDocs/GlobalConcentratedSolarPowerMarketsandStrategies2010.pdf Global Concentrated Solar Power Markets and Strategies 2010-2025.

==Biofuels==
[[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil continued its ethanol expansion]] plans which began in the 70's and now has the largest ethanol distribution and the largest fleet of cars run by any mix of ethanol and gasoline.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp| 19}}
[[Image:EthanolPetrol.jpg|right|thumb|Information on pump, California.]]
In the [[ethanol fuel]] industry, the United States dominated, with 130 operating ethanol plants in 2007, and production capacity of 26 billion liters/year (6.87 billion gallons/year), a 60 percent increase over 2005. Another 84 plants were under construction or undergoing expansion, and this will result in a doubled production capacity.
The [[biodiesel]] industry opened many new production facilities during 2006/2007 and continued expansion plans in several countries. New biodiesel capacity appeared throughout Europe, including in
Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp|19}}

[[cellulosic ethanol commercialization|Commercial investment in second-generation biofuels]] began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.&lt;ref name=ren21-2008/&gt;{{rp|19}}

==Employment==

Renewable energy use tends to be more labor-intensive than fossil fuels, and so a transition toward renewables promises employment gains. Globally, about 2.3 million people work either directly in renewables or indirectly in supplier industries. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the PV sector accounts for an estimated 170,000 jobs, and the solar thermal industry accounts for about 624,000.  More than 1 million jobs are located in the biomass and biofuels sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5821 Jobs in Renewable Energy Expanding]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St_Amelia_by_Delaroche.jpg|thumb|right|Preparatory study for ''Saint Amelia'' by [[Paul Delaroche|Delaroche]]]]
'''''Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary''''' is an oil painting by [[Paul Delaroche]] which was investigated in 2016 by the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''

==Lost work==
An oil painting of Saint Amelia by history painter Paul Delaroche was commissioned in 1831 by [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily|Queen Marie-Amélie of France]], wife of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis Philippe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/830070/saint-amelie-queen-of-hungary|title=Raunheim, Hermann (1817-1895) - Saint Amélie, Queen of Hungary|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created as a design for a stained glass window in the Queen's private chapel at the [[Château d'Eu]]. The work was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon of 1834]]. In 1837 the painting was recorded as being hung in the Royal Chapel at the [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris, and was copied in an engraving by Paolo Mercuri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/830069/sainte-amelie-queen-of-hungary|title=Mercuri, Paolo (1804-1884) - Sainte Amélie, Queen of Hungary |website=www.royalcollection.org.uk |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preparatory drawing, in [[chalk]], [[graphite]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] is held by the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=719921&amp;partId=1&amp;people=127343&amp;peoA=127343-2-9&amp;page=1|title=drawing|website=British Museum|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original painting was believed to be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul Delaroche: History Painted|page=165|year=1997|first=Stephen|last=Bann|authorlink=Stephen Bann|publisher=Reaktian Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fake or Fortune?''==
The ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' team investigated a version of the painting, housed at Castle of Park in [[Cornhill, Aberdeenshire]], to determine whether it was the Delaroche original or one of a number of copies. This unsigned version of the painting, was bought in 1989, for about £500, by art dealer the late Neil Wilson, who worked for [[Christie's]] after leaving university. The painting's [[provenance]] was very poor. In the programme, art expert [[Bendor Grosvenor]] showed an 1866 watercolour by [[Joseph Nash]] depicting the painting in the Queen's bedroom at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont House]] in [[Surrey]], where the King and Queen lived after fleeing France following the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]]. After that, the next sighting of the work was when it was sold at Christie's in 1980 as a work by the French artist [[Fleury François Richard]], with the title 'A Queen and her Retinue at Worship'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grosvenor|first1=Bendor| authorlink=Bendor Grosvenor |title='Fake or Fortune?' does Delaroche |url=http://www.arthistorynews.com/articles/4051_Fake_or_Fortune_does_Delaroche |accessdate=10 July 2017 |work=Art History News|date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Work==
Dr. Ali's research focuses on the causes and consequences of environmental conflicts and how ecological factors can promote peace. He has previously served on the faculty of [[Brown University]]’s  [[Watson Institute for International Studies]] and on the visiting faculty for the [[United Nations University for Peace]] ([[Costa Rica]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Curriculum Vitae|publisher=[[University of Delaware]]|url=https://www.ceoe.udel.edu/File%20Library/Our%20People/Profiles/saleem/CV-Saleem.pdf|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his empirical research has focused on environmental conflicts in the mineral sector. In September 2007, he was chosen as one of eight "revolutionary minds" by ''[[Seed magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201203/the.synthesist.htm| magazine=Aramco World | title=The Synthesist | first=Nazish | last=Yar Khan |date=May–June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005 to 2008, he received two grants from the [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] Foundation to investigate the environmental and social impact of gemstone and gold mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation Grant to Create Knowledge Hub on Colored Gemstones|publisher=[[Eureka Alert]]|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/uod-tc042517.php|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also completed a report on oil and gas pipelines as a source of cooperation that was researched while based at the [[Brookings Institution]] research center in Doha, Qatar in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Energizing Peace|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/energizing-peace-the-role-of-pipelines-in-regional-cooperation/|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His report on "Ecological Cooperation in South Asia" was launched in Washington at an event hosted by [[Peter Bergen]] in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ecological Cooperation in South Asia|publisher=[[New America Foundation]]|url=https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/events/ecological-cooperation-in-south-asia-the-way-forward/|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to embarking on an academic career, Dr. Ali worked as an environmental health and safety professional at General Electric. He also served as a consultant for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], and [[Health Canada]].  Yet other of his projects included a mining impact prospectus for the [[Crow Nation]] and research assistance to [[Cultural Survival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Curriculum Vitae|publisher=[[University of Delaware]]|url=https://www.ceoe.udel.edu/File%20Library/Our%20People/Profiles/saleem/CV-Saleem.pdf|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2014, he is also an editor for the University of Chicago Press book series on environmental science, law and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Summits Series on Environmental Science, Law and Policy|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/series/SESLP.html|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Singapore Sling: The Man Who Loved a Corpse''''' ({{lang-el|Singapore Sling: Ο Άνθρωπος που Αγάπησε ένα Πτώμα|italic=yes}}, [[romanization of Greek|tr.]] ''Singapore Sling: O Anthropos pou Agapise ena Ptoma'') is a 1990 Greek [[black and white]] dramatic [[experimental film|experimental]] [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]] and regarded as his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]]. Considered a difficult film to label while still managing to develop something of a [[Cult film|cult]] following throughout the years nonetheless, it was shot in a bizarre manner somewhat resembling [[film noir]] or neo-noir and black comedy as well as the [[exploitation film|exploitation]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], and crime genres mixed with some elements of eroticism and [[horror film|horror]] with sex being used as a power game and received a theatrical release in Greece on 6 December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hardy|editor-first=Phil|editor-link=Phil Hardy (journalist)|year=1995|title=The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror|title-link=The Aurum Film Encyclopedia|volume=3|publisher=New York, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]|pages=478–479|isbn=0-87951-624-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamindemon.com/2009/08/25/review-singapore-sling-a-man-in-love-with-a-corpse/|title=Review: ''Singapore Sling'' – A Man in Love with a Corpse|website=The Dreamin' Demon: Real Life Horror (Reviews: S)|date=25 August 2009|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Nikolaidis' career as a film director in his home country which stretches to the early 1960s he was almost entirely unknown outside Greece before the early 1990s and is still less known outside it and it was only with this film, which has immediately achieved cult status, that international fame came to him and it probably still remains the film for which he is best known today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/06/22/singapore-sling-18-207547/|title=''Singapore Sling'' (18)|last=Rudd|first=Amy|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=22 June 2008|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as exemplified by the fact that it was released on DVD by [[Synapse Films]], the only one of Nikolaidis' films to so far receive a home video release in North America. The film was officially selected for screening at the Rimini Film Festival.

==Plot==
Two mentally ill women who are clearly suffering from not otherwise specified delusional disorders, a mother and a (grown) daughter, live together in a secluded mansion. They are in a relationship and both are recognised for their beauty. They spend their days playing perverse [[BDSM]]-related incestuous games in memory of their [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] patriarch who, when he was still alive, raped his daughter when she was eleven, murdered several servants, and is now a mummified corpse with which the daughter is shown having sex. They occasionally kill their servants and bury their bodies in the garden.

When first glimpsed the psychotic mother-daughter protagonists, half-dressed, are burying their disemboweled chauffeur into a pit, they have just finished to dig in their backyard on a dark and stormy night with thunder and heavy rain. They lay down their shovels and drag out of the bushes, his fresh corpse. He was killed in one of their usual games combining incestuous sex with murder. Shortly after this and at first unnoticed by the two women, a lovesick detective pulls his car up to the residence. He is suffering from a painful bullet wound and an equally painful yearning to track down Laura, his long-missing beloved for whom he has been searching for three years and about whom it is known that she has visited the area. What he does not yet know is that he has stumbled onto the lair of two profoundly insane women who have already lured Laura into their home and brutally killed her (in the process decorating their kitchen with her viscera, as a flashback helpfully shows). It is also revealed that the daughter is physically very similar to Laura and is desperately looking for a man's companionship. 

The duo then easily take the seriously wounded and bleeding detective, having already figured them out to be responsible for Laura's kidnapping, into their home, essentially kidnapping him. As the exhausted detective was silent and apparently refuses to speak, even in order to state his own name, the two women christen him 'Singapore Sling', after they discover a recipe in his pocket notebook for that type of [[Singapore Sling|cocktail]]. They use him as a pawn in their sexually tinged [[Sexual roleplay|role-playing games]] and as a party to their distorted and perverse form of entertainment, during which Singapore Sling, now a prisoner, is tied up, chained to a bed, vomited on, electrocuted, used as a sex slave, and subjected to various other forms of torture and atrocities in which he is forced to participate. However, as Singapore Sling's confinement wears on he regains his strength and takes a more active role in the games. His deranged captors become concerned and alarmed when a sharp kitchen knife, belonging to the late father, goes missing and they discover Singapore Sling digging a deep hole in their backyard. As psychotic as these two are, they are still lucid enough to recognize that a killing is imminent, if not two or even three. In an atmosphere of decadence and dark madness, the characters gradually sink into the depths of their subconscious mind.

A few days later, the daughter decides that she is fed up with having to suffer under the yoke of maternal authority, and, together with Singapore Sling, murders her mother. Singapore Sling then takes what up until now used to be the mother's role in the sexual games. However, during one of these games, a reenactment of Laura's murder, he stabs the daughter, playing Laura, with the aforementioned missing kitchen knife now attached to his penis. The daughter, while bleeding to death, shoots Singapore Sling and then he goes out to the garden and falls into the pit which he himself had recently dug. The film hence ends, in short, with all three characters dead.

==Themes==
The film's protagonist's search for a woman named Laura is a direct reference to the classic [[film noir]] ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) by American director [[Otto Preminger]]. The film uses as background music, in addition to classical music by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Giaches de Wert]], the compositions used by [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Julie London]] in ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]).

==Reception==
Director [[Nikos Nikolaidis]] said the following about this film's reception during an interview: "When I was shooting ''Singapore Sling'', I was under the impression that I was making a comedy with elements taken from Ancient Greek Tragedy... Later, when some European and American critics characterized it as 'one of the most disturbing films of all times,' I started to feel that something was wrong with me. Then, when British censors banned its release in England, I finally realized that something is wrong with all of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cult-cinema.ru/reviews/s/singapore_sling/|script-title=ru:''Singapore Sling''/''Сингапурский Слинг'' (1990)|last=Меренков|first=Сергей|date=21 December 2007|website=CULT Cinema: Рецензин, S|accessdate=30 August 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic neo-psychedelia band [[Singapore Sling (band)|Singapore Sling]] is named after the film. As the band's frontman Henrik Björnsson explained in a June 2003 interview with Belgium's [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|VRT Radio 1]]: "We had a first gig. It was booked and we didn't have a name and I had been looking for a film called ''Singapore Sling'' for a long time. I couldn't find it anywhere.

{{redirect|Eco-friendly products|the marketing use of this term|Environmentally friendly}}
'''[[Sustainability|Sustainable]] products''' are those products that provide environmental, social and economic benefits while protecting [[public health]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] over their whole life cycle, from the extraction of [[raw material]]s until the final disposal.

== Scope of definition ==
According to Belz, Frank-Martin.,&lt;ref&gt;Frank-Martin B. and Peattie, K. (2009). Sustainability Marketing: A Global Perspective. Wiley, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; the definition of sustainable product has six characteristics:
* [[Customer satisfaction]]: any products or services that do not meet customer needs will not survive in the market in a long term.
* Dual focus: compared with purely environmental products, sustainable products focus both on ecological and social significance.
* Life-cycle orientation: sustainable product is constantly environmental-friendly during its entire life. That is, from the moment the raw materials are extracted to the moment the final product is disposed of, there must be no permanent damage to the environment.
* Significant improvements: sustainable products have to contribute to dealing with socio-ecological problems on a global level, or provide measurable improvements in socio-ecological product performance.
* [[Continuous improvement process|Continuous improvement]]: since the state of knowledge, technologies and societal expectation keep on developing, so sustainable products should also be continuously improved regarding social and environmental variation.
* Competing offers: sustainable products may still lag behind competing offers, therefore, the competing offers may serve as a [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] regarding social and ecological performance.

[[Michael Braungart]] and [[William McDonough]]'s book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Michael Braungart and William McDonough (2002). Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. North Point Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; expands on the life-cycle part of this definition. They suggest that we should make every material and product so that it can be disassembled when its use is over, and so that all the materials of which it is made can then be returned to the Earth after composting, or endlessly recycled as raw materials.

=== Sustainable product standards ===

=== Overall standards ===
'''Nordic Swan Ecolabel'''
The standard of [[Nordic swan|Nordic Swan Ecolabel]], which is distributed in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]], mainly refers to distinguish products that have a positive effect on the environment. Or rather, it has climate requirements that limit the amount of CO2 emissions where it is most relevant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordic-ecolabel.org/criteria/product-groups/&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3,000 products, mainly household chemicals, paper products, office machinery and building materials have been issued with this label. The criteria account environmental factors through the product's life cycle (raw material extraction, production and distribution, use and refuse). Thus the most important parameters are consumption of natural resources and energy, emissions into air, water and soil, generation of waste and noise.

'''Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)'''

[[Global Reporting Initiative|GRI]] frames out and disseminates global sustainability reporting guidelines for ‘voluntary use by organizations reporting on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of their activities, products and services’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalreporting.org/ReportingFramework/G31Guidelines/&lt;/ref&gt; According to GRI Guidelines, reporters should take into consideration stakeholders’ interests and use the [[social indicator]]s and others that more accurately depict the social and ecological performance of the organization.

'''Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)'''

[[Life-cycle assessment|LCA]] evaluates and discloses the environmental benefits of products over their full life cycle, from raw materials extraction to final disposition. Since 1997 the process of conducting LCA studies has been standardized by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).

=== Product-oriented standards ===
'''Organic Food Labeling'''[[File:National Organic Program.jpg|thumb|right|The National Organic Program (run by the USDA) is responsible for the legal definition of organic in the United States and issue organic certification.]]
[[Organic food]] are foods that are produced using methods involving no agricultural synthetic inputs, for instance, synthetic [[pesticide]]s, [[chemical fertilizer]]s, [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMO), and are not processed using [[irradiation]], industrial [[solvent]]s, or chemical [[food additive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Gary J. &amp; Albala, Ken, ed (2007). The business of food: encyclopedia of the food and drink industries. ABC-CLIO. p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[United States]], [[European Union]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and many other industrialized countries require food producers to acquire special critieria or certification to market their products as "organic". Apparently, organic food producers emphasize sustainable [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the social-ecological attributes such as soil, water and the whole ecosystem. International organizations such as the [[Organic Consumers Association]] supervise the development of organic food. According to the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP) in the US, a voluntary green-and-white seal on foods’ packaging denotes that a product is at least 95% organic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MSC Labeling'''

The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) is an independent non-profit organization which was established in 1997 in order to cope with the [[overfishing]] problem. Fisheries that are assessed and meet the standard can use the MSC blue ecolabel. The MSC mission is to 'reward sustainable fishing practices’. As of the end of 2010, more than 1,300 fisheries and companies had achieved a Marine Stewardship Council certification.&lt;ref&gt;List of Companies certified to MSC. www.ekobai.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FSC Labeling'''

The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) is an international non-profit organization established in 1993 to ‘promote forest management that is environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsc.org&lt;/ref&gt; Its main responsibilities for achieving the goal are standard framing, independent certification issuing and labeling. FSC directly or indirectly addresses issues such as [[illegal logging]], [[deforestation]] and [[global warming]] and has positive effects on [[economic development]], [[environmental conservation]], [[poverty alleviation]] and social and political empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;effects of FSC Certification in Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Sweden and the UK. WWF (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Experiences with voluntary standards initiatives and related multi-stakeholder dialogues. B. Lang. GTZ (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair Trade Labeling'''
[[File:EKO symbol RGB.jpg|right|thumb|[[EKOenergy]] is an ecolabel for energy in Europe]]
Although there is no universally accepted definition of [[fair trade]], Fair trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) most commonly refer to a definition developed by FINE, an informal association of four international fair trade networks (Fair trade Labeling Organizations International, [[World Fair Trade Organization]] - formerly International Fair Trade Association, [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]]): fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers – especially in the South. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Labelling Organizations International www.fairtrade.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U. S. Green Building Council LEED Rating System'''

The LEED Green Building Rating System evaluates environmental performance of all buildings over their life, providing the definitive standard for what constitutes a [[Green building|"green" building]], persuading the consumer and building industry to develop products that are more environmentally and economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;LEEDv3". US Green Building Council. http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1970. Retrieved 20 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EKOenergy label'''

[[EKOenergy]] is an ecolabel originating in Finland. It is becoming the continent wide ecolabel for energy, which is supported by number European NGOs. It evaluates sustainability of electricity products on open energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.res-e.org |title= Renewable Electricity Standard for Europe|author= |year= 2012|work= RES-E Standard|publisher= RES-E Initiative Group|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Seal'''

[[Green Seal]] is a North American non-profit ecolabel organization established in 1989. It generates life cycle-based sustainability standards for products, services and companies in addition to offering third party [[independent test organization]] certification for those meeting its standards. Green Seal was the first non-profit environmental certification program established in the [[United States]]. It currently has certified nearly 4,000 products and services within 400 categories.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainability at Yellowstone http://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/environment/green-seal-certification/green-seal/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable product policies ==
'''International'''

Since 1998, the branch of the '''[[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP)''' has undertaken several national programs or action plans on [[sustainable consumption]] and production.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2007), Assessment of Policy instruments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Buildings.http://www.unep.org/themes/consumption/index.asp?page=home&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[United Nations]] is responsible for administrating the Marrakech Process&lt;ref&gt;http://esa.un.org/marrakechprocess/&lt;/ref&gt; and developing the ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework through Regional Marrakech Process Consultations, whose goal is to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production (SCP). 
'''[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)'''’s Environmental Directorate has also done comprehensive work on the environmental impacts of sustainable consumption and production. One of current OECD projects is reviewing measures for sustainable manufacturing production.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (1999), Towards More Sustainable Household Consumption Patterns. http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0,2340,en_2649_34331_2397498_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regions and countries'''

'''European Union''': on 16 July 2008 the [[European Commission]] presented the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy (SCP/SIP) Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2011), [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/escp_en.htm Sustainable Consumption and  Production and Sustainable Industrial  Policy Action Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; which clarifies the United Nations’ Marrakech Process on Sustainable Consumption and Production and global ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework and it is finally adopted by the Council on 4 December 2008 and is updated regularly. It includes a series of proposals on sustainable consumption and production to target EU goals for [[environmental sustainability]], [[economic growth]] and [[public welfare]], which are as follows:
* A proposal to extend mandatory labeling requirements which is relevant to the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of products according to the 1992 Energy Labeling Directive.
* A proposal to widen the covering fields of voluntary [[EU Ecolabel]] of products (e.g., including food and beverage products) and streamline the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/product-policy/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|right|Sample EU energy efficiency label]]
* A proposal for an independent communication on green public procurement. This communication identifies economic priority sectors, establishes common environmental criteria and  guides to implement green public procurement by Member States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publicprocurement/modernising_rules/conferences/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposal for the revision of the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) to enlarge the number of companies involved, including companies outside the EU, and decrease the administrative costs for Small and Mediums Sized Enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Proposals on sustainable consumption and production that will contribute to improve the environmental efficiency of products and increase the demand for more pro-environmental goods and production technologies.

'''The [[United States]]''' government does not have a standardized national policy or strategy for sustainable consumption and production. However, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) develops extensive sustainability programs on water, agriculture, energy, and ecosystem, etc. At the same time, the [[U.S. Department of State]]’s Sustainable Development Partnerships web page provides considerable information about the U.S. government's sustainable development initiatives to help other countries set up and implement their own development strategies in social and ecological terms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/international/factsheets/200810-sustainable-consumption-and-production.htm#UNEP&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[United Kingdom]]''' government considers Sustainable Consumption and Production is one of the four priority sectors identified in the 2005 UK Sustainable Development Strategy. The UK government is carrying out a series of actions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/&lt;/ref&gt;  to achieve goals of sustainable consumption and production in public and private areas respectively.

'''Norwegian''' Ministry of the Environment founded [[Norway]]’s Green in Practice (GRIP), which is a public-private foundation established in 1996 to promote sustainable consumption and production. At the same time, Norway’s Ministry of Finance has primary responsibility to fund the strategy of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://greennow.net/Felles/english.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Australia]]n''' government requires that certain electrical products for sale should contain mandatory energy-efficiency labeling to provide consumers with information that helps reduce energy use and green house gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyrating.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable product design ==
{{See also|Sustainable design}}
Conventionally, [[environmental management system]]s have always addressed the impacts of products on local surroundings. ISO 14001 (ISO 14001:3) provides a formalized framework for managing significant environmental aspects and improving environmental performance through a ‘‘Plan, Do, Check, Review’’ continual improvement cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly K, Olds R, Blechinger F, Reynolds D and Beckett-Fumell Z (2004): [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225664765_ISO_14001_-_Effective_management_of_sustainable_design ISO 14001 – effective management of sustainable design]. The Journal of Sustainable Product Design 4:43–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the phase of [[product planning]], consumer demands and market opportunities are evaluated. At this time a product description and execution plans for a successful program launch are developed and product requirements are defined.
During the phase of product development, specific design specifications are finalized, models are built, and designs are reviewed and released for manufacture planning. Once manufacturing begins, the product is commercially launched for general availability and volume deployed to the marketplace. Once a [[prototype]] is available, LCA is used as a fundamental standard to identify significant social and environmental aspects and quantify environmental impact.
Once a product is launched into market and becomes commercialized, it enters the maturity phase, which means that the sales and the profits both reach the peak. The maturity phase contains two stages: during the first stage of maturity, the customer is utilizing the product. Modifications may still be made to the product to enhance or change it. The product enters the second stage of maturity when it approaches near to the decline phase. 
Where applicable, end-of-life products are taken back and subsequently reused or recycled efficiently. While being a legal requirement in the EU, the take back of end-of-life products offers the chance to review the final life cycle stage of a product through direct contact with recyclers. This knowledge can then be applied to future designs and product improvement.

'''''Think: Philosophy for Everyone''''' is an [[academic journal]] created to forge a direct link between contemporary philosophy and the general public. The central aim of the journal is to provide easily accessible and engaging writing by philosophers pre-eminent in their fields to a wide audience, unimpeded by academic jargon and technicality. The journal is sponsored by the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] in London and published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. Think's editor is [[Stephen Law]].

''Think'' expressly aims to counter the popular impression that philosophy is pointless and wholly detached from everyday life. It also aims to expose some of the bad philosophy that currently passes as accepted wisdom, and offers contemporary philosophers the chance to help nurture and encourage philosophers of the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdcnet.org/think.html Journal website at Philosophy Documentation Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215022241/http://www.pdcnet.org/think.html |date=December 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tipu's Tiger front view 2006AH4173.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A Museum]], London showing the prostrate European being attacked]]
'''Tipu's Tiger''' or '''Tippu's Tiger''' is an eighteenth-century [[automaton]] or mechanical toy created for [[Tipu Sultan]], the  ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in India. The carved and painted wood casing represents a tiger savaging a near life-size European man. Mechanisms inside the tiger and man's bodies make one hand of the man move, emit a wailing sound from his mouth and grunts from the tiger. In addition a flap on the side of the tiger folds down to reveal the keyboard of a small [[pipe organ]] with 18 notes.

The tiger was created for Tipu and makes use of his personal emblem of the tiger and expresses his hatred of his enemy, the British of the [[East India Company]]. The tiger was discovered in his [[Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace|summer palace]] after East India Company troops [[Battle of Seringapatam|stormed Tipu's capital]] in 1799. The [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]], [[Lord Mornington]] sent the tiger to Britain initially intending it to be an exhibit in the [[Tower of London]]. First exhibited to the London public in 1808 in [[East India House]], then the offices of the East India Company in London, it was later transferred to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) in 1880 (accession number 2545(IS)).&lt;ref name="V&amp;A web"&gt;{{cite web

Tipu's Tiger was originally made for Tipu Sultan (also referred to as Tippoo Saib, Tippoo Sultan and other epithets in nineteenth-century literature) in the Kingdom of Mysore (today in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]) around 1795.&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle11"/&gt; Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem, employing tiger motifs on his weapons, on the uniforms of his soldiers, and on the decoration of his palaces.&lt;ref name=ModernAsianStudies&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brittlebank | first1 = K. | title = Sakti and Barakat: The Power of Tipu's Tiger.

Tipu had inherited power from his father [[Hyder Ali]], a Muslim soldier who had risen to become ''dalwai'' or commander-in-chief under the ruling Hindu [[Wodeyar dynasty]], but from 1760 was in effect the ruler of the kingdom. Hyder, after initially trying to ally with the British against the [[Maratha]]s, had later become their firm enemy, as they represented the most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom, and Tipu grew up with violently anti-British feelings.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=23-24}}

The tiger formed part of a specific group of large [[caricature]] images commissioned by Tipu showing European, often specifically British, figures being attacked by tigers or elephants, or being executed, tortured and humiliated and attacked in other ways. Many of these were painted by Tipu's orders on the external walls of houses in the main streets of Tipu's capital, [[Seringapatam]].{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=24}} Tipu was in "[[Franco-Indian alliances#Proposals of Tippu Sahib|close co-operation]]" with the French, who were at war with Britain and still had [[French India|a presence]] in South India, and some of the French craftsmen who visited Tipu's court probably contributed to the internal works of the tiger.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=24-25}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically about half an inch thick, and now much reinforced on the inside following bomb damage in World War II. There are many openings at the head end, formed to match the pattern of the inner part of the painted tiger stripes, which allow the sounds from the pipes within to be heard better, and the tiger is "obviously male". The top part of the tiger's body can be lifted off to inspect the mechanics by removing four screws. The construction of the human figure is similar but the wood is much thicker.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=66}} Examination and analysis by the V&amp;A conservation department has determined that much of the current paint has been restored or overpainted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6099083 V&amp;A Conservation in Action - Tippoo's Tiger] video, accessed, 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure is clearly in European costume, but authorities differ as to whether it represents a soldier or civilian; the current text on the V&amp;A website avoids specifying, other than describing the figure as "European".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html Tippoo's Tiger on Victoria &amp; Albert Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825074241/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html |date=25 August 2006 }}; to Ord-Hume he is "a European soldier" (Part 1, 21), but to de Almeida and Gilpin he is "an English gentleman" (p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a "regular grunting sound" simulating the roar of the tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, summarized at p. 64 and throughout in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of both shell and workings, and analysis of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ (many have been replaced), indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture. The presence of French artisans and French army engineers within Tipu's court has led many historians to suggest there was French input into the mechanism of this automaton.&lt;ref name=Archer&gt;{{cite book

==History==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger Salmond 1800.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The first published illustration of Tipu's Tiger in [[James Salmond]]'s book of 1800]]
Tipu's Tiger was part of the extensive plunder from Tipu's palace captured in the fall of Seringapatam, in which Tipu died, on 4 May 1799, at the culmination of the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]]. An ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the Governor General of the East India Company, [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], wrote a memorandum describing the discovery of the object:&lt;ref&gt;The St James's Chronicle, April 1800; also reported in the Edinburgh Caledonian Mercury 24 April 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stronge|2009|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"In a room appropriated for musical instruments was found an article which merits particular notice, as another proof of the deep hate, and extreme loathing of Tippoo Saib towards the English. This piece of mechanism represents a royal Tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an Organ, within the body of the Tyger. The sounds produced by the Organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress intermixed with the roar of a Tyger. The machinery is so contrived that while the Organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up, to express his helpless and deplorable condition. The whole of this design was executed by Order of Tippoo Sultaun. It is imagined that this memorial of the arrogance and barbarous cruelty of Tippoo Sultan may be thought deserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

The earliest published drawing of Tippoo's Tyger was the frontispiece for the book "A Review of the Origin, Progress and Result, of the Late Decisive War in Mysore with Notes" by [[James Salmond]], published in London in 1800. It preceded the move of the exhibit from India to England and had a separate preface titled "Description of the Frontispiece" which said:&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle24"&gt;As quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.tigerandthistle.net/thistle24.htm|title=2.4 Tippoo's Tiger: Frontispiece |author=Wood, Col Mark |year=2000 |website=The Tiger and the Thistle - Tipu Sultan and the Scots in India |publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland. |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"This drawing is taken from a piece of mechanism representing a royal tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an organ within the body of the tyger, and a row of keys of natural notes. The sounds produced by the organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress, intermixed with the roar of a tyger. The machinery is so contrived, that while the organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up to express his helpless and deplorable condition.

The whole of this design is as large as life, and was executed by order of Tippoo Sultaun, who frequently amused himself with a sight of this emblematic triumph of the Khoodadaud, over the English, Sircar. The piece of machinery was found in a room of the palace at Seringapatam appropriated for the reception of musical instruments, and called the Rag Mehal.

The original wooden figure from which the drawing is taken will be forwarded, by the ships of this season, to the Chairman of the Court of Directors, to be presented to his Majesty. It is imagined that this characteristic emblem of the ferocious animosity of Tippoo Sultaun against the British Nation may not be thought undeserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

Unlike Tipu's throne, which also featured a large tiger, and many other treasures in the palace, the materials of Tipu's Tiger had no intrinsic value, which together with its striking iconography is what preserved it and brought it back to England essentially intact. The Governors of the East India Company had at first intended to present the tiger to the Crown, with a view to it being displayed in the [[Tower of London]], but then decided but to keep it for the Company. After some time in store, during which period the first of many "misguided and wholly unjustified endeavours at "improving" the piece" from a musical point of view may have taken place, it was displayed in the reading-room of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] Museum and Library at [[East India House]] in [[Leadenhall Street]], London from July 1808.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=29-31}}&lt;ref&gt;153-157&lt;/ref&gt;

It rapidly became a very popular exhibit, and the crank-handle controlling the wailing and grunting could apparently be freely turned by the public. The French author [[Gustave Flaubert]] visited London in 1851 to see the [[Great Exhibition]], writes [[Julian Barnes]], but finding nothing of interest in [[The Crystal Palace]], visited the East India Company Museum where he was greatly enamoured by Tipu's Tiger.&lt;ref name="Pritchett Symbols"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/tipusultan/symbols/symbols.html |title=Symbols |author=Pritchett, Prof Frances W.  |year=2000 |website=Tipu Sultan of Mysore (r. 1782-99) |publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1843 it was reported that "The machine or organ ... is getting much out of repair, and does not altogether realize the expectation of the visitor".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the crank-handle disappeared, to the great relief of students using the reading-room in which the tiger was displayed, and ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' later reported that
{{quote|"These shrieks and growls were the constant plague of the student busy at work in the Library of the old India House, when the Leadenhall Street public, unremittingly, it appears, were bent on keeping up the performances of this barbarous machine. Luckily, a kind fate has deprived him of his handle, and stopped up, we are happy to think, some of his internal organs... and we do sincerely hope he will remain so, to be seen and admired, if necessary, but to be heard no more".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 79, quoting ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', June 5, 1869, p. 766&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Leadenhall Street Museum.png|thumb|left|300px|Engraving of the East India Company Museum in Leadenhall Street. Tipu's Tiger can be seen to the left.]]

When the East India Company was taken over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, [[Whitehall]] until 1868, when it moved down the road to the new [[India Office]], which occupied part of the building still used by today's [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in [[South Kensington]], which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V&amp;A records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] through the summer and spring.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keats-Shelley"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30210016 |title=News and Notes|author=Mann, Phyllis G. |journal=Keats-Shelley Journal, Vol 6.

In recent times, Tipu's Tiger has formed an essential part of museum exhibitions exploring the historical interface between Eastern and Western civilisation, colonialism, ethnic histories and other subjects, one such being held at the Victoria and Albert Museum itself in autumn 2004 titled "Encounters:the meeting of Asia and Europe, 1500&amp;ndash;1800".&lt;ref name="Jaffer (2007)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffer |first1=Amin |editor1-first=Francisco José |editor1-last=Gomes |others=Alexandra Curvelo, Clare Anderson , Bhaswati Bhattacharya , Kévin Le Doudic , Momin Chaudhury , Samuel Berthet , Bhagwan S.

The replica itself also had an earlier Scottish association, having been made in 1986 for 'The Enterprising Scot' exhibition, which was held to commemorate the October 1985 merger of the [[Royal Scottish Museum]] and the [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] to form a new entity - the [[National Museum of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tiger11.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206054703/http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tiger11.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 February 2008 |title=1.1 Tippoo's Tiger |author=Unattributed |year=2000 |website=The Tiger and the Thistle - Tipu Sultan and the Scots in India |publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland. |accessdate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Tipu's Tiger is arguably the best-known single work in the Victoria and Albert Museum as far as the general public is concerned. It is a "must-see" highlight for school-children's visits to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and functions as an iconic representation of the museum, replicated in various forms of memorabilia in the museum shops including [[postcard]]s, model kits and stuffed toys.&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kromm|first1=Jane|last2=Bakewell|first2=Susan Benforado|title=A history of visual culture: Western civilization from the 18th to the 21st century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO2scveOMokC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=17 July 2011|date=2 February 2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-492-1|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors can no longer operate the mechanism since the device is now kept in a glass case.

Tipu's Tiger is also notable as a literal image of a tiger killing a European, an important symbol in England at the time, and from about 1820 the "Death of Munro" became one of the scenes in the repertoire of [[Staffordshire pottery]] figurines.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=26}}&lt;ref name="de Almeida, 38"/&gt; Tiger-hunting in the [[British Raj]], is also considered to represent not just the political subjugation of India, but in addition, the triumph over India's environment.&lt;ref name=Sramek2006/&gt; The iconography persisted and during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] ran a political cartoon showing the Indian rebels as a tiger, attacking a victim in an identical pose to Tipu's Tiger, being defeated by the British forces shown by the larger figure of a lion.

Motives for collection of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter as having a social and cultural context.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kalter |first1=Barrett  |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Review Essay: "Shopping, Collecting, and Feeling at Home" |journal=Eighteenth-Century Fiction |volume=20 |issue=3, Article 11 |pages= 469–477|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth_century_fiction/v020/20.3.kalter.html |doi= 10.1353/ecf.0.0008|accessdate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated by the need to display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt; In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and ''objet's d'art''&amp;nbsp; from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace in the minds of the British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt;

==As a musical instrument==
[[File:Tipu Sultan's Tiger.JPG|thumb|Side view, showing how the handle when turned gets in the way of the player of the keyboard]]

In a detailed study published in 1987 of the tiger's musical and noise-making functions, Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume concluded that since coming to Britain, "the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked, and in doing so much of its original operating principles have been destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31, though his main discussion of the matter is in his Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ranks of pipes in the organ (as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions), each "comprising eighteen notes, [which] are nominally of 4ft pitch and are [[unison]]s - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch. This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a [[Voix céleste|celeste]] effect. ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature".{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|p=69}} The tiger's grunt is made by a single pipe in the tiger's head and the man's wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate [[bellows]] located in the man's chest, where they can be accessed by unbolting and lifting off the tiger. The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted "grunt-pipe" until it reaches a point where it slips down "to fall against its fixed lower-board or reservoir, discharging the air to form the grunting sound"{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|pp=64-66, photos 67-68}} Today all the sound-making functions rely on the crank-handle to power them, though Ord-Hume believes this was not originally the case.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}

Works on the noise-making functions included those made over several decades by the famous organ-building firm [[Henry Willis &amp; Sons]], and Henry Willis III, who worked on the tiger in the 1950s, contributed an account to a monograph by Mildred Archer of the V&amp;A. Ord-Hume is generally ready to exempt Willis work from his scathing comments on other drastic restorations, which "vandalism" is assumed to be by unknown earlier organ-builders.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 30, and Part 2 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
There was a detailed account of the sound-making functions in ''[[The Penny Magazine]]'' in 1835, whose anonymous author evidently understood "things mechanical and organs in particular".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 75, preceding his full reproduction of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; From this and Ord-Hume's own investigations, he concluded that the original operation of the man's "wail" had been intermittent, with a wail only being produced after every dozen or so grunts from the tiger above, but that at some date after 1835 the mechanism had been altered to make the wail continuous, and that the bellows for the wail had been replaced with smaller and weaker ones, and the operation of the moving arm altered.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/8973957 video] of [[David Dimbleby]] playing the grunt and wail only&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzling features of the present instrument include the placing of the handle, which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ord-Hume, using the 1835 account, concludes that originally the handle (which is a nineteenth-century British replacement, probably of a French original) only operated the grunt and wail, while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows, now replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 71, 73, 75, 77, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard, which is largely original, is "unique in construction", with "square ivory buttons" with round [[lathe]]-turned tops instead of conventional keys. Though the mechanical functioning of each button is "practical and convenient" they are spaced such that "it is almost impossible to stretch the hand to play an octave".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, 73, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The buttons are marked with small black spots, differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The two stop control knobs for the organ are located, "rather confusingly", a little below the tiger's testicles.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 64&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is now rarely played, but there is a V&amp;A video of a recent performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6699473 Vimeo.com] ''Conservation in Action - Playing Tippoo's Tiger Part 2'', and [http://vimeo.com/6099330 ''Part 1'', with the top of the tiger removed], accessed 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authority and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. Between 2011 and 2012, following some concerns on opaque activities which accompanied the process of [[privatisation of the media in Croatia]], the government initiated the reform of the law on transparency of media ownership with the aim to avoid the concealment of information on media ownership structure.

The Croatian law provides the disclosure of information that are sufficient to establish who formally holds shares in the [[Media of Croatia|media organisations operating in Croatia]]. However, in practice, some obstacles have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, Croatia TMO consultation, July 2013. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some unclear aspects in the new legal framework which is the result of uncoordinated legal developments needed to complement the original Media Act with provisions to be applied to electronic media, which emerged several years later and that are now covered by a dedicated law, namely the Electronic Media Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the information disclosed can be accessed by the public at large, but, as a matter of fact, this is quite uncommon. In Croatia, the public debate on media ownership transparency developed only recently, in connection with the amendments to the Media Act and Electronic Media Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General overview==
{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

Transparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. It is an essential component of any democratic media system and its crucial for [[media pluralism]] and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2013/12/11/the-transparency-of-media-ownership/ Mark Thompson, Media Plurality Series: The Transparency of Media Ownership, 11 December 2013. Retrieved 31 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes available all the information needed for finding out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. The importance of transparency of media ownership for any democratic and pluralist society has been broadly recognised by the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission's High-Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2013/12/11/the-transparency-of-media-ownership/ Mark Thompson, 11 December 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Council of Europe]].

To ensure that the public knows who effectively owns and influences the media, national legal frameworks should ensure the disclosure of at least the following basic information:
* name and contact details of the media outlets; 
* constitutional documents; size of shareholdings over a given threshold;
* name and contact details of direct owners with a given percentage of shareholding;
* identity of the persons with indirect control or have a significant interest in a given media company;
* citizenship/residence status of individuals with at least a certain shareholding percentage;
* country of domicile of company with at least a given shareholding percentage.

Importantly, to understand who really owns and controls a specific media outlet it is necessary to check who is beyond the official [[Shareholder|shareholdings]] and scrutinise indirect, controlling and [[beneficial ownership]] which refers on shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/TMO_Recommendations_05_November_2013.pdf Access-Info Europe, 4 November 2013, Ten recommendations on transparency of media ownership, 4 November 2013. Retrieved 30 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; To be meaningful and easily accessible by the citizens and national media authorities, this information should be updated, searchable, free and reusable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/TMO_Recommendations_05_November_2013.pdf Access-Info Europe, 4 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Media of Croatia}}

In 2011, concerns about opaque media financial flows led to changes to the laws regulating media ownership transparency to make possible the identification of media owners beyond a company back to individuals. Indeed, the relevant laws have been updated to ensure better ownership transparency of media publishers, in particular to avoid the concealment of the real media ownership structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The process of privatisation of the print media in Croatia, which began in 2000, had been accompanied by corruption scandals and rumours of [[money laundering]] and the involvement of criminal groups in the sales of the biggest Croatian newspapers, i.e. ''[[Jutarnji list]]'', ''[[Večernji list|Večerni List]]'' and ''[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, Country case study: Croatia, 2013. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The names of the real owners of these media was hidden behind secret contracts and informal agreements involving politicians, police and other high-profile individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to the Media Act and the Electronic Media Act were very quick and passed with limited consultation by the Parliament in July 2011 for the Media Act and in June 2012 for the Electronic Media Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
Transparency of media ownership in Croatia is regulated by the Media Law (2011) and the Electronic Media Law (2012). These rules apply to all the media sectors, i.e. print, broadcast and online media which are required to regularly provide and update information on their shareholders. These laws contain provisions for disclosing ownership information to: the relevant media authorities, i.e. the Electronic Media Council in the case on online media (Electronic Media Act); to independent professional and business organisations such as the Croatian Chamber of Economy and other corporate and trade registers (Media Act); or directly to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the Croatian legal framework requires media to reveal enough information to make possible the identification of their owners, be it an individual or a company. This includes data on all [[Shareholder|shareholdings]] over 1%, disclosure of [[beneficial ownership]] and of people with indirect interests and control as well as a prohibition on "secret" ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The information disclosed are provided directly to the public via the web and Official Gazette.

Upon request, the Croatian Chamber of Economy, which is responsible for collecting ownership data, must guarantee [[public access to the information]] submitted to it. This is in compliance with the recognised [[right of access to information]] under the Act on the Right to Access Information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments have had little impact on the ownership structure of Croatian media, which remain questionable. This is because most of the privatisation, which in many cases was reported to be suspicious or controversial, were completed before the amended laws entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transparency of media ownership in practice==
Despite the good provisions enshrined in the reformed legal framework which built upon existing obligations, the lack of consultation that led to the amendments to the Media Act and the Electronic Media Act resulted in a series of shortcomings especially with regard to monitoring and enforcement of the laws. For instance, in practice, media companies in Croatia do not always comply with their obligation to publish information on indirect ownership and the law doesn't foresee a mechanism for monitoring, checking compliance and apply sanctions. Indeed, the Media act does not provide for effective mechanism enabling the Croatian Chamber of Economy to check that the information received are updated and correct. Given the scarcity of resources assigned to it, the Chamber has to rely on the assistance of other authorities such as the Croatian Competition Agency and the Company Register.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Another critical point of the Croatian system regulating transparency of media ownership is that it does not guarantee the full disclosure of information on individuals holding shares of a media company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/13230 Access Info-Europe, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, often the name of a company is not enough for providing information on the individuals behind it. For example, on the basis of the information provided under the law regulating transparency of media ownership the media companies ''Europa digital d.o.o''., ''Slobodna Dalmacija'', ''EPH Media'' and ''Gloria Groupa'' apparently don't have anything in common, but they are all subsidiary companies within the ''[[Hanza Media|EPH group]]'', owned by ''[[Funke Mediengruppe|WAZ]]'' and the businessman [[Ninoslav Pavić]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_1.pdf Media integrity matters: reclaiming public service values in media and journalism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković ; assistant editor Jovana Mihajlović Trbovc&amp;#93;. – 1st ed. – Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies, 2014. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in practice, media outlets do not always disclose information on indirect ownership as required by the law. For example, the only shareholder listed for the media company ''Vecernji list d.d''., which issues the daily paper ''[[Večernji list|Vecernji list]]'' is Styria Media International AG from Graz. Other relevant ownership information are not disclosed, for instance information regarding the important shareholders of Styra Media International AG or whether that company holds some shares for another person or a company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-info.org/tmo/12124 Access-Info Europe, July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the publication of data in the Official Gazette is not monitored and since there is there is not a special issue of the Official Gazette listing the updates occurred during the year the search is complex and time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_1.pdf Media integrity matters: reclaiming public service values in media and journalism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković ; assistant editor Jovana Mihajlović Trbovc&amp;#93;. – 1st ed. – Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies, 2014. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In sum, despite the fact that the laws on transparency of media ownership are well defined, in practice is quite difficult to assess the actual ownership structures and reconstruct the networks of ownership and connected persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_1.pdf Media integrity matters: reclaiming public service values in media and journalism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković ; assistant editor Jovana Mihajlović Trbovc&amp;#93;. – 1st ed. – Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies, 2014. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is exacerbated by the fact that, according to the Croatian law, different agencies are in charge of collecting data on ownership – the Council for Electronic media is responsible for online media and the Croatian Chamber of Commerce for print media – without a unique centralised monitoring system working across print, radio, television and online media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monitor.cmpf.eui.eu/mpm2015/results/croatia/ Media Pluralism Monitor 2015, Croatia. Retrieved 19 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the European Commission organised a consultative conference on transparency of media ownership and Croatia was mentioned as "a good practice" in this context. However, many panellists participating at the conference highlighted that it is important to insist on the improvement of the legal framework but that is not enough as, according to experts, it is more important to know who effectively controls the owners than who nominally owns the media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2015-croatia.pdf IREX, Europe &amp; Eurasia Sustainability Index 2015 – Croatia.

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], {{circa|1486}}]]
'''Venus Anadyomene'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀφροδίτη Ἀναδυομένη; ἀναδυομένη, ''anadyomenē'', meaning "rising up"; ''Aphrodite Anadyomene'' is preferred by some writers, for consistency.&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek, "Venus Rising From the Sea") is one of the iconic representations of [[Aphrodite]], made famous in a much-admired painting by [[Apelles]], now lost, but described in [[Natural History (encyclopedia)|Pliny's ''Natural History'']], with the anecdote that the great Apelles employed [[Campaspe]], a mistress of [[Alexander the Great]], for his model. According to [[Athenaeus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]]. ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', Book XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;  the idea of Aphrodite rising from the sea was inspired by the courtesan [[Phryne]], who, during the time of the festivals of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinia]] and [[Poseidon]]ia, often swam nude in the sea. A scallop shell, often found in Venus Anadyomenes, is a symbol of the female [[vulva]].

==Antiquity==
[[File:Aphrodite Anadyomene from Pompeii cropped.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Pompeii|Pompeian]] mural of Venus Anadyomene]]
According to [[Greek mythology]], [[Aphrodite#Birth|Aphrodite was born]] as an adult woman from the sea, which also perpetually renewed her [[virginity]]. A motif of the goddess wringing out her hair is often repeated. The subject was often repeated in Antiquity, a fourth-century sculptural representation from a [[Gallo-Roman]] villa in [[Aquitania]] ([[Louvre]]) testifying to the motif's continued viability in [[Late Antiquity]].

[[Apelles]]' painting was executed for the [[Asclepeion|temple of Asclepius]] at [[Kos]], from which it was taken to Rome by [[Augustus]] in part payment of tribute, and set up in the [[Temple of Caesar]]. In the time of [[Nero]], owing to its dilapidated condition, it was replaced by a copy made by the painter Dorotheus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anadyomene|volume=1|page=907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny, listing Apelles' best paintings, noted "[Another of] Venus emerging from the sea, dedicated by the late Augustus of blessed memory in the shrine of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] his [adoptive-]father, which is called "The Anadyomene", praised in Greek verses like other works, conquered by time but undimmed in fame."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'' xxxv.91 ''Venerem exeuntem e mari divus Agustus dicavit in delubro patris Caesaris, quae anadyomene vocatur, versibus Graecis tantopere dum laudatur, aevis victa, sed inlustrata.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The image of Venus Anadyomene is one of the very few images that survived in Western Europe essentially unchanged from its classical appearance, from Antiquity into the [[High Middle Ages]]. [[Jean Seznec]] instances&lt;ref&gt;Seznec, B.F. Sessions, tr., ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'', 1995:153 note 8, and 154 fig. 58 referring to Codices Vindobonensis 2563 and 2583x and British Library Royal Ms 19, {{circa|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; two images of Venus among constellations illustrating 14th-century  Provençal manuscripts of [[Matfre Ermengau|Matfre Ermengau of Béziers]]' ''Breviari d'amor'', in which Venus is represented nude in the sea: "This extraordinary conservatism may perhaps be explained by the fact that the culture of the last pagan centuries remained alive longer in Provence than elsewhere."

==Renaissance and post-Renaissance==
Through the desire of [[Renaissance]] artists reading Pliny to emulate Apelles, and if possible, to outdo him, Venus Anadyomene was taken up again in the 15th century: besides [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli's]] famous ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' ([[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence), another early Venus Anadyomene is the [[bas-relief]] by [[Antonio Lombardo (sculptor)|Antonio Lombardo]] from [[Wilton House]] ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London).

[[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'', {{circa|1520}}, formerly a long-term loan by the Duke of Sutherland, was 2003's acquisition of the year at the [[National Gallery of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]]. It depicts Venus standing in the sea, wringing out her hair. The scallop shell is merely symbolic, as it does not interact with Venus.

[[The Birth of Venus (Bouguereau)|''The Birth of Venus'']], executed by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] in 1879, reimagines Botticelli's composition, and is another testament to the theme's continuing popularity among the [[Academic art|academic painters]] of the late 19th century. It was shown at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1879, and was bought for the [[Musée du Luxembourg]]. Venus' nude figure takes up the center of the composition, with many admirers gathered around her.

[[Alexandre Cabanel|Alexandre Cabanel's]] [[The Birth of Venus (Cabanel)|painting of the same name]] reworking the then recently discovered Pompeii fresco, was shown at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] in 1863, and bought by [[Napoleon III]] for his own personal collection. Venus lies naked on the waves ambiguously, with putti flying above her. [[Robert Rosenblum]], comment on Cabanel's painting is that "This Venus hovers somewhere between an ancient deity and a modern dream... and the ambiguity of her eyes, that seem to be closed but that a close look reveals that she is awake... A nude who could be asleep or awake is specially formidable for a male viewer".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kern, ''Eyes of Love: The Gaze in English and French Paintings and Novels 1840-1900'' p.101, 1996, Reaktion Books, Art &amp; Art Instruction, {{ISBN|0-948462-83-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a highly conventionalized theme, with undertones of [[eroticism]] justified by its mythological context, was ripe for [[Modernism|modernist]] [[Deconstructionism|deconstruction]]; in 1870 [[Arthur Rimbaud]] evoked the image of a portly ''Clara Venus'' ("famous Venus") with all-too-human blemishes (''déficits'') in a sardonic poem that introduced [[cellulite]] to high literature: ''La graisse sous la peau paraît en feuilles plates'' ("the fat under the skin appears in slabs").

[[Pablo Picasso]] recast the image of Venus Anadyomene in the central figure of his seminal painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), a modernist deconstruction of the icon, and one of the foundational artworks of [[Cubism]].

Venus Anadyomene offered a natural subject for a fountain: the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington DC has a lifesize bronze plumbed so that water drips from Venus' hair, modelled by a close follower of [[Giambologna]], late sixteenth century. Rococo sculptures of the subject were modestly draped across the hips, but bolder nudes appealed to male nineteenth-century patrons: [[Théodore Chassériau]] executed the subject in 1835 and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]]' ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Ingres)|Venus Anadyomene]]'', completed after many years in 1848, is one of the painter's most celebrated works ([[Musée Condé]], Chantilly, France).

==Wave theory==
In 1913 the British archaeologist [[John Myres]] was on the coast near Paphos in winter. Watching the sea, he saw the wind blow two breakers together: "When the angle of impact is about 90o, ‘the “break” is both concentrated within a small width of swell, and very violent, so that the breaker shoots up in a column like a water-spout, 10-15 feet high, and falls back in an outward cascade of foam which may be carried some feet to leeward by the wind. It looks exactly like a human figure literally “rising from the sea” and spreading long hair and dripping arms."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in "Review of [[Robin Lane Fox]], ''Travelling Heroes: Greeks and their Myths in the Epic Age of Homer''" (London: Allen Lane, 2008) by [[Gregory Nagy]], [https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hlnc.essay:Nagy.Review_of_Robin_Lane_Fox_Travelling_Heroes.2011    Harvard University's Center for Hellenic Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;
