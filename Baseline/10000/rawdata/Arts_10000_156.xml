'''''A New Kind of Science''''' is a best-selling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Weighing Wolfram's 'New Kind of Science'
 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20030113/40516-weighing-wolfram-s-new-kind-of-science.html
 |publisher=Publishers Weekly
 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics?

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

'''''A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery''''', or the full title, '''''A Philosopher giving a Lecture on the Orrery in which a lamp is put in place of the Sun''''', is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] depicting a lecturer giving a demonstration of an [[orrery]] to a small audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/child.asp?txtKeywords=&amp;lstContext=&amp;lstResourceType=&amp;lstExhibitionType=&amp;chkPurchaseVisible=&amp;txtDateFrom=&amp;txtDateTo=&amp;x1=&amp;y1=&amp;x2=&amp;y2=&amp;scale=&amp;theme=&amp;album=&amp;resource=5230&amp;viewpage=%2Fengine%2Fresource%2Fexhibition%2Fstandard%2Fdefault%2Easp&amp;originator=&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=&amp;text=&amp;exhibition=1652&amp;offset=0 | title=A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery (1764–1766) | accessdate=12 August 2011 | work=Revolutionary Players | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724091137/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/child.asp?txtKeywords=&amp;lstContext=&amp;lstResourceType=&amp;lstExhibitionType=&amp;chkPurchaseVisible=&amp;txtDateFrom=&amp;txtDateTo=&amp;x1=&amp;y1=&amp;x2=&amp;y2=&amp;scale=&amp;theme=&amp;album=&amp;resource=5230&amp;viewpage=%2Fengine%2Fresource%2Fexhibition%2Fstandard%2Fdefault.asp&amp;originator=&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=&amp;text=&amp;exhibition=1652&amp;offset=0 | archivedate=24 July 2011 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting preceded his similar ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]).

The first of Wright's candlelit masterpieces, ''[[Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight]]'', was painted in 1765, and showed three men studying a small copy of the "[[Borghese Gladiator]]". The ''Gladiator'' was greatly admired; but his next painting, ''The Orrery'', caused a greater stir, as it replaced the Classical subject at the centre of the scene with one of a scientific nature. Wright's depiction of the awe produced by scientific "miracles" marked a break with previous traditions in which the artistic depiction of such wonder was reserved for religious events,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; since to Wright the marvels of the technological age were as awe-inspiring as the subjects of the great religious paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In both of these works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well, and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilding, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were an essential part of the display. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] the lighting is normal.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 1998, 342&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was one of a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated, [[hierarchy of genres]] in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated as seriously as the costumed [[history painting]] of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the ''Orrery'' and ''Air Pump'' subjects resembled [[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation pieces]], then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when [[Johann Zoffany]] began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 215–216, 270, 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century art historian [[Ellis Waterhouse]] compares these two works to the "''genre serieux''" of contemporary French drama, as defined by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a view endorsed by Egerton.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 285–286, and Egerton (1998), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous review from the time called Wright "a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way".&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Orrery'' was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by [[Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers|Washington Shirley]], [[Earl Ferrers|5th Earl Ferrers]], an amateur astronomer who had an [[orrery]] of his own, and with whom Wright's friend [[Peter Perez Burdett]] was staying while in [[Derbyshire]]. Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with a youth next to the orrery.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Ferrers purchased the painting for £210, but [[Robert Shirley, 6th Earl Ferrers|the 6th Earl]] auctioned it off, and it is now held by [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]],&lt;ref name="Lunar"&gt;Uglow 2002, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; where it is on permanent display, and close to a working replica of a full-sized mechanical [[orrery|Grand Orrery]].

A biographer of Wright, [[Benedict Nicolson]], argued in 1968 that [[John Whitehurst]] was the model for the lecturer,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Benedict, ''Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1968, {{ISBN|0-7100-6284-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another commentator points out the figure's resemblance to "a painting of [[Isaac Newton]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheOrrery.htm |title=Art treasure – The Orrery |publisher=Derby City Council |language= |accessdate=12 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724223647/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheOrrery.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close observation of the adult faces in the picture reveals that each one demonstrates one or other of the main [[Lunar phase|phases of the moon]] – new moon, half moon, gibbous moon and full moon.&lt;ref&gt;The Orrery – A Users' Guide, N J Moyes, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Altar frontal from Avià''' is a rare [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[altar]] frontal exhibited at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Guia del Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.p. 25. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the front of the [[altar]] of the church of [[St. Mary of Avià]], in the county of [[Berguedà]], later moved to [[MNAC Barcelona]], while the church has a replica in place. It is dated to the 13th century or earlier, and was painted by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=1be3734bc116cb40ed37627bb0055750aac1142ee18f11b6dbffd5470903a561?inventoryNumber=015784-000# The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontal is painted in [[tempera]] on a wood panel, with [[parchment]] overlaps, ''[[pastiglia]]'' [[stucco]] [[relief]] decoration and remains of additional vanished metal plates. It is divided into five areas, dominated by the central [[Virgin and Child]]. The figures are elongated, with [[Byzantine art|Byzantine-style]] costumes and  frontal poses. Four scenes surround the central figures: the [[Annunciation]] and [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]], the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and the [[Presentation of Jesus]] in the temple. Both the frame and the divisions between the compartments are decorated with [[gilding|gilded]]  [[gypsum]] plaster, imitating precious metal.

'''ArtBakery''' is an art centre based in the village of [[Bonendale]] a few kilometers from [[Douala]] and founded by [[Goddy Leye]]. The centre offers trainings for emerging artists (Master Class), journalists (Art Daily) and residency programs for young artists (Portfolio). ArtBakery is specifically designed to technically support the production of multimedia artworks, video and digital art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerofculture.nl/uk/specials/rain/artbakery.html ArtBakery] on "The Power of Culture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ArtBakery is founded in 2002 after the artist [[Goddy Leye]] moves back to [[Cameroon]] from the [[Netherlands]]. The centre is part of the [[Rijksakademie]] International Network (RAIN), a network of artists who support contemporary cultural practices in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.r-a-i-n.net|title=R-A-I-N|website=www.r-a-i-n.net|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAIN supports ArtBakery and its first project ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bessengue_City_Douala Bessengue City]''.

== Activities ==
=== Bessengue City ===
''Bessengue City'' is a project designed and coordinated by [[Goddy Leye]] and organised in [[Bessengue]] [[Douala]] in October 2002. The project involved the artists [[James Beckett (artist)|James Beckett]], [[Goddy Leye]], [[Hartanto]], [[Jesus Palomino]] and the local community and it was produced with the support of [[Rijksakademie|Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten]] of [[Amsterdam]] and by the programme R.A.I.N. Rain Artists’ Initiative Network. 
James Beckett produces in the neighbourhood of [[Bessengue]] an experimental radio, with a range of one kilometre and the collaboration of a group of young people which made interviews and recordings. The radio was called ''Radio Bessengue City'', or ''Dikalo la Bessengue'' (the messenger of Bessengue) becomes, as one listener said, “the radio of the people by the people”.

Goddy Leye takes pictures of twenty smiling people from the neighbourhood and makes some digital manipulation. The portraits are printed and arranged in random groups and positioned as posters in the estate. Produced from the same footage, the 6-minute video called ''Bouquet de Sourires'' (Bouquet of Smiles), is shown in the neighbourhood.

Hartanto builds the website of the project and he connects one person from Bessengue with another from [[Bandung]]. The messages, written in French (Bessengue) and Indonesian (Bandung), are scanned and sent with their translation in both directions. News on everyday life and the local environment are exchanged on a daily basis.

=== Exit Tour ===
''Exit Tour - [[Douala]], [[Cotonou]], [[Lomé]], [[Accra]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Bamako]], [[Dakar]]'' is a collaborative artistic project organised in 2006. In occasion of [[Dak'art 2006]], seven artists ([[Ginette Daleu]], [[Justine Gaga]], [[Dunja Herzog]], [[Lucfosther Diop]], [[Achillekà|Achillekà Komguem]], [[Alioum Moussa]] and [[Goddy Leye]]) departed from Douala and reached Dakar using only public transportation. During the three-months journey, the artists visited galleries, artists and participated to workshops in [[Cotonou]], [[Lomé]], [[Accra]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Bamako]], [[Dakar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africanartists.blogspot.com/2011/02/dairy-to-dakart-2006.html|title=Unseen Art Scene: Journey from Douala to Dak'Art 2006|last=Scene|first=Unseen Art|date=2011-02-24|website=Unseen Art Scene|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry in the museum.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] in its museum in [[Bayeux]], [[France]].]]

The '''Bayeux Tapestry tituli''' are captions embroidered on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] describing events leading up to the [[Norman conquest of England]] concerning [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England]], and culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The ''[[tituli]]'' are in [[Medieval Latin]].

==Description==

[[File:Bayeux tapestry stitches detail..jpg|thumb|Detail of embroidered lettering]]

The Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by William the Conqueror's half-brother, [[Odo of Bayeux|Bishop Odo]], possibly at the same time as [[Bayeux Cathedral]]'s construction in the 1070s, and completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.&lt;ref name=stenton&gt;[[#Stenton|Stenton (1961)]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is embroidered in [[wool]] [[yarn]] on a [[plain weave|tabby-woven]] [[linen]] ground using [[backstitch|outline or stem stitch]] for detailing and lettering.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coatsworth|Coatsworth (2005)]], p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A dark blue wool, almost black, is used for most of the tapestry's lettering but towards the end other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The content of the hanging is primarily pictorial but ''tituli'' are included on many scenes of the action to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.&lt;ref name=musset&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The text is in Latin (which for the most part is grammatically correct), and is extremely direct, with each statement being closely tied to the scenes depicted in a given section.&lt;ref name=musset35/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is frequently abbreviated as indicated by [[tilde]]s placed over words at the place of omission of a letter. The words themselves are often demarcated by two points (which Lucien Musset likens to colons); sometimes, more important section breaks are demarcated by three points. Many personal names, mostly in English, are not Latinised and the same applies for names of places in England and for Beaurain "Belrem" in France. In places the spelling shows an English influence, such as the phrase "at Hestenga ceasrta", which in proper Latin would be "ad Hastingae castra").&lt;ref name=musset35&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Some French names are either archaic ("Rednes") or anglicised ("Bagias").&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], pp. 35{{en dash}}6.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes "Franci" is used to describe the Normans who at that time certainly did not regard themselves as French.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final ''titulus'' "Et fuga verterunt Angli" is said by Lucien Musset to be "entirely spurious", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.&lt;ref name=spurious2/&gt; The first word on the tapestry "Edward" is also a restoration.&lt;ref name=spurious1/&gt;

==Latin text with English translation==

The English translation provided here is of a literal nature, to reflect the simplicity of the captions themselves. The numbering scheme uses the scene numbers on the tapestry's backing cloth, which were added sometime around 1800.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

'''Benin art''' is the [[art]] from the [[Kingdom of Benin]] or [[Edo Empire]] (1440&amp;ndash;1897), a pre-colonial African state located in what is now known as the South-South region of [[Nigeria]]. Primarily made of cast bronze and carved ivory, Benin art was produced mainly for the court of the [[Oba of Benin]] - a divine ruler for whom the craftsmen produced a range of ceremonially significant objects. The full complexity of these works can be appreciated only through the awareness and consideration of two complementary cultural perceptions of the art of Benin: the Western appreciation of them primarily as works of art, and their understanding in Benin as historical documents and as mnemonic devices to reconstruct history, or as ritual objects. This original significance is of great import in Benin.&lt;ref name=Plankensteiner /&gt;

==Chronology==
Given the stylistic differences, the art of Benin has been divided by some authors, including Egyptologist [[Boris de Rachewiltz]] in the following periods:

==The royal arts of Benin==
The royal arts of the Benin Kingdom of south-central Nigeria affirm the centrality of the oba, or divine king, portraying his divine nature. While recording the kingdom's significant historical events and the oba's involvement with them, they also initiate the oba's interactions with the supernatural and honor his deified ancestors, forging a continuity that is vital to the kingdom's well-being.&lt;ref name="AIC website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benin—Kings and Rituals: Court Arts from Nigeria|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/benin/overview|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials used in Benin's royal arts—primarily brass, ivory, and coral—are endowed with sacred power. The innate value of these materials within Benin and the time and skill that is invested in working them reflect the earthly and otherworldly influence of the oba and the great wealth of his kingdom. Benin's royal arts belong to a tradition that favors convention even as it promotes creativity and innovation, especially as a reflection of royal prerogative. Through time, rulers have used the arts to interpret the history of the kingdom and to orient themselves with the past in an effort to support their own initiatives and define their images for posterity.

Although only made popular to Western audiences after the [[Punitive Expedition]] in the 19th century, Benin art has been in existing since or at least the 13th century.

==Ancestral altars==
{{main|Benin ancestral altars}}

A newly installed oba is responsible for creating an altar dedicated to his father, commissioning the appropriate objects to adorn it and activating it on a regular basis with sacrifices of food or animal blood. The oba does the same for his mother if she attained the title of iyoba, or [[Queen mothers (Africa)|queenmother]]. While bells and rattle staffs are placed on all ancestral altars, ivory tusks and commemorative brass heads are made specifically for royal altars. Associated with trade, ivory and brass are durable and valuable, and their colors—white like sacred kaolin clay and red like fire and coral beads—relate to royal power.

Before the British conquest, an oba's courtyard was the focal point for rituals in his honor. British troops reported 18 altars dedicated to previous obas when they took possession of the palace in 1897. Today, all of the royal altars stand together in a single courtyard.&lt;ref name="AIC website" /&gt;

One of the objects unique to Benin art is an [[Ikegobo]], or "altars to the hand," which celebrates the accomplishments of exceptional individuals. The hand is associated with action and productivity, and is considered the source of wealth, status, and success for all those who depend on manual skill and physical strength. Altars of this kind are commissioned in terracotta, wood, or brass, depending on the status of the patron.&lt;ref name="Met Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oba with Animals, Altar to the Hand (Ikegobo) of Ezomo Ehenua [Nigeria; Edo peoples, court of Benin] (1991.17.113,1996.11)|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1991.17.113,1996.11|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=3 April 2013|location=New York|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art related to rituals at court==
''For the full article on art related to rituals at court see [[Benin court and ceremonial art]]''

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 58.160 Double Bell Egogo.jpg|thumbnail|This ivory double bell (Egogo) is one of the oldest surviving African ivory sculptures; only six of these ivory gongs are known. They were used by the oba during the Emobo ceremony to drive away evil spirits. Carved with the oba, supported by his military commander and his heir.]]
Private and public ceremonies mark many of the important moments in Benin's yearly calendar. In the past, an elaborate series of rites were performed throughout the year to secure otherworldly support for the kingdom's well-being and to celebrate decisive events in its history. For the sake of convenience, the current monarch, Oba Erediauwa, emphasizes the end-of-year festival called [[Igue]], which is held during the winter holidays to allow the greatest number of people to attend. Igue includes a sequence of rituals that renew the oba's supernatural powers and cleanse the kingdom's unruly spirits.

Benin's other important ritual festivals include [[Ague (festival)|Ague]], where the first budded yams are blessed in hopes of a successful harvest; Ugie Ivie, the Festival of Beads, in which the oba's coral and red stone regalia is bathed in cow's blood to reinvest it with spiritual force; Ugie Erha Oba, which honors the oba's father and all paternal ancestors; Oduduwa, a masquerade that likewise honors the oba's paternal ancestors; and Ugie Oro, celebrating Oba Esigie's victory over the Idah Kingdom in the 16th century.

Finely carved ivory double gongs are examples of art related to rituals at court. They are called “double” gongs because of second, smaller resonating cups at their front. Typically, the  central image is the oba in coral regalia supported by the high priests osa and osuan, officials who tend the altars of the kingdom's two patron gods. These gongs are still carried today by the oba during Emobo, the last of the empowering rites of the Igue festival. The oba gently taps the ivory instrument, creating a rhythmic sound to calm and dismiss unruly spirits from the kingdom.

==Leopard imagery in the arts of Benin==
The oba is referred to metaphorically as “the leopard of the house,” and images of the beautiful, cunning, and immensely dangerous cat appear frequently in Benin's royal arts. Before the British invasion in 1897, domesticated leopards were kept in the palace to demonstrate the oba's mastery over the wilderness. Leopard imagery is also frequently linked to the oba's military might.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==The Oba's regalia==
The oba's divine right to rule is reiterated in his regalia. His coral crowns, shirts, aprons, necklaces, and accessories refer to those that Oba Ewuare is said to have stolen from Olokun, the god of the waters and prosperity. Coral and red stones such as jasper and agate are also filled with supernatural energy, or ase, as are elephant ivory and brass, two other valuable materials that the oba has historically controlled.

Despite his divine status, the oba can not rule alone. He must rely on others to fulfill his destiny, a dependence that is physically expressed when he walks or sits with his arms supported at the elbows and wrists by attendants. They help him bear the weight of his regalia, a constant reminder of the burden of kingship.&lt;ref name="AIC website" /&gt;

==Brass Casting==
Brass casters (igun eronmwon) are the highest-ranking craft guild within the hierarchical structure of the Iwebo society, followed by blacksmiths (igun ematon) and ivory and wood carvers (igbesanwan).

The origins of brass casting in Benin are debated. One popular story credits Oba Oguola (enthroned c. 1280) with sending for a master brass caster from [[Ile Ife]], the capital city of the ancient Ife Kingdom to the northwest, and with later establishing a royal brass-casting guild.&lt;ref name=Inneh&gt;{{cite book|last=Inneh|first=David|title=Benin kings and rituals : court arts from Nigeria|year=2007|publisher=Snoeck|location=Ghent|isbn=9053496262|authorlink=The Guilds Working for the Palace|editor=Barbara Plankensteiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Egharevba|first=Jacob U.|title=A Short History of Benin, 4th Edition|year=1968|publisher=Ibadan University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest brass casting developed independently in Benin and may have mutually benefited from exchange with Ile Ife.&lt;ref name=Gore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gore|first=Charles|title=Casting Identities in Contemporary Benin|journal=African Arts|date=Summer 1997|volume=30|issue=3|pages=54–61, 93|doi=10.2307/3337500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casters in both regions used the [[lost wax method]], in which a precisely detailed wax model is formed over a clay core. When the model is complete, clay is carefully applied over the wax. It is then heated, melting the wax, which exits from a narrow channel. Next, molten metal is poured into the mold. Once cool, the hardened clay is chipped away, leaving behind an image now cast in bronze.&lt;ref name=Plankensteiner&gt;{{cite book|title=Benin- Kings and Rituals: Court Art from Nigeria|year=2007|publisher=Exhibition catalogue Kunsthistoriches Museum Vienna mit MVK und OTM/Snoeck|editor=Barbara Plankensteiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The Punitive Expedition==
The decline of Benin art occurred in the 19th century when the [[Benin Expedition of 1897|Punitive expedition]] by the British caused impairment in the creation of the arts. On February 18, 1897, the British arrived in Benin City under orders to invade and conquer it. As a result, the possessions of the oba and his court became spoils of war. The objects were rounded up with little regard for their associated meaning; no systematic record was kept of their grouping or placement. Many of these objects were sold in London to defray the cost of the expedition.

'''Calandrino''' is a character from [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s the ''[[Decameron]]'', in which he appears in four stories. In these tales he is the victim of the pranks of Bruno and [[Buonamico Buffalmacco|Buffalmacco]]. He becomes a recurring character in Renaissance literature, especially in Italy.

==Appearances in The Decameron==
In each of the tales in which Calandrino is a character (VIII, 3; VIII, 6; IX, 3; IX, 5), he is portrayed as a simpleton who believes in the [[folk religion|folk magic]] of the time period. In the first tale (VIII, 3), the three painters hunt for [[heliotrope (mineral)|heliotropes]], and Calandrino believes that by finding one he is rendered [[invisible]]. Bruno and Buffalmacco, his friends and fellow painters, pretend they don't see him and kick rocks at him all the way back to [[Florence]], where he arrives bruised.

In the second tale (VIII, 6) Bruno and [[Buonamico Buffalmacco|Buffalmacco]] subject him to a medieval version of a [[polygraph]] test. According to common belief at the time, a person who is lying wouldn't be able to swallow the prepared bread and cheese when under examination. However, Bruno and Buffalmacco sour the cheese with [[water-pepper|dog ginger]], a very bitter herb which Calandrino then spits out. This convinces his friends that he is lying about a pig of his being stolen (which in reality they had taken).

Calandrino is convinced that he [[male pregnancy|is pregnant]] in story IX, 3. To give him a painless miscarriage he takes a potion that is specially prepared by his friends, Bruno and Buffalmacco.

Finally, tale IX, 5 is a story in which Boccaccio uses the Calandrino character to ridicule the folk magic of his time period. To gain a woman's affections, Calandrino casts a spell and prepares a [[potion]] from a scroll supplied by Bruno. The potion contains all sorts of absurd ingredients and the scroll is filled with gibberish. When his wife discovers his intentions, she beats Calandrino.

==Calandrino in the arts==
Calandrino became the main character in several artistic works, including:

* [[Bernardo Dovizi]]'s play ''La Calandra'' (also, known as ''Il Calandro ''and'' La Calandria'', 1507) (See [[Bernardo Dovizi#Literary fame: Calandro]]) - play
* [[Giovanni Alberto Ristori]], ''«[[Calandro]]»'' (1726), libretto - [[Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino]] - opera
* [[Antonio Sacchini]], ''«L'avaro deluso, o Don Calandrino»'' (1778) - opera
* [[Johann Georg Schürer]], ''«Calandro»'' (1748) - opera
* [[Giuseppe Gazzaniga]], ''«Il Calandrino»'' (1771) - opera
* [[Domenico Cimarosa]], ''Il ritorno di Don Calandrino'' (1778)- opera
* Le avventure di Calandrino e Buffalmaco (1975) - mini-series
* Paul Calandrino, [http://paulcalandrino.com/nincompoop.html ''The Nincompoop''] (2007) - play

==Historical identity==
Calandrino was a historical person, an [[Italian Renaissance]] painter named '''Nozzo di Perino''' who lived in the fourteenth century. Whether he really was the [[Simpleton (folklore)|simpleton]] portrayed by Boccaccio in his work is unknown, but common belief is that he was a bit gullible. It is unclear whether this belief arose because of the popularity of the ''Decameron'', or whether it was already popular belief when Boccaccio wrote the tales.

{{Other people}}
'''Catherine Blake''' (née '''Boucher'''; 25 April 1762 – 18 October 1831) was the wife of the poet, painter and [[Engraving|engraver]] [[William Blake]], and a vital presence and assistant throughout his life.

==Life==
Catherine was born the daughter of a man of a market gardener{{clarification needed|date=February 2017}} in [[Battersea]], then just outside London on the other side of the [[River Thames]]. She met William here in 1781, during his brief visit to the area, while he was recovering from an emotional upset following the failure of an earlier relationship. Their courtship was brief. According to early biographers of Blake, Catherine immediately recognised him as her future husband and when she sympathised with him over his earlier emotional troubles he replied "do you pity me? Then I love you."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wright, ''Life of William Blake'', Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Blake married Catherine &amp;ndash; who was five years his junior &amp;ndash; on 18 August 1782 in [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an 'X'.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/William_Blake/11.R.htm Catherine Blake, ca.1805]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 5 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They remained together until his death in 1827.&lt;ref name="M155"&gt;Myrone, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Blake taught her to read and write, and also to use his [[printing-press]].

The couple did not have children, and it has been suggested that Blake wanted to bring a concubine into the relationship to act as a surrogate mother, which was consistent with the theories of [[Swedenborgianism]] by which Blake was influenced.&lt;ref name = "rob"&gt;Robert Rix, ''William Blake and the Cultures of Radical Christianity'', Ashgate, 2007, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake's earliest biographer [[Alexander Gilchrist]] does not mention this, but speaks of unspecified troubles in the early years of the relationship. However, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] later explicitly asserted that this was the case, but that Blake dropped the idea when he saw that it upset Catherine. No documentary evidence survives supporting this notion, but Blake is known to have stated that he "learned from the Bible that wives should be held in common."&lt;ref name = "rob"/&gt;
[[File:The Letters of William Blake (1906) Kate's portrait.png|thumb|200px|Pencil drawing by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] after Tatham's life sketch of Catherine Blake]]&lt;!-- another poor reproduction at File:The Letters of William Blake- Catherine Blake.png --&gt;
Writers who knew the couple in their later years describe a very happy relationship. In 1802, [[William Hayley]] wrote that William "and his excellent wife (a true helpmate!) pass the plates thro' a rolling press in their own cottage together".&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt; On his deathbed, Blake drew a picture of Catherine as his last work, stating "you have ever been an angel to me".

After her husband's death Catherine was taken in by Blake's admirer [[Frederick Tatham]], for whom she nominally worked as a housekeeper. At this period she continued to sell Blake's works. When she died four years later Tatham claimed that she had bequeathed all Blake's works to him. When he later converted to [[Irvingite]] beliefs, he destroyed a number of them, asserting that they were inspired by the devil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ackroyd]], ''William Blake'', pp. 368–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Blake's art==
Throughout her husband's uneven career, Catherine not only took an active role in the production of William's engravings and illuminated books; she also ran the household finances and offered strong practical support. William's friend [[John Thomas Smith (1766–1833)|J. T. Smith]] said that Blake "allowed her, to the last moment of his practice, to take off his proof impressions and print his works, which she did most carefully."&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt; Catherine's role in colouring at least some of William's illuminated books has been wide, although her hand is usually attributed to some of the more clumsily rendered passages. Her work as a printer is held in higher regard.&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt;

==Role in literature==
It has often been suggested that the figure of [[Enitharmon]] in Blake's mythology is partly inspired by Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila A. Spector, ''Glorious Incomprehensible: The Development of Blake's Kabbalistic Language'', Bucknell University Press, 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Enitharmon is the wife of the "eternal prophet" [[Los (Blake)|Los]] in Blake's writings. Catherine is explicitly identified as the poet's "shadow of delight" in the second part of Blake's ''[[Milton a Poem]]''.

Catherine appears as a model wife in William Hayley's writings on ideal marriages. In more recent literature, she is the central character in [[Janet Adele Warner]]'s novel ''Other Sorrows, Other Joys: The Marriage of Catherine Sophia Boucher and William Blake'' (2001) and also features in [[Tracy Chevalier]]'s novel ''Burning Bright'' (2007). She is an amateur detective in short stories by [[Keith Heller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hycyber.com/MYST/EQ_ha.html|title=hycyber.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]]'s stage play ''In Lambeth'' dramatised a visit by [[Thomas Paine]] to the [[Lambeth]] home of William and Catherine Blake in 1789. It was first performed at the East Dulwich Tavern in July 1989. The play was later adapted for television in the [[BBC Two]] ''Encounters'' series (which featured similar fictionalised meetings between historical figures) and was first broadcast on 4 July 1993. It was directed by Sebastian Graham-Jones, and featured [[Mark Rylance]] as William, [[Bob Peck]] as Paine and Lesley Clare O'Neill as Catherine.

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)
{{ISBN|0763721972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Superposability|file=S06144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word for hand, χεῖρ (''kheir'').

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html |title=Space radiation may select amino acids for life |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meierhenrich Uwe J., Nahon Laurent, Alcaraz Christian, Hendrik Bredehöft Jan, Hoffmann Søren V., Barbier Bernard, Brack André | year = 2005 | title = Asymmetric Vacuum UV photolysis of the Amino Acid Leucine in the Solid State | url = | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 5630–5634 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200501311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

{{smallcaps all|L}}-forms of amino acids tend to be tasteless, whereas {{smallcaps all|D}}-forms tend to taste sweet.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08/&gt; [[Spearmint]] leaves contain the {{smallcaps all|L}}-enantiomer of the chemical [[carvone]] or ''R''-(−)-carvone and [[caraway]] seeds contain the {{smallcaps all|D}}-enantiomer or ''S''-(+)-carvone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf60176a035 | title=Chemical and sensory data supporting the difference between the odors of the enantiomeric carvones |author1=Theodore J.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In inorganic chemistry ==

{{main article|Complex (chemistry)#Optical isomerism|l1=Complex (chemistry): Isomerism}}
Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-[[racemic]] chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''.  Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.&lt;ref name=EllielChir97&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eliel, E.L. | year = 1997 | title = Infelicitous Stereochemical Nomenclatures | journal = Chirality | volume = 9 | pages = 428–430 | url =  https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/inter.4/eliel/eliel.html | access-date = 5 February 2016 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-636x(1997)9:5/6&lt;428::aid-chir5&gt;3.3.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample  have the same chirality sense. Use of '''homochiral''' as a synonym is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=asymmetric synthesis| file = E02072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral''' when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomerically enriched (enantioenriched)| file = E02071}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enantiomeric excess]] or '''e.e.''' is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of ''R'' contains 70% ''R'' and 30% ''S'' (70% − 30% = 40%).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomer excess (enantiomeric excess)| file = E02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

The '''Clio Awards''' is an annual award program that recognizes innovation and creative excellence in [[advertising]], [[design]] and [[communication]], as judged by an international panel of [[advertising professional]]s.&lt;ref name=TRIBUTE&gt;Clio Awards: A Tribute to 30 Years of Advertising Excellence 1960-1989/Part 1, {{ISBN|0-86636-124-3}}, PBC International, September 1990&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described the event (in 1991) as the world's most recognizable international advertising awards.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;

==History==
The awards, founded by [[Wallace A. Ross]] in 1959, are named for the Greek goddess [[Clio]], the mythological [[Muse]] known as "the proclaimer, glorifier and celebrator of history, great deeds and accomplishments".&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt;

The Clios were first given in 1959, for excellence in television advertising, by the ''American TV and Radio Commercials Festival''. Each winner received a gold [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]]–designed statuette. The competition was expanded to include work on international television and movies in 1966, and then radio ads, in the United States, in 1967.&lt;ref name=GUIDE&gt;Carder, Sheri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=1993+Clio+award&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oofl86zCJ_&amp;sig=Rd-DUO1ZsVcuIJ7qeDxrUp6oUe8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fbrFTNaNLYW8lQeAwYzkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=1993%20Clio%20award&amp;f=false "Clio Awards"] ''The Guide to United States popular culture'', pages 180-181, {{ISBN|978-0-87972-821-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s==
[[File:1977 Clio ArthurSchroeck.jpg|thumb|Engraved plaque on the 1977 Clio award given to [[Artie Schroeck]] for arranging the music in a [[McDonald's]] jingle.]]
The Clio Awards were acquired by Bill Evans in 1972 for $150,000&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Horovitz, Bruce: [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-04/business/fi-6474_1_clio-awards "Hello Clio, What's New?"] Los Angeles Times, September 4, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and the Clios became a profitable "for profit" company.&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt; At one point, the company's income was $2.5 million per year, being derived primarily from Clio nomination fees, of $70 to $100 per entry.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;

Evans expanded competition by including: U.S. Print advertising in 1971; International Print advertising in 1972; International Radio advertising in 1974; U.S. Packaging design in 1976; International Packaging design; and U.S. Specialty advertising in 1977.&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt;

==1980s==
In 1983, Evans continued to expand by acquiring U.S. Cable advertising in 1983.&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt;

The rules for the 1984 award required that a given entry appear publicly during the calendar year in 1983. In order to be eligible, [[Chiat/Day]] needed to run [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s [[1984 (advertisement)|1984]] commercial for the [[Macintosh]] computer prior to [[Super Bowl XVIII]]. In December 1983, Apple purchased time on [[KMVT]] in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]], after the normal sign-off, and recorded the broadcast in order to qualify.&lt;ref name="linzmayer"&gt;Linzmayer, Owen (1994). ''The Mac Bathroom Reader''. Sybex, {{ISBN|978-0-7821-1531-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the following year, a nearly identical situation occurred when [[Ziebart|Ziebart's]] ad agency, [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]], purchased time on a [[Detroit]] channel carrying the inaugural [[Cherry Bowl]] college football game in December, 1984 in order for that commercial to be eligible for the 1985 awards.  The move paid off as Ziebart's "Friend of the Family (Rust in Peace)" commercial garnered the Clio Award in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99092280/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Evans acquired Hispanic advertising.&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt;

==1990s==
===1991 Clio Awards===
{{tone|date=December 2014}}
Attendees of the 1991 Clio Awards who had paid the US$125 admission price did not have tickets waiting at the door, as promised. Also missing were any Clio officials and Clio President Bill Evans. The event did not start on time; in fact, people stood around drinking, schmoozing, and trading rumors about Evans and the Clio organization for more than two hours. Finally, the lights dimmed and the band started playing. A man walked up to the microphone and began to speak. He identified himself as the caterer and announced that the master of ceremonies was a no-show, but that he would give it a shot. It started out well but, after being informed that there was no script and no winners list, he gave up and walked off. A second man walked onstage and began talking, but he was not a polished speaker and it was obvious that we he was inebriated. Print ads were the first awards; transparencies of the winning entries were displayed. As each image appeared on screen, the owner of the work was asked to come to the stage, pick up their Clio, and identify themselves and their agency. When the last award in the category was dispensed, the band began playing an interlude and the emcee began singing. The audience began booing and throwing dinner rolls, and the man staggered offstage. Several minutes passed, but no one took his place. As the people began to leave, one man mounted the stage, strode to the table of remaining statuettes, snatched one up, and waved it as he left the stage. Two other individuals claimed their own awards; then suddenly, the stage was stampeded by advertising executives, intent on the Clios that remained.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt;

The event for television commercials, scheduled a few days later, was called off.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt;

===1992 Bankruptcy===
On March 17, 1992, Clio Enterprises Inc., filed for bankruptcy, claiming $1.8 million in debts and indeterminate assets of at least US$1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Stuart: [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bankruptcy-filing-by-clio-enterprises.html "Bankruptcy Filing By Clio Enterprises"] New York Times, March 18, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicago]] publisher Ruth Ratny purchased the Clio name for an undisclosed figure. Evans had wanted $2 million, and trade publications reported a sale price of $10,000, which Ratny called low. Ratny reorganized the event as the '''New Clio Awards''', and combined what had previously been two events into a single presentation, which was delayed from June until September 1992. [[Advertising Age]] magazine reported 6,000 entries, less than one quarter of the 1990 total. As a concession to the 1991 winners who had not yet received the trophies, their entry fee was waived. The 1990 award show at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] drew 1,800, while only 500 paid for the 1992 show at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]],&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt; which was hosted by [[Tony Randall]]. A total of 86 awards in 73 categories were handed out.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Stuart: [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/14/business/the-media-business-advertising-new-clios-face-a-test-of-credibility.html "'New' Clios Face a Test Of Credibility"]. ''The New York Times'', September 14, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Another major change with the "New" Clios was direct competition between U.S. and foreign firms, which resulted in Swiss agency Comsult/Advico Young &amp; Rubicam being named the winner of the best Television campaign.&lt;ref name=SWISS&gt;Horovitz, Bruce: [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-16/business/fi-1011_1_clio-awards "Swiss Firm Wins Top Clio Award"]. ''Los Angeles Times'', September 16, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

A bankruptcy court ruled that the creditors of the 1991 Clio Awards should be paid. At the time, Ratny lacked the financial resources to settle the [[US$]]600,000 debt. Another Chicagoan, James M. Smyth a former film editor, put up the money and became sole owner of the Clio Awards.  On New Year's Eve of 1992, he began working on the 1993 Clio awards show.&lt;ref name=TEMPO&gt;Millman, Nancy: [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-02-22/features/9303183743_1_new-clio-awards-revive-condo "Tempo reported on the New Clio Awards"] Chicago Tribune, February 22, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feigenbaum, Nancy: [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/clio-awards "The Clio Awards is about to get yet"] Orlando Sentinel, February 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The award ceremony was again delayed until September, and  [[Jay Chiat]] of [[TBWA\Chiat\Day]], Rick Fizdale from [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] and Keith Reinhard at [[DDB Worldwide]] joined the  Clio Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Stuart: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-another-setback-for-clio-awards.html "ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Another Setback For Clio Awards"]. ''The New York Times'', May 28, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Clios were sold to Dutch-owned company VNU Media.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;

==2000s==
In 2007, VNU changed its name to the [[Nielsen Company]].&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973271,00.html "Advertising The Collapse Of Clio"] Time magazine, July 1, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[e5 Global Media]] assumed control of Clio, when it acquired magazines [[Adweek]] and [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] (among others) from Nielsen Business Media.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Keith: [http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/clio_awards_return_to_downtown_just_QAsQQ6thXSqBNnviIEKMhM "CLIO awards return to downtown just as advertised"] New York Post, May 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Nicole Purcell was appointed Executive Director of Clio and Brooke Levy was hired to run marketing for the organization. Together they have been credited with reestablishing Clio as a best-in-class creative program. In 2015, Nicole Purcell was promoted to President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/ny-clio-idUSnBw206195a+100+BSW20150120 |title=CLIO Names Nicole Purcell President|work=Reuters|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive]] acquired the Clio Awards Collection from the [[London International Awards]], the organization that purchased the collection from the Clio organization in 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.iu.edu/stories/2017/12/iub/releases/14-clio-collection.html|title=We interrupt your viewing pleasure with this message from our sponsors|work=News at IU|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of thousands of reels of 16mm and 35mm film, the collection contains Clio entries and winners from the 1960s through the early 1990s across a wide variety of categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.libraries.indiana.edu/IULMIA/exhibits/show/clio|title=Clio Awards Collection · Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive|website=collections.libraries.indiana.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; International submissions are also included in the collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Clio is currently part of MediaBistro Holdings, a group that also includes Adweek and The Film Expo Group, and is owned by Guggeinheim Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/adweek-parent-prometheus-buys-mediabistro-editorial-assets-158001 |title=Adweek Parent Company Buys Mediabistro Editorial Assets|work=AdWeek|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drpepper.com/en Clio Awards ]. Retrieved 19 Oct. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging==
In 2014, Clio assembled a 50/50 male-female jury made up of more than 70% international (non-US) judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clioawards.com/awards/press/?year=2014&amp;pressid=262 |title=CLIO Awards 2015|publisher=Clioawards.com|date= |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2014 was also the year Clio began holding judging sessions internationally. The 2014 judging session took place in Malta, and the 2015 session will take place in Tenerife, Spain.

According to the Clio Awards website, more than 80% of submissions are eliminated within the first two rounds. Juries then determine whether a work deserves to be included on the Shortlist, or receive a Bronze, Silver, or Gold medal. One work in each media type may be awarded the Grand Clio, the highest honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clioawards.com/about/ "About Clio"] Clio 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Clio stated, in 2007, that the competition received more than 19,000 entries from all over the world and enlisted a jury of more than 110 judges from 62 countries. Nearly two-thirds of the submissions came from outside the United States.&lt;ref name=ABOUT&gt;[http://www.clioawards.com/about/ "About Clio"] Clio 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colin Graham director.jpg|thumb|Colin Graham]]
'''Colin Graham''' [[OBE]] (22 September 1931 in [[Hove]], England – 6 April 2007 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]) was a  stage director of opera, theatre, and television.
 
Graham was educated at Northaw School (Hertfordshire),&lt;ref name="Blyth"&gt;{{cite news | author=Alan Blyth | title=Colin Graham | url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2053228,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=10 April 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stowe School]] and [[RADA]]. Early in his career, he began a long association with [[Benjamin Britten]], for whom he directed all but one of the composer's stage works, including all of the world premieres after 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/04/09/db0901.xml Obituary for Colin Graham, ''Telegraph'', 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; He became associated with the English Opera Group in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/arts/09graham.html Vivien Schweitzer, "Colin Graham, 75, Director of St. Louis Opera Company, Dies."  ''New York Times'', 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, he also worked for the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]] in London and later at [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]] and at the [[English National Opera]] in the 1970s.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Graham was associated with several recordings of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas conducted by Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]] with the Glyndebourne Festival Chorus and principals including [[George Baker (record singer)|George Baker]].  He enhanced these recordings with movement for the performers that makes the recordings sound more like a live staged performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/tbjsarg.htm Information from the G&amp;S Discography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620064531/http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/tbjsarg.htm |date=2008-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham made his American debut as a stage director at [[Santa Fe Opera]] in 1974 with his staging of Britten's ''[[Owen Wingrave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1629548.ece%20 Obituary for Colin Graham, ''The Times'', 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Graham later became Director of Productions for [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]] (OTSL) in 1978, until 1985, when he became OTSL's Artistic Director.  He held this position until his death.

Graham directed the world premieres of [[John Corigliano]]'s opera, ''[[The Ghosts of Versailles]]'', for the [[Metropolitan Opera]]; ''[[The Dangerous Liaisons]]'' and André Previn's ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (opera)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' for [[San Francisco Opera]]; ''The Song of Majnun'' for [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]]; and a series of three operas by [[Miki Minoru]]. In addition, he directed productions for the [[Santa Fe Opera]], notably [[Bright Sheng]]'s ''Madame Mao'' in 2003, continuing his association with general director [[Richard Gaddes]], which had begun during the latter's tenure at OTSL. Collectively, he directed 55 world premieres of operas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/6288.html Matthew Westphal, "Colin Graham, Opera Director and Head of Opera Theatre of St. Louis, Dies at 75".  ''Playbill Arts'', 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham also wrote libretti for several operas, including:
* [[Benjamin Britten]], ''The Golden Vanity''
* [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], ''Penny for a Song''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metoperafamily.org/operanews/news/pressrelease.aspx?id=1393 "Colin Graham, 75, Celebrated Opera Director and OTSL Artistic Director, Has Died".  ''Opera News'' (on-line), 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Graham studied theology and became a minister in 1987, and ultimately took US citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Elizabeth Forbes]] | title=Colin Graham | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/colin-graham-444147.html | work=The Independent | date=11 April 2007 | accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="Blyth"/&gt;  At the time of his death, Graham was at work on the premiere production of ''Anna Karenina'' for [[Florida Grand Opera]] and OTSL.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Bryan Miller, "Colin Graham, Opera Theatre's artistic director, dies".

'''''Communication Arts''''' is the largest international [[trade journal]] of visual communications.&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations"&gt;[http://www.accessabc.com/ Audit Bureau of Circulations] Publisher’s Statement 12/07&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1959 by Richard Coyne and Robert Blanchard, the magazine's coverage includes [[graphic design]], [[advertising]], [[photography]], [[illustration]] and [[interactive media]]. The magazine continues to be edited and published under the guidance of Coyne's wife Jean and their son Patrick Coyne. Currently, ''Communication Arts'' (CA) publishes six issues a year and hosts six creative competitions in graphic design, advertising, photography, illustration, typography and interactive media and two Web sites,   commarts.com  and  creativehotlist.com

==History==
The magazine was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 Essential Magazines for Graphic Designers|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/14-essential-magazines-for-graphic-designers/|accessdate=August 22, 2016|work=Web Designer Depot|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue debuted in August 1959 as the ''Journal of Commercial Art''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Commercial Art'', Vol. 1, #1, August, 1959, Palo Alto, California&lt;/ref&gt; Among a number of innovations, it was the first U.S. magazine printed by offset lithography.&lt;ref&gt;“Yesterday in CA”, ''Communication Arts'', Vol. 31, #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Within six months, paid circulation grew to 10,000. Paid advertising, however, was low and CA was not a financial success. After Blanchard left to go into business by himself, Coyne and a small staff continued to write, design, and produce the magazine. Eventually, paid circulation increased to 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srds.com/ SRDS] Publisher’s Sworn Statement, June 30, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

CA's current audited paid circulation is 63,043&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations" /&gt; and an average of 3.1 people see each issue, giving ''Communication Arts'' an estimated reach of 189,129 readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf Media info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154801/http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions== 
To generate additional income and editorial content, the magazine began an annual [[Juried (competition)|juried competition]] in 1960. Within a few years, the annual competition grew, and eventually segmented into four annual competitions: graphic design, advertising, photography and illustration. A fifth competition, interactive, was added  in 1995. All the CA competitions are juried by  creative professionals.

== Online presences ==
CA was the first major design publication to launch a Web presence ([http://www.commarts.com/ Communication Arts]) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331051305/http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html |date=2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to showcasing creative work in visual communications, it included job listings. The jobs section grew, and was relaunched in 2001 as a standalone website,   Creative Hotlist.  These two websites receive approximately three million page views and 250,000 unique visitors per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217070426/http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Conversations with God''''' ('''''CwG''''') is a sequence of books written by [[Neale Donald Walsch]]. It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and [[God]] answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsch|first=Neale Donald|authorlink=Neale Donald Walsch|title=Conversations with God|year=1995|type=Paperback|ISBN=0-399-14278-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book of the ''Conversations with God'' series, ''Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue'', was published in 1995 and became a publishing phenomenon, staying on ''[[The New York Times Best Sellers List]]'' for 137 weeks.  The succeeding volumes in the nine book series also appeared prominently on the List.

In an interview with [[Larry King]], Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working.  After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: "Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zechner/cwg/lkl-ndw.html Neale Donald Walsch on CNS's ''Larry King Live''] (April 7th, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down.  The ensuing dialogue became the ''Conversations with God'' books. When asked in a recent interview how does he ‘open up’ to God these days, Neale stated “I am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/creative-thoughts/being-at-one-neale-donald-walsch-interview-with-gil-dekel-phd-part-1-of-3  'Being at One': Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel, PhD (Part 1 of 3), Paragraph 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of the dialogue ==
Containing nearly 3,000 pages of material in total, the series presents a large number of ideas.  The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues.

=== CwG's basic messages ===
In ''Friendship with God'', Walsch writes that God presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue:

# We are all one.
# There's enough.
# There's nothing we have to do.
# Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way.
# God is a collective, that is, there are many Gods and Goddesses who have been delegated some work each, respectively.

[[Existence]] is essentially [[Nondualism|non-dual]] in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God.  The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us.  The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of [[World population|humanity]]. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we ''have'' to do, there are an ''infinite'' number of ways to experience this, not just the ''one'' way we may have chosen so far.

According to the books, God recommends many [[Economy|economic]] and [[social]] changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world, it recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of [[reincarnation]] and the existence of life on other planets.

=== God's motive for creation ===
In Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that "knowing" and "experiencing" oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in [[myriad]] ways because everything is one.

This present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that [[sentience]] can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just "know" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, actions are either working or they are not working. A thing is either [[wikt:functional|functional]] or [[dysfunctional]], not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over "time" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.

=== Nature of the dialogue ===

Book 1 (page 4) argues that words are not the ultimate truth, rather words are symbols, and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their own inner knowing or intuition to determine their own truth while reading the book, or any other book. Though the books bear the title ''Conversations with God'' and the author states in book 1 that he is "taking dictation" from God, the 'dialogue' is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that really moves you), and not necessarily through words 'spoken' by God to a person. "All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me." (CwG1, page 58). [[Jesus]] is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, "I am the way and the life, follow me". Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God - Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference) - rather than become his followers. Jesus is supposed to have said, "I and the Father (God) are one and you are my brethren". This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) (Book 3, Chapter20, pgs. 329-330). Jesus is said to have said, "without the father (God), I am nothing". The father of all is pure thought which is the energy of life (Book 3, Chapter11, pg. 180). In Book 3 of ''Conversations with God'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is mentioned that [[Mahavatar Babaji]] may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], Jesus and other humans.&lt;ref&gt;Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; When Neil asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. It was through fear that the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday, not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church. One had to attend one particular church - if you went to a church of a different denomination that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control, pure and simple, using fear. The amazing thing is it worked. People will always believe in hell and in a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man &amp;mdash; ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving and vengeful. In the past, most people could not imagine a God who might rise above all of that so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord. It was as if people could not trust themselves to be good and act appropriately, on their own by their own built in reasons. So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry, retributive God in order to keep themselves in line. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else&amp;mdash;and along came the reincarnationists saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don't worry. Do the best you can. Don't become so paralysed with fear that you can't budge. Promise yourself to do better and get on with it. Naturally, the early Church couldn't hear of such a thing that did two things. First, it denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical, then it created the sacrament of confession. Confession could do for the Church goer what reincarnation promised. That is, give him another chance. There was a catch however - this absolution could not come directly from God, it had to flow through the church whose priests pronounced penances which had to be performed. These were usually prayers which were required of the sinner. So now you had two reasons to keep up church membership. The church found confession to be such a good drawing card that soon it declared to be a sin not to go to confession. Everybody had to do it at least once a year. If they didn't, God would have another reason to be angry. More and more rules - many of them arbitrary and capricious - began to be promulgated by the church, each rule having the power of God's eternal condemnation behind it, unless, of course, failure was confessed and then the person was forgiven by God and condemnation avoided. That lead to another problem. People figured out that this must mean they could do anything as long as they confessed it. The church was in a quandary. Fear had left the hearts of the people. Church attendance and membership dropped. People came to confess once a year, said their penances, were absolved of their sins and went on with their lives. There was no question about it. A way had to be found to strike fear into the heart again, so purgatory was invented. Purgatory was described as a place something like hell, but not eternal. This new doctrine declared that God would make you suffer for your sins even if you confessed them. Under the doctrine, a certain amount of suffering was decreed by God for each nonperfect soul, based on the number and type of sins committed. There were mortal sins and venial sins. Mortal sins would send you right to hell if not confessed before death. Once more, Church attendance shot up, collections were up, too and especially contributions&amp;mdash;for the doctrine of purgatory could buy one's way out of the suffering. According to the church's teaching, one could receive a special indulgence but not directly from God - only from an official of the church. These special indulgences freed one from the suffering in purgatory which they had earned with their sins or at least part of it. These reprieves were granted to very few like those who made a  huge contribution to the church. For a really huge sum, one could obtain a plenary indulgence. This meant no time in purgatory at all - it was a non-stop ticket straight to heaven. This special favor from God was available for even fewer. Royalty, perhaps and the super rich. The amount of money, jewels and land given to the church in exchange for these plenary indulgences was enormous. The exclusivity of this brought great frustration and resentment to the masses. The poorest peasant had no hope of gaining a bishop's indulgence and so the rank and file lost faith in the system with attendance threatening to drop once again. Then they brought in the novena candles. People could come to the church and light a novena candle for the poor souls in purgatory and by saying a novena (a series of prayers in a particular order that took some time to complete), they could reduce by many years the sentence of the dearly departed, extricating them from purgatory sooner than God would otherwise have allowed. They couldn't do anything for themselves but at least they could pray for mercy for the departed. Of course, it would be helpful if a coin or two were dropped through the slot for each candle lit. A lot of little candles were flickering behind a lot of red glass and a lot of pesos and pennies were being dropped into a lot of tin boxes in an attempt to get God to ease up on the suffering being inflicted on the souls in purgatory (Book 3, Chapter7, pgs. 126-130).

== Parallels in other belief systems ==
In the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and "God" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions:

* All things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. ([[The Law of One]]/[[Advaita]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God-realization ([[Hinduism]]/' '[[Bhagavad-Gita]]/[[Sikhism]]'' ).
* Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect ([[Rousseau]]/[[Sikhism]]).
* We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know ([[Hinduism]]/[[Plato]]/[[Sikhism]]).
* Physical reality is an illusion ([[Hinduism]]/ [[Buddhism]]'s concept of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''/[[Sikhism]]).
* One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (''[[Tao Te Ching]]'').
* God is everything. ([[Hinduism]] / [[Spinoza]] / [[Brahman]]/[[Sikhism]])
* God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself. ([[Hinduism]]/[[Hegel]]/[[Sikhism]], and process theology as first outlined by [[Alfred North Whitehead]])
* God is not fear-inducing or vengeful, only our parental [[Psychological projection|projections]] onto God are. ([[Sikhism]])
* Fear or love are the two basic alternative perspectives on life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insight.poeticmind.co.uk/12-application/12-2-space-pt-4-of-6/  'Inspiration: a functional approach to creative practice', Paragraph 2]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Drewermann]])
* Good and evil do not exist (as absolutes, but can exist in a different context and for different reasons). ([[Nietzsche]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Reality is a representation created by will. ([[Schopenhauer]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Nobody knowingly desires evil. ([[Socrates]]/[[Sikhism]])

''Home With God'', we are told, is the final book in this series of two-way written communication&lt;ref&gt;''Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends'' (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-74326-716-8}}, pp. 308&lt;/ref&gt; {see HwG page 308, "Our final conversation in public."}. In August 2016, however, Neale stumbled upon a "new and unexpected dialogue" continuing the original trilogy with a fourth installment released on March 27, 2017.

The first three books in the series are often called the CwG trilogy. In 2005, the trilogy was re-released as one combined 'Gift Edition' book. This edition contains the entire text of the first three books with 'God's words in blue ink and Neale's in black ink, and features a combined 3-in-1 index at the back.

'''Cowper House''' is a former [[town house]] at 12&amp;nbsp;Bridge Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]], and it incorporates a section of the [[Chester Rows]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376063|desc= Number 10 Row Cowper House Number 12 Street, Chester|access-date= 10 July 2013|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cowper House was built in 1664, following the destruction of many buildings in Chester during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last =Ward | first =Simon | authorlink = | title =Chester: A History |edition= | publisher =Phillimore | year = 2009 | location =Chichester | pages = 74–75|  isbn =978-1-86077-499-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built above [[undercroft]]s dating from 1350–75, or possibly earlier.  Alterations have been made to the building in the 19th&amp;nbsp;and 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries.  Thomas Cowper had been [[mayor]] of Chester in 1641–42 and a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] supporter in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].  The rear undercroft was excavated in 1839, and it is thought that the front undercroft is older than that in the rear.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The house is constructed in [[sandstone]], brick, and [[timber framing]] with plaster panels.  The roof is of grey [[slate]].  It has four storeys and a [[gable]] overlooking the street.  The street level consists of a modern shop front on the right of which is a flight of 11&amp;nbsp;stone steps leading to the Row level above.  At the Row level is another modern shop front.  Between this and the street is a walkway, a sloping stallboard and a rail with [[baluster]]s overlooking the street.  Above the Row opening is a carved [[Fascia (architecture)|fascia]].  In the storey above is a window running almost the whole width of the building.  Its frame projects from the wall and is carried on eight [[corbel]]s.  The window has 14&amp;nbsp;lights, is [[mullion]]ed and [[Transom (architectural)|transomed]], and contains [[Leadlight|leaded lights]].  Below and on each side of the window are timber-framed panels.  The top storey is [[jettying|jettied]].  At its base is a [[bressummer]] carved centrally with "•T•C•1664" (the initials are those of Thomas Cowper), on each side of which are carved patterns.  The top storey has a ten-light mullioned and transomed [[casement window]] containing leaded lights.  Below the window are eight panels containing wooden carvings, and two similar panels are on each side of the window.  Above the window are [[Quadrant (architecture)|quadrant]]-braced panels.  The [[bargeboard]] is decorated with carvings and at its peak is a [[finial]].&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
Two steps lead down from the street to the front undercroft which is 16m long.  At its rear, six steps lead down to the rear undercroft which is 13m long.  This undercroft has six bays and is [[rib vault]]ed.  At the far end is a three-light window.  On the left side in the fifth bay is a stone stairway. In the third storey is a sandstone fireplace with a beam inscribed "TC 1661" on each side of a blank shield.

==Plot==
Upon publication of the obituary for Matthew A. Sobol, a brilliant computer programmer and CTO of Cyberstorm Entertainment, a [[Daemon (computing)|Daemon]] is activated. Sobol, dying of brain cancer, was fearful for humanity and began to envision a new world order. The Daemon becomes his tool to achieve that vision. The Daemon's first mission is to kill two programmers Joseph Pavlos &amp; Chopra Singh who worked for CyberStorm Entertainment and unknowingly helped in the creation of the Daemon.

The program secretly takes over hundreds of companies and provides financial and computing resources for recruiting real world agents and creating AutoM8s ([[Autonomous car|computer controlled driverless cars]], used as transport and occasionally as weapons), Razorbacks (sword-wielding robotic riderless motorcycles, specifically designed as weapons) and other devices. The Daemon also creates a secondary online web service, hidden from the general public, dubbed the [[Darknet]], which allows Daemon operatives to exchange information freely.

What follows is a series of interlocking stories following the main characters:

'''Detective Pete Sebeck''' is called in to investigate the death of Pavlos. However, when a connection is made between the two programmers and Cyberstorm, the FBI takes over led by Agent Decker. For being the first authority figure in the investigation, the Daemon selects Sebeck against his will to serve the Daemon, which frames Sebeck for its creation as a multi-million scheme and a hoax. The US government, though knowing the truth, fasttracks Sebeck's trial and executes him eight months later. Sebeck makes peace with his wife, who loves him despite Sebeck's having an affair, but his son Chris remains estranged, and he proclaims his innocence while dying from lethal injection. However, Sebeck later awakens to learn that the Daemon faked his death and assigned him the task to prove that humanity deserves its freedom from the Daemon. Joined by a fellow operative named Laney Price, Sebeck vanishes into America.

'''Jon Ross''', a Russian hacker and identity thief, is questioned by the FBI and brought into the investigation by Sebeck. Unfortunately, traditional investigation methods are useless against Sobol's Daemon program. Ross eventually deduces that the Daemon can anticipate their every move, seemingly one step ahead of anyone who tries to interfere with its operation. Even after being named in the Daemon hoax (and put on the FBI's most wanted list), Ross willingly helps the US government to stop the program. Assigned to the NSA's anti-Daemon task force, with Agent Phillips, he is a firsthand witness to Loki's attack on the installation and barely survives the massacre that follows. With his immunity deal rescinded, he vanishes underground with the intent on destroying the Daemon on his own.

'''Agent Roy "Tripwire" Merritt''' a decorated FBI agent is brought in to secure Sobol's property, when several FBI agents and police officers are killed by an automated Hummer that attacks anyone who approaches. A longtime military officer and expert in hostage situations, he realizes that Sobol's estate is a death trap and red herring, but fear of the Daemon forces his hand and his team is ordered to secure the site regardless. His team is quickly killed, and he remains the lone survivor, infiltrating the house and accidentally triggering a bomb, which levels the property. Blamed for the failure, he is relieved of duty but is later brought onto the anti-Daemon task force by the Major. When Loki is revealed to have infiltrated the building, Roy pursues him, against orders. Fearful of the publicity that the chase will generate, the Major kills Roy himself. Despite being an enemy to the Daemon, he becomes a folk hero of the Darknet, known as "The Burning Man" by the Darknet users, who respect him for his tenacity.

'''NSA Agent Natalie Philips''', a genius workaholic government cryptographer. Phillips joins the investigation shortly after the FBI is called in. Eventually, she is placed in charge of the anti-Daemon task force, but she finds plenty of interference from the Major. She is attracted to Jon Ross (the attraction is mutual), but she quickly states that national security will take precedence and their relationship will remain professional. Phillips objects to the murder of Sebeck to protect infected corporate systems from the Daemon's wrath. One of a handful survivors from Loki's attack, Phillips is blamed for the failure and relieved of duties.

'''Brian Gragg''' aka "Loki Stormbringer" is a sociopathic loner and avid gamer. He makes a living through identity theft and other cyber crimes. After running afoul of some hackers from the Philippines, he allows his partner in crime, Jason Heider, to be killed in his place. Needing to lie low, Loki is recruited by the Daemon by outthinking a hidden game level in one of Sobol's games. Loki is the first Daemon operative and quickly becomes one of the most powerful operatives. His behavior, though useful to the Daemon, is hated and feared even by other Darknet members. His first major act is to infiltrate the anti-Daemon task force. When found out, he quickly triggers an attack, which leaves most of the people and agents there dead. He is pursued by Roy Merritt, as he escapes and witnesses the Major executing Roy, vowing to kill the Major for betraying his own man.

'''The Major''', unnamed throughout the series, is introduced as a secret DOD liaison assigned to the daemon task force. Soon, everyone who encounters him realizes that his history is checkered, and his loyalty remains with the military-industrial complex now under attack by the Daemon. When Loki massacres the task force, he quickly contains the situation by destroying all evidence (including leveling the building) and personally executing Roy Merritt, fearful that Merritt's pursuit of Loki will attract too much attention. Realizing that they have underestimated the Daemon and its network, the Major retreats and prepares to wage a secret war against the Daemon and its agents.

'''Anji Anderson''' is a recently fired reporter, whose good looks have hindered her career for years. Having been relegated to fluff pieces and put on the air to be pretty, she is quickly recruited as a Daemon operative, her job to investigate stories that benefit the Daemon and help push its propaganda. Her main effect in the story is to help frame Sebeck.  She eventually becomes the spokesman for the Daemon.

'''Charles Mosely''' is a former drug dealer and convicted killer recruited by the Daemon, which helps him to escape prison by transferring him first to minimum security and then releasing him altogether. With a new identity, he travels to a Daemon-controlled office where he is interrogated by the Daemon's AI and is deemed acceptable to serve. He eventually becomes a security operative, assigned jobs such as executing criminals, participating a massive worldwide assassination of spammers who corrupt the internet. Mosley's only request is for the Daemon to locate his missing son and protect him. Ray is both found and sent to live with Daemon agents, who will raise and educate Ray in a safe family-like setting.

==Dutton purchase==
On June 25, 2008, the [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] imprint of the [[Penguin Group]] purchased ''Daemon'' and the rights to the sequel ''Freedom™'' from Verdugo Press.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[http://verdugopress.com/ Daemon by Leinad Zeraus Acquired by Dutton]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton has since achieved foreign rights sales worth over $1 million.

==Film adaptation==
[[Walter F. Parkes]], who produced the 1983 film ''[[WarGames]]'', had optioned the film rights to ''Daemon'' with [[Paramount Pictures]],&lt;ref name="WSJ When"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trachtenberg |first=Jeffrey A. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123678059330595141 |title=When Computers Rule the World |publisher=online.wsj.com |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they likely reverted to Suarez on 8 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Suarez film"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suarez |first=Daniel |url=https://plus.google.com/+DanielSuarez/posts/SjC6iVZGfCb |title=Status of 'Daemon' Movie |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Thomas O'Bannon''' (September 30, 1946 – December 17, 2009) was an American film [[screenwriter]], [[film director|director]], [[visual effects supervisor]], and occasional actor, usually in the [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] genres.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

O'Bannon is best known for having written the screenplay for ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', adapted from a story he wrote with [[Ronald Shusett]], and writing and directing the horror comedy ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]''. He also contributed computer animation to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and worked on cult classics such as ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'', ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]''.

==Early life==
O'Bannon was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], the son of Bertha ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Lowenthal) and Thomas Sidney O'Bannon, a carpenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/40/Dan-O-Bannon.html |title=Dan O'Bannon Biography (1946-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the art school of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], where he did stand-up comedy routines, did make-up for campus theater productions, and provided illustrations for Student Life, the student newspaper.  While there he roomed with future movie producer [[Michael Shamberg]]. O'Bannon moved home briefly after [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] and attended [[St. Louis Community College–Florissant Valley|Florissant Valley Junior College]] where he wrote and directed a short science fiction satire titled "The Attack of the 50-foot Chicken." O'Bannon also attended MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois.  He then attended the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) film school, where he met [[John Carpenter]] and collaborated with him on the science fiction student film ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974).

==Career==

===Early work===
Carpenter expanded the ''Dark Star'' short into a feature which was released in 1974 with a final budget of only US$60,000. O'Bannon served in a number of capacities, including scripting, editing and acting in one of the leading roles ("Pinback"). In 1975, ''Dark Star'' won the [[Saturn Award|Golden Scroll]] award (the Saturn Awards' original name) for [[Saturn Award for Best Special Effects|Best Special Effects]].

O'Bannon, growing up a science-fiction and horror enthusiast, abandoned technical work (including a stint as a computer animator on [[George Lucas]]' classic ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'') for screenwriting.

===1970s===
O'Bannon attended USC Film School and lived near the Los Angeles Campus in an old two-story house affectionately called the "Menlo Manor" which he shared with other USC students (Don Jakoby, who collaborated on several screenplays with Dan including ''Blue Thunder''; and Jeffrey J. Lee, who became a well-known artist in Europe). Part of his student film ''Dark Star'' was filmed there, with O'Bannon co-starring as Sgt. Pinback. He spent many late nights in old Hollywood editing his and other student films. His wish was to become a director. ''Dark Star'' was edited by O'Bannon using a 1940s Moviola.

He was attached to supervise special effects for an [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] production of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', but this fell apart in 1975 and the movie was never made as the major Hollywood studios were wary of financing the picture with Jodorowsky as director.  O'Bannon's role is prominently featured in the 2013 documentary ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]''.  The collapse of ''Dune'' left O'Bannon broke, homeless, and dependent on friends for his survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18438 |title=R.I.P. Dan O'Bannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living with his friend [[Ronald Shusett]], they came up with the story for O'Bannon's career-making film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), for which he wrote the screenplay and supervised visuals.

===1980s===
In 1981, O'Bannon helped create the animated feature ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', writing two of its segments ("Soft Landing" and "B-17").  O'Bannon voiced his displeasure with his next big-budget outing, [[John Badham]]'s ''[[Blue Thunder]]'' (1983), an action film about a Los Angeles [[helicopter]] surveillance team. Originally written with Don Jakoby, ''Blue Thunder'' also underwent extensive rewriting, losing some of its political content.  He and Jakoby also scripted ''[[Lifeforce (film)|Lifeforce]]'' (1985), a movie based on [[Colin Wilson]]'s novel ''[[The Space Vampires]]'' and directed by [[Tobe Hooper]] that veers from [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] visitation to [[Vampire|vampirism]] and an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] ending. It was not well received at the time, and was considered a [[box office]] [[box office bomb|flop]].  O'Bannon would again collaborate with Jakoby and Hooper for the 1986 remake ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]''. Purists considered it inferior to the 1950s original and it also performed poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Invaders from Mars|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=invadersfrommars.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Bannon also worked as a consultant for ''[[C.H.U.D.]]'', helping to create the design concept for the title creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chudfacts.com/#financing C.H.U.D. Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, O'Bannon moved into the director's chair with ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]''. Like ''Alien'', the film met with success, spawned numerous sequels, and became a cult classic.

===1990s===
In 1990, O'Bannon and Shusett re-teamed to make ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', an adaptation of the short story "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]" by [[Philip K. Dick]]. This was a project the two had been working on since collaborating on ''Alien''. The film earned well over US$100 million.  An earlier screenplay by the duo titled ''Hemoglobin'' was also produced as the low budget feature ''[[Bleeders (film)|Bleeders]]'' (1997).

O'Bannon's second directorial feature, ''[[The Resurrected]]'' (1991), was a low-budget horror effort released direct-to-video. Based on the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], it focused on a family's ancient rituals that awaken the dead. In 1995, O'Bannon received a co-writing credit for the sci-fi film ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]'' adapted from the Philip K. Dick story "[[Second Variety]]", having written the initial version of the screenplay with [[Michael Campus]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35037/rest-peace-dan-obannon |title=Rest in Peace: Dan O'Bannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2001, O'Bannon was the [[artist-in-residence|filmmaker-in-residence]] at [[Chapman University]]'s [[Dodge College of Film and Media Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scriptmag.com/features/screenwriting-the-dan-obannon-way |title=Screenwriting the Dan O’Bannon Way |author=Script Magazine |date=13 February 2013 |website=Script |publisher=F+W |access-date=19 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dream diary''' (or '''dream journal''') is a [[diary]] in which dream experiences are recorded. A [[dream]] diary might include a record of nightly dreams, personal reflections and [[waking dream]] experiences. It is often used in the study of dreams and [[psychology]]. Dream diaries are also used by some people as a way to help induce  [[lucid dream]]s. They are also regarded as a useful catalyst for remembering dreams. The use of a dream diary was recommended by Ann Faraday in ''The Dream Game'' as an aid to memory and a way to preserve details, many of which are otherwise rapidly forgotten no matter how memorable the dream originally seemed.&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, Ann: ''The Dream Game'', [[Harpercollins]], March 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Keeping a dream diary conditions a person to view remembering dreams as important. Dreams can be recorded in a paper diary (as text, drawings, paintings, etc.) or via an audio recording device (as narrative, music or imitations of other auditory experiences from the dream). Many websites offer the ability to create a digital dream diary.

== Lucid dreaming ==
Dream diaries are often kept by people striving to induce and remember lucid dreams. Writing down dreams increases what is called dream recall, or the ability to remember dreams. When writing down dreams, the dreamer often searches for dream signs, or recurring themes that have been detected between dreams. Dream recall can vary from day to day but keeping a diary tends to regulate waking dream memory.

It is important to record the dreams in the diary immediately after waking up, as individuals forget the details of their dreams very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Sponias - [http://www.freepsychologyarticles.com/how-to-keep-a-dream-journal-free-psychotherapy-in-your-own-dreams.html How to Keep a Dream Journal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192441/http://www.freepsychologyarticles.com/how-to-keep-a-dream-journal-free-psychotherapy-in-your-own-dreams.html |date=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing the next day's date in the dream diary asserts a conscious thought to remember dreams, which communicates intention to the subconscious mind.  The subconscious mind then responds by fulfilling that desire.  This mental action causes the conscious and subconscious minds to work together toward the common goal of remembering the dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condron|first=Barbara|title=The Dreamer's Dictionary|year=1994|publisher=SOM Publishing|location=Windyville, Missouri|isbn=0-944386-16-4|url=http://som.org/NewPages/Newsite07/SOMBar/Books/Titles/DreamersDictionary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False awakenings ===
The discipline of waking up to record a dream in a diary sometimes leads to a [[false awakening]] where the dreamer records the previous dream while still in a dream. Some dream diarists report writing down the same dream one or two times in a dream before actually waking up, and recording it in a physical dream diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/IJoDR/article/download/9085/pdf|title = False awakenings in light of the dream protoconsciousness theory: A study in lucid dreamers|last = Buzzi|first = Giorgio|date = September 2011|journal = International Journal of Dream Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific uses==
Followers of [[Eckankar]] frequently keep dream diaries, since they view dreams as important teaching tools and as a gateway to "Soul Travel," or the shifting of one's consciousness to ever-higher states of being.&lt;ref&gt;Klemp, H. (1999). ''The Art of Spiritual Dreaming''. Minneapolis, MN: [http://www.eckankar.org/dream.html Eckankar]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722.jpg|280px|thumb|''Durán Madonna'', c. 1435–38. 100 cm × 52 cm. Oil on oak wood. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid. Frame not captured in this reproduction.]] 
'''''Durán Madonna''''' (also known as the '''''Madonna in Red''''' or '''''Virgin and Child in a Niche'''''&lt;ref&gt;Nosow, ix&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Madonna Enthroned''''') is an oil on oak [[panel painting]] completed sometime between 1435 and 1438 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. The painting derives from [[Jan van Eyck| Jan van Eyck's]] ''[[Ince Hall Madonna]]'' and was much imitated subsequently.&lt;ref name= "Panofsky 259"&gt;Panofsky p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]], Madrid, it depicts a seated and serene [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] dressed in a long, flowing red robe lined with gold-coloured thread. She cradles the child Jesus who sits on her lap, playfully leafing backwards through a holy book or manuscript on which both figures' gazes rest. But unlike van Eyck's earlier treatment, van der Weyden not only positions his Virgin and Child in a Gothic [[apse]] or [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] as he had his two earlier madonnas (the ''[[Madonna Standing (van der Weyden)|Madonna Standing]]'' and the ''[[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden)|Virgin and Child Enthroned]]''), but also places them on a projecting plinth, thus further emphasising their sculptural impression.&lt;ref name= "Panofsky 259"/&gt;

Christ appears much older than in most contemporary paintings of this kind. He is far from an infant, and is very realistically and physically rendered. He is shown as a small child, with none of the softness of usual 15th-century depictions of the Virgin and Child.&lt;ref name="N146"&gt;Nosow, 146&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is characterised by the sculptural look that van der Weyden often favoured, and for its similarity in colourisation to his c. 1435 ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'' (Madrid) and c. 1442–45 ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' (Berlin).

The painting was acquired by Pedro Fernández-Durán in 1899 at the [[Palace of Infante don Luis (Boadilla del Monte)|Palacio de Boadilla]], Madrid. He donated the work to the [[Museo del Prado]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt;

==Description==
Mary is shown in a long, red, hooded robe and white headdress, with the Child Jesus in a white shirt seated on her lap. He curiously leafs through and crumples the pages of a book perched on his mother's knee. The book is placed at the very center of the panel, symbolising the centrality of the divine Word in Christian belief.&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; According to the Prado, the book itself represents an allusion to the "Holy Scriptures that announce Christ's redemptive mission."&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;"[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/virgin-and-child-1/ Virgin and Child]". [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An angel in dark grey dress hovers above Mary's head, holding a pearl-encrusted crown destined for her upon her assumption as [[Queen of Heaven]].&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; Mary's long robe swirls around the pictorial space, obscuring her throne and eventually falling at the support by her feet.&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; They are framed by a sculpted [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] or apse with Gothic [[tracery]] similar to that found in van der Weyden's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]''.&lt;ref name="N145"&gt;Nosow, 145&lt;/ref&gt; The curved arches of the niche echo the lines of her figure as she bends protectively over the child. These curved lines and warm colours give the work its sense of internal harmony.&lt;ref name="N145" /&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722 (Detail).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail showing the restless child leafing through the parchments of the holy book.]]
Art-historical analysis in the early to mid 20th century placed little emphasis on Christ's older age for a "Virgin and Child" work of this period. Nor did it emphasise the significance of the manuscript or the rough manner in which Christ seems to energetically leaf through it, his play watched on by a near-indulgent&lt;!--hm--&gt; Mary. More recently, art historians such as [[Alfred Acres]] have questioned the significance of the child's freedom of movement and naturalistic portrayal in such a deliberately elegant and poised work—especially in the work of such a self-aware and compositionally involved painter as van der Weyden. Acres believes that the book is central to the understanding of the painting, and notes its perfect centrality in the panel; it is the focus of both figures' gazes and hands, and Christ is apparently leafing ''backwards'' through the pages, towards the beginning.&lt;ref name="A77"&gt;Acres, 77&lt;/ref&gt; While Christ's right hand holds a number of parchments scrunched together and he pays no attention to them, his more careful left hand is about to open the lower left corner of the open page. If it is reasonably assumed that the book held open on Mary's lap is facing towards her, it seems the child is leafing backwards through the pages. While holy books were often included in 15th-century northern depictions of the Virgin, they were usually associated with the idea of the Virgin as a representation of learning or wisdom; in no other contemporary painting are they turned through with such restless energy, not to mention being turned through from end to beginning.&lt;ref name="A79"&gt;Acres, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Acres suggests that the infant Christ is leafing back towards [[Book of Genesis|Genesis: 3]] describing the [[Fall of Man]], citing three other works where van der Weyden similarly articulates the [[Redemption (theology)|redemptive theme]], including the '' Madonna Standing'' panel in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] where the Madonna is flanked by figures of Adam and Eve.&lt;ref name= "A90"&gt;Acres, 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Panofsky 261"&gt;''c.f.'' Panofsky p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - detail2.jpg|thumb|290px|Detail showing the dark winged angel hovering under the Niche holding the crown above Mary's head.]]
Art historian [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] believes the painting was influenced by [[Robert Campin]]'s Frankfurt ''[[commons:File:Robert Campin - Virgin and Child - WGA14434.jpg|Virgin and Child]]'' both in [[ideal of feminine beauty|the ideal of feminine beauty]] it presents and for its elegant use of long folded draperies. Campbell notes that both works are composed from strong diagonal lines, with the main figures pushed out into the center foreground, in an almost [[trompe-l'œil]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 19&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Durán Madonna'' is often compared to van der Weyden's ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'', both for the colourisation of Mary's dress and for a sculptural look similar to the reliefs shown in the earlier triptych. In addition, the underdrawing of Mary's head is strikingly similar to that of the kindly, idealised Madonna in his ''Froimont Diptych'' (after 1460), now in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Caen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand et al., 259&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these strong similarities, attribution to van der Weyden is not doubted, although the work is known to have been frequently copied in Spain after it was relocated there&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; sometime in the 16th century.

The black overpaint behind the Virgin was probably added at the request of a later 18th-century seller, most likely in an attempt to fashion the piece as a genre work and downplay its religious theme. Research aided by X-ray has been inconclusive and has found no lost detail or drawing beneath the thick layers of paint.&lt;ref name="C50"&gt;Campbell, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusionary devices==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait Diptych of Laurent Froimont (left wing) - WGA25697.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Left wing of van der Weyden's ''Froimont Diptych'', after 1460. [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Caen]].]]

Van der Weyden often depicted lifelike and voluminous figures set in shallow sculptural spaces, in which they seemed cramped and larger than scale. The space filled by the figures is undefined and ambiguously located. Mary and the child are supported by a projecting [[corbel]], the three-dimensionality of which gives the disorienting impression that the figures are part of a [[relief]] in a much larger work of art. This gives the work a dizzying and dislocated perspective; its own unique sense of space and placement.&lt;ref&gt;Nosow, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is an early example of van der Weyden's habit of rendering his figures with the appearance of [[polychrome]] sculptures, an effect here accentuated by the neutral background.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; Van der Weyden's tendency to blur the line between sculpture and paint in an illusionistic manner can be see most effectively in his  ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]''. Art historian Robert Nosow notes the architectural aspect of the gothic frame, and the manner in which the lines of the Virgin and child make them seem as if statues come to life.&lt;ref name="N145" /&gt; Art historian Shirley Neilsen Blum writes that the faux sculptural elements, "force[s] the viewer to continually confront the seemingly real presence of two media, sculpture and painting&amp;nbsp;... Rogier defies logic and therefore enhances the magical quality of the image. Divinity is stressed because it has transcended media definition."&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February 2008, four paintings worth [[swiss franc|CHF]] 180 million ($162.5 million) were [[art theft|stolen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.com/Public/News/2008/woa20080211.asp |publisher=Interpol.com |title=Four masterpieces stolen from Zurich museum (ref.: 2008/5583) |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All four paintings have since been recovered.

'''Krip-Hop''' is a movement demonstrating alternate arrangements by which [[hip hop]] artists with disabilities can communicate through social media, including [[Education|educators]],  [[journalist]]s and conferences. The movement uses hip hop music as a means of expression for the disabled, providing them an opportunity to share their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choy|first1=Allie|date=February 12, 2012|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues|title=Krip-hop nation uses hip-hop to expose disability issues}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Not History}}History==
Krip Hop was founded by [[Leroy F. Moore Jr.]], an African American writer, [[poet]], community [[Activism|activist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] who was diagnosed with [[cerebral palsy]]. Moore was born in New York in 1967 to an activist father loosely connected to the Black Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydayabolition.com/2013/02/23/leroy-moore/|title=Interview with Leroy Moore |publisher=Everyday Abolition/Abolition Every Day |date=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His upbringing sensitized Moore to the challenges faced by African Americans and the disabled.&lt;ref name="amoeba"/&gt; As a youth, Moore discovered that most people had little knowledge of the historical impact of disabled African Americans. This led him to begin research, initially in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amoeba.com/blog/2008/07/jamoeblog/krip-hop-project-s-leroy-f-moore-on-being-black-disabled.html |title=Krip-Hop Project's Leroy F Moore On Being Black &amp; Disabled |publisher=The Amoeblog |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore first spotlighted disabled hip hop artists in the early 2000s. He co-produced and co-hosted a three-part series on what he called "Krip Hop" for a Berkeley, California radio station. The "Krip Hop" series appeared on [[KPFA]]'s ''Pushing Limits'', which focuses on news, arts, and culture for the disabled community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hix |first=Lisa |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/performance/article.jsp?essid=43903 |title=Interview with Leroy Moore, Founder of Krip Hop Nation |publisher=KQED Public Media |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' popularity inspired Moore to create Krip Hop Nation for disabled musicians, since little cultural work or music by people with disabilities had been recognized.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reverb"/&gt; "The Krip-Hop movement really makes the pain of the people feel visible", Moore said. "It goes a lot deeper than what people can see."&lt;ref name="uwdaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues#.UoBI-ZTF1mk |work=The Daily |publisher=University of Washington |author=Allie Choy |date=12 February 2012 |title=Krip-Hop Nation uses hip-hop to expose disability issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111040926/http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Krip Hop Nation==
The primary goal of Krip Hop Nation is to increase awareness in music and media outlets of the talents, history and rights of people with disabilities in the hip-hop industry. In an interview, Moore expressed the hope that by listening to his music the audience would understand the need to question authority and the information provided to them. He said he wanted his listeners to learn about their community and to become open to all people. Issues such as racism and sexism are commonly discussed, and Moore hoped that people would examine possible [[ableism]] in their attitudes.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt; According to Moore, Krip Hop Nation goes beyond producing music and the [[bling-bling]] associated with hip hop; the movement is about advocacy, education and overcoming oppression. For Moore the movement has sought to reclaim negative terms associated with the disabled (such as "crazy", "lame", "retarded" and "cripple"), using them to shock people into understanding and respecting the disabled African American community.&lt;ref name="wordgathering"/&gt; Krip Hop Nation addresses discrimination against disabled artists in hip hop by publishing articles and hosting events, lectures and workshops. It has over 300 members worldwide.&lt;ref name="wordgathering"/&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is self-published.|date=March 2015}}

Moore has explained that "Krip Hop" is a play on "Hip Hop." Although the "Krip" part of the name refers to "crippled", it is spelled with a "k" to avoid association with the [[Crips]].&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Krip Hop Nation has released two mixtape CDs, held conferences with the PeaceOut HomoHop organization at UC Berkeley and New York University, organized and hosted a six-artist performance in Sacramento, California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://poormagazine.org/node/4655 2011 End of the Year Accomplishments.] Accessed 31 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; staged a show at Disability and Deaf Arts (DADA) in [[Liverpool]] and hosted a Krip Hop Nation conference in Atlanta, Georgia for [[Black History Month]] in 2011 featuring musicians, writers and activists.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;

In February 2012, DJ Quad of 5th Battalion joined Krip Hop Nation to co-produce a CD with 17 disabled artists from the UK, the US and Germany on police brutality and profiling. Among the collaborators was Emmitt Thrower of Artist Magnet. The documentary was scheuled for release in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leroy |url=http://poormagazine.org/node/4655 |title=Krip-Hop Nation End of the Year Accomplishments 2012 |publisher=POOR Magazine/Prensa POBRE |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable musicians==
Krip Hop Nation includes artists such as Counterclockwise, Preach-man, Wheelchair Sports Camp, Miss Money and Fezo.&lt;ref name="wheres-lulu"/&gt; [[Kalyn Heffernan]] is a rapper from [[Denver]], Colorado. With [[Osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]], Heffernan is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|cm}} tall and uses a wheelchair. She heads Wheelchair Sports Camp, an experimental hip-hop group with jazz and avant-garde influences. Her raps are political, with many discussing the difficulties she faces as a disabled person in America. Heffernan created beats for Haitian rappers in the area dealing with extreme poverty after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gentile |first=Joseph |url=https://www.vice.com/read/everyone-in-this-wheelchair-sports-camp-is-stoned-and-making-beats |title=Everyone in This Wheelchair Sports Camp Is Stoned and Making Beats |publisher=Vice |date=2013-12-05 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 she was arrested after a 3-day sitdown protest at her GOP Senator's office, remarking "I'd rather go to jail than to die without [[Medicaid]]" in regards to [[Trumpcare]]. &lt;ref name="Heffernan Trumpcare Arrest"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/leahmcelrath/status/880782432064110592 |title=Heffernan Trumpcare Arrest |last=Leah McElrath   |first=Leah |date=2017-07-01 |website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Dickens 3.jpg|thumb]]

'''The letters of [[Charles Dickens]]''', of which more than 14,000 are known, range in date from about 1821, when Dickens was 9 years old, to 8 June 1870, the day before he died.{{sfn|Easson|2011|p=335}}  They have been described as "invariably idiosyncratic, exuberant, vivid, and amusing…widely recognized as a significant body of work in themselves, part of the Dickens canon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themorgan.org/blog/charles-dickenss-letters |title=Charles Dickens's Letters |last=Kiely |first=Declan |date=10 November 2011 |publisher=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum |access-date=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were written to family, friends, and the contributors to his literary periodicals, who included many of the leading writers of the day.  Their letters to him were almost all burned by Dickens because of his horror at the thought of his private correspondence being laid open to public scrutiny.  The reference edition of Dickens's letters is the 12-volume Pilgrim Edition, edited by Graham Storey ''et al.'' and published by [[Oxford University Press]].

==Dickens as a letter-writer==
[[File:Charles Dickens Autograph.jpg|thumb|Dickens's signature from a letter, incorporating his personal flourish]]

[[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] received, by his own count, 60 to 80 letters every day, and when pressure of work permitted he replied to them without delay.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=viii}}  For most of his life he did not employ a secretary but conducted his correspondence himself.  Exceptions were made for begging letters, which his sister-in-law [[Georgina Hogarth]] answered, and for routine business connected with his two magazines, ''[[Household Words]]'' and ''[[All the Year Round]]'', which was handled by his assistant editor [[William Henry Wills (journalist)|W. H. Wills]], although Dickens preferred to correspond with the contributors himself.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=xiv}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pearson |first1=Hesketh |author-link1=Hesketh Pearson |year=1949 |title=Dickens |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KP4NAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22explanation+and+advice+to+his+contributors%22&amp;dq=%22explanation+and+advice+to+his+contributors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIgJeBt5jXAhUCElAKHXy6CdQQ6AEIJjAA |location=London |publisher=Four Square |page=180 |access-date=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote with a goose quill rather than a steel pen, and at first used black ink (now aged to brown), switching in the late 1840s to blue ink on blue paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themorgan.org/collection/A-Letter-from-Charles-Dickens |title=A Letter from Charles Dickens |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |publisher=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum |access-date=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His biographer [[Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]] described his handwriting as "so 'prompt', so alert, finished and full of purpose and decision; legible also, but requiring familiarity and training to read".  He often ended his signature with an exuberant flourish, which became a kind of trademark.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|pp=xv-xvi}}

==His correspondents==

Dickens's correspondents spanned the whole social scale of 19th century England from reformed street prostitutes to [[Queen Victoria]] herself.  They included family members, of course, and Dickens's publishers; writers like [[Robert Browning]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Wilkie Collins]], [[George Eliot]], [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] (not yet ennobled), and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]; the artists [[Clarkson Frederick Stanfield|Clarkson Stanfield]] and [[Daniel Maclise]]; and the actor [[William Macready]].  Letters to several of his friends have little or no representation in the surviving correspondence because they were destroyed by the recipients, their heirs, or by random accidents of history.  These correspondents include his daughter [[Kate Perugini|Katey]], [[Augustus Egg]], [[Chauncy Hare Townshend]], [[Hablot Knight Browne|Hablot K. Browne ("Phiz")]], [[Richard Barham]], [[James Muspratt]], and his lover [[Ellen Ternan]].{{sfn|Hartley|2012|pp=xii-xiii, xix}}{{sfn|Paroissien|2008|p=35}}

==Subject matter==

The letters are the only extended autobiographical writing by Dickens that has survived.  Attempts at writing a diary seldom lasted long and for the most part the manuscripts are lost, while a memoir of his childhood was discontinued and converted into some of the early chapters of ''[[David Copperfield]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Philip |chapter=Diaries and Autobiography of Dickens |editor1-last=Schlicke |editor1-first=Paul |title=The Oxford Comapnion to Charles Dickens: Anniversary Edition |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AYCcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=%22diaries+are+mentioned+in+letters%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitsaS8xaXXAhVO3KQKHcf4BakQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22diaries%20are%20mentioned%20in%20letters%22&amp;f=false |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=158 |isbn=9780199640188 |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The letters therefore give the most immediate and vivid expression of Dickens's life as seen by himself, even though they rarely examine his interior life.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|pp=viii-ix, xi}}  They give a unique insight into the way Dickens's processes of composition worked as he wrestled with the novels we know and considered others which were never written, such as the "book whereof the whole story shall be on the top of the [[Great St Bernard Pass|Great St. Bernard]]".{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=x}}  Dickens's almost constant travelling is also reflected.  [[George Gissing]] wrote that "If he makes a tour in any part of the British Isles, he writes a full description of all he sees, of everything that happens, and writes it with such gusto, such mirth, such strokes of fine picturing, as appear in no other private letters ever given to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gissing |first1=George |year=1898 |title=Charles Dickens: A Critical Study |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZWg6AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gusto+such+mirth%22&amp;dq=%22gusto+such+mirth%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYgc_Dx6XXAhXN26QKHcrYD9g4FBDoAQgrMAE |location=London |publisher=Blackie |page=235 |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The range of subject-matter of the letters is described by his editor, Jenny Hartley:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scotland, Paris, and Venice…child exploitation, [[Ragged school|Ragged Schools]], and soup kitchens…[[the Great Exhibition]], women smoking, and dresses for reformed prostitutes…ravens, waistcoats, and recipes for punch…[[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]] and dreams…terrible acting and wonderful children's birthday parties".{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=xx}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Manuscripts==

Dickens's early sensational success as the author of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' induced many people to keep any letters he might send them.  This, along with his huge output of letters, ensured that many thousands have survived.{{sfn|Easson|2011|p=335}}{{sfn|Paroissien|2008|p=35}}  In 1965 the editors of his letters reckoned them to number nearly 12,000; by 2002 they had amended the total to 14,252.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|p=xxxiv}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2002 |editor1-last=Storey |editor1-first=Graham |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens.

In contrast, few letters to Dickens are known.  Dickens often expressed his opposition to the publication of private letters, and was determined to suffer from it himself as little as possible.  He burned those letters that had been sent to him in a mass bonfire in 1860, commenting, "Would to God that every letter I had ever written was on that pile".  He burned more in 1869, the year before he died.{{sfn|Easson|2011|p=336}}{{sfn|Paroissien|2008|p=34}}  As a result, hardly more than 250 letters to Dickens have survived to the present day.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|p=xxx}}

==Editions==
[[File:Lettre de Dickens à Angela Burdett-Coutts.jpg|thumb|A letter to [[Angela Burdett-Coutts]], written from the [[Champs-Élysées]], Paris in 1856]]

The reading public's first chance to study large numbers of Dickens letters came shortly after his death with the publication of ''The Life of Charles Dickens'' (1872–74) by his lifelong friend John Forster.  Many of Dickens's letters to Forster were included, but they were heavily and rather dishonestly edited to make Forster seem a more central figure in Dickens's life than he had always been.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|pp=xi-xvii}}

In 1878 it was announced that a collection of Dickens's letters would be edited by his sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth.  In collaboration with Dickens's eldest daughter [[Mary Dickens|Mary]] she duly produced ''The Letters of Charles Dickens'' in three volumes, which were published by [[Chapman &amp; Hall]] between 1880 and 1882.  A second edition in two volumes followed in 1882, and a third in one volume, published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], in 1893. Altogether they included roughly a thousand letters, many were heavily cut for reasons of taste, and some were created by cut-and-pasting together extracts from several different letters in a way which was considered unacceptable even by late-Victorian standards.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|p=ix-x}}

1938 saw the publication in three volumes of almost 6,000 of the letters, edited by Walter Dexter as part of the Nonesuch Edition of Dickens's Works.{{sfn|House|Storey|1965|p=xvii}}  This was an expensively-priced edition limited to 877 copies, and was therefore not easily accessible to the ordinary reader unless he had either ample means or access to a university library.  Moreover, Dexter's editorial practices were far from rigorous: there was hardly any annotation, and many of the letters were simply copied from previous editions rather than from the originals, with the inevitable result that the texts were not always accurate.{{sfn|Paroissien|1985|p=xii}}{{sfn|Easson|2011|p=337}}

In 1949 the publisher [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] set a new edition in motion, with a grant of £6000 from the [[Pilgrim Trust]] and the Dickens scholar Humphry House in place as editor.  In 1955, with almost 10,000 letters transcribed, House died unexpectedly.  His widow Madeline House took over the project in collaboration with the critic [[Graham Hough]], though Graham Storey soon took over Hough's role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1985 |editor1-last=Hart-Davis |editor1-first=Rupert |title=The Lyttelton Hart-Davis Letters.

The editorial team changed over the years, with Madeline House, Graham Storey, Kathleen Tillotson, K. J. Fielding, Nina Burgis and Angus Easson all being named as editor at various points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/34284786?style=html&amp;title=letters%20of%20Charles%20Dickens |title=Copac catalogue entry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Copac |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Academy]] took over the financing of the project, and from 1995 it was renamed the British Academy – Pilgrim Trust Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |editor1-last=Storey |editor1-first=Graham |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens.

Not all of the originals of these letters can be found; some are printed from short extracts in sale catalogues and similar sources, and some are only known from mentions of their existence in other letters.{{sfn|Hartley|2012|p=viii}}  Dickens's biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] reported that "Each volume of this edition wins acclaim as it appears, and it is right that it should do so";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/14338634?style=html&amp;title=letters%20of%20Charles%20Dickens |title=Copac catalogue entry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Copac |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one such critic thought that "it brings Dickens so close you can almost smell the cigar smoke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f.waseda.jp/vicky/students/help/mistakes/almost-ex.html |title=Examples of ''almost'' |last=Muehleisen |first=Victoria |publisher=Waseda University |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dissenting voices have been few, and though Joel J. Brattin noted that there were some errors and omissions of transcription he endorsed it as being in general extremely accurate, and thought the project as a whole "of incomparable value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brattin |first1=Joel J. |year=2011 |orig-year=1999 |chapter=Criticism and Scholarship |editor1-last=Schlicke |editor1-first=Paul |title=The Oxford Companion to Charles Dickens: Anniversary Edition |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AYCcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22despite+some+errors+and+omissions%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK5o_f9KXXAhVLyKQKHXL8AI0Q6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22despite%20some%20errors%20and%20omissions%22&amp;f=false |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=146–147 |isbn=9780199640188 |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Dickens letters are discovered at the rate of about 20 per year, and they were for some years edited and published in Supplements to the Pilgrim Edition in ''The Dickensian'', the journal of the [[Dickens Fellowship]].  They have also been made accessible online by the Charles Dickens Letters Project, and it is intended eventually to publish a supplementary volume to the Pilgrim Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/files/34843306/Supplement_1.pdf |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens: Supplement – I |last=Easson |first=Angus |website=The Charles Dickens Letters Project |publisher=Queen's University Belfast |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/files/34843324/Supplement_19.pdf |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens: Supplement XIX |last1=Easson |first1=Angus |last2=Litvack |first2=Leon |last3=Brown |first3=Margaret |last4=Dicks |first4=Joan |website=The Charles Dickens Letters Project |publisher=Queen's University Belfast |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dickensletters.com |title=The Charles Dickens Letters Project |last=Litvack |first=Leon |publisher=Dickens Fellowship |access-date=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selections==

The costliness of both the Nonesuch and Pilgrim volumes, and the fragmentary or routine business nature of many of the letters included, has encouraged the publication of selections of Dickens's letters, intended for the general reader rather than the scholar.  In 1985 David Paroissien edited ''The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens'', taking his texts from the Nonesuch Edition, substantive textual variants from the first five volumes of the Pilgrim Edition (the only ones then published) being listed in the notes.{{sfn|Paroissien|1985|pp=x-xii}}  The scholar [[John Espey]] wrote that this selection constitutes "a full review of almost all that we know of Dickens' activities as editor, public figure, father, husband, lecturer and lover", and that it "should satisfy for some time both the general reader and the specialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Espey |first1=John |date=23 February 1986 |title=Selected Letters of Charles Dickens: Edited and Arranged by David Paroissien |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-23/books/bk-10839_1_david-paroissien |journal=Los Angeles Times |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Dickens's bicentenary year, Jenny Hartley edited a one-volume selection from the Pilgrim Edition.  [[Claire Harman (writer)|Claire Harman]], writing in the ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|Times Literary Supplement]]'', welcomed it with enthusiasm, while noting the sparse annotation and the fact that Hartley had chosen a representative selection of the letters, including a few rather trivial ones, rather than "a series of epistolary knock-out blows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harman |first1=Claire |date=8 February 2012 |title=What an Amazing Man! |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/charles-dickens-letters-amazing-man/ |journal=Times Literary Supplement |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd Tonkin, in the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'', found it to be "edited with unobtrusive intelligence and insight",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tonkin |first1=Boyd |date=3 February 2012 |title=The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens, Edited by Jenny Hartley |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-selected-letters-of-charles-dickens-edited-by-jenny-hartley-6298396.html |journal=The Independent |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Carol Oates]] thought it "more revealing and more intimate than any biography",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oates |first1=Joyce Carol |date=16 August 2012 |title=The Mystery of Charles Dickens |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/08/16/mystery-charles-dickens/ |journal=The New York Review of Books |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the critic [[Nicholas Lezard]] recommended it in the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' with the words, "The whole book bursts with the author’s energy, and you will love him and know him better after reading even a few of these letters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lezard |first1=Nicholas |date=14 July 2015 |title=The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens: Review – The Man Behind the Novels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/14/selected-letters-charles-dickens-review |journal=The Guardian |access-date=5 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, a 4-hour audiobook was issued by [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] under the title ''Charles Dickens: A Portrait in Letters'', the readers being David Timson and [[Simon Callow]].  One reviewer wrote that they "create myriad personalities with varying accents, tones, class distinctions, and personal idiosyncrasies that are nearly flawless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.audiofilemagazine.com/reviews/read/77105/charles-dickens-a-portrait-in-letters-by-charles-dickens/ |title=[Review] |author=S.

==Background==
Gotland began to gradually abandon [[Norse religion]] and adopt [[Christianity]] during the 11th century.&lt;ref name="DMG"&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrén|first= Anders|authorlink= |title= Det Medeltida Gotland. En arkeologisk guidebok|trans-title=Medieval Gotland. An archaeological guide book. |url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/12028545|year= 2011|publisher= Historiska Media|location= Lund|language=Swedish|isbn= 978-91-85873-83-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first churches to be built on Gotland were wooden, built in the manner of [[stave church]]es.&lt;ref name=lansstyrelsenkyrkor/&gt; None of these have survived intact. The most well-preserved remains, today in the [[Swedish History Museum]], are those of [[Hemse stave church]].&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; Traces and archaeological evidence of earlier stave churches have been discovered in ten different sites on Gotland.&lt;ref name="DMG"/&gt; The remains point to an artistic decoration reminiscent of [[Viking art]].&lt;ref name=kulturen&gt;{{cite book |last1= Jonsson|first1= Marita|last2= Lindquist|first2= Sven-Olof|last3= Hejdström|first3= Raymond|date= 1999|title= Vägen till kulturen på Gotland|edition= 6th|url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/7768519|location= Visby|publisher= Gotlands fornsal|page= |isbn= 91-88036-32-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone churches began to replace wooden churches during the 12th century.&lt;ref name=lansstyrelsenkyrkor/&gt; These churches were [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style, with influences coming mainly from [[Architecture of Denmark|Denmark]] and western [[Architecture of Germany|German]] architecture,&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; but to a limited extent also from the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=kulturen/&gt; Importantly, the construction of [[Lund Cathedral]] in [[Scania]] established a source of influences in the relative vicinity. Likewise, the 1164 establishment of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Roma Abbey]] on Gotland led to strong [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercian influences]] in the following period of church construction. These Romanesque churches were sometimes decorated internally with [[Church frescos in Sweden|frescos]]. Here also, the influences came most often from the west and south, but sometimes also from [[Russian culture|Russia]]. Similarly, the churches were adorned with stone sculpture, notably decorated [[baptismal font]]s. Here, too, influences came from both the west and the east,&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; but the sculptors themselves seem to have been native Gotlanders.&lt;ref name=kulturen/&gt; Finally, such churches also occasionally display wooden sculptures, such as [[triumphal cross]]es. These display a more markedly uniform western style, with influences coming from France or western Germany.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt;
[[File:Martebo kyrka church medieval servant Egypticus.jpg|thumb|left|During the Gothic era, the church portals were often decorated with sculptures, such as these at [[Martebo Church]]]]
During the 13th century, reconstruction works were started on several of these earlier churches. New churches were also commissioned. Gotland was enjoying a period of prosperity thanks to increasing trade, and, possibly, due to its role as a staging area for [[Northern Crusades|crusaders departing for the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref name="DMG"/&gt; The churches were made larger and more elaborate. The style began to shift in favour of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], although few churches on Gotland display a pronounced Gothic style. The most elaborate parts of these churches are often the portals, notably the main southern portals.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; The towers of these churches are also taller and more elaborate than earlier towers (which were often designed with a dual, defensive purpose). Another typical feature is the square [[choir (architecture)|choir]] that lacks an [[apse]] and instead has a straight eastern wall with three windows.&lt;ref name=kulturen/&gt; Internally, frescos and wooden sculpture continued to enjoy popularity, as well as occasionally [[stained glass]] windows. Artistic influences came via Visby from mainly western Germany. At the end of this period, Gotland entered a period of economic decline. Following the [[Black Death]], the invasion of Gotland by [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]] and the [[Battle of Visby]] (1361), and a general decrease in trade, many churches were left unfinished. Hence, several churches on Gotland display a peculiar form, where the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] is in Gothic style and disproportionally large in comparison with the rest of the otherwise Romanesque church. In such cases, reconstruction of the church had started with the choir but was brought to a halt before the whole reconstruction scheme could be finished.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt;

From about 1400, no new churches were erected and the general religious building activity decreases sharply. Internally, some churches receive further embellishment in the form of new [[altarpiece]]s or frescos during the 15th and 16th century. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], a new type of altarpieces and [[pulpit]]s were introduced.&lt;ref name="gotkyrkor"/&gt; These post-Reformation furnishings from the 17th and 18th centuries are also well represented in the churches of Gotland.&lt;ref name=lansstyrelsenkyrkor/&gt;

The church building activity on Gotland thus took place in the period of approximately 250 years, from {{circa}} 1100 to 1350. Until the early 13th century, the pace of church building was comparable to the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. From then on, both the number and size of new churches increased significantly, until building activity came to a complete halt at the end of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="DMG"/&gt;

Only a few of the church buildings on Gotland have been significantly altered since the end of the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name=lansstyrelsenkyrkor/&gt; which is unusual in a European context, since medieval churches were often heavily reconstructed or renovated during the 19th century. The medieval parish churches of Gotland comprise the most well-preserved set of such churches in Sweden,&lt;ref name="DMG"/&gt; and indeed in the whole [[Baltic region]].&lt;ref name=lt&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hansson|first= Joakim|last2= |first2= |date= 2005|title= Lost values &amp; unused possibilities in the medieval churches in Gotland|url= http://www.menufakultetas.vdu.lt/var/uploads/editor/mik_1.pdf|journal= Meno istorija ir kritika (MIK)|publisher= |issn= 1822-4547|volume= 1/2005|issue= |pages= 60–72|doi= |accessdate= 12 October 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044918/http://www.menufakultetas.vdu.lt/var/uploads/editor/mik_1.pdf|archivedate= 4 March 2016|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, a small number of new churches have been built, notably in Visby.

The vast majority of the churches on Gotland belongs to the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church of Sweden]], and the [[Diocese of Visby]].

This is a list of monuments suffering damage from conflict in the [[Middle East]] during the 21st century. It is sorted by country.

==Afghanistan==
* The [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were a spectacular legacy of [[Buddhism]] in [[Afghanistan]]. The sandstone sculptures were among the tallest standing Buddhas in the world (the largest at 53 metres). The 35 structures had survived more than 1,500 years. The [[Taliban]] stated that they considered the monuments [[idolatrous]] and destroyed them with dynamite over several weeks, starting on 2 March 2001.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"&gt;{{cite news |title=The greatest buildings you'll never see: 20 priceless monuments lost in conflict |author=Kieron Monks |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/05/world/gallery/precious-monuments-lost-in-middle-east-conflicts/index.html|network=cnn |date=29 June 2015 |accessdate=2 July 2015 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
* The [[Museum of Islamic Art, Cairo|Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Cairo]] is home to one of the world's most impressive collections of Islamic art. It includes over 100,000 pieces that cover the entirety of [[Islamic history]]. The Cairo site was first built in 1881 and underwent a multi-million dollar renovation between 2003 and 2010.

: On January 24th, 2014 a car bomb attack targeting the Cairo police headquarters on the other side of the street caused considerable damage to the museum and destroyed many artifacts. It is estimated that 20-30% of the artifacts will need restoration. The blast also severely damaged the buildings facade, wiping out intricate designs in the Islamic style. The [[Egyptian National Library and Archives]] in the same building was also affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140124-cairo-egypt-museum-islamic-art-bomb-artifacts-destroyed/|title=Cairo Blast Rips Into Islamic Art Museum, Damaging Key Global Collection|date=26 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25877201 | work=BBC News | title=Cairo's Islamic Art Museum hit in blast | date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/unesco-islamic-museum-cairo-blast|title=Unesco to assess blast damage at Islamic museum in Cairo|first=Associated Press in|last=Cairo|date=26 January 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq==
* [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]. Once the largest [[mosque]] in the world, built in the 9th century on the [[Tigris River]] north of [[Baghdad]]. The mosque is famous for Malwiya Tower, a 52-meter minaret with spiraling ramps for worshipers to climb. The site was bombed in 2005, in an insurgent attack on a [[NATO]] position, destroying the top of the minaret and surrounding walls.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
* [[Tomb of Jonah]]. The purported resting place of biblical prophet Jonah, along with a tooth by some believed to be from the whale that consumed him in the myth. The site dated to the 8th century BC, and was of great importance to [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] faiths. It was entirely blown up by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] militants in 2014 as part of their campaign against perceived apostasy.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
* [[Nimrud]]. The ancient [[Assyria]]n city around Nineveh Province, Iraq was home to countless treasures of the empire, including statues, monuments and jewels. Following the 2003 invasion the site has been devastated by looting, with many of the stolen pieces finding homes in museum abroad.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

[[File:Saint Elijah's Monastery 1.JPG|thumb|[[Dair Mar Elia]] monastery]]
* [[Dair Mar Elia]]. The Christian monastery near Mosul was founded in the late 6th century, and its sanctuary was built in the 11th century. The monastery was damaged during the invasion of 2003, before being completely destroyed by ISIL in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Martin|title=Isil extremists destroy Iraq’s oldest Christian monastery|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/isil-extremists-destroy-iraq-s-oldest-christian-monastery/|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebanon==
* [[Old Beirut]] suffered through a brutal 15-year civil war, successive battles with [[Israel]], and sweeping urban development. It is referred to as the "Paris of the [[Middle East]]" and is known for its impressive landscape Ottoman, French and [[Art Deco]] architecture. Officials report that just 400 of 1200 protected historic buildings remain.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

==Libya==
* [[Cyrene (Libya)]]. A key city for the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], established in [[630 BC]]. Famed as the basis for enduring myths and legends, such as that of the huntress heroine of the same name and bride of [[Apollo]]. The ruins were some of the best preserved from that period.

: In May 2011, a number of objects excavated from Cyrene in 1917 and held in the vault of the National Commercial Bank in [[Benghazi]] were stolen. Looters tunnelled into the vault and broke into two safes that held the artefacts which were part of the so-called 'Benghazi Treasure' . The whereabouts of these objects are currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/benghazi-treasure |title=Benghazi Treasure |publisher=Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Cyrene were destroyed in August 2013 by locals to make way for homes and shops. Approximately 200 vaults and tombs were leveled, as well as a section of a viaduct dating to the third century BC. Artifacts were thrown into a nearby river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/1242-130823-libya-cyrene-necropolis |title=Destruction of Cyrene Necropolis |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Al-Madina Souq]]. The covered markets in the Old City are a famous trade center for the region's finest produce, with dedicated sub-souks for fabrics, food, and accessories. The tunnels became the scene of fierce fighting and many of the oldest are now damaged beyond recognition. This was described by UNESCO as a tragedy.&lt;ref name="Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan"/&gt;
* [[Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge]]. This French-built suspension bridge was a popular pedestrian crossing and vantage point for its views of the Euphrates River.

* [[Krak des Chevaliers]]. The Crusader castle from the 11th century survived centuries of battles and natural disasters, becoming a [[World Heritage site]] in 2006 along with the adjacent castle of Qal'at Salah El-Din.

: During the [[Syrian Civil War]] which began in 2011 UNESCO voiced concerns that the conflict might lead to the damage of important cultural sites such as Krak des Chevaliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/862 |title=Director-General of UNESCO appeals for protection of Syria’s cultural heritage |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the castle was [[Artillery|shelled]] in August 2012 by the [[Syrian Army|Syrian Arab Army]], and the Crusader chapel has been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-syrias-ancient-treasures-pulverised-8007768.html| title=Robert Fisk: Syria's ancient treasures pulverised| publisher=The Independent| date=2012-08-05| accessdate=2012-08-05| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was reported to have been damaged in July 2013 by an [[Syrian Arab Air Force|airstrike]] during the [[Siege of Homs]],&lt;ref name="Air strike  2013"&gt;{{cite news| title=Latest victim of Syria air strikes: Famed Krak des Chevaliers castle| url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=60073| accessdate=14 July 2013| newspaper=Middle East Online| date=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once more on the 18th of August 2013 it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown.

* [[Palmyra]]. An "oasis in the Syrian desert" according to [[UNESCO]], this Aramaic city has stood since the second millennium BC and featured some of the most advanced architecture of the priod. The site subsequently evolved through [[Greco-Roman]] and [[Persia]]n periods, providing unique historic insight into those cultures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">[[File:Malaysian Batik.jpg|thumb|right|A batik craftsman making [[batik]], Malaysian batik are usually patterned with floral motifs with light colouring.]]

'''Malaysian Batik''' is [[batik]] textile art of [[Malaysia]], especially on the east coast of Malaysia ([[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]]). The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik depicting humans or animals are rare because Islam norms forbid animal images as decoration. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception. The Malaysian batik is also famous for its geometrical designs, such as spirals. The method of Malaysian batik making is also quite different from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern is larger and simpler, it seldom or never uses ''canting'' to create intricate patterns and rely heavily on [[brush]] [[painting]] method to apply colours on fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik.

In line with the Malaysia concept, the Malaysian government is now endorsing Malaysian batik as a national dress to every level of the general population, by having local designers to create new batik designs which reflect the Malaysia idea.&lt;ref&gt;Malaysia Activities At State Level Throughout Next Year Bernama.com, accessed 4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Drawing Malaysian Batik.jpg|thumb|left|The drawing of Malaysian batik.]]
The origin of batik production in Malaysia it is known trade relations between the [[Melayu Kingdom]] in [[Jambi]] and Javanese coastal cities have thrived since the 13th century, the northern coastal batik producing areas of [[Java]] (Cirebon, Lasem, Tuban, and Madura) has influenced Jambi batik. This Jambi (Sumatran) batik, as well as Javanese batik, has influenced the batik craft in the [[Malay peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Traveller Indonesia, Vol 1, No 6, 2009, Jakarta, Indonesia, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Museum of Cultural History, Oslo|Museum of Cultural History]] of Oslo, it is known for certain that the Javanese influenced Malay batik-making technically as well as in the development of designs. At an early stage the Malaysians used wooden blocks in order to produce batik-like textiles. As late as the 1920s Javanese batik makers introduced the use of wax and copper blocks on Malaysia's east coast. The production of hand drawn batik in Malaysia is of recent date and is related to the Javanese batik tulis.

Commercial production started in the 1960s. This craft has developed its own particular aesthetic and design, peculiar to Malaysia. The new Malaysian batik is clearly different from the Javanese tradition of hand-painted batiks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/malaysia/engelsk/0_b_side1.html Malaysia - Batikktradisjoner i bevegelse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian batik can be found on the east coast of Malaysia such as Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang, while batik in Johor clearly shows Javanese and Sumatran influences since there are a large number of Javanese and Sumatran immigrants in southern Malaysia.

==Culture==
[[File:Malaysian Batik shop.jpg|thumb|right|A Batik shop in Malaysia selling a variety of Malaysian batik.]]
Batik was mentioned in the 17th century [[Malay Annals]]. The legend goes when [[Laksamana Hang Nadim]] was ordered by Sultan Mahmud to sail to India to get 140 pieces of ''serasah'' cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements explained to him, he made up his own. On his return unfortunately, his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dewan sastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYVkAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society: 1952|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZlhAAAAMAAJ|year=1953|publisher=The Branch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For men, Batik can be worn at dinner functions. Even the ladies wear the fabric as formal dress, combining batik with modern fashion.
The Malaysian government encourages civil servants to wear batik during the 1st and 15th day of the month. In Sabah, East Malaysia, teachers are encouraged to wear batik shirts or baju kurung to school on Thursdays - usually the school will have a particular patterned fabric which will be provided to every teacher to take to the tailor, so that their clothing matches.

'''Mary Anderson Grierson''' (27 September 1912 – 30 January 2012) was a Welsh-born Scottish botanical artist and illustrator. The youngest of three children to parents hailing from [[Dumfries]], she was encouraged by her mother to paint from an early age but preferred watercolour over oil. Grierson served in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] as a flight officer in a photographic reconnaissance unit and used the skills she learnt into use later in her life. She joined [[De Havilland]]'s public relations department after demobilisation and moved to [[Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd|Hunting Aerosurveys]] in 1947. Grierson was sent on a week course in pen and ink drawing in Suffolk ten years later and returned there for another ten years after finding the experience fulfilling.

In 1960 she became employed by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens]] in [[Kew]] as the [[Kew Gardens|Herbarium]]'s resident artist. Grierson later illustrated several books and had her work exhibited at various locations across the globe. She officially retired from Kew Gardens in 1972 to enable her to take up more private commissions. Grierson was the recipient of several medals, including the [[Victoria Medal of Honour]] by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in 1997.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Grierson was born on 27 September 1912 at Bodfaen, Craig Y Don Road, [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] in [[Caernarfonshire|Caernarvonshire]]. She was the youngest of three children of the laundry proprietor George Rae Grierson and his wife Anna, ''née'' Shortridge.&lt;ref name=OBNDentry&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=T. Prance|first=Ghillean|title=Grierson, Mary Anderson (1912–2012), botanical artist|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10481|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|date=January 2016|accessdate=5 November 2017|subscription=yes|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/104812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of Grierson's parents came from [[Dumfries]].&lt;ref name="independentobituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Desmond|first=Ray|title=Mary Grierson: Floral artist celebrated as one of the most distinguished in her field|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mary-grierson-floral-artist-celebrated-as-one-of-the-most-distinguished-in-her-field-7466777.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna was an oil painter and encouraged Grierson to take up the same career from an early age. Grierson preferred [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] over [[Oil painting|oil]] as she disliked the smell that comes from oils.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Mary Grierson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/9134740/Mary-Grierson.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=9 March 2012|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at the Bangor County School for Girls and later claimed at the school she did not enjoy all subjects apart from art and botany of which she excelled.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; Grierson chose not to attend university,&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; but was awarded the diploma of the [[Royal Drawing Society]] in London in 1930,&lt;ref name="walesonlineobituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Devine|first=Darren|title=Artist Mary Grierson inspired by Kew Gardens dies at 99|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/artist-mary-grierson-inspired-kew-2033511|work=WalesOnline|date=2 March 2012|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which confirmed her talent for the first time.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt;

She spent 1931 teaching English to a German family but returned home to study at [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]] and found employment as a confectioner in [[Llandudno]]. Her parents became ill and this induced Grierson to return home and care for them. Following the death of her father, she and her mother relocated to Dumfries where she managed a local restaurant.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; When World War II broke out,&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; Grierson served in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] as a flight officer in a photographic reconnaissance unit,&lt;ref name="walesonlineobituary" /&gt; and was based at [[Medmenham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; Her work saw her examine aerial photographs taken after British air raids in Germany to assess what damage had been done. Grierson's job required good vision and heavy concentration which she put to use later in life.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt;

===Career===
After demobilisation, Grierson joined [[De Havilland]]'s public relations department and was put in charge of photographs.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; In 1947, she moved to [[Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd|Hunting Aerosurveys]],&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; a company that produced maps from aerial photographs.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; Hunting Aerosurveys sent Grierson on a week's course in pen and ink drawing at the Flatford Mill Field Centre in [[Suffolk]] ten years later.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; She found the experience so fulfilling and returned to come under the mentorship of the painter John Nash for the next ten years.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walesonlineobituary" /&gt; Grierson applied for the vacancy of exhibitions officer at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens]] in [[Kew]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; She showed a portfolio of her work to her interviewer, Edgar Milne-Redhead, the deputy keeper of the [[Kew Gardens|Kew Herbarium]]. Milne-Redhead took one of her paintings and suggested to Grierson that she would be better off working as the Herbarium's resident artist.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt;

In 1966, she won her first gold medal for flower painting from the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] (RHS),&lt;ref name="womeninscience"&gt;{{cite book|last=M. C. Haines|first=Catharine|title=International Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary to 1950|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HftdjMNDvwIC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=Mary+Grierson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=chXBMlSYi-&amp;sig=KkjzEMZcBP4n1dnexShRTuThXyQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrqKPznqfXAhWF0xoKHYRcAs04FBDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20Grierson&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|location=[[Santa Barbara, California]]|page=119|isbn=978-1-57607-090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was invited to contribute designs for two postage stamps for the [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]] the next year: a primrose for the 9d and a violet for the 1s.9d.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; The first book Grierson illustrated came in 1967 which was [[Anthony Julian Huxley]]'s ''Mountain Flowers''.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; A further gold medal was awarded to her in 1969.&lt;ref name="womeninscience" /&gt; The Israeli Nature Authority commissioned her to paint the flora of the Negev and Sinai deserts in 1970. Grierson retired from Kew in 1972 and this enabled her to accept more private commissions. These works included a series of paintings of endangered plants for the archives of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and a major series of tulip drawings for the Van Tubergen Nurseries at [[Haarlem]] that were later purchased by Kew Gardens.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; In 1973,&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; she was invited to go to Hawaii to create a record of plants at the [[National Tropical Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt;

Grierson's paintings began to be exhibited in the same year at the International Exhibition of Botanical Art in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]]. In 1975, her paintings were put on display at the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation in [[Pittsburgh]], and she illustrated her second book that same year, ''Trees and Shrubs of the British Isles'' by William Bean. Grierson had her first of seven solo exhibitions at [[Spink &amp; Son]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; Starting from 1966, she had been teaching a course at Kew but ended this in 1983.&lt;ref name="independentobituary" /&gt; Grierson received the RHS's Gold Veitch Memorial Medal the following year.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt; Her work was further exhibited at the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden in 1984 and received an honorary [[Master of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Reading]] two years later. Grierson illustrated Brian Mathew's ''Hellebores'' in 1989 and earned a silver medal at the 1990 International Book Art Exhibition in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt;

Her sole exhibition at Kew Gardens came in 1993 and her last exhibition at Spink &amp; Son followed in the next year.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; Grierson's work in Hawaii appeared in Peter Shaw Green's  ''A Hawaiian florilegium: botanical portraits from paradise'' in 1996 and was awarded the [[Victoria Medal of Honour]] by the RHS in 1997.&lt;ref name="telegraphobituary" /&gt;

===Later years and death===

She lived in Lynde House Care Home in [[Twickenham]] in her later years and suffered from impaired vision that was caused by macular degeneration.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt; Grierson suffered a stroke on 26 December 2011,&lt;ref name="walesonlineobituary" /&gt; and died at Kingston Hospital from this on 30 January 2012. Her ashes were scattered on the mound of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew. Grierson never married.&lt;ref name="OBNDentry" /&gt;

In European [[heraldry]], the '''musimon''' (also known as the '''tityrus''' or '''tytron''') is used to symbolize one in authority who leads with strength.  Used in this sense, the musimon is a cross between a goat and a sheep; it has the feet and body of a goat, the head and beard of a ram, and two horns from each for a total of four—two curved and two straight.

Musimon can also refer to the real animal known as the [[European mouflon]] (''Ovis aries musimon''), a wild short-fleeced mountain sheep found on the islands of [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] and parts of mainland [[Europe]].

The third incarnation of [[United States|American]] toy company [[Hasbro]]'s '''[[My Little Pony]]''' [[Toy|toyline]] and [[media franchise]] began in 2003. The revamped line of dolls was targeted to a younger audience than the previous lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hasbro Revamps My Little Pony to Draw Younger Girls|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-105890012.html|accessdate=9 August 2014|work=Marketing Week|date=10 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular era is often unofficially referred to as "Generation Three" or "G3" by collectors. Until the generation's end in 2009, there have been at least two minor revamps. A series of direct-to-video animated films (mostly produced by [[SD Entertainment]]) accompanied the line-up.

"Generation Three" is set in the fictional town of Ponyville, which is centered on Celebration Castle. Only Earth Ponies were released from 2003 to 2005, but in 2005 and 2006 Pegasus Ponies and Unicorn Ponies were respectively introduced.

Until late 2005, packaging came with Pony Points that were later used for exclusive mail orders. Unlike the "G1" line, the Pony Points had to be mailed in to order; a customer could not pay a flat fee and add points to it to lower the price. Some of the ponies available with the Pony Points program were Dazzle Surprise, Sunshimmer and Love Wishes. Other merchandise included posters or a play mat to put buildings on. The points program ended on 31 January 2006.

While the line was simultaneously released in the U.S. and Europe, there are a few ponies unavailable in the U.S., such as Winter Snow and some small, fairy-like ponies called Breezies who first appeared in the animated feature ''The Princess Promenade''. One of the most uncommon ponies in this third line was released by mistake in 2004. A Pinkie Pie with the words "2003 Licensing Show" embedded into her symbol was used to promote the My Little Pony toy line at the 2003 Spring Licensing Show, and were intended to be released only at that show in a limited edition of 300. Due to a packaging error, a few were packaged as regular ponies and sold in stores. Other limited-edition ponies have been the Pony Project promotional ponies and Rosey Posey, who was given to attendees at a charity dinner held by Hasbro.

;Ponyville figurines
The Ponyville figurines are fully molded plastic and smaller than the main "G3" line. Although they have their own playsets and accessories, many of the characters are the same as their larger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-MLP-Fleece-Throw-Blanket-50-by-60-Officially-Licensed-Hasbro-/171667200962 | title=My Little Pony MLP Fleece Throw Blanket 50" by 60" Officially Licensed Hasbro | accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2008 and 2009 revamps
In 2008, the number of characters were reduced to seven: Pinkie Pie, Scootaloo, Toola-Roola, Rainbow Dash, Sweetie Belle, Cheerilee and Starsong; thus collectors referring the revamp as "Core 7". The following year in 2009, in a move referred by collectors as "Generation 3.5", Hasbro redesigned the characters to resemble Ponyville figurines.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

;Collector's edition after 2010
Recognizing the older fans of its line, Hasbro has released special collector ponies noticeably different from the regular "G3". While some had a general release as "Art Ponies", many are available through special events, such as the annual My Little Pony Collector's Convention and the [[San Diego Comic Con]]. These ponies are elaborately designed, such as the underwater-themed art pony which has fish and sea creatures printed all over its body, and come in matching display boxes. The 2011 SDCC pony is black and pink and has a [[kawaii]] skull instead of a "cutie mark". There is also a white pony available to customizers. Despite the redesign as "G3.5" and the advent of the "[[My Little Pony (2010 toyline)|G4]]" line, Hasbro continued the collector-themed "G3" ponies in their original poses.

==Media==
===Direct-to-video animated features===
Between 2003 and 2009, the ponies appeared in a series of [[direct-to-video]] shorts and feature-length films. Most of them were produced by [[SD Entertainment]]. These are set in yet another milieu, and feature the "G3" ponies:{{Citation needed |date=September 2014}}

'''PHaradise''' is a permanent light installation conceived by [[NatHalie Braun Barends]] at the Kunsthalle Mannheim, which was inaugurated on 9 March 2007, located at the dome and the adjacent roof tops of the Hermann Billing Bau at [[:de:Kunsthalle Mannheim|Kunsthalle Mannheim]].&lt;ref name="Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=100 Yahre Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007 | publisher=Kunsthalle Mannheim | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-89165-210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
It represents the act of breathing before falling asleep. The inspiration is represented by cold white light flowing vertically from below into the dome, and the exhalation by warm white colored lights air flowing horizontally towards the rooftops beside the cupola.&lt;ref name="NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life"&gt;{{cite book | title=NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life | publisher=Art Space | year=2007 | location=Berlin/New York/Santiago | isbn=978-3-941494-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to this evening light motion, the viewer has the experience of reliving the breath of the architectural structure, which is transformed into a light sculpture in the [[:de:Skulpturengarten der Kunsthalle Mannheim|Skulpturengarten]]. The "breathing" rhythm becomes slower as time pass by during the evening, symbolizing falling asleep.

PHaradise overlooks the Phoenix Room of [[HHole| HHole for Mannheim]], a multimedia installation at the rooftop of the Athene-Trakt of the Museum, where, among other things, natural light flows into the museum through its seven holes, meeting artificial light coming from below, thus creating a symbolic imaginary space between heaven and earth.

The architecture of the Kunsthalle becomes "alive", changing its own breathing rhythm similar to a living being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25395">'''Royal Designer for Industry''' is a distinction established by the British [[Royal Society of Arts]] (or RSA) in 1936, to encourage a high standard of industrial design and enhance the status of designers. It is awarded to people who have achieved "sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry". Those who are British citizens take the letters '''RDI''' after their names, while those who are not become Honorary RDIs (HonRDI). Everyone who holds the distinction is a Member of The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry (founded in 1938).

Their work is diverse, ranging from fashion to engineering, theatre to product design, graphics to environmental design.

New RDIs are elected annually and the Faculty continues to support initiatives to further excellence in design, including an annual Summer School for innovative young designers.

Only 200 designers may hold the distinction RDI at any time and it is regarded as the highest honour to be obtained in the [[United Kingdom]] in a diverse range of design disciplines including the field of [[industrial design]]. In addition, the RSA may confer HonRDI titles up to a maximum of half the number of people who currently hold the distinction RDI.

New RDIs are awarded Diplomas each year at the annual RDI Dinner. Every two years a new Master of the Faculty is elected by the past Masters, who include Dinah Casson, [[Mike Dempsey]], Sir [[Kenneth Grange]], Geoffrey Harcourt, Martin Hunt, Timothy O’Brien, [[Chris Wise]] and [[Malcolm Garrett]]. The current Master is Tristram Carfrae. 

==Current members==
The list identifies current RDIs, the date of their award and the category of design for which they were honoured.

"'''Selling out'''" is a common idiomatic pejorative expression for the compromising of a person's integrity, morality, [[wikt:authentic|authenticity]], or principles in exchange for personal gain, such as money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sellout|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sellout|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=21 February 2012|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of music or art, selling out is associated with attempts to tailor material to a [[mainstream]] or commercial audience. For example, a musician who alters his material to encompass a wider audience, and in turn generates greater revenue, may be labeled by fans who pre-date the change as a "sellout." A sellout also refers to someone who gives up, or disregards, hence the term 'sells' – someone or something – for some other thing or person. The term could also be used as 'sold out' depending on the context.

==In politics==
In political movements a "sellout" is a person or group claiming to adhere to one ideology, only to follow these claims up with actions contradicting them, such as a revolutionary group claiming to fight for a particular cause, but failing to continue this upon obtaining power.

An example of political "selling out" is a political party who has formed a coalition with another party it had historically opposed, such as the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' leader [[Nick Clegg]]'s coalition with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] in the United Kingdom, during which he reneged on his pledge to oppose any increase in student tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clegg sold out to get power, say voters|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/clegg-sold-out-to-get-power-say-voters-2083293.html|newspaper=Independent|first=Matt|last=Chorley|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/09/lib-dem-clegg-poll-principles|title=Clegg "sold out" for power|first=Sophie|last=Elmhirst|publisher=New Statesman|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music and entertainment==

===Music===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY UNSOURCED CONTENT! NOT LIKING AN ARTISTS LATEST SONG IS SUBJECTIVE, NOT INDICATIVE OF SELLING OUT! --&gt;
There are two distinct forms of "selling out" in terms of music. First, there is the use of the term "sell out" to refer to those who sign for major labels or to those who licence their music to companies for use in advertising&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/30/rocknroll-sellout|title=The great rock'n'roll sellout|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that contradicts their apparent values. Secondly, the expression can refer to those who sacrifice their musical integrity through a change in their musical sound, sometimes due to pressure from [[Music industry|major labels]]&lt;ref name=InDefense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2012/03/20/in-defense-of-sell-out-musicians/|title=In Defense of "Sell Out" Musicians|first=Lizzie|last=Azran|publisher=NYU Local|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in order to gain profit by making their music more appealing to a [[mainstream]] audience.

====Record labels and advertising====

Since the time of [[big band]] radio shows there has been an established relationship between musicians and commercialisation. There had been some signs of resistance to this model as early as the 1960s, when gospel group [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] refused to sign record deals to record secular music.&lt;ref&gt;http://ktep.org/post/clarence-fountain-leader-and-founding-member-blind-boys-alabama-dies-88&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the [[punk subculture]] in the 1970s that the notion that musicians should be completely independent of commercial influences began to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-20002543-27.html|title=Can bands sell out anymore?|first=Matt|last=Rosoff|publisher=Cnet|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partly manifested itself in the reluctance of bands to sign for major labels, as this would include taking part in activities that were seen as crass and overly commercial.&lt;ref name=Science&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7901003.stm|title=The science of selling out|first=Stephen|last=Dowling|publisher=BBC|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued into the 1980s, when bands were scorned by [[fanzines]] for signing with major labels as the mainstream success this would bring was symptomatic of the general decay in culture.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt; However, after a number of bands maintained the quality of their records after signing for a major label, by the end of the 1980s the focus on "selling out" shifted to advertising.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;

The attitude held by those who disliked the idea of "selling out" towards advertising was negative; comedian [[Bill Hicks]] claimed that any band who licensed their music for advertising was "off the artistic roll call forever",&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt;&lt;ref name=Science /&gt; and [[Neil Young]] mocked the fact that songs became associated with brands on his 1988 album ''[[This Note's for You]]''.&lt;ref name=GreatSellOut /&gt; However, although it was possible for fans to feel a sense of betrayal due to the relationship they developed with the song and artist, when artists did allow their music to be used for commercials others considered the advertised product to be more appealing.&lt;ref name=Science /&gt; As CD sales fell and record companies became unwilling or unable to afford the push new bands needed to become established, sponsorship of bands by major companies began to be seen as more acceptable, with even minor record labels devoting time and money towards marketing deals with well-known brands.&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;

By the 2010s the use of licensing of artists in commercials had become an accepted part of the music industry, and even those who would previously have been considered part of the 1970s resistance to "selling out" have been used in advertising products, such as former [[Sex Pistols]] frontman [[John Lydon]] advertising Country Life [[butter]] and [[Iggy Pop]] endorsing car insurance.&lt;ref name= Science /&gt; Consequently, it has been suggested&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Risk&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/11/risk_management_can_an_artist.html|title=Risk Management: Can An Artist Sell Out When There Are No Boundaries?|first=Carrie|last=Brownstein|publisher=NPR Music|date=11 November 2009|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the acceptance of music in advertising is generational, as younger listeners are comfortable with the relationship to the point of indifference&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;&lt;ref name=Risk /&gt; whilst those who have seen the industry evolve still reject it.&lt;ref name=Cnet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;

====Musical integrity====
[[File:Metallica 46.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Metallica playing live at Illinois in 2004.]]
Another definition of "selling out" refers to putting aside musical quality or original intentions in favor of commercial success,&lt;ref name=Anti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/lowdown/05/integrity.shtml|title=The Art of Selling Out: Compromising the Music|first=Trent|last=McMartin|publisher=antimusic|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a distinction is made for those who achieve success without changing their original sound.&lt;ref name=InDefense /&gt; The difference between the two is often subjective.&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; Whilst artists may change their musical direction for commercial reasons, such as pressure from major labels who require songs to appeal to mass markets,&lt;ref name=InDefense /&gt; a change in sound may also be part of a natural progression of creative maturity.&lt;ref name=Science /&gt;

An example of artists being accused of "selling out" is the band [[Metallica]], whose [[Metallica (album)|1991 eponymous album]] has been considered the turning point in the band's musical direction;&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/8b8c|title=Metallica (The Black Album) Review|first=Sid|last=Smith|publisher=BBC|date=18 April 2007|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the band members were called the "poster boys for musical un-integrity" after the band attempted to sue fans who were downloading their music through [[Napster]].&lt;ref name=Lulu &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/metallicas-lulu-problem-why-dont-they-just-sell-out-again/247295/|title=Metallica's 'Lulu' Problem: Why Don't They Just Sell Out Again?|first=Daniel|last=Snyder|publisher=The Atlantic|date=25 October 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, known as ''The Black Album'', saw critics&lt;ref name=Review /&gt; and [[Bob Rock]],&lt;ref name=Rock&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/metallicas-black-album-track-by-track-485030#!1|title=Metallica's Black Album track-by-track|first=Joe|last=Bosso|publisher=MusicRadar|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the album’s [[Record producer|producer]], acknowledged that there was a move away from the band's previous sound. Rock claimed that the change stemmed from the band’s desire to "make the leap to the big, big leagues",&lt;ref name=Rock /&gt; whilst some fans blamed Rock himself, going as far to eventually create an internet petition demanding the band cut their ties with him.&lt;ref name=Review /&gt; However, other fans did not consider the change in sound to be significant enough to be considered "selling out,"&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; and others accepted the change as part of a natural evolution of the band’s style.&lt;ref name=Geeks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2011/08/13/metallica-20th-anniversary-of-the-black-album/|title=Metallica: 20th Anniversary Of The ‘Black Album’|publisher=Geeks of Doom|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately ''The Black Album'' became the band’s most commercially successful release,&lt;ref name=Anti /&gt; going [[Music recording sales certification|16x platinum]].&lt;ref name=Lulu /&gt; The differing reaction by fans to the album demonstrates the difficulty in labelling an artist as a "sellout" objectively.

"[[Poseur]]" is a pejorative term, often used in the [[Punk subculture|punk]], [[Heavy metal subculture|heavy metal]], [[hip hop]], and [[goth subculture|goth]] [[subculture]]s, to describe a person who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group or for popularity among various other groups, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture.
 
While this perceived [[wikt:inauthentic|inauthenticity]] is viewed with scorn and contempt by members of the subculture, the definition of the term and to whom it should be applied is subjective. While the term is most associated with the 1970s- and 1980s-era punk and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] subculture, English use of the term originates in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=poseur Definition of poseur] at Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; A hardcore punk band that signed a lucrative contract with a major label would probably be labelled as poseurs.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Film and television===
In film and television "selling out" refers to compromising the content of produced media, primarily for financial reasons; for example, introducing [[product placement]].

Product placement, or embedded marketing, is the placement of brands or products in media in order to advertise,&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/concept-embedded-marketing-product-placement-20278.html|title=Concept of Embedded Marketing &amp; Product Placement|first=Neil|last=Kokemuller|publisher=Chron|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in television from almost the very beginning, but has increased with introduction of devices such as [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s which allow viewers, and therefore consumers, to fast-forward through adverts.&lt;ref name=tvg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/product-placement-tv-1042607.aspx|title=Product Placement: Is TV Selling Out?|first=Michael|last=Schneider|publisher=TVguide.com|date=31 January 2012|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the idea that product placement is a form of selling out is [[Eurocentrism|Anglocentric]],&lt;ref name=Pisfor&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/p-is-for-product-placement-as-tv-shows-sell-out-to-advertisers-2213863.html|title=P is for product placement as TV shows sell out to advertisers|first=Ian|last=Burrell|publisher=The Independent|date=14 February 2011|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as American television shows such as ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Apprentice]]'' recorded over 500 examples of brand integration in 2011 according to [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]].&lt;ref name=tvg /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pisfor /&gt;

===Comedy===
[[File:Jesus is coming.. Look Busy (George Carlin).jpg|thumb|right|200px|George Carlin has been accused of being a sellout for appearing in commercials for MCI, a company he had previously criticized.]]
[[Stand-up comedians]] occasionally face accusations of "selling out." Comedians who start out in comedy clubs might often use foul language and [[blue humor]] in their routines. A comic who alters his or her routine by "sugar-coating" his language and using less-offensive material to obtain mainstream success may be accused of "selling out."

[[George Carlin]] was accused of being a "sellout" for appearing in television commercials for [[MCI Inc.|MCI]]'s [[10-10-220]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingit.com/article/394|title=Gettingit.com: The Happy Pessimist|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530071427/http://www.gettingit.com/article/394|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowculture.com/adman/admn1129.html|title=The adMan - A Knee-Jerk to the Groin of American Advertising|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teevee.org/archive/1999/01/18/index.html|title=1-800-SELL-OUT|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090058/http://www.teevee.org/archive/1999/01/18/index.html|archivedate=4 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin had previously spoken of his dislike for MCI's commercials in his 1996 album ''[[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|Back in Town]]''. In his 1999 album ''[[You Are All Diseased]]'', which contains rants against advertising and business, Carlin admits the dichotomy but makes no attempt to explain himself, stating, "You're just gonna have to figure that shit out on your own." In interviews, Carlin revealed he appeared in the advertisements to help pay off a large tax debt to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bankrate.com/csites/news/investing/20010316a.asp|title=Carlin's got his act together, on stage and off|publisher=[[Bankrate.com]]|author=Getlen, Larry|date=2001-03-16|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian/actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] has described herself as a "sellout" based on her participation with the TV show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' playing [[Janis Gold]]. Garofalo initially turned down the role because of the way the show depicted torture scenes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/24/24-its-a-chloejanis-rivalryor-26069.aspx|title=24: It's A Chloe-Janis Rivalry--Or Not, As It Seems|date=February 2, 2009|publisher=Buddy TV|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however changed her mind later on, saying in an interview, “Being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance [on torture].”&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/arts/television/16twen.html?_r=1|title=Deep Inside the Grim ‘24,’ Two Comics’ Inside Joke|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=February 15, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garofalo admitted to "selling out" for losing weight in order to gain more acting work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janeane Garofalo on Botox, Spanx, and the Troubles of Finding Work As a 45-Year-Old Former Slacker Icon&amp;#124;|work=Vulture|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|author=Yuan, Jada|date=2010-02-19|accessdate=2012-11-23|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/02/janeane_garofalo_on_botox_span.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
An artist may also be accused of "selling out" after changes in artistic direction.  This conclusion is often due to the perception that the reason for the artist changing artistic style or direction was simply potential material gain. This ignores other causes of artistic [[Personal development|development]], which may lead an artist in new directions from those that attracted their original fans.  Artists' improvements in musical skill or change in taste may also account for the change.

Other times, artists (including those with politically oriented messages) resent the term on the grounds that the perceived desire for material gain is simply a result of the band seeking to expand its message. To such artists, ''not'' going mainstream or signing to a bigger label to avoid "selling out" prevents them from addressing a wider audience, regardless of whether or not there is any real artistic change, and arbitrarily hampers the artists' course of mainstream success. Such an accusation, then, assumes that mainstream success must be against the artists' original intentions. For example, when questioned about signing to a major label, [[Rage Against the Machine]] answered "We're not interested in preaching to just the converted. It's great to play abandoned squats run by anarchists, but it's also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message, people from [[Granada Hills, Los Angeles|Granada Hills]] to [[Stuttgart]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratm.de/faq/ragefaq.html#1_9|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526032423/http://www.ratm.de/faq/ragefaq.html#1_9|title=Rage Against The Machine Online : F.A.Q.|author=RinO|archivedate=26 May 2006|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when confronted with the accusation of "selling out" in 2001, [[Mike Dirnt]] of [[Green Day]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If there's a formula to selling out, I think every band in the world would be doing it," he said. "The fact that you write good songs and you sell too many of them, if everybody in the world knew how to do that they'd do it. It's not something we chose to do...The fact was we got to a point that we were so big that tons of people were showing up at punk-rock clubs, and some clubs were even getting shut down because too many were showing up. We had to make a decision: either break up or remove ourselves from that element. And I'll be damned if I was going to flip fucking burgers. I do what I do best. Selling out is compromising your musical intention and I don't even know how to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/2001/jul/20/512106831.html?%22green+day%22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031510/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/2001/jul/20/512106831.html?%22green+day%22 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41044">'''Serbian art''' refers to the [[visual arts]] of the [[Serbs]] and their nation-state [[Serbia]]. The medieval heritage includes [[Byzantine art]], preserved in architecture, frescos and icons of the many Serbian Orthodox monasteries. In the Early modern period, Serbian visual arts began to be influenced by Western art, culminating in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the late 18th century. The beginning of modern Serbian art is placed in the 19th century.

==Prehistory==
Currently, Europe's oldest known civilization was discovered in [[Serbia]], namely [[Lepinski Vir]] and [[Vinča culture]]. In Serbia, [[Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)]] (Serbian: Археолошка налазишта/Arheološka nalazišta) are many and have the highest level of state protection under the Law on Cultural Heritage. See: [[Prehistoric sites in Serbia]] and [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe]] for artifacts and sculpture found at the archeological sites of Lepinski Vir. Here are some images of Serbian prehistory art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.ca/search?q=serbian+prehistory+art&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA791CA791&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTwIzyyO_dAhWpxYMKHXk4BJkQsAR6BAgCEAE&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman period==
Geographically Serbia was always part of the [[Roman Empire]] whether it was ruled from [[Rome]] or from [[Byzantium]]. The Roman ruins are found throughout the [[Balkan Peninsula]].

==Medieval Serbian art==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
Church architecture developed under the patronage of the medieval Serbian state. The most distinctive piece of medieval Serbian architecture was the [[Studenica monastery]] founded by [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of medieval Serbia ca. 1190. This monastery also featured significant works of art including its Byzantine style [[fresco]] paintings. Its church also features extensive sculptures based on Psalms and the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]]. UNESCO added this monastery to its list of World Cultural Heritage sites in 1986. It was the model for other monasteries at [[Mileševa monastery|Mileševa]], [[Sopoćani]] and the [[Visoki Dečani]]. The influence of Byzantine art became more influential after the capture of [[Constantinople]] in 1204 in the [[Fourth Crusade]] when many Greek artists fled to Serbia. Their influence can be seen at the Church of the Ascension at [[Mileševa]] as well as in the wall paintings at the Church of the Holy Apostles at [[Peć]] and at the Sopoćani Monastery. Icons also formed a significant part of church art. The influence of Byzantine architecture reached its [[Serbian Orthodox Church#Serbo-Byzantine Style|peak]] after 1300 including the rebuilding of the [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] (ca. 1306–1307) and [[St. George]] at [[Staro Nagoričane]] as well as the [[Gračanica monastery]]. Church decorative paintings and religious arts and crafts also developed further in the period. The most noteworthy painters at the time were [[Michael Astrapas and Eutychios]] (fl. 1294-1317) and before them, '''Deacon Jovan''' and '''Rufin'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=223&lt;/ref&gt;

Icon of the Holy Virgin [[Pelagonitissa]], dating from 1421, is considered one of the last outstanding achievements of icon painting, a representation of the then still-living Byzantine iconography. Its author '''Makarije Zograf''' worked on the icon in the Church of Transfiguration in the monastery of the village [[Zrze]], near [[Prilep]], and many other Serbian monasteries during the fifteenth century. Makarije Zograf and his brother Metropolitan '''Jovan Zograf''' cared for the monastery endowment until it was transferred to Constantine, the village head (''kmet'').&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=mkYWAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=makarije+zograf&amp;dq=makarije+zograf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj57Lie0pPeAhUJwYMKHVtCC60Q6AEIXzAI&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Visoki Dečani monastery]] in [[Metohija]] was built between 1330 and 1350. Unlike other Serbian monasteries of the period, it was built with [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] features by master-builders under the monk Vitus of Kotor. Its frescoes feature 1000 portraits portraying all of the major themes of the New Testament. The cathedral features [[iconostasis]], [[Hegumen|hegumen's]] throne and carved royal sarcophagus. In 2004, UNESCO listed the Dečani Monastery on the World Heritage List.

There was a further spate of church building as the Serbian state contracted to the Morava basin in the late 14th century. Prince [[Stefan Lazarević]] was a poet and patron of the arts who founded the church at [[Manasija monastery|Resava]] at [[Morava rivers, Serbia|Morava]] with the wall paintings having a theme of parables of Christ with the people portrayed wearing feudal Serbian costumes.

Manuscripts were another significant feature of Serbian medieval art. ''Miroslav's Gospel'' features lavish calligraphy and miniatures and is a significant artwork as well as a notable work of literature. The [[Chludov Psalter]] dating from the 14th century is beautifully decorated and was probably owned by a high-ranking noble. Serbian princes were well known in the 15th century for supporting manuscripts employing [[scribe]]s and artists to create manuscripts besides icons and frescoes. [[Lovro Dobričević]] (1420-1478) of [[Kotor]] was a Venetian painter of Serbian origin, though Roman Catholic by confession, who first started to paint in the Serbian Orthodox [[Savina Monastery, Montenegro|Savina Monastery]] in Zeta and [[Serbian Despotate]] (now [[Montenegro]]) in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visit-montenegro.com/montenegro/montenegro-museum-in-the-open/monastery-savina/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 19th century, Serbian medieval art was used as inspiration for notable architect [[Andrey Damyanov]] who, between 1835 and 1878, along the [[Vardar]] and [[Morava Valley]]s and Bosnia, built around 40 churches and other buildings. &lt;ref name="balkanologie"&gt;[http://journals.openedition.org/balkanologie/1932?file=1 Journal Balkanologie] by Bernard Lory, December 2002, retrieved 3-4-2018 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting to the social demand of its Serbian sponsors, Damyanov combined simultaneously traditional elements of the 15th century Morava school with Occidental baroque elements found North of Sava river.&lt;ref name="balkanologie"/&gt;

Thanks are due to field scientist and academic [[Gabriel Millet]] who was the first to bring Serbian art to the attention of the West in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/3641241/Contribution_de_Gabriel_Millet_%C3%A0_l%C3%A9tude_de_lart_Serbe&lt;/ref&gt;The other is Serbian-American scientist [[Michael Pupin]], who gathered an international team of scholars and public figures to support the preservation of architectural heritage during and after the [[Great War]]. In 1918, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]], in Pupin's "Serbian Orthodox Church" on the medieval Serbian churches, refuted the notion that Serbian art was nothing more than a branch of [[Byzantine art]] and showed that Serbian art had an original character of its own.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- INSERT THESE IN THE TABLE [http://www.sv-luka.org/ikone/sericins.htm]https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mihajlo-Pupin-South-Slavs-Monuments-vol-I-Serbian-Orthodox-Church-New-York-and_fig1_282186492&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fresco paintings===

Orthodox fresco painting represents the peak of Serbian medieval art. Its birth went in line with the creation and development of medieval Serbian state, but unlike Serbian state it didn't cease to exist during the Ottoman occupation. While Serbian architecture has seen mixed influences of both [[Byzantine]] and [[Medieval Italy|medieval Italian states]], fresco and icon painting remained deeply rooted in solely eastern byzantine tradition. 
 
Frescos were being painted under the patronage of Serbian rulers, as the highest form of religious decorative form. Following the political expansion and military growth, the 13th and 14th century are marked as the period when the biggest amount of newly built or existing sanctuaries have been decorated, mostly by unknown artists. Studenica monastery has been built in 1196 under the patronage of [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of [[Nemanjić dynasty]], and ever since it enjoyed the care of Stefan's descendants as the ''archi-model''. Its most representative fresco, ''The Crucifixion'', was made twelve years later, in 1208, on the blue background brought into contrast with golden-yellow of Christ's bare crucified body. In the second half of 14th century an unknown artist painted monumental ''The Dormition of the Virgin'' in Sopoćani monastery, which remained the supreme achievement of byzantine painting tradition. 
 
However, the most famous Serbian medieval fresco is the ''Myrrhbearers'' (or the "White Angel")&lt;ref name="Art in the middle ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/vdjuric-medieval_art.html |title=Art in the middle ages |publisher=rastko.rs |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Mileševa monastery|Mileševa]] monastery, painted in 1235, on the southern wall of the church. It depicts [[Archangel Gabriel]] sitting on Christ's grave. The identity of its author is unknown. In the 16th century, the ''White Angel'' was over-painted with another fresco, and so was hidden until the 20th century when the fresco was restored.&lt;ref name="novosti-mileseva"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/srbija.73.html:391503-Manastir-Mileseva---crkva-Belog-andjela | title=Manastir Mileševa - crkva Belog anđela | publisher=[[Večernje novosti]] | date=5 August 2012 | accessdate=19 December 2014 |trans-title=Mileševa Monastery - the Church if the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fresco was sent as a message in the first [[Satellite television|satellite broadcast]] signal from [[Europe]] to [[United States|America]] after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], as a [[symbol]] of [[peace]] and [[civilization]].&lt;ref name="prijepolje"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.turizamprijepolje.org.rs/index.php/n-s-ir-il-sh-v-i-b-li-nd | title=Манастир Милешева и Бели Анђео | publisher=Tourist Organisation of Preijepolje | accessdate=19 December 2014 |trans-title=Mileševa Monastery and the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the same signal, containing the White Angel, was transmitted to space in an attempt to communicate with [[extraterrestrial life]] forms.&lt;ref name="52vikenda"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.srbija.travel/download/brosure/52_vikenda_smanjen.pdf | title=52 vikenda u Srbiji | publisher=Tourist Organisation of Serbia | author=Mihaljčić, Milena | year=2013 | location=Belgrade | pages=30 | isbn=978-86-6005-278-2 |trans-title=52 Weekends in Serbia | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/272313/Filaret-zinuo-na-Belog-andela | title=Filaret zinuo na Belog anđela | publisher=Vesti Online | date=25 November 2012 | accessdate=19 December 2014 | author=Lončar, R. |trans-title=Filaret Gasps at the White Angel | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another notable mention is the fresco of Serbian queen [[Simonida]], in [[Gračanica monastery]], today located on the disputed territory of [[Kosovo]]. Born as Simonis Palaiologina, she was a daughter of the Byzantine Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] (r. 1282–1328) and [[Irene of Montferrat]], and the fourth wife of Serbian king [[Stefan Milutin]] (r. 1282–1321). Two celebrated Serbian poems were inspired by the beauty of the fresco. Two dark stains on the places where queen's eyes were supposed to be have created a common belief that her eyes were being ''carved out'' by [[Albanian people|Albanian]]s, hence the well-known strophe by [[Milan Rakić]]:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Your eyes were gouged out, oh beautiful image, 
On a pilaster at approach of night, 
Knowing that no one would witness the pillage,
An Albanian’s knife robbed you of your sight.&lt;ref&gt;''Simonida'', Kosara Gavrilović translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
However, between 1971 and 1976, during the conservation works in the monastery, it was discovered that for centuries the queen's eyes were lying under what actually was (unsuccessfully intentionally damaged) grey layer. Once the patches were removed, ''Simonida'' was shown to media with light-blue eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/terazije/ko_je_simonidi_iskopao_oci.14.html?news_id=199228 | title=Ko je Simonidi iskopao oci | publisher=Danas | accessdate=June 9, 2017 | language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th centuries==
The Ottoman conquest of Serbia during the 15th century is traditionally said to have had a negative impact of the visual arts. The Serbs became part of the [[Rum Millet]] (Christian community), and were regarded a lower class ([[rayah]]). The Serbian nobility was not integrated into the Ottoman state system. The church was abolished in long periods by the Ottoman government. As the nobility and church were the main sources of patronage for architects and artists, the Early Modern period is considered an artistically less productive period in Serbian art. Despite the general trend, remarkable monuments were built. There was some resumption of artistic endeavour after the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate in 1557. '''Zograf Longin''' (1530-1600) and [[Georgije Mitrofanović]] were the leading painters of the late 16th and early 17th century. Mitrofanović's work on the church at the [[Morača Monastery]] is considered one of his best. Traditional Serbian art was beginning to show some Baroque influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of [[Nikola Nešković]], [[Teodor Kračun]] and [[Jakov Orfelin]]. Among the icon painters working in the Byzantine tradition in Old Slavonia were '''Nikola Klisur''' (mid-17th century)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=JEpLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=nikola+klisur&amp;dq=nikola+klisur&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTibCj4ZPeAhUH7YMKHa2ZAUEQ6AEIPTAD&lt;/ref&gt;and '''Ostoja Mrkojević''' (late 17th century).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=vI4MAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=ostoja+mrkojevic&amp;dq=ostoja+mrkojevic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn0fW245PeAhUlzIMKHTp6D8AQ6AEIKzAA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baroque===
Painting of the Early Baroque did not create a homogeneous group of painters. It developed under the Russian-Ukrainian and Southern Balkans basis and the influences that had slowly arrived from Western European art centers. The first generation of Baroque painters nourished on the learnings of the Russian painter Jov Vasilievich and Vasilije Romanovich, then the trainee of the Kiev Academy of painting,[[Dimitrije Bačević]], Vasilije Ostojić, Joakim Marković, Jovan Popović, Amvrosije Janković, Dimitrije Popović, Teodor Stefanov Gologlavac, and [[Stefan Tenecki]]. The work of Balkan icon painters in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] throughout the 18th century. Teodor Simonov (born in Moschopolis) worked for the Serbian Orthodox [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] during the eight decade of the 18th century. Simonov painted the walls of the church monastery in Stolni Beograd, today's [[Székesfehérvár]] in Hungary. The works of [[Jovan Četirević Grabovan]] who completed part of his education in [[Imperial Russia]], and returned to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] to settle in [[Osijek]] in [[Slavonia]] where he developed a rich icon-painting activity. The works of others who also came originally from southern parts of the Balkans (once known as [[Old Serbia]]) such as [[Hristofor Žefarović]] and [[Janko Halkozović]], created in the spirit of the Levant Baroque, relying on the transferred experience of Italian Renaissance art and the Byzantine tradition, which resulted in a distinctive model of Baroque icons. The originator of the more direct rotation on Central European models was Joakim Marković, whose work is linked to the first portraits and [[Still life]]s, and in church painting of historical compositions and heraldic depictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО РАНОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-ranog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High Baroque art was reflected on the firmer cultural orientation towards Vienna, as well as church and school reforms. The changes are visible in the works of [[Teodor Kračun]] who in his work represents a significant step towards understanding the actual Central European art. The retrospective Orthodox heritage confronted the emphasized emotionality and the movement as a fundamental element of artistic expression. Scenes are placed in the real world, Christ and Mary are depicted according to the rules of the secular ruler iconography and rely on graphic templates from popular illustrated Bibles. The group of representatives of the High Baroque include [[Mojsej Subotić]], [[Grigorije Davidović Opšić]], [[Grigorije Jezdimirović]] and [[Lazar Serdanović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО ВИСОКОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-visokog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence and development of Late Baroque painting had been determined by the cultural and political changes of the time of Joseph II. Conceptual changes in the era of enlightened and learned man - the Enlightenment - marked the last decade of the 18th century. The learned artist, traveling the European capitals of Art, accepts and implements the ideas of the Enlightenment reforms. Among the artists who took Serbian painting of Central European Late Baroque formulation, [[Jakov Orfelin]] and [[Teodor Ilić Češljar]] stand out. They are joined by woodcarvers [[Aksentije Marković]] and [[Marko Vujatović]]. Neoclassicism as the style of the new era, based on the ideas of the Enlightenment, would not jeopardize the ruling Late Baroque conception in the first decades of the next century. Such a sequence is identified in the works of painters [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Jovan Isajlović Stari]], [[Georgije Mišković]] and Mihajlo Živković.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СЛИКАРСТВО КАСНОГ БАРОКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XVIII ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/slikarstvo-kasnog-baroka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the important painters were [[Nikola Nešković]], [[Teodor Kračun]], [[Teodor Ilić Češljar]], [[Pavel Đurković]], [[Dimitrije Bačević]], [[Georgije Bakalović]], [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Jovan Četirević Grabovan]], [[Jovan Pačić]], and others.

==19th century drawing and painting==

===Religious art===
Printed magazines with engravings became a popular method of communicating through art, of both religious and irreligious themes. The printing of engravings of figures of prominent Serbian rulers fitted in the ideas of continuity of Serbian statehood. Monasteries on Fruška Gora and other ones in the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] issued engraved magazines in which protector saints with monasteries were represented. Graphical arts of the 18th century were the first class documents of appearance and condition of monastery buildings before photographs. In the last decades of the 18th century, the written word suppressed visual arts as the main communication activity in religious magazines, with graphical arts becoming more and more used in illustrated books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=РЕЛИГИОЗНО СЛИКАРСТВО XIX ВЕКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/religiozno-slikarstvo-19-veka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphical arts===
In the first decades of the 19th century a new graphic technique of lithography experience a real boom in the countries of Western Europe. Serbian artists gradually introduced it to the history of national arts in the 19th century. In contrast to modest attempts of scarce individuals, the lithography becomes an important branch of Serbian art only with the emergence of [[Anastas Jovanović]]. Independent printed magazines on religious themes which prevailed in the 18th century became scarcer in the 19th century, only accounting for a part of the graphic production. As a medium very suitable for spreading political ideas, lithography dominates with national-historical themes. Sketch portraits and templates for lithography were dealt by many Serbian painters: [[Jovan Isajlović Mlađi]], [[Jovan Popović (artist)|Jovan Popović]], [[Uroš Knežević]], [[Pavle Simić]], [[Pavle Čortanović]], [[Steva Todorović]], [[Đorđe Krstić]], while being technically performed in Vienna and Pest by lithographers [[Gabriel Decker]] (1821-1855), [[Friedrich Karl Leiboldt]], [[Josef Bauer (lithographer)|Josef Bauer]] (1820-1905), [[Vincent Katzler]] (1823-1882) and others. At the end of the 19th century popular oleographs appear, as the first reproduction of popular works, most often with motifs from folk life and depictions of historical figures and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ГРАФИКА XIX ВЕКА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/grafika-19-veka.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassicism===
{{further|Neoclassicism}}
Under the influence of the ides of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Rationalism]], at the end of the 18th and beginning of 19th century, Serbian art came to leave baroque pictorial poetics and acceptance of the aesthetic ideals of the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]], characterized by [[eclecticism]] of different stylistic expressions, of the late baroque to neo-classical. In addition to religious painting, which was still dominant, the portrait gains increasing importance. Portraits complete the picture of the new society created in that time and point to the idea of permanent memory of individuals within the family or the wider community. The gallery of characters, in addition to church prelates and priests, senior officers, a significant places is taken by eminent members of civil society from the first decades of the 19th century: lawyers, university professors, writers, wealthy merchants, and their wives, the status shown by marked clothing and jewelry. Stylistic features of paintings of that era: a balanced composition, precise modeling, rigorous academic drawing, color of reduced register, expressed in the works of [[Stefan Gavrilović]], [[Arsa Teodorović]] and [[Pavel Đurković]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=НЕОКЛАСИЦИЗАМ - АРСЕНИЈЕ ТЕОДОРОВИЋ И ПАВЕЛ ЂУРКОВИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/neoklasicizam-arsenije-teodorovic-i-pavel-djurkovic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biedermeier===
{{further|Biedermeier}}
In the 1830s the Serbian art scene is added by a generation of painters who transferred Bidermeier and [[Nazarene movement|Nazarene art]] programs from Central Europe. As a stylistic expression that deeply permeated the Serbian art at that time, Biedermeir was most suitable for the wide layers of citizens that concerned about themselves, their family and home. In the changed social circumstance in which the middle class had become the bearer of social changes, the family becomes the basic unit of modern society and the main scene of private life. Awareness of family is confirmed and visualized in family portraits, in group or of some of its members. Family portraits depict the social status of the family, but at the same time they have a private character and are part of narrow family cult. In addition to portraits, Biedermeir painting is also focused on the [[Genre art]] and [[Still life]]. The most important representatives of the Biedermeier expression in Serbian painting are [[Konstantin Danil]], [[Katarina Ivanović]], [[Dimitrije Avramović]] and [[Nikola Aleksić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=БИДЕРМАЈЕР - КОНСТАНТИН ДАНИЛ И НИКОЛА АЛЕКСИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/bidermajer-konstantin-danil-i-nikola-aleksic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/en/biedermeier.html#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
{{further|Romanticism}}
In the mid-19th century Serbian artistic creativity was marked with reception of content and design of civil works (Biedermaier), but at the same time the development of a program of historicism. For the penetration of Romanticist conceptions, education and stays of Serbian painters in Vienna and Munich, as well as trips to Italy, were crucial. Social and political conditions contributed to the Romantic expression in Serbian art accomplishing its highest achievements in the late 1860s and beginning of 1870s. In stylistic and thematic view, Romanticism brought notable innovations: greater freedom of strokes and composition, warm colors complemented by the play of light and shadow. Most Serbian artists of that period reflected national-historical content in painting compositions, however, client needs kept iconography and portrait painting popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=EПОХА РОМАНТИЗМА|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/epoha-romantizma.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of notable Romanticist painters include [[Katarina Ivanović]] (1811–1882), [[Đura Jakšić]] (1832–1878), [[Pavle Simić]] (1818–1876), [[Novak Radonić]] (1826–1890) and [[Steva Todorović]] (1832–1925).

===Historicism===
{{further|Historicism (art)}}
In accordance with the general ideas of Historicism, as the dominant characteristics of the culture of the 19th century in European context, the top role in the process of constituting national identity was held by events and figures from national history. They represented a representative of the golden age of the nation, which in Serbian culture of the 19th century was equated with the period of the rule of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]]. Idealization of a glorious past, regardless of whether it was based on real facts or myth, it was the main tool in the constitution and the homogenization of the nation. This idealized past was directly at the service of the glorification of the present, which emphasized the idea of rebuilding the former Serbian glory. These ideas are directly reflected in the visual art of the epoch - historical compositions, but also patriotic scenes that illustrate the events of the recent past are gaining more and more importance. They praise the nation through the idealization of events and personalities, becoming at the same time engaged means of communication with the aim to awaken national and patriotic feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ИСТОРИЗАМ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/istorizam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of notable Historicist painters include [[Đura Jakšić]] (1832–1878) and [[Pavle Simić]] (1818–1876).

===Academicism===
{{further|Academic art}}
In the last decades of the 19th century, Serbian painters began to stay at Munich as a center of education and its Academy of Fine Arts, which compared to the Viennese, was more [[avant garde]] and progressive. However, the larger number of them remained faithful to the Vienna Academy where the education system was still based on the constitutional education, traditional practices and technical skills. The highest level of Academicism in Serbian painting of the late 19th century are portraits of [[Paja Jovanović]] (1859–1957) and [[Uroš Predić]] (1857–1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=АКАДЕМИЗАМ - ПАЈА ЈОВАНОВИЋ И УРОШ ПРЕДИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/akademizam-paja-jovanovic-i-uros-predic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
{{further|Orientalism}}
Orientalism indicates interest in Oriental scenes in the visual arts of the 19th century. Napoleon's campaign in Egypt, the conquest of Algeria, as well as travel books and other literary descriptions encouraged the enthusiasm and imagination of artists. Islamic countries of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa had become the preferred travel destination for many artists. Scenes of squares, bazaars, harem and various folklore events entered European painting. Orientalism rarely had a purely documentary character and more often depicted the enthusiasm of Europeans for beauty, vividness and allure of the unknown and exotic world. The wild nature and unusual customs, combined with the gorgeous colors and light, had become a great inspiration to European artists. During a long period of education, [[Paja Jovanović]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebritic.com/?p=660281&lt;/ref&gt;along with classes at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, attended the School of historical painting of [[Leopold Müller (painter)]], famous for its oriental motifs. There is no doubt that Miller's crucial lessons determined his painting preference. Noting the increased interest of Europe to the events in the Balkans, he traveled during the holidays to Albania, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia gathering sketches and studies of the life of the Balkan peoples. Precisely these themes brought Paja Jovanović worldwide fame and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=ОРИЈЕНТАЛИЗАМ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/orijentalizam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism===
{{further|Realism (art movement)}}
In the last decades of the 19th century, with Serbian painters attending the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Realism entered the Serbian art scene. In stylistic view, Realists, succeeding the Romantic agitation, brought calm and order in painting. In Serbian painting Realism never took root in the true sense, in the symbiosis of thematics and techniques. Serbian painters, taught artistically to express in a new form, return to be faced with the difficult solvable problems of adapting the conditions of an economically, socially and culturally underdeveloped environment, which was unwilling to accept new social themes which European Realism advocated. Serbian painters therefore continue to paint portraits, religious and historical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=РЕАЛИЗАМ - ЂОРЂЕ КРСТИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/realizam-djordje-krstic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
{{further|Symbolism (arts)}}
Symbolism in European painting appeared at the end of the 19th century as a reaction to the beautified world of academic realism and commercialization of art. As a formulated artistic phenomenon on a European scale it was also present at the Munich art scene, where some Serbian painters were formed. Representatives of Symbolism proclaimed turning of indirect, associative and suggestive mode of expression. They used mythological symbols, dreams and imagination as a visual language of the soul. In addition to depicting themselves, they painted mythological, religious and allegorical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Galerija Matice srpske|title=СИМБОЛИЗАМ - СТЕВАН АЛЕКСИЋ|work=СТАЛНА ПОСТАВКА XIX ВЕКА|year=2015|url=http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/simbolizam-stevan-aleksic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern visual arts==
[[Cyril Kutlík]] set up the first school of art in Serbia in 1895. Many of his students went to study in Western Europe, especially France and Germany and brought back avant-garde styles. [[Nadežda Petrović]] was influenced by [[Fauvism]] while [[Sava Šumanović]] worked in [[Cubism]].

After World War I, the [[Belgrade School of Painting]] developed in the [[Belgrade|capital]] with some members such as [[Milan Konjović]] working in a Fauvist manner, while others such as [[Marko Čelebonović]] working in a style called ''Intimisme'' based on the use of colours.

Some artists chose to emigrate: thus [[Yovan Radenkovitch]] (1901–1979) left Belgrade for Paris in the 1930s, befriending [[Matisse]] and [[Vlaminck]] and adopting a style greatly inspired by [[Fauvism]], before eventually leaving Europe to show his work in New York, in 1941; meeting with considerable acclaim, he decided, in the 1950s, to settle in the USA – near [[Waterbury]], [[Connecticut]], where several of his paintings are still kept today, in [[Mattatuck Museum]].

[[Socrealism]] was the dominant school after World War II with the rise to power of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. However, that period did not last long &amp;ndash; during the 1960s, Serbian artists started to break free from the constraints of the Communists led by figures such as [[Petar Lubarda]] and [[Milo Milunović]]. The [[Mediala group]] featuring [[Vladimir Veličković]] was formed in the 1970s to promote [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] figurative painting. Serbian art was split between those basing their works on the traditions of Serbian work such as frescoes and iconography and those exploring international styles.

The first part of 21st century, with young artists like [[Jovanka Sanijenovic]] or [[Simonida Rajčević]], marks a predominance of a figurative art linked to realism – a realism «where everything is real and nothing is real – considering contemporary time as needing a return to what is real and concrete, and at the same time social and existential.&lt;ref&gt;Gordana Biba Marković, ''[http://www.domkulturecacak.org/node/474 XV Prolećni Anale]''. Dom kulture Čačak, 20 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied art and design==
[[File:Pirot kilim serbian rug.png|thumb|100px|Pirot Kilim with the ornament Rašićeva ploča]]
Applied art and design through the centuries have evolved in Serbia through crafts. The wealth of forms, the variety of materials with powerful color schemes and ornamentation folk art represented a strong stimulus for the affirmation of applied art, which in the second half of the 19th century, gets its first artists in Serbia. End of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century were marked by the work of individual personalities, each of them made a significant contribution to the development and the history of applied art in Serbia. These were people of different professions and some of them include: [[Mihailo Valtrović]], [[Vladislav Titelbah]], [[Dragiša Milutinović]], [[Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak]].

==Performance art==
[[File:artistIsPresent.jpg|thumb|right|Marina Abramović performed "The Artist Is Present" at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in March 2010.]]
[[Maga Magazinović]], philosopher and choreographer, was one of the most important figures of contemporary physical practice in Serbia before the Second World War. The emancipation of the body in her work was realized through the application of gymnastics, dance and physical education. During the '60s and '70s history of the contemporary dance developed in the framework of [[performance art]], [[body art]] and [[happening]]s. On the status of the body can meditate in the works of [[Marina Abramović]] and [[Katalin Ladik]]. The performance art of the eighties was marked by a specific attitude toward ideology. This attitude is manifested in the work within the context of using utopian socialist iconography. During the '90s performance art was focused on the fight against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sveske.ba/en/content/drugost-druge-scene-u-srbiji Drugost druge scene u Srbiji]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marina Abramović]] is the most prominent Serbian performance artist.  Active for over three decades, she has been described as the "grandmother of performance art." She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of her observers. Her art focuses on the theme of “confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body,” while relying on the extent of these discomforts based on the actions of her audience members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demaria|first1=Cristina|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovic|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|date=August 2004|volume=11|issue=3|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another performance artists include [[Gabrijel Savić Ra]], [[Nela Antonović]], [[Lidija Antonović]], [[Predrag Radovančević]], etc.

Panel at right is ''Death and the Miser''. At bottom "The Wayfarer" which  would have been on the outside of the triptych.]]

'''''Ship of Fools''''' (painted c. 1490–1500) is a painting by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], now on display in the Musée du [[Louvre]], Paris.  The surviving painting is a fragment of a [[triptych]] that was cut into several parts. ''The Ship of Fools'' was painted on one of the wings of the altarpiece, and is about two thirds of its original length. The bottom third of the panel belongs to [[Yale University]] Art Gallery and is exhibited under the title ''[[Allegory of Gluttony and Lust|Allegory of Gluttony]]''. The wing on the other side, which has more or less retained its full length, is the ''[[Death and the Miser]]'', now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]. The two panels together would have represented the two extremes of prodigality and miserliness, condemning and caricaturing both.

==Dating/provenance==

[[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] study has dated the wood to 1491, and it is tempting to see the painting as a response to Sebastian Brant's [[Ship of Fools (satire)|''Das Narrenschiff'']] or even the illustrations of the first edition of 1493. Another possible source for the [[Ship of Fools|ship allegory]] is the 14th-century ''[[Le Pèlerinage de l'Âme]]'' by [[Guillaume de Deguileville]] , which was printed in Dutch in 1486 (shortly after [[William Caxton]] printed it as [[The Pilgrimage of the Soul|''The Pylgremage of the Sowle'']] in 1483).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Bosing: ''Heronymus Bosch Between Heaven and Hell'' (London 1994) reprinted as ''Bosch The Complete Paintings'' (Taschen 1994) pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Drawing of the Ship of Fools|nl|3=Het narrenschip (tekening)}}'', also in the Louvre, appears to be a later copy.

Dendrochronological studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://expert.jeroenboschplaza.com/ericdebruyn/klein-2001/?lang=en | title = Dendrochronological Analysis of Works by Hieronymus Bosch and His Followers | accessdate = 2016-08-12 | publisher = -Ludion, Rotterdam, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Peter Klein have radically altered the provenance of some paintings, for instance the Escorial ''Crowning with Thorns'' panel can only have been painted after 1525 and so is not a Bosch original. The same goes for the Rotterdam ''Marriage feast at Cana'' panel which can only have been painted after 1553. It has also become clear that the Rotterdam Pedlar tondo, the Paris ''Ship of Fools'' panel and the Washington ''Death of a Miser'' panel have been painted on wood from the same tree.

The two to eight years between the felling of the tree and  its use as a painting substrate allows ''The Ship of Fools'' to be a direct satire of a frontispiece&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://digital.lib.uh.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p15195coll15&amp;CISOPTR=31 | title = Stultifera Navis woodcuts | accessdate = 2011-09-17 | publisher = University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Sebastian Brant's [[Ship_of_Fools_(satire)|book]].

[[File:Mals, die Sankt Benedikt Kirche Dm15779 foto1 2012-08-13 10.44.jpg|thumb|]]

'''St. Benedikt''' is a pre-Romanesque church in [[Mals]], [[South Tyrol]], known for its [[Carolingian period|Carolingian-era]] frescoes.

It was built in the second half of the 8th century. Until the 12th century, it was owned by the [[bishops of Chur]]. 
In the 12th century, the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] tower was added.

In the 18th century, under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the building was used for storage. Use as a sacral building was resumed only in the 20th century, after the discovery of the Carolingian frescoes.

The frescoes are dated to c. AD 800. They belong to a limited set of surviving frescoes of the Carolingian period, alongside those of the nearby St. Johann abbey in [[Val Müstair]], [[Grisons]].
The fresoes are mostly distributed in three [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] in the altar wall, showing [[Jesus Christ]] in the center, flanked by pope [[Gregory the Great]] and [[Saint Stephen]].
On the walls separating the niches are [[donor portrait]]s below a troop of twelve angels, and scenes showing Gregory writing his ''Dialogi'' and disputing with  [[Paulus Diaconus]], alongsides scenes showing [[Paul of Tarsus]] and a fragment of a scene from the life of [[Saint Benedict]].

[[File:Peacock feathers closeup.jpg|thumb|250px| The brilliant iridescent colours of the peacock's tail feathers are created by structural coloration, as first noted by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Robert Hooke]].]]
'''Structural coloration'''&lt;!--"Coloration" is a standard British English spelling, as in [[Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'', and is also used in American English. It follows a little-known rule, that roots in ''-our'' when given Latinate suffixes should use the ''-or'' spelling accordingly, as if borrowed directly from Latin instead of through French: ''colouring'' and ''colourist'' but ''coloration'', ''colorimetry'', and ''colorize''; ''honourable'' but ''honorarium''; ''humourless'' but ''humorous''; and so on. So this apparent aberration is actually a kind of etymological spelling, although the American usage may have been an influence post-Webster. (See Fowler's [[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|''MEU'']] sv '''-our- and -or-'''.)--&gt; is the production of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with [[visible light]], sometimes in combination with [[pigment]]s. For example, [[peacock]] tail [[feather]]s are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often [[iridescence|iridescent]].

Structural coloration was first observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – [[wave interference]] – explained by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] a century later. Young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of [[thin films]], combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different angles.

[[Animal coloration|In animals]] such as on the feathers of birds and the scales of [[butterfly|butterflies]], interference is created by a range of [[photonic]] mechanisms, including [[diffraction grating]]s, selective mirrors, [[photonic crystals]], crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some [[cuts of meat]] also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by [[electron microscopy]]. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue is found in the marble berries of ''[[Pollia condensata]]'', where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces [[Bragg's law]] scattering of light. The bright gloss of [[buttercup]]s is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.

Structural coloration has potential for industrial, commercial and military application, with [[Biomimicry|biomimetic]] surfaces that could provide brilliant colours, adaptive [[camouflage]], efficient optical switches and low-reflectance glass.

== History ==
[[File:Micrographia title page.gif|thumb|upright|[[Robert Hooke]]'s 1665 ''[[Micrographia]]'' contains the first observations of structural colours.]]

In his 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'', [[Robert Hooke]] described the "fantastical" colours of the [[peacock]]'s feathers:&lt;ref name=HookeOnPeacockIridescence&gt;Hooke, Robert. Micrographia. Chapter 36 ('Observ. XXXVI. ''Of Peacoks, Ducks, and Other Feathers of Changeable Colours''.')&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The parts of the Feathers of this glorious Bird appear, through the Microscope, no less gaudy then do the whole Feathers; for, as to the naked eye 'tis evident that the stem or quill of each Feather in the tail sends out multitudes of Lateral branches, … so each of those threads in the Microscope appears a large long body, consisting of a multitude of bright reflecting parts. &lt;br /&gt;… their upper sides seem to me to consist of a multitude of thin plated bodies, which are exceeding thin, and lie very close together, and thereby, like [[Nacre|mother of Pearl]] shells, do not onely reflect a very brisk light, but tinge that light in a most curious manner; and by means of various positions, in respect of the light, they reflect back now one colour, and then another, and those most vividly.  Now, that these colours are onely fantastical ones, that is, such as arise immediately from the refractions of the light, I found by this, that water wetting these colour'd parts, destroy'd their colours, which seem'd to proceed from the alteration of the reflection and refraction.&lt;ref name=HookeOnPeacockIridescence/&gt;}}

In his 1704 book ''[[Opticks]]'', [[Isaac Newton]] described the mechanism of the colours other than the brown pigment of peacock tail feathers.&lt;ref name="ExeterIridescence"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/themes/natural-photonics/iridescenceinlepidoptera/ | work=Natural Photonics (originally in Physics Review Magazine) | publisher=University of Exeter | title=Iridescence in Lepidoptera | date=September 1998 | accessdate=April 27, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082122/http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/themes/natural-photonics/iridescenceinlepidoptera/ | archivedate=April 7, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton noted that&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33504/33504-h/33504-h.htm | title=Opticks | last=Newton |first=Isaac| publisher=William Innys at the West-End of St. Paul's, London|edition=4th | date=1730| origyear=1704 | accessdate=April 27, 2012 | pages=Prop.

[[File:NHM Chrysospalax trevelyani (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|In 1892, [[Frank Evers Beddard]] noted that  ''[[Chrysospalax]]'' golden moles' thick fur was structurally coloured.]]
[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] (1773–1829) extended Newton's [[particle theory of light]] by showing that light could also behave as a wave. He showed in 1803 that light could diffract from sharp edges or slits, creating [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Young| first=Thomas| title=Experimental Demonstration of the General Law of the Interference of Light |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |year=1804 |volume=94|doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001 | pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shamos |first=Morris |title=Great Experiments in Physics |year=1959 |publisher=Holt Rinehart and Winston |location=New York |pages=96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1892 book ''[[Animal Coloration (1892 book)|Animal Coloration]]'', [[Frank Evers Beddard]] (1858–1925) acknowledged the existence of structural colours:

{{quote|The colours of animals are due either solely to the presence of definite pigments in the skin, or … beneath the skin; or they are partly caused by optical effects due to the scattering, diffraction or unequal refraction of the light rays. Colours of the latter kind are often spoken of as structural colours; they are caused by the structure of the coloured surfaces. The metallic lustre of the feathers of many birds, such as the [[Hummingbird|humming birds]], is due to the presence of excessively fine striae upon the surface of the feathers.&lt;ref name=Beddard&gt;{{cite book | title=Animal Coloration: an account of the principal facts and theories relating to the colours and markings of animals | authorlink=Frank Evers Beddard | year=1892 | last=Beddard | first=Frank Evers | publisher=Swan Sonnenschein |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5K-nT8GIn5AC | isbn=978-0-543-91406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}}}

But Beddard then largely dismissed structural coloration, firstly as subservient to pigments: "in every case the [structural] colour needs for its display a background of dark pigment;"&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|2}} and then by asserting its rarity: "By far the commonest source of colour in invertebrate animals is the presence in the skin of definite pigments",&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|2}} though he does later admit that the [[Cape golden mole]] has "structural peculiarities" in its hair that "give rise to brilliant colours".&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|32}}

=== Structure not pigment ===
[[File:Thin film interference.svg|thumb|When light falls on a [[thin-film optics|thin film]], the waves reflected from the upper and lower surfaces travel different distances depending on the angle, so they [[Interference (optics)|interfere]].]]

{{further|Feather}}

Structural coloration is caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. [[Colour]]s are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel [[thin-film optics|thin layers]], or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the colour's [[wavelength]].&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030399205001246 | title=Structural colour in animals—simple to complex optics | author=Parker, A.R., Martini, N. | journal=Optics &amp; Laser Technology |date=June–September 2006 | volume=38 | issue=4–6 | pages=315–322 | doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2005.06.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural coloration is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the [[bee-eater]], [[kingfisher]] and [[roller]], for example), as well as many [[butterflies|butterfly]] wings, [[beetle]] wing-cases ([[elytra]]) and (while rare among [[flowers]]) the gloss of [[buttercup]] petals.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite journal | title=Nature's Color Tricks| date=May 2012 | author=Ball, Philip |volume=306 | pages=74–79 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0512-74 | journal=Scientific American | issue=5 | pmid=22550931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kooi&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2016.0933| title = Functional optics of glossy buttercup flowers | url =https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314251397_Functional_optics_of_glossy_buttercup_flowers | journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface | volume = 14| pages=20160933| year = 2017| last1= van der Kooi | first1 = C.J.| last2 = Elzenga| first2= J.T.M.| last3=Dijksterhuis| first3=J.| last4=Stavenga|first4=D.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are often [[iridescent]], as in [[peacock]] feathers and [[nacre]]ous shells such as of [[pearl oyster]]s ([[Pteriidae]]) and ''[[Nautilus]]''.

=== Principle of iridescence ===
{{further|thin-film interference|iridescence}}
[[File:Bruchfläche eines Perlmuttstücks.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electron microscope|Electron micrograph]] of a fractured surface of [[nacre]] showing multiple thin layers]]

Iridescence, as explained by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1803, is created when extremely [[thin film]]s reflect part of the light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further part of it is reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and [[refractive index]] of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are [[Phase (waves)|out of phase]]. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.&lt;ref name=ExeterIridescence /&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

=== Fixed structures ===
[[File:Butterfly magnification series collage.jpg|thumb|Butterfly wing at different magnifications reveals microstructured chitin acting as a [[diffraction grating]]]]

A number of fixed structures can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can be far more elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt; Each mechanism offers a specific solution to the problem of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.

[[File:Morpho butterfly scale christmas tree multilayer structures drawing from electron micrograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Drawing of 'firtree' micro-structures in ''[[Morpho]]'' butterfly wing scale]]
A '''[[diffraction grating]]''' constructed of layers of [[chitin]] and air gives rise to the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales as well as to the tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their [[light microscope]]s. Another way to produce a diffraction grating is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical ''[[Morpho]]'' butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in ''Parotia lawesii'', [[Lawes's parotia]], a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;&lt;ref name="DoekeleBirdofParadise"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dramatic colour changes in a bird of paradise caused by uniquely structured breast feather barbules | url=http://cbn.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2011/ProcRSocBStavenga/2011ProcRSocBStavenga.pdf | author=Stavenga, Doekele G. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2010 | volume=278 | pages=2098–2104 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2293 | last2=Leertouwer | first2=H.

The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in ''[[Ranunculus acris]]'', the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at the centre of the flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.&lt;ref name=Kooi/&gt;

'''Surface gratings''', consisting on ordered surface features due exposure of ordered muscle cells on [[cuts of meat]]. The structural coloration on meat cuts appears only after the ordered pattern of muscle [[Myofibrils|fibrils]] is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.&lt;ref name=foods&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/2/4/499 | title=Foods | work=Iridescence in Meat Caused by Surface Gratings | date=November 2013 | accessdate=March 1, 2014 | author=Martinez-Hurtado, J L | volume=2 | pages=499–506 |doi=10.3390/foods2040499 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variable structures ===

[[File:Variable ring patterns on mantles of the blue-ringed octopus Hapalochlaena lunulata.png|thumb|left|400px|Variable ring patterns on mantles of ''Hapalochlaena lunulata'']]

Some animals including [[cephalopods]] like squid are able to vary their colours rapidly for both [[camouflage]] and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible [[proteins]] which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of [[reflectin]] proteins in [[chromatophore]] cells in the skin of the ''[[Doryteuthis pealeii]]'' squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;

Blue-ringed octopuses spend much of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal [[chromatophore]] cells.  If they are provoked, they quickly change colour, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50-60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second.  In the [[greater blue-ringed octopus]] (''Hapalochlaena lunulata''), the rings contain multi-layer [[Chromatophore#Iridophores and leucophores|iridophore]]s.  These are arranged to reflect blue–green light in a wide viewing direction. The fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved using muscles under neural control. Under normal circumstances, each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores. When these relax and muscles outside the ring contract, the bright blue rings are exposed.&lt;ref name="Mathger2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mäthger, L.M., Bell, G.R., Kuzirian, A.M., Allen, J.J. and Hanlon, R.T. |year=2012 |title=How does the blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata) flash its blue rings? |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=215 |issue=21 |pages=3752–3757 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3752.full |doi=10.1242/jeb.076869 |pmid=23053367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural coloration could be further exploited industrially and commercially, and research that could lead to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create [[active camouflage|active or adaptive]] [[military camouflage]] fabrics that vary their colours and [[pattern]]s to match their environments, just as [[chameleon]]s and [[cephalopod]]s do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like [[transistor]]s, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">The '''Symphony No. 1''' of [[Douglas Lilburn]] was completed in 1949, and had its [[premiere]] in 1951.  The [[symphony]] is in three integrated movements; a typical performance lasts around 30 minutes.

The symphony opens with a [[trumpet]] motto, forcefully stated, and shadowed by [[timpani]]; this is eventually woven into a theme for [[String instrument|strings]], over which [[woodwinds]] begin a climb.  The second theme of the movement is more austere, yet is still exuberant.  The second movement is more lyrical in nature, and is structured around two main themes; of these, the first is stated initially by the strings, while the second is first taken up by the woodwinds.  The third and final movement is built on four themes, derived from what Lilburn once called "the naive, generous country that gave one its joyous force".

The movements are marked as follows:
*''[[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] non troppo''
*''[[Andante (tempo)|Andante]] con moto''
*''Allegro''

The orchestration of the symphony consists of 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[horn (instrument)|horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[timpani]], and [[string instrument|strings]].&lt;ref name="Promethean"/&gt;

Several recordings of the symphony exist. The symphony was given its first engraved publication in 2015.&lt;ref name="Promethean"&gt;For publication and instrumentation see e.g. {{OCLC|929124298}}; also [http://www.promethean-editions.com/php/PubDetail.php?pubID=651&amp;SSID=11&amp;SSSID=42&amp;Composer=Douglas%20Lilburn Promethean Editions Description of the 2015 Edition].

'''''The [[proscription|Proscribed]] Royalist, 1651''''' (1852–53) is a painting by [[John Everett Millais]] which depicts a young [[Puritan]] woman protecting a fleeing [[Royalist]] after the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651, the decisive defeat of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Royalist is hiding in a hollow tree, a reference to a famous incident in which Charles himself hid in a tree to escape from his pursuers. Millais was also influenced by [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[I Puritani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Rosenfeld, ''John Everett Millais'', Phaidon Press Ltd., 2012, pp. 70–1, 73–4, 88, 102, 111–12, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Siren''''' is a painting by [[John William Waterhouse]]. The painting depicts a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] sitting at the edge of a cliff, [[lyre]] in hand, staring down at a shipwrecked sailor floating in water, who in turn is staring up at her.

According to the William Waterhouse's website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwwaterhouse.com/view.cfm?recordid=3|title=John William Waterhouse: The Siren - 1900 « Paintings|publisher=jwwaterhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; this picture was painted in 1900 and is now part of a private collection. The estimated sales price for the painting in 2003 was one million pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/11/03/basir03.xml|title=Culture|publisher=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Siren
He listened in thrall to the song of the siren,
Her voice like a star as it flew through the air.
He drowned in her eyes as she called him to follow,
And likened the sun to the gold of her hair.

She swept up her arms and held him close to her,
Her soft lips caressing the lines on his brow.
He could not resist her, a magic had trapped him,
And nothing could save him, for she had him now.

She pulled him down with her into the clear water,
He gasped as death started the grip on his soul.
His life ebbed away as she dragged him still further,
And laughed when she saw she'd accomplished her goal."
- Charlotte Lester.

'''The Spoils of War (symposium)'''
[[File:Looted_Art_-_German_loot_stored_at_Schlosskirche_Ellingen_-_Ellingen_(Bavaria_-_Germany).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|German repository of looted possessions in a church at Ellingen, Bavaria, May 1945.]]
"The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property" was a ground-breaking international [[symposium]] held in New York City in 1995 to discuss the artworks, cultural property, and historic sites damaged, lost, and [[Nazi plunder|plundered as a result of World War II]]. The three-day event was sponsored by the [[Bard Graduate Center]] for Studies in the Decorative Arts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;January 19–21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organized by [[Elizabeth Simpson (archaeologist)|Elizabeth Simpson]], an archaeologist and professor at the Bard Graduate Center.

Worldwide interest in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory at the end of the war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the opening of official negotiations on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.

==New York conference and proceedings==
[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|Generals Bradley, Patton, and Eisenhower examining works of art stored by the Nazis in the Merkers mine, Germany, April 1945.]]The program featured 48 notable speakers—government officials, diplomats, journalists, art historians, archaeologists, lawyers, and independent researchers—from Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Australia, England, and the United States. The combined testimony laid bare another horrifying dimension to the anguish of human suffering wrought by the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The symposium was the first to address the issue in a public forum, and led to numerous initiatives on provenance research by the governments involved as well as museums, libraries, and art dealers internationally. As a result, the art world was changed irrevocably. Acquisitions policies were revised and organizations restructured to facilitate the identification of artistic and cultural objects that had been stolen or transferred illegally during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aamd.org/standards-and-practices |title=Standards &amp; Practices &amp;#124; Association of Art Museum Directors |website=Aamd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes were established to allow families to claim their missing property; such claims have resulted in many works being restored to the heirs and descendants of the rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/home |title=Welcome to |publisher=Lootedart.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Spoils of War cover.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spoils of War'' (1997), showing paintings stolen from the Russian palaces at Petrodvorets and Pushkin, abandoned in March 1945 in East Prussia by German soldiers fleeing the Red Army.]]

The conference proceedings were published in an award-winning volume edited by Elizabeth Simpson (Harry N. Abrams, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Elizabeth. ''The Spoils of War--World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property''. New York: [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]] in association with the Bard Graduate Center, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes 17 treaties, conventions, and other official documents relating to the protection and return of cultural property. These begin with the "[[Lieber Code]]" of 1863 and the "[[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]]," and continue with the treaties following World War I, the "[[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954]]" for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]]" on the prevention of illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects]] of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention |title=Cultural Property - 1995 Convention - Unidroit - International Institute for the Unification of Private Law - Institut International pour l'Unification du droit privè |publisher=Unidroit |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses resulting from World War II==
Elizabeth Simpson and lawyer Jeanette Greenfield, author of ''The Return of Cultural Treasures'',&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette. ''The Return of Cultural Treasures.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; provided introductory comments on the subject, along with [[Lynn H. Nicholas|Lynn Nicholas]], author of ''The Rape of Europa'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn. ''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''. New York: Vintage Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; who discussed the massive displacement of art and cultural property that occurred during World War II. Individual countries detailed the damage to their national patrimony, as well as losses suffered by individuals. A talk on Jewish ceremonial art and private property was given by Vivian Mann, then Chair of Judaica at [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|The Jewish Museum]], New York. These reports were followed by a series of contributions on laws, directives, and conventions in place at the beginning of World War II, directives in force in Germany during the war, and laws enacted by the Allies to counter German appropriations. These and all the conference presentations are published in the proceedings (see list of contributors below).

==The "Monuments Men"==
[[File:Capt Edith Standen at Central Collecting Point Wiesbaden 1946.jpg|thumb|Captain Edith Standen at the Wiesbaden Collecting Point, 1946.]]A group of the so-called [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art|"Monuments Men"]] (which in fact included several women) detailed their firsthand accounts of the work of the art-specialist officers of the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentsmen.com |title=Official Site |publisher=The Monuments Men |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section]] of the [[Office of Military Government, United States]], recounted the discovery of [[looted art]] and stashed bullion in German mines, bunkers, castles, and churches, along with the redistribution and repatriation of these finds through the Munich and Wiesbaden Collecting Points. Of the veteran officers speaking the New York conference—James S. Plaut (d. 1996), [[Walter Farmer|Walter I. Farmer]] (d. 1997), [[Edith Standen|Edith A. Standen]] (d. 1998), [[Craig Hugh Smyth]] (d. 2006), [[S. Lane Faison]] (d. 2006), and Bernard Taper (d. 2016)—none survives today.

==Reappearance and recovery==
Other repatriations occurred at the end of the war, effected by the US State Department, the USSR, and other countries. Case studies include fascinating discussions of the [[Theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg Church Treasures]], the Soviet Secret Repositories,&lt;ref&gt;Akinsha, Konstantin, Grigorii Kozlov, and Sylvia Hochfield. ''Beautiful Loot: The Soviet Plunder of Europe's Art Treasures'', New York: Random House, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Treasure of Priam," which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann at Troy in 1873, shipped out of Turkey illegally by Schliemann, ended up in Berlin, transferred to Moscow by the Soviet Trophy Brigades after the fall of Berlin, held in secret in the Pushkin Museum, and finally brought out of the secret repository and exhibited in the museum in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, Vladimir, and Mikhail Treister. ''The Gold of Troy: Searching for Homer’s Fabled City''. Moscow and New York: Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in association with Harry N. Abrams, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims to ownership of the Trojan treasures by Turkey, Germany, and Greece, the objects remain in Moscow with the issue unresolved.[[File:Sophia Schliemann wearing Treasure A, Troy.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|Heinrich Schliemann's wife, Sophia, wearing gold jewelry from Treasure A, Troy, ca. 1873.]]

==Current issues and cooperative efforts==
The conference concluded with a series of presentations on current and proposed efforts to mitigate the losses suffered. Lyndel Prott, then Chief of the International Standards Section of the Cultural Heritage Division of [[UNESCO]], offered a list of "Principles for the Resolution of Disputes Concerning Cultural Heritage Displaced during the Second World War":

# Cultural objects that have been taken from territory occupied during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War by any belligerent will be returned to the country from which they have been taken.
#Where there have been successive displacements, the objects will be returned to the territory where they were located at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939.
#Principle 1 will apply whether  transfers of the cultural objects concerned have taken the form of open looting or plunder, or of transactions apparently legal in form, even when they purport to have been voluntarily effected.
#Cultural property taken from an occupied territory shall never be detained as war reparations.
#Where cultural objects displaced during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War have passed into the hands of third parties, the state that is responsible for their removal from the country where they were located in 1939 shall reacquire them for return to the state from which they were taken, by repurchase, indemnity or other appropriate means.
#No time limits can be set.
#Cultural objects being repatriated are to be accompanied by the relevant scientific documentation where available.
#Restitution by replacement is an available remedy where unique cultural objects have been destroyed.

==Press coverage and controversy==
The "Spoils of War" symposium was covered extensively in the international press, including articles carried by the [[Associated Press]] and in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''New York [[Newsday]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', and ''[[Pravda]]''. The [[The Forward|''Jewish Forward'']] published a critique that appeared on the first day of the conference; at issue was whether or not the conference gave sufficient weight to Jewish wartime losses, since these losses were detailed within the greater context of the Second World War and the damages experienced by the peoples of the many nations involved.

[[File:Amber Room Catherine Palace Tsarskoye Selo pre-war photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The original [[Amber Room]] in the [[Catherine Palace]], Pushkin (Tsarskoye Selo), Russia, in an early 20th century photograph before it was lost as a result of the Second World War.]]This issue sparked a second conference in Washington, DC, in 1998. Sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the "Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled participants from the New York symposium along with others to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. This resulted in a further set of "[[Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm |title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art |publisher=State.gov |date=1998-12-03 |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by organizer [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]], as well as "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/decl.htm |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York conference has remained influential, however, due to its broader scope—dealing as it did with losses that occurred throughout Europe, inflicted not only by the Germans but also by the Soviets and western Allies, and affecting all those peoples who suffered as a result of the Second World War. The volume of conference proceedings was reviewed widely by publications in the United States and Europe, as well as ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'', [[Russian News Agency TASS|''ITAR-TASS'']], and others. As the only comprehensive treatment of the subject, it is cited frequently, considered one of the most important books on World War II and its aftermath—and the loss, reappearance, and recovery of cultural property relating to the war.

[[Image:Blighty.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A shell case embossed with an image of two wounded Tommies approaching the White Cliffs of Dover]]

'''Trench art''' is any decorative item made by soldiers, prisoners of war, or civilians where the manufacture is directly linked to armed conflict or its consequences. It offers an insight not only to their feelings and emotions about the war, but also their surroundings and the materials they had available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armymuseum.co.nz/whats-on/world-war-one-centenary/personal-treasures-wwi-trench-art/|title=Personal Treasures: WWI Trench Art|website=New Zealand Army Museum|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not limited to the World Wars, the history of trench art spans conflicts from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] to the present day. Although the practice flourished during World War I, the term 'trench art' is also used to describe souvenirs manufactured by service personnel during World War II. Some items manufactured by soldiers, prisoners of war or civilians during earlier conflicts have been retrospectively described as trench art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Categorisation ==
There are four broad categories of trench art:

===Items made by soldiers===
{{multiple image
 | footer = Two [[chestnut]] leaves, engraved by a French soldier with the names of his children "Andrée" and "Eléonore" while waiting in the trenches.
 | image1 = "Andrée".jpg
 | image2 = "Eléonore".jpg
 }}
There is much evidence to prove that some trench art was made in the trenches, by soldiers, during war.

In ''With a Machine Gun to Cambrai'', [[George Coppard]] tells of pressing his uniform buttons into the clay floor of his trench, then pouring molten lead from shrapnel into the impressions to cast replicas of the regimental crest.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Chalk carvings were also popular, with contemporary postcards showing carvings in the rocky outcrops of [[Dugout (military)|dug-outs]].{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Many smaller items such as rings and knives were made by soldiers either in front line or support trenches, especially in quieter parts of the line.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Wounded soldiers were encouraged to work at crafts as part of their recuperation, with embroidery and simple forms of woodwork being common. Again from ''With a Machine Gun to Cambrai'', George Coppard recalls that, while recuperating from wounds at a private house in [[Birkenhead]], "one kind old lady brought a supply of coloured silks and canvas and instructed us in the art of [[embroidery]]. A sampler which I produced under her guidance so pleased her that she had it framed for me."

An example of therapeutic embroidery during World War I is the work of British military in Egypt, who were photographed sewing and embroidering for Syrian refugees. There was also the Bradford Khaki Handicrafts Club, which was funded in Bradford, UK, in 1918, to provide occupational therapy and employment for men returning from the trenches in France|url=https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/organisations-and-movements/charities/bradford-khaki-handicrafts-club.

===Items made by POWs and internees===
The second category consists of items made by prisoners of war and interned civilians.

[[Prisoners of war|POWs]] had good reasons to make decorative objects: free time and limited resources. Much POW work was therefore done with the express intention of trading the finished article for food, money or other privileges.

Reference to POW work is made in the recollections of A B Baker, W.A.A.C., contained in the book ''Everyman at War'', published by Purdom in 1930:
"Part of my work had to do with prisoners quartered in a camp near to our own. Those Germans were friendly men. They were clever with their hands, and would give me little carvings which they had made."

===Items made by civilians===
[[File:Trench Art.JPG|left|thumb|Chromed metal trench art ashtray made from a 25 pounder shell casing, 1942]]
The third category is items made by civilians, which mainly means civilians in and around the conflict zone, but would also include items made by sweethearts at home.

In 1914, the US set up the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]], headed by [[Herbert Hoover]]. It shipped staple foodstuffs, mainly flour, in the printed cotton flour sacks typical of the period. As thanks, the Belgians would embroider and paint in the designs, elaborating them with dates and flags and send them back to the US. Examples of these are now in the [[Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum|Herbert Hoover Museum]], but some were sold to soldiers in Paris or given as gifts.

Civilians in France, in the zones occupied by troops, were quick to exploit a new market. Embroidered [[postcard]]s were produced in what quickly became a [[cottage industry]], with civilians buying the surrounds and embroidering a panel of gauze. These postcards depicted regimental crests or patriotic flags and national symbols in abundance, and millions were produced over the course of the war.

At war's end, when civilians began to reclaim their shattered communities, a new market appeared in the form of pilgrims and tourists. Over the ensuing twenty years mountains of discarded debris, shell casings, and castoff equipment were slowly recycled, with mass-produced town crest motifs being stuck onto bullets, shell casings, fuse caps, and other [[wikt:paraphernalia|paraphernalia]] to be sold to tourists.

===Commercial items===
The fourth category is purely commercial production. After the war, [[tonne]]s of surplus materials were sold by the government and converted to souvenirs of the conflict.

Ship breaking, particularly if the ship had been involved in significant events such as the [[Battle of Jutland]], resulted in much of the wood from the ship being turned into miniature barrels, letter racks, and boxes, with small brass plaques attached announcing, for example, "Made of [[teak]] from HMS ''Shipsname'', which fought at the Battle of Jutland".

'''Wearable art''', also known as ''Artwear'' or "art to wear", refers to individually designed pieces of (usually) handmade clothing or [[jewellery]] created as fine or expressive art. While the making of any article of clothing or other wearable object typically involves aesthetic considerations, the term ''wearable art'' implies that the work is intended to be accepted as a serious and unique artistic creation or statement. Pieces may be sold and/or exhibited. The modern idea of wearable art seems to have surfaced more than once in various forms. Marbeth Schon's book on modernist jewellery (see the section on jewellery below) refers to a "wearable art movement" spanning roughly the years 1930 to 1960. A 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of a book on knitting refers to "the 60s Art to Wear movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Penelope Green |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DD143CF937A35756C0A9659C8B63&amp;&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22art%20to%20wear%20movement%22&amp;st=cse |title=BOOKS OF STYLE; Why Knit?

Most wearable art is made of fibrous materials and constitutes therefore a branch of the wider field of [[fiber art]], which includes both wearable and non-wearable forms of art using fabric and other fiber products. Wearable art as an artistic domain can also include jewelry, or clothing made from non-fiber materials such as leather, plastic sheeting, metals, etc.

==Wearable fiber art==
Artists creating wearable fiber art may use purchased finished fabrics or other materials, making them into unique garments, or may dye and paint virgin fabric. Countering the belief that art is something expensive, some clothing artists have started local companies to produce quality art work and clothing for a modest price. Wearable art is not restricted to jewellery but is also seen in graphic [[T-shirt]]s and even pants.

As with any other art form, the talent and skills of artists in this field vary widely. Since the nature of the medium requires [[craft]] skills as well as artistic skills, an advanced artist may wish to study [[color theory]], [[chemistry]], [[sewing]], [[Fashion designer|clothing design]], and computer software such as [[Photoshop]] and [[Illustrator]]. Classes in [[fashion design|clothing design and marketing]] are offered at colleges such as the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in [[New York City]].

The [[New Zealand]] city of [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] gained a reputation in the field of wearable art, with its ''World of Wearable Art Awards'', held annually since 1987 and run by [[Suzie Moncrieff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Suzie Moncrieff has the WoW factor|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/8884275/Suzie-Moncrieff-has-the-WoW-factor|newspaper = [[Stuff.co.nz]]|date = 2013-07-06|access-date = 2015-12-02|language = English|first = Kimberley|last = Rothwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the show moved to [[Wellington]] to a larger venue, although [[World of Wearable Art|a museum of garments]] remains in Nelson. In Australia, the [[Shearwater Wearable Arts]] or W.A.V.E. (Wearable Arts Vision In Education) has developed from a high school initiative to become a leading wearable arts event.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is held at [[Shearwater, The Mullumbimby Steiner School]] in [[Mullumbimby]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shearwaterperformingarts.com/ | title=Shearwater Wearable Arts 2017 | publisher=Shearwater The Mullumbimby Steiner School | work=Shearwater Wearable Arts | accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewelry as wearable art==
{{main|Art jewelry}}
Some 20th-century modern artists and architects sought to elevate bodily ornamentation — that is, jewellery — to the level of fine art and original design, rather than mere decoration, craft production of traditional designs, or conventional settings for showing off expensive stones or precious metals. In ''Modernist Jewelry 1930-1960: The Wearable Art Movement'' (2004), author Marbeth Schon explores unique and innovative wearable art objects created by surrealists, cubists, abstract expressionists, and other modernist artists working in the middle decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schon |first=Marbeth |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=modernist+%22The+Wearable+Art+Movement+%22&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Results for 'modernist "The Wearable Art Movement "' |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme examples==
Not all garments created as wearable art are made from traditional fibers or fabrics, and not all such artworks are meant for ordinary, practical use. [[Performance art|Performance]] and [[conceptual art]]ists have sometimes produced examples which are more provocative than useful.  [[Trashion]] is another branch of extraordinary wearable art, for example, work by [[Marina DeBris]].  The Portland Oregon Trashion Collective, Junk to Funk, has been using creating outrageous art garments out of trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junktofunk.org |title=Junk to Funk |publisher=Junk to Funk |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example is the ''Electric Dress'', a [[Shinto wedding|ceremonial wedding]] [[kimono]]-like costume consisting mostly of variously colored electrified and painted light bulbs, enmeshed in a tangle of wires, created in 1956 by the Japanese [[Gutai]] artist [[Atsuko Tanaka (artist)|Atsuko Tanaka]]. This extreme garment was something like a stage costume. Not really wearable in an everyday, practical  sense, it functioned rather as part of a daring work of [[performance art]] (though the "performance" element consisted merely of the artist's wearing the piece while mingling with spectators in a gallery setting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Mark |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/ |title=Electrifying Art: Atsuko Tanaka, 1954-1968 - New York Magazine Art Review |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2004-10-04 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nam June Paik]]'s 1969 performance piece called ''TV Bra for Living Sculpture'', [[Charlotte Moorman]] played a [[cello]] while wearing a [[brassiere]] made of two small operating television sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Collins |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D7143DF93AA35752C1A967958260 |title=Charlotte Moorman, 58, Is Dead; A Cellist in Avant-Garde Works |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian artist Andrea Vander Kooij created a group of pieces called ''Garments for Forced Intimacy'' (2006). According to an essay at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]'s Faculty of Fine Arts gallery website, these hand-knit articles of clothing are designed to be worn by two people simultaneously, and they, "as the name states, compel the wearers into uncharacteristic proximity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fofagallery.concordia.ca/ehtml/2007/acting.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204221546/http://fofagallery.concordia.ca/ehtml/2007/acting.htm |date=February 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[wearable computing]] technology develops, increasingly miniaturized and stylized equipment is starting to blend with wearable art esthetics.  Low-power mobile computing allows light-emitting and color-changing flexible materials  and high-tech fabrics to be used in complex and subtle ways.  Some practitioners of the [[Steampunk]] movement have produced elaborate costumes and accessories which incorporate a pseudo-Victorian style with modern technology and materials.

'''Sir William Jackson Hooker''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KH|FRS|FRSE|FLS|DCL|LLD}} (6 July 1785 – 12 August 1865) was an English systematic [[botany|botanist]] and organiser, and botanical illustrator. He held the post of [[Regius Professor]] of Botany at [[Glasgow University]], and was Director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]. He enjoyed the friendship and support of Sir [[Joseph Banks]] for his exploring, collecting and organising work. His son, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], succeeded him to the Directorship of Kew Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Mea 1967. ''The Hookers of Kew 1785–1911.'' Joseph, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Hooker was born in [[Norwich]]. His father, Joseph Hooker of [[Exeter]], a member of the same family as the celebrated theologian [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]], devoted much of his time to the study of German literature and the cultivation of curious [[plant]]s. He was educated at [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]] and afterwards took up as a recreation the study of [[natural history]], especially [[ornithology]] and [[entomology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Self-Taught Botanists Who Saved the Kew Botanic Garden |author=Stearn, William T.  |journal=Taxon |volume=14 |issue=9 |date=December 1965 |page=294 |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) |jstor=1216740 |doi=10.2307/1216740}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently confined his attention to botany, on the recommendation of [[Sir James Edward Smith]], whom he had consulted respecting a rare [[moss]].

Hooker inherited enough money to be able to travel at his own expense. His first botanical expedition—at the suggestion of Sir [[Joseph Banks]]—was to [[Iceland]], in the summer of 1809. The specimens he collected, along with his notes and drawings, were destroyed by fire on the homeward voyage; an incident in which he nearly lost his life. His good memory, however, aided him to publish an account of the island, and of its inhabitants and flora; his ''Tour in Iceland'', 1809, was privately circulated in 1811&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Travels in the Island of Iceland, during the summer of the Year 1810'' by Sir George Steuart Mackenzie and ''Journal of a Tour in Iceland, in the Summer of 1809'' by William Jackson Hooker|journal=The Quarterly Review|volume=7|date=March 1812|pages=48–92|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b661434;view=1up;seq=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hooker, William Jackson|title=Journal of a tour in Iceland, in the summer of 1809|location=London|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Orme, and Brown|edition=2nd|year=1813|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001235821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810–1811 he made extensive preparations, and sacrifices which proved financially serious, with a view to accompany Sir [[Robert Brownrigg]] to [[Ceylon]], but political upheaval led to the project being abandoned. In 1814 he spent nine months in botanizing excursions in France, Switzerland and northern Italy, and in the following year he married Maria Dawson Turner, the eldest daughter of [[Dawson Turner]], banker, of [[Great Yarmouth]], and sister-in-law of [[Francis Palgrave]].

Settling at [[Halesworth]], [[Suffolk]], he devoted himself to the formation of his [[herbarium]], which became of worldwide renown among botanists. In 1816 the ''British Jungermanniae'', his first scientific work, was published. This was succeeded by a new edition of [[William Curtis]]'s ''[[Flora Londinensis]]'', for which he wrote the descriptions (1817–1828); by a description of the ''Plantae cryptogamicae'' of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aimé Bonpland]]; by the ''[[Muscologia]]'', a very complete account of the [[moss]]es of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Ireland, prepared in conjunction with [[Thomas Taylor (botanist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1818);&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle = Taylor, Thomas (d.1848) |last= Boulger |first=George Simonds |authorlink=George Simonds Boulger |volume = 55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by his ''Musci exotici'' (2 vols., 1818–1820), devoted to new foreign mosses and other [[cryptogamic plants]].

In 1820 he accepted the regius professorship of botany in the [[University of Glasgow]] where he soon became popular as a lecturer; his style was both clear and ready. The following year he brought out the ''[[Flora Scotica]]'', in which the natural method of arrangement of British plants was given with the artificial. He worked with the [[Glasgow]] botanist and lithographer [[Thomas Hopkirk]] to establish the [[Royal Botanic Institution of Glasgow]] and to lay out and develop the [[Glasgow Botanic Gardens]]. In 1815, he was made a corresponding member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and, in 1833, his status was changed to that of foreign member. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1823.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker succeeded in convincing the British government that botanists should be appointed to their expeditions. While his works were in progress his herbarium received large and valuable additions from all parts of the globe, and his position as a botanist was thus vastly improved. He was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] and a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1836, and in 1841 he was appointed director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], on the resignation of [[William Townsend Aiton]].&lt;ref&gt;Kew had formerly been a royal garden; Hooker was the first Director under its new state ownership. Turrill W.B. 1959. ''The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, past and present''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direction the gardens expanded from {{convert|10|to|75|acre|ha|abbr=out}}, with an arboretum of {{convert|270|acre|km2}}, many new glass-houses were erected, and a museum of [[economic botany]] was established. He was engaged on the ''Synopsis filicum'' with [[John Gilbert Baker]] when he contracted a throat infection then epidemic at Kew. He died in 1865 and is buried at [[St. Anne's Church, Kew]].

He was succeeded at Kew Gardens by his son Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], a rare example of an outstanding man succeeded in his post by an equally outstanding son.
