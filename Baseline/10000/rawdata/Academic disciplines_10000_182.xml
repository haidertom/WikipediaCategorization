'''Achaemenid architecture''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: معماری هخامنشیان) includes all architectural achievements of the [[Achaemenid]] [[Persian people|Persians]] manifesting in construction of spectacular cities used for governance and inhabitation ([[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Ecbatana]]), temples made for worship and social gatherings (such as [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] temples), and [[mausoleums]] erected in honor of fallen kings (such as the burial tomb of [[Cyrus the Great]]). The quintessential feature of Persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of Assyrian, Egyptian, Median and Asiatic Greek all incorporated, yet producing a unique Persian identity seen in the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to study architecture|author =Charles Henry Caffin|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|year=1917|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnoWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achaemenid architecture is academically classified under [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] in terms of its style and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dictionary of Iranian Traditional Architectural Terms (Persian: فرهنگ واژه‌های معماری سنتی ایران) |author=Fallah'far, Sa'id |publisher=Kamyab Publications |year=2010 |pages=44 |isbn=978-964-350-316-1 |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713082632/http://lccn.loc.gov/2010342544 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achaemenid architectural heritage, beginning with the expansion of the empire around 550 B.C.E., was a period of artistic growth that left an extraordinary architectural legacy ranging from Cyrus the Great's solemn tomb in [[Pasargadae]] to the splendid structures of the opulent city of [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Architecture|author =Marco Bussagli|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2005|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fMfCkY6-9joC&amp;pg=PA211|isbn=9781845110895}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[Sassanid empire|second Persian Empire]], the [[Sassanid dynasty]] (224–624 C.E.), revived Achaemenid tradition by construction of temples dedicated to fire, and monumental palaces.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

Perhaps the most striking extant structures to date are the ruins of [[Persepolis]], a once opulent city established by the Achaemenid king, [[Darius the Great]] for governmental and ceremonial functions, and also acting as one of the empire's four capitals. Persepolis, would take 100 years to complete and would finally be ransacked and burnt by the troops of [[Alexander the Great]] in 330 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient cities: the archaeology of urban life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome|author =Charles Gates|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=186|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8aLb5pnm1j4C&amp;pg=PA186|isbn=9780415121828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar architectural infrastructures were also erected at [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]] by Darius the Great, serving similar functions as [[Persepolis]], such as reception of foreign dignitaries and delegates, performance of imperial ceremonies and duties, and also housing the kings.

==Pasargadae==

===Mausoleum of Cyrus the Great===

Despite having ruled over much of the ancient world, Cyrus the Great would design a tomb that depicts extreme simplicity and modesty when compared to those of other ancient kings and rulers. The simplicity of the structure has a powerful effect on the viewer, since aside from a few cyma moldings below the roof and a small rosette above its small entrance, there are no other stylistic distractions.&lt;ref name=ronald&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arts of Persia|author =Ronald W. Ferrier|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1989|pages=27–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G2Qkf0h2Pj4C&amp;pg=PA27|isbn =0300039875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural details====
After his death, Cyrus the Great's remains were interred in his capital city of [[Pasargadae]], where today his [[limestone]] tomb (built around 540–530 B.C.E.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasargadae|author =UNESCO World Heritage Centre|year=2006|accessdate=December 26, 2010|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1106}}&lt;/ref&gt;) still exists. The translated ancient accounts give a vivid description of the tomb both geometrically and aesthetically; The tomb's geometric shape has changed little over the years, still maintaining a large stone of quadrangular form at the base (forty five feet by forty two feet&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book|title=The palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored: an essay on ancient Assyrian and Persian architecture, Volume 5|author =James Fergusson|publisher=J. Murray|year=1851|pages=214–216 &amp; 206–209 (Zoroaster Cube: pp. 206) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Us0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215}}&lt;/ref&gt;), followed by a pyramidal succession of seven, irregular smaller rectangular stones (possibly as a reference to the seven planets&lt;ref name=james/&gt; of the [[solar system]]) reaching a height of eighteen feet, until the structure is curtailed by a rectangularly formed cubical edifice with a small opening or window on the side, where the slenderest man can barely squeeze through.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite book|author =((Grk.) Lucius Flavius Arrianus) (En.) Arrian – (trans.)

The edifice, or the "small house" is a rectangular, elongated cube that lies directly on top of the pyramidal stone steps, and is {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} in width, {{convert|6+1/2|ft|m|spell=in}} in height, and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=Aedeen&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeologica: The World's Most Significant Sites and Cultural Treasures|author =Aedeen Cremin|publisher=frances lincoln Ltd|year=2007|pages=227–29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A0llBlzF6UgC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227|isbn=9780711228221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inside of the edifice is occupied by a small chamber a few feet in width and height, and around ten feet deep. It was inside this chamber where the bed and coffin of Cyrus the Great would have been situated.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The edifice has a pediment roof possessing the same length and width dimensions as the edifice itself. Around the tomb were a series of columns, the original structure which they supported is no longer present.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; [[Arrian]]'s direct testimony indicates that Cyrus the Great was indeed buried in the chamber inside the edifice, as he describes Alexander seeing it during his visit to Pasargadae, but it is also a possibility that the body of Cyrus the Great had been interred below the structure, and that the tomb seen on the top is in fact a [[cenotaph]] or a false tomb.

There was originally a golden [[coffin]] inside the mausoleum, resting on a table with golden supports, inside of which the body of Cyrus the Great was interred. Upon his resting place, was a covering of tapestry and drapes made from the best available Babylonian materials, using fine Median workmanship; below his bed was a fine red carpet, covering the narrow rectangular base of his tomb.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;

====History====
Translated Greek accounts describe the tomb as having been placed in the fertile Pasargadae gardens, surrounded by trees and ornamental shrubs, with a group of Achaemenian protectors (the "[[Magi]]"), stationed nearby to protect the edifice from theft or damage.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persia past and present|author =Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson|year=1906|publisher=The Macmillan Company|pages=278|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7pdCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magi were a group of on-site Zoroastrian observers, located in their separate but attached structure possibly a [[caravanserai]], paid and cared for by the Achaemenid state (by some accounts they received a salary of daily bread and flour, and one sheep payment a day&lt;ref name=james/&gt;). The magi were placed in charge of maintenance and also prevention of theft. Years later, in the ensuing chaos created by [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasion of Persia and loss of a centralized authority directing and caring for the Magi, Cyrus the Great's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which the tomb was treated, and questioned the Magi and put them to court.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt; On some accounts, Alexander's decision to put the Magi on trial was more about his attempt to undermine their influence and his show of power in his newly conquered empire, than a concern for Cyrus's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Monthly review|author1=Ralph Griffiths |author2=George Edward Griffiths |publisher=Printers Street, London|year=1816|pages=509|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hogCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Alexander the Great ordered [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]] to improve the tomb's condition and restore its interior.&lt;ref name=Cleveland /&gt;

The tomb was originally ornamented with an inscription that, according to [[Strabo]] (and other ancient sources), stated:&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

{{quote|O man! I am Cyrus the Great, who gave the Persians an empire and was the king of Asia. Grudge me not therefore this monument.}}

The edifice has survived the test of time for some 2,500 years. After the Arab invasion into Persia and collapse of the [[Sassanid Empire]], Arab armies wanted to destroy this historical artifact, on the basis that it was not in congruence to their Islamic tenets, but quick thinking on the part of the local Persians prevented this disaster. The Persians renamed the tomb, and presented it to the invading army as the tomb of King [[Solomon]]'s mother. It is likely that the inscription was lost at this time.&lt;ref name=elliot&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran|author1=Andrew Burke |author2=Mark Elliot |publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2008|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] (Shah of Iran), the last official monarch of Persia, during his [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] paid significant homage to the Achaemenid kings and specially Cyrus the Great. Just as Alexander the Great before him, the Shah of Iran wanted to appeal to Cyrus's legacy to legitimize his own rule by extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =James D. Cockcroft|title=Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiIEFLxZaJwC|isbn=9781555468477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah of Iran however was generally interested in protection of imperial historical artifacts.

After the [[Iranian revolution]], the tomb of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos and vandalism propagated by the Islamic revolutionary hardliners who equated Persian imperial historical artifacts with the late Shah of Iran. There are allegations of the tomb being in danger of damage from the construction of the [[Sivand Dam]] on river Polvar (located in the province of [[Fars Province|Pars]]) and water related damage, but there is no official acknowledgement of this claim. [[United Nations]] recognizes the tomb of Cyrus the Great and Pasargadae as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] site.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld|Ernst E. Herzfeld]], believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of [[Chicago University]], headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive façade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of "irreparable damage"&lt;ref name=book/&gt; from neglect, the elements, and vandalism.

Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as [[Susa]] also hosted [[Palace of Darius in Susa|a similar structure]] initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire.&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt; Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son [[Xerxes the Great]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]] as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.

During the time of [[Shah of Iran]], the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as [[Heinrich Lübke]] of Germany, and [[Ralph Graves (writer)|Ralph Graves]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In an article in ``Life`` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way:

{{quote|When you see Persepolis for the first time as I did, facing Marvdasht, you are likely to be disappointed but once inside the ruins themselves you are overwhelmed by the still-proud soaring columns, and by the quality and the fresh state of the bas-relief carvings which are certainly among the finest in the history of the world’s art. But mostly you are transfixed by the sudden realization that all this happened 24 centuries ago, and that people from every nation in the known world of the time had stood in the same place and felt the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A stunning setting for a 2500th anniversary|author =Ralph Graves|publisher=Life magazine|date=October 15, 1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Four-winged guardian===

[[File:Pasargades winged man.jpg|left|thumb|The four winged guardian figure of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], with four wings, a two horned crown, and a royal Elamite clothing]]
Perhaps one of the most memorable remaining architectural and artistic works is the bas-relief of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae. This is a bas-relief cut upon a stone slab depicting a figure or a guardian man, most likely a resemblance of Cyrus himself, possessing four wings shown in an [[Assyria]]n style, dressed in [[Elam]]ite traditional clothing, assuming a pose and figure of an [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god, and wearing a crown that has two horns, in what resembles an ''[[Ovis longipes palaeoaegyptiacus]].'' The structure originally had an upper stone slab that in three different languages, ([[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]]) declared, "I, (am) Cyrus the king, an Achaemenid."&lt;ref name=ilya&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge history of Iran: The Median and Achaemenian periods, Volume 2|author = Ilya Gershevitch|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|pages=392–398|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kMLKgzj5afMC&amp;pg=PA392|isbn = 9780521200912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This carved in limestone writing was in place when [[Robert Ker Porter|Sir Robert Ker Poter]] described the piece in 1818 but, at some point has been lost.

[[David Stronach]] has suggested that there were originally four such figures, set against doorways to the Palace of Cyrus in Pasargadae.&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; That this bas-relief has such an eclectic styling with elements of [[ancient egypt|Egyptian]], [[Elam]]ite, and [[Assyria]]n, reflects "..'the oecumenical attitude of the Achaemenian kings, who from the time of Cyrus, onward adopted a liberal policy of tolerance and conciliation toward the various religions embraced within their empire'..."&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; It would therefore depict the eclectic nature of Achaemenid life from policies of the kings to their choice of architecture.

[[Herodotus]], recounts that Cyrus saw in his sleep the oldest son of Hystaspes, [Darius the Great] with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing with the one wing Asia, and with the other wing Europe.&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt; Noted [[Iranologist]], [[Ilya Gershevitch]] explains this statement by Herodotus and its connection with the four winged figure in the following way:&lt;ref name=ilya/&gt;

{{quote|Herodotus, therefore as I surmise, may have known of the close connection, between this type of winged figure, and the image of the Iranian majesty, which he associated with a dream prognosticating, the king's death, before his last, fatal campaign across the Oxus.}}

This relief sculpture, in a sense depicts the eclectic inclusion of various art forms by the Achaemenids, yet their ability to create a new synthetic form that is uniquely Persian in style, and heavily dependent on the contributions of their subject states. After all, that is what distinguishes Achaemenid architecture from those of other kingdoms. It is its originality in context of fusion and inclusion of existing styles, in such a way as to create awe-inspiring structures.

==Persepolis==
[[File:2009-11-24 Persepolis 02.jpg|thumb|center|800 px|&lt;center&gt;Panorama of [[Persepolis]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[File:Perspolis.jpg|thumb|right|A well-preserved [[Persian column]] showing the details of the capital of the columns in [[Persepolis]]]]

[[Persepolis]] is the Latinized version of the Old Persian name, "Parsa" literally meaning the "city of Persians." Another spectacular achievement of the Achaemenids, Persepolis became one of the four capitals of the empire. Initiated by [[Darius the Great]] around 518 B.C.E., it would grow to become a center for ceremonial and cultural festivities, a center for dignitaries and visitors to pay homage to the king, a private residence for the Persian kings, a place for [[satraps]] to bring gifts for the king in the Spring during the festival of [[Nowruz]], as well as a place of governance and ordinance.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; Persepolis's prestige and grand riches were well known in the ancient world, and it was best described by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] as "the richest city under the sun".&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt;

===Structural details===
Today the archaeological remnants of this once opulent city are about 70 kilometers northeast of the modern Iranian city of [[Shiraz]], in the [[Fārs Province|Pars]] province, in southwestern [[Iran]]. Persepolis is a wide, elevated complex 40 feet high, 100 feet wide, and a third of a mile long,&lt;ref name=book/&gt; composed of multiple halls, corridors, a wide terrace, and a special, double, symmetrical stairway that would provide access to the top of the terrace.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; The stairway would delineate [[relief]] scenes of various motifs of daily life or nature, including some that were literal as well as metaphorical; Some scenes would show natural acts such as a lion attacking its prey but bear symbolism of spring and the [[Nowruz]] festival. Other scenes would depict, subjects from all states of the empire presenting gifts to the king, as well as scenes depicting royal guards, or scenes of social interactions between the guards or the dignitaries.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; This stairway is sometimes referred to as "All countries."&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

The structure was constructed from various halls and complexes that included, hall of [[Apadana]] (the largest hall with 36 columns), "Tachar" (the private chamber of Darius the Great), "Hadish" (added later on as a private chamber for king [[Xerxes the Great]]), the "Talar-i-Takht" also known as the 100-columned hall serving as the throne hall for general meeting with the king, "Darvazeh-i-Mellal" (the gate of all nations), the "khazaneh" (the royal treasury), a hall/palace complex later on developed by [[Artaxerxes III]], Tripylon (council hall), and the "rock cut tombs of the kings" or [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

The most impressive hall in the complex is the [[Apadana]] hall, occupying an area of about 109 square meters with 36 [[Persian column]]s, each more than 19 m tall. Each column is [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]], with a square base (except a few in the [[porticos]]), and an elaborate [[capital (column)|capital]] with two animals supporting the roof. The structure was originally closed off from the elements by mud-brick walls over 5 meters thick and over 20 meters.&lt;ref name=stronach&gt;{{cite web|title=APADANA|author1=R. Schmitt |author2=D. Stronach |publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|date=December 15, 1986|accessdate=Jan 23, 2011|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/apadana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The columns have a composite capital depicting addorsed bulls or creatures. Those columns in the porticoes not only would possess a circular base, but would also have an ornate capital after the end of the fluting, only to be curtailed by detailed addorsed bulls, supporting the roof.&lt;ref name=stronach/&gt;

Apadana's relief is also unique in that it delineates the presence and power of the king. Known as "Treasure reliefs" the depicted scenes on Apadana stress the continuity of the kingdom through Darius the Great, and stress his presence throughout the empire, as well as depict his army of Persian [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|immortals]]. Perhaps this was Darius's attempt to create a symbol of the assured continuity of his line. Apadana hall and the adjacent structures in the complex are believed to have been designed to host large number of people. In fact, halls of Persepolis could at any one time host some ten thousand visitors easily with the king and the royal staff seated appropriately.&lt;ref name=stronach/&gt;

The grandeur of Persepolis is in its architectural details, its impressive, tall, and upright columns, in its skilfully crafted reliefs depicting people from all walks of life, and from all corners of the empire, and most importantly in its historical importance as both a political and a social center of Achaemenid royal life.

[[Persepolis Administrative Archives|Persepolis Fortifications]] (PF) Tablets, dating to between 509 and 494 B.C.E. are ancient Persian documents that describe many aspects of construction and maintenance of the Persepolis.&lt;ref name=george/&gt; The tablets are important because they highlight two important aspects of the Achaemenid life and the construction of Persepolis: Firstly, that the structure was created by workers, who were paid rations or wages, and secondly the structure had an intricate system of engineering involving weight bearing and architectural elements, and most notably an irrigation system composed of a system of closed pipes and open aqueducts. The following text from ''PF 1224'', delineates both points:

{{quote|32 BAN (9.7 litres) of grain...the high priest at Persepolis... received and gave (it as) bonus to post-partum Greek women at Persepolis, irrigation (workers), whose apportionment are set...."&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of Hellenic studies|author1=George Boys-Stones |author2=Barbara Graziosi |author3=Phiroze Vasunia |publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2009|pages=42–47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cIDDR1WD9iEC&amp;pg=PA42|isbn=9780199286140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Water technologies====
The runoff and sewer network of Persepolis are among the most complex in the ancient world. Persepolis is constructed on the foot of a mountain (Rahmat Mountain), with an elevated terrace that is partially man made and partially part of the mountain complex. As Persepolis was in essence an important cultural center often used by the beginning of the spring during the festival of [[Nowruz]] it enjoyed great precipitation and water runoffs from the molten ice and snow. The sewer network assumed great importance at this critical time as it was meant to both handle the water flow downward from higher areas as well as manage the inhabitant’s sewage runoffs, and their water needs.&lt;ref name=Mays&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Water Technologies|author1=L. Mays |author2=M. Moradi-Jalal et. al |publisher=Springer|year=2010|pages=95–100|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AEzOzSZEAToC&amp;pg=PA94|isbn=9789048186327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent flooding, the Achaemenids used two engineering techniques to divert molten snow and mountain runoff: The first strategy was to collect the runoff in a reservoir that was a well with a square opening with dimensions of 4.2 m for the square opening, and a depth of 60 m, allowing a volume of 554 cubic meters, or 554,000 liters, (60 x 4.2 x 4.2) of runoff to be collected. The water would be diverted toward the reservoir via multiple masonry gutters strategically located around the structure. The second strategy was to divert water away from the structure, should the reservoirs be filled to capacity; this system used a 180 m long conduit, with 7 m width, and 2.6 m depth located just west of the site.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

The water system however was far more complex than just the reservoirs and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation. The irrigation was divided into five zones, two serving north part of the structure and three the southern part. Amazingly the irrigation system was designed to be harmonious with the structure so that at places there were central drainage canals in the center of the columns and small draining holes and conduits on each floor that would take the water out of roof, each floor, and the sewage portals into an underground sewage network and away from the structure.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

The five zones (I–V) all possessed a runoff capacity of 260 L/s (liter/second) which is certainly more than the amount needed for handling mountain runoff indicating that the system was also used for water supply to the inhabitants, sewage management, and even irrigation of the gardens around the structure.&lt;ref name=Mays/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Structural technologies====
In order for such a massive structure to have functioned properly it meant that the weight of the roof, columns and indeed the terrace had to be distributed evenly. Construction at the base of the mountain offered some structural support. The ceiling material was a composite application of wood and stone decreasing its overall weight. Extensive use of stone in Persepolis, not only guaranteed its structural integrity for the duration of its use but also meant that its remains lasted longer than the mud-bricks of [[Palace of Darius in Susa|Susa palaces]].

===History===
Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld|Ernst E. Herzfeld]], believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of [[Chicago University]], headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt;

On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive façade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of "irreparable damage"&lt;ref name=book/&gt; from neglect, the elements, and vandalism.

Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as [[Susa]] also hosted a similar structure initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire.&lt;ref name=ronald/&gt; Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son [[Xerxes the Great]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]] as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.

During the time of [[Shah of Iran]], the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as [[Heinrich Lübke]] of Germany, and [[Ralph Graves (writer)|Ralph Graves]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In an article in ``Life`` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way:

{{quote|When you see Persepolis for the first time as I did, facing Marvdasht, you are likely to be disappointed but once inside the ruins themselves you are overwhelmed by the still-proud soaring columns, and by the quality and the fresh state of the bas-relief carvings which are certainly among the finest in the history of the world’s art. But mostly you are transfixed by the sudden realization that all this happened 24 centuries ago, and that people from every nation in the known world of the time had stood in the same place and felt the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A stunning setting for a 2500th anniversary|author =Ralph Graves|publisher=Life magazine|date=October 15, 1971|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AUAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Vandalism===
Throughout history there have been instances of neglect or vandalism in Persepolis. The most notable historical figure to vandalize this structure was [[Alexander the Great]], who after entering Persepolis in 330 B.C.E. called it the "most hateful city in Asia" and allowed his Macedonian troops to pillage it.&lt;ref name=Laura&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the conqueror: the epic story of the warrior king, Volume 2003|author =Laura Foreman|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|pages=152|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVEa4nzLkT4C&amp;pg=PA152|isbn =9780306812934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this stern hatred, Alexander also admired the Persians as is obvious through his respect for [[Cyrus the Great]], and his act of giving a dignified burial to [[Darius III]]. Years later upon revisiting the city he had burnt, Alexander would regret his action. [[Plutarch]] depicts the paradoxical nature of Alexander when he recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of [[Xerxes the Great]] as if it were a live person:

{{quote|Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece, or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alexander the Great: The Invisible Enemy: A Biography |first=John Maxwell |last=O'Brien |publisher=Psychology Press |date=1994 |page=104 |isbn=978-0-415-10617-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In retrospect, it must be understood that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure to bring an end to Persepolis, Alexander is not by any means the only. Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid era]]. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of the books. That no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zoroastrian faith: tradition and modern research|author =Solomon Alexander Nigosian|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=1993|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uspf6eDDvjAC&amp;pg=PA47|isbn =9780773511446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, and in WWII, the structure would also suffer vandalism at the hands of the Allies. Natural causes such as earthquakes and winds have also contributed to the overall demise of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Persian Earthquakes|author1=N. N. Ambraseys |author2=C. P. Melville |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|pages=198|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1JkfKub5vakC&amp;pg=PA198|isbn=9780521021876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first French excavation in Susa carried out by the Dieulafoys and the looting and the destruction of Persian antiquities by the so-called archeologists had a deep impact on the site. Jane Dieulafoy writes in her diary:

{{quote| Yesterday I was gazing at the huge stone cow found recently; it weighs around 12,000 kilos! It is impossible to move such an enormous mass. I couldn't control my anger. I took a hammer and started striking the stone beast. I gave it some ferocious blows. The head of the pillar burst open like ripe fruit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}}}

Even to date the structure is not safe from destruction and vandalism. After the Iranian revolution, a group of fundamentalists serving [[Khomeini]], including his right-hand man [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], tried to bulldoze both the renown Persian poet, [[Tomb of Ferdowsi|Ferdowsi's tomb]], and Persepolis, but they were stopped by the provisional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Epic of Iran|author =Reza Aslan|publisher=New York Times|date=April 30, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/books/review/30aslan.html?pagewanted=print|accessdate=Jan 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery below highlights only some of these unfortunate acts of vandalism mostly by foreign visitors from the late 1800s to mid-1900s. Currently the structure is at high risk of "irreparable damage."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Virtual reconstruction===
French archaeologist, Egyptologist, and historian [[Charles Chipiez]] (1835–1901) has created some of the most advanced virtual drawings of what [[Persepolis]] would have looked like as a metropolis of the Persian Empire. The following mini-gallery depicts his virtual recreations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of art in Persia|author1=Georges Perrot |author2=Charles Chipiez |publisher=Chapman and Hall, limited|year=1892|pages=336–43 &amp; others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SU9TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314-IA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first image on the left is a view of the "Talar-i-Takht" or the 100 columns hall of Persepolis. Note on the far left portion of the image, the famous "[[lamassu]]" (or chimeric man, lion, eagle beast) greeting the visitors (look below for a picture of a lamassu). Chipiez's drawings delineate his technical prowess and attention to details.

The second picture from the left, is Chipiez's drawing of the columns, their [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] ornation, and roof structure of the palace of Darius in Persepolis, also known as "Tachar." Note the adorsed bull details, as well as the use of wood in construction of the roof. This explains why the palace caught fire when Alexander the Great, set it aflame.

The third picture from the left, is a more detailed, technical drawing of the "Talar-i-Takht" or the 100 column hall. Note the layering of the roof, the detailing on the edges of the roof, the window structures, and the technical detailing of the construction poles.

The last picture, on the right, is a panoramic view of the outside of the palace of Darius the Great in Persepolis. Details of the Persepolis reliefs are depicted as one can note the symbolic scenes of lions attacking bulls, accompanied by two groups of Persian soldiers protecting (symbolically in this case) the infrastructure above.

[[Susa]] was an ancient city (5500 B.C.E) even by the time of the Achaemenids. Susa became a part of the Achaemenid Empire in 539 B.C.E., and was expanded upon by Darius the Great with construction of Palace of Darius, and later development of palace of [[Artaxerxes II]]. The palace had a unique Apadana, resembling the one in Persepolis, except this hall was much larger than its Persepolis counterpart covering some 9,200 square meters.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Cyrus the Great chose Susa as a site for one of his fortifications creating a wall there that was significantly taller than older walls made by the Elamites. This choice might have been to facilitate the trade from [[Persian Gulf]] northward.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; What remains in way of structure from this once active capital, are five archaeological mounds, today located in modern Shush, in southwestern Iran, scattered over 250 hectares.&lt;ref name=man&gt;{{cite book|title=Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible|author1=David Noel Freedman |author2=Allen C. Myers |author3=Astrid B. Beck |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2000|pages=1258|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P9sYIRXZZ2MC&amp;pg=PA1258|isbn=9780802824004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural details===
Darius's design of his palace in Susa would resemble Persepolis structurally and aesthetically but would incorporate more of a local flair. The structure hosted a large hall of throne or ''Apadana'' similar to the [[Apadana]] of the Persepolis. This Susa version of Apadana would be composed of three [[porticoes]] at right angles to each other, one of which was closed in all three sides by the walls, and only open in its southward direction. The palace was decorated with reliefs in enameled terra-cotta of lions walking.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Intricate scenes depicting archers of king Darius would decorate the walls, as well as motifs of nature such as double-bulls, unicorns, [[fasciae]] curling into volutes, and palms disposed as a flower or a bell. The archers in particular depict a unique symbiosis of Persian, Ionian and Greek artistry of the time probably reflecting the origin of the artists who were originally hired by Darius the Great, and their personal reflections on the finished work.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Perhaps the most striking terra-cotta relief is that of the [[griffin]], depicting a winged creature resembling a lion with wings of an eagle (picture not shown here). The terra-cotta brick reliefs were decorated with lively dye colorations often giving them a lifelike quality.

===History===
Architecturally, the palace of Darius in Susa, was the epitome of the Persian architecture at the height of the empire's growth. Originally erected by Darius, and extensively renovated and modified by [[Artaxerxes II]], it was meant to reflect the same opulence and prestige as Persepolis. This was Darius the Great's attempt to decorate his summer capital of Susa and to show case its glory. French archaeologist [[Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy]] discovered the remnants of the palace of Darius, among the ruins of Susa producing the artifacts of this once magnificent structure now at display in the [[Louvre]] museum, France. He also wrote a series of architectural observations known as "''L'Art antique de la Perse''" which made a significant impression on the art community as to the intricacy of the Achaemenid architecture.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Art|author = Giulio Carotti|publisher=Duckworth &amp; Co|year=1908|pages=94–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-JLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dieulafoy and his wife Jane, made significant contributions in way of excavation, Susa remains were noted by many observers years before and were in fact officially noted by [[William Loftus|William K. Loftus]] in 1852.&lt;ref name=man/&gt;

Susa was a wealthy city by the time Alexander the Great invaded it, and it is said that he required 10,000 camels and 20,000 donkeys to carry away the treasures.&lt;ref name=Aedeen/&gt; For the most part the architectural wealth of Susa lies in its palaces, and ceremonial structures most of which have been eroded away by time or wear and tear. Today the most important remnants of the Achaemenid contribution to the architecture of ancient Susa are found in remnants of the Palace of Darius the Great in the original excavation site, or hosted in foreign nations' museums as Persian artifacts. Today the archaeological remains of the structure remain exposed to the elements, wear and tear, and human activity, and it seems that remains of Susa would be forever lost to the humankind, except perhaps for few selected pieces on display at the Louvre or foreign nations' museums.

Below are a few selected photos from the palace of Darius. The photo on the far left depicts the famous Archers' relief from the palace of Darius, from Susa. The second picture from the right, is a two-dimensional "[[lamassu]]" a mythical creature with wings of an eagle, head of a man, and body of a lion. The picture in the middle, is of the base of a column from the palace of Darius in Susa, inscribing in its rim, in three languages (Babylonian, Elamite, and Old Persian), that Darius, is the "great king of kings."

==Naqsh-e Rustam==
[[File:Naghsh-e rostam, Irán, 2016-09-24, DD 20-24 PAN.jpg|thumb|900 px|center|&lt;center&gt;A panorama of the [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] mountain complex&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Naqsh-e Rustam]] is an archaeological site located about 6 kilometers to the northwest of [[Persepolis]] in Marvdasht region in the Fars province of Iran.&lt;ref name=garthwaite&gt;{{cite book|title=The Persians|author =Gene Ralph Garthwaite|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2005|pages=51–55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FqzrZ3b8aakC&amp;pg=PA51|isbn=9781405144001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash-e Rustam acts as a [[necropolis]] for the Achaemenid kings, but is a significant historical entity in that it also housed ancient [[Elamite]] relief, as well as later relief by the [[Sassanid empire|Sassanid]] kings. Naqsh-e Rustam is not the actual name of this massive structure, but is the [[New Persian]] compound word composed of "Naqsh" meaning "face", or "facade", and "[[Rostam|Rustam]]" referring to the hero of the Persian epic [[Shahnameh]]. The [[Elamite]]s, [[Achaemenid]]s, and the [[Sassanid]]s lived centuries before the drafting of the Shahnameh by the Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]], and therefore the name is a misnomer, the result of the great amnesia of Persians about their ancient past, that settled over them after being conquered by the Arabs.&lt;ref name=paul&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Zarathustra: Across Iran and Central Asia to Find the World's First Prophet|author =Paul Kriwaczek|publisher=Random House, Inc|year=2004|pages=88–90|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YQ_yENnMpKQC&amp;pg=PA88|isbn=9780307426352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name therefore is a retrospective creation, due to lack of historical documents and lack of any inclusive knowledge of its origin. In ancient Persia, this structure would overlook the now long gone city of [[Istakhr]] easily accessible from Persepolis. Istakhr had a religious role as it was the place where Achaemenids held their reverence of the water goddess [[Anahita]]. The structure is carved into a native limestone rock mountain, and houses the burial chambers of [[Darius the Great]], [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I]], and [[Darius II]], all Achaemenid monarchs of Persia. There is also an incomplete tomb, as only its lower cruciform arm is carved out of the rock, while the rest is unfinished. It is speculated to belong to king [[Darius III]].&lt;ref name=garthwaite/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

The kings were interred behind a facade and [[rock relief]], that would resemble an accurate depiction of the king's own palace and its structural details. The accuracy of the facade and its association with the actual structure of the kings' palaces is so close that they almost produce a view of how the structures would have looked before time reduced them to remains; Tomb of Darius the Great, for instance mirrors his palace in [[Persepolis]], the "Tachar" even in scale and dimensions.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

The tombs are carved into the mountain's side, in form of a cross ([[Old Persian]]: ''chalipa''), depressed into the mountain's [[limestone]] background, and elevated from the ground. The relief which is found in the depressed cruciform is that which depicts the respective king's palace, and also depicts on its roof, the relief figure of the king praying, to [[Ahuramazda]] or what most believe is a reference to the [[Zoroastrian]] icon, [[Faravahar]].&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

One of the enigmatic features of the complex is a cubical, stone structure standing 12.5 meters tall, and around 7 meters wide, called the "[[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]]" translating to the "Cube of [[Zoroaster]]" believed to have been constructed during the Acahemenid era and modified and changed during the Sassanid era. The structure is cubical in base, with blind impressions on the side resembling windows, and a ruined staircase leading to a small door in the front leading to a completely empty interior.&lt;ref name=garthwaite/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; There are varied speculations as to its function discussed below.

The structure also once housed an ancient Elamite relief which has been almost entirely replaced by the Sassanid reliefs. Today but a figure of a man remains of the Elamite contribution to this mountain. The later Sassanids, also created their own historical signature on the structure, called the [[Naqsh-e Rajab]]. Though numerous and very detailed, the study of the [[Sassanid architecture|Sassanid architectural]] achievements sheds light on some of the architectural achievements during the second Persian empire's reign.

===Ka'ba-ye Zartosht===
[[File:Tour nagsh-e-rostam iran.jpg|thumb|left|A close up view of the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] ("Cube of Zoroaster") showing the stairs, the narrow opening, and the blind windows. Note its placement in a depression, as well as the unique rectangular markings on the façade]]

This enigmatic structure stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical shape and a square base (~ 22 feet in sides),&lt;ref name=james/&gt; constructed in what is essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on all but one of its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The structure's roof houses a minimal [[entablature]] of a repeating square pattern.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.

From one perspective, its proximity to the kings' tombs, and its simple design, is by some scholars thought to indicate that the cube was a Zoroastrian temple, and the Naqsh-e Rustam was more than a mere place for grieving of the deceased kings, but a grand festive center where crowds would gather on festive days to observe the king pray to [[Ahuramazda]], and bask in the structure's magnitude while praying to Ahuramazda.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; This would certainly be logical as the city was also adjacent to [[Istakhr]], a major religious and cultural center. The concept of the temple being used as a fire sanctuary, is however not likely because there is no general ventilation for smoke and gasses, and also that it differs so drastically, architecturally and aesthetically from other well known contemporary temple sites in [[Fars province|Pars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pasargadae: the oldest imperial capital|author =Ali Sami|publisher=Musavi Printing Office|year=1956|pages=90–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjUbAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curiously the design although unique, is not the only one of its kind. Located not far away from the Cube of Zoroaster, there exists in [[Pasargadae]], even to date, remnants of a structure that is very similar in its square shape and design to the "''Cube of Zoroaster''", called "''Zendan-i-Suleiman''."&lt;ref name=james/&gt; The name "Zendan-i-Suleiman,"  is a compound word composed of the words, "Zendan" which is Persian for "jail", and "Suleiman" which is a local Persian dialect name of the King [[Solomon]], translating to ''"Jail of Solomon."'' Structurally both "Jail of Solomon" and "Cube of Zoroaster" have the same cubic shape, and even resemble each other in the most minute of details, including facade, and dimensions. The name "Jail of Solomon" is of course a misnomer since Solomon never did erect this structure. The term must have come as a result of a Persian tactic advised by local Persians, to protect both [[Cyrus the Great]]'s [[Tomb of Cyrus|tomb]], and the surrounding structures including this temple, from invading Arabs' destruction, by calling the mausoleum, the "tomb of Solomon's mother" and the temple in Pasargadae, the "Jail of Solomon."&lt;ref name=elliot/&gt;

Just like the "Cube of Zoroaster", the function of the "Solomon's Jail" is not well understood. There are theories about the structures being used as a depository of objects of dynastic or religious importance as well as theories of it being a temple of fire.&lt;ref name=james/&gt; It should also be noted, that the structures as they exist today are not simply the work of the Achaemenid architects and have been modified, and improved by the Sassanids, who also used them for their festive, and political needs.

==Behistun inscription==

Carved high in [[Mount Behistun]] of [[Kermanshah]], one can find the Behistun inscription, a text etched into the stone of the mountain describing the manner in which Darius became the king of Persia, after the previous ruler ([[Cambyses II]]), and how he overthrew the [[magus]] usurper of the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The journal of sacred literature and Biblical record, Volume 3|author1=John Kitto |author2=Henry Burgess |author3=Benjamin Harris Cowper |publisher=A. Heylin|year=1856|pages=183–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qHUtAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this inscription Darius also details his [[satraps]] and delineates his position as the king and emperor of the Persian empire.

Architecturally speaking, the Behistun inscription is a massive project, that entailed cutting into the rough edge of the mountain in order to create [[bas-relief]] figures as seen in the pictures above. The Behistun mountain, rises up to some 1700 feet as part of the [[Zagros]] mountain chains in [[Iran]]. The mountain's location is ideal being close to both [[Ecbatana]] and [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The bas-relief itself is located some 300 feet above the base of the mountain. The figures represent two of the king's soldiers, the king himself standing over a fallen usurper and captives of several nations possibly dissidents, or co-conspirators. The inscription itself is written in [[cuneiform]] character in [[Old Persian]], [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]], and [[Medes|Median]].&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of the world from the earliest records to the present time: ancient history, Volume 1|author =Philip Smith|publisher=[[D. Appleton &amp; Company|D. Appleton]] |year=1865|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=elAPAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is interpreted and deciphered with the help of many intellectuals and scholars, but the [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]] is credited as being most critical in the process of deciphering the piece.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Part of why the understanding of the text is so vivid today is owed to Darius the Great himself, for he wrote the message of the inscription in three language, and so allowed the modern scholars to decipher one language and follow through the other two, since the message was essentially similar in all three forms. In this sense, the Behistun inscription is not only a significant architectural work, but also a significant linguistic tool, as important to the old world understanding of [[ancient Persia]] and its languages, as [[Rosetta Stone]] is to understanding [[ancient Egypt]] and its languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Darius the Great|author =J. Poolos|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2008|pages=38–9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K0EZK08VGXEC&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influences==
Elements of the Achaemenid style can be seen in contemporary [[Iranian architecture]]. Buildings built by the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], in particular, show extensive influence of Achaemenid architecture and art.

The '''American Schools of Oriental Research''' ('''ASOR'''), founded in 1900 as the '''American School of Oriental Study and Research in Palestine''', supports and encourages the study of the peoples and cultures of the [[Near East]], from the earliest times to the present. It is apolitical and has no religious affiliation. [[Susan Ackerman (biblical scholar)|Susan Ackerman]] has been President since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dartmouth Professor Leads Middle East Research Group|url=http://jewish.dartmouth.edu/news/dartmouth-professor-leads-middle-east-research-group|publisher=[[Dartmouth College]]|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;{{cite web|title=ASOR: History: The Early Years |url=http://www.asor.org/about/history.html |publisher=ASOR ]]|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASOR supports three independent overseas institutes:
* [[Albright Institute of Archaeological Research]], [[Jerusalem]], - former directors of which include [[Millar Burrows]] who was instrumental in the first publications of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]].
* Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute, [[Nicosia]].
* [[American Center of Oriental Research]], [[Amman]]. 
The overseas institutes support scholars working in the Middle East that focus on [[Near Eastern Archaeology]], [[Semitic languages]], [[history]], and [[Bible|Biblical]] studies. All institutes are also members of the [[Council of American Overseas Research Centers]].

==Annual conference==
ASOR convenes a scholarly conference once a year in North America, always beginning 8 days before [[Thanksgiving]] (on a Wednesday evening) and running through Saturday evening. 

2008 - [[Boston, MA]] and drew over 730 scholars and interested lay members from around the world. 

2009 - [[New Orleans, LA]].

2018 - [[Denver, CO]].

2019 - [[San Diego]], CA.

==Publications==
ASOR also publishes three  scholarly publications. Two of the journals are academic flagships in their respective areas: the ''[[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]]'' presents archaeological, historical, and epigraphic articles on topics from the ancient Near East, and the ''[[Journal of Cuneiform Studies]]'' presents articles in English, German, and French on Mesopotamian topics.  The organization also publishes ''[[Near Eastern Archaeology (journal)|Near Eastern Archaeology]]'', a quarterly that reports recent research for both popular and professional audiences.

An '''anal piercing''' is a [[body piercing]] in the surrounding area of the [[human anus]], usually the [[perineum]].&lt;ref name="Angel2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elayne Angel|title=The Piercing Bible: The Definitive Guide to Safe Body Piercing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83sjmTPnz48C&amp;pg=PA25|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|isbn=978-0-307-77791-1|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, piercing of the anal sphincter itself is rather rare. Some report difficulty cleaning the area after defecation and increases chances of infection.&lt;ref name="Angel2011"/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] the minimum age for an anal piercing is 16 enacted in the Sexual Offense Act of 2003.&lt;ref name="Allen2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Allen|title=Age Restricted Sales: The Law in England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GBDCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178|date=28 October 2015|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-78462-419-4|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, anal piercings have been used as a form of humiliation.&lt;ref name="Stoichita2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32218">A '''behaviour mutation''' is a genetic [[mutation]] that alters genes that control the way in which an organism behaves, causing their behavioural patterns to change.

A  [[mutation]] is a change or error in the [[Genome|genomic]] sequence of a cell.&lt;ref name="Futuyma 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |year=2009 |title=Evolution |edition=2nd |location=Sunderland |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-223-8}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur during [[meiosis]] or [[DNA replication|replication]] of [[DNA]], as well as due to [[Ionizing radiation|ionizing]] or [[UV radiation]], [[transposons]], [[Mutagen|mutagenic chemicals]], [[virus]]es and a number of other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2004.01.012 |title=Shaping bacterial genomes with integrative and conjugative elements |year=2004 |last1=Burrus |first1=Vincent |last2=Waldor |first2=Matthew K |journal=Research in Microbiology |volume=155 |issue=5 |pages=376–86 |pmid=15207870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |title=The molecular biology of cancer |year=2000 |last1=Bertram |first1=John S |journal=Molecular Aspects of Medicine |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=167–223 |pmid=11173079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1112699 |title=Pesticide Resistance via Transposition-Mediated Adaptive Gene Truncation in ''Drosophila'' |year=2005 |last1=Aminetzach |first1=Yael T. |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5735 |pages=764–7 |pmid=16051794 |last2=MacPherson |first2=J. Michael |last3=Petrov |first3=Dmitri A.|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..764A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations usually (but not always) result in a change in an organisms [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. These changes are largely deleterious, having a negative effect on fitness; however, they can also be neutral and even advantageous.&lt;ref name="Futuyma 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.6504S |jstor=25427413 |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in ''Drosophila'' |last1=Sawyer |first1=Stanley A. |last2=Parsch |first2=John |last3=Zhang |first3=Zhi |last4=Hartl |first4=Daniel L. |volume=104 |year=2007 |pages=6504–10 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701572104 |issue=16 |pmid=17409186 |pmc=1871816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is theorized that these mutations, along with [[Recombination (biology)|genetic recombination]], are the raw material upon which [[natural selection]] can act to form evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean B. |last2=Grenier |first2=Jennifer |last3=Weatherbee |first3=Scott |year=2005 |title=From DNA to Diversity: Molecular Genetics and the Evolution of Animal Design |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-1-4051-1950-4}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to selection's tendency to "pick and choose" mutations which are advantageous and pass them on to an organism's offspring, while discarding deleterious mutations. In [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] lineages, these mutations will always be passed on, causing them to become a crucial factor in whether the lineage will survive or go extinct.&lt;ref name="Futuyma 2009" /&gt;

One way that mutations manifest themselves is behaviour mutation. Some examples of this could be variations in mating patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/hdy.1989.52 |title=Effects of the ''hypoactive'' and ''inactive'' mutations on mating success in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' |year=1989 |last1=O'Dell |first1=Kevin |last2=Burnet |first2=Barrie |last3=Jallon |first3=Jean-Marc |journal=Heredity |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=373–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasingly aggressive or passive demeanor,&lt;ref name="Brunner et al 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.8211186 |title=Abnormal behavior associated with a point mutation in the structural gene for monoamine oxidase A |year=1993 |last1=Brunner |first1=H. |last2=Nelen |first2=M |last3=Breakefield |first3=X. |last4=Ropers |first4=H. |last5=Van Oost |first5=B. |journal=Science |volume=262 |issue=5133 |pages=578–80 |pmid=8211186|bibcode = 1993Sci...262..578B }}&lt;/ref&gt; how an individual learns and the way an individual interacts and coordinates with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolfer |first1=David P. |last2=Lipp |first2=Hans-Peter |journal=Experimental Physiology |pmid=11187958 |url=http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11187958 |title=Dissecting the behaviour of transgenic mice: Is it the mutation, the genetic background, or the environment? |date=2000-11-01 |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages=627–34 |doi=10.1017/S0958067000020959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviour mutations have important implications on the nature of the evolution of animal behaviour. They can help us understand how different forms of behaviour evolve, especially behaviour which can seem strange or out of place. In other cases, they can help us understand how important patterns of behaviour were able to arise – on the back of a simple gene mutation.&lt;ref name="Hamilton1964"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

== History ==
Ethology, the study of animal behaviour, has been a topic of interest since the 1930s. The pioneers of the field include great names such as Dutch biologist [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and Austrian biologists [[Karl von Frisch]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/sBIPH-004-0537-z |title=Instinct in the '50s: The British reception of Konrad Lorenz's theory of instinctive behavior |year=2004 |last1=Griffiths |first1=Paul E. |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=609–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tinbergen |first=Niko |title=The Animal in its World: Explorations of an Ethologist 1932–1972 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London |year=1973}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.05.002 |title=A gene mutation which changed animal behaviour: Margaret Bastock and the yellow fly |year=2007 |last1=Cobb |first1=Matthew |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=163–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the three won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973 for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1973 |publisher=Nobel Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first published demonstration of how a mutation in a single gene could change an organism's behaviour was carried out by [[Margaret Bastock]] in 1956, while she was a Ph.D. student working under Tinbergen at Oxford University.&lt;ref name="Cobb 2007" /&gt;

Bastock investigated the yellow mutant of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the common fruit fly. Upon comparison of courtship rituals in 19 yellow mutants and 19 wild types, wild types were noted to court 92% of the time, while yellow ones courted only 83% of the time. In addition, when the yellow mutants courted it took them noticeably longer than the wild types. Even after significant generations of crossing, the flies homozygous for the "yellow" allele were less successful in mating with wild type females than their heterozygous brothers. These results led Bastock to conclude that the origin of this deficient mating behaviour was the very same mutant gene that caused yellow discolouration.&lt;ref name="Bastock 1956" /&gt;

Bastock's work directly and indirectly influenced a new way of observing behaviour patterns and analyzing them, as well as changed the way we look at the evolution of these behavioural patterns in animals.&lt;ref name="Hamilton1964" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton1964a" /&gt; However, it was not until much later that her work was fully recognized and accredited in further studies on genes influencing animal behaviour.&lt;ref name="Cobb 2007" /&gt; [[Seymour Benzer]] worked further on ''D. melanogaster'' in the 1960s, focusing on different novel [[phenotypes]] such as [[phototaxis]] and [[circadian rhythms]].&lt;ref name="Benzer 1967"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1967PNAS...58.1112B |jstor=58086 |title=Behavioral Mutants of Drosophila Isolated by Countercurrent Distribution |last1=Benzer |first1=Seymour |volume=58 |year=1967 |pages=1112–9 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.58.3.1112 |pmid=16578662 |issue=3 |pmc=335755}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, J.C.

== Notable experiments ==
Behaviour mutations have been studied in a variety of animals, but most commonly in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' due to being able to produce large numbers with short generation time as well as a rich diversity of behaviours. Many tests have been used in drosophila by specifying behavioural mutations to further understand the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Benzer 1967"/&gt; In order to understand how behaviour is controlled by the nervous system, it's key to identify the neuronal substrates important for the specific activity studied, as well as to explain how they are incorporated into a functional circuit. Most tests used allowed researches to directly observe the mutation, such as altering [[phototaxis]] or flight-reduction. It was also shown in some experiments that certain mutations affect experience-based behaviour. Behavioural mutation has also been extensively tested in mice.

In one test involving ''Drosophila'', a temperature-sensitive allele of shibire is overexpressed in neuronal subsets using the [[GAL4/UAS system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/neu.1018 |title=Conditional modification of behavior inDrosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitiveshibire allele in defined neurons |year=2001 |last1=Kitamoto |first1=Toshihiro |journal=Journal of Neurobiology |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=81–92 |pmid=11291099}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shi gene is used for [[synaptic vesicle]] recycling, and a change in the temperature would cause an accelerated and reversible effect on the synaptic transmission of shi expressing neurons. When shi was tested to cholinergic neurons, the flies showed a quick response to the temperature and were paralyzed within two minutes at 30 degrees, which was reversible. When shi was expressed in [[photoreceptor cell]], fly larva showed temporary temperature-dependent blindness. This experiment shows that shi can be expressed in specific neurons to cause temperature-dependent alterations in behaviours. This research will further be helpful in studying the neuronal subsets in the behaviour of intact animals due to the reversible and controlled manner it is performed in.

In more recent studies the [[Zebrafish]] ennui mutation was identified from mutagenesis identification for defects in early behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/dneu.20569 |title=The zebrafishennui behavioral mutation disrupts acetylcholine receptor localization and motor axon stability |year=2008 |last1=Saint-Amant |first1=Louis |last2=Sprague |first2=Shawn M. |last3=Hirata |first3=Hiromi |last4=Li |first4=Qin |last5=Cui |first5=Wilson W. |last6=Zhou |first6=Weibin |last7=Poudou |first7=Olivier |last8=Hume |first8=Richard I. |last9=Kuwada |first9=John Y. |journal=Developmental Neurobiology |volume=68 |pages=45–61 |pmid=17918238 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homozygous ennui embryo swam more slowly than the wild-type but gained normal swimming as it aged. When tested, the motor output of the [[central nervous system]] following mechano-sensory stimulation was normal in ennui, which means that the reaction-time and reaction-style was normal to the wild-types and the [[motoneuron]] were not affected. The synaptic current at the neuromuscular junction was significantly reduced in ennui which means that the [[neuromuscular junction]] was affected. The [[acetylcholine receptor]] were significantly reduced in the adult ennui in size as well as localization at the [[myotome]] segment borders of fast-twitch muscles. [[Genetic mosaic]] analysis revealed that ennui is necessary cell autonomously in muscle fibers for normal synaptic localization of acetylcholine receptors. Also, ennui is very important for [[agrin]] function. Ennui is very important in nerve-dependent acetylcholine clustering and the stability of axon growth.

In mice, chemical mutagenesis is a phenotype-driven approach to map the mouse mutant catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Nolan |first1=P |last2=Peters |first2=J |last3=Vizor |first3=L |last4=Washbourne |first4=R |last5=Thornton |first5=C |last6=Glenister |first6=P |last7=Greenaway |first7=S |last8=Hewitt |first8=M |year=1999 |title=Systematic approaches to identifying novel behavioural mutations using ENU mutagenesis |conference=13th International Mouse Genome Conference |location=Philadelphia |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/126922/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of mice in behavioural mutation tests allows scientists to increase our understanding of the genetic basis of mammalian behaviour as well as applying this information to human [[neurological disorder]]s and [[psychiatric disorder]]s. [[SHIRPA]] is a hierarchal screening protocol that efficiently searches for mutations in muscle and lower [[Motor neuron#Function|motor neuron function]], [[Spinocerebellar]],|[[:en:Sensory neuron|sensory neuron]] function, [[neuropsychiatry]] function, and [[Autonomic nervous system#Function|autonomic nervous system function]]. The mice are then further tested for defects in parameters that are associated with human psychiatric disorders by using two well-known behaviour tests. The mice are tested for [[locomotor activity]] (LMA) as well as [[prepulse inhibition]] (PPI). For LMA, mice are placed in cages with beam-splitting monitors that will measure the activity of the mice as well as calculate their habituation to that environment.  LMA is recorded in 35-minute time spans in bins of a 5-minute duration. The PPI measures the acoustic startle response, which is an exaggerated response to an unexpected stimulus. The acoustic startle is measured over a range of frequencies and amplitudes to calculate the average response. These tests allow us to detect abnormal behaviours and document them.

== Behavioural degradation under spontaneous mutation accumulation ==

In each generation, the [[genetic variation]] within a population increases due to accumulation of [[mutation]]s and decreases in response to [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]]. Mutation accumulation occurs when mutations of small effect accumulate at certain [[Locus (genetics)|loci]], yielding a large phenotypic effect in the aggregate. Multiple genes may simultaneously affect behavioural traits. [[Mutation#Spontaneous mutation|Spontaneous mutations]] arise from sources including errors in [[DNA replication]], spontaneous lesions, and [[Transposable element|transposable genetic elements]] in the absence of [[mutagen]]s. Spontaneous mutations play a central role in the maintenance of genetic variation and persistence of natural population of many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173437 |title=Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation Studies in Evolutionary Genetics |year=2009 |last1=Halligan |first1=Daniel L. |last2=Keightley |first2=Peter D. |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=40 |pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01276.x |title=Fitness Recovery and Compensatory Evolution in Natural Mutant Lines of C. Elegans |year=2011 |last1=Estes |first1=Suzanne |last2=Phillips |first2=Patrick C. |last3=Denver |first3=Dee R. |journal=Evolution |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=2335–44 |pmid=21790579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologists have used mutation accumulation experiments, in which mutations are allowed to drift to fixation in [[inbred line]]s, to study the effect of spontaneous mutations on [[phenotype]] character. Phenotypic assays significantly determine whether and how quickly population with accumulated deleterious mutational loads can result in degradation of behavioural responses over time.&lt;ref name="Futuyma 2009"/&gt;

Based on laboratory experimental evolution with long-term mutation accumulation (MA) lines of the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a team of researchers at the [[University of Oregon]] investigated that mutation accumulation of behaviour is capable of generating significant levels of individual variation in ecologically relevant behavioural traits within populations. This variation will be dependent largely on the [[genetic structure]] and demographic characteristics of individuals. As a result, small or isolated populations are at high risk of experiencing behavioural degradation. For instance, the rate of mutation for behavioural traits has more effects for behavioural mutation within [[Captive breeding|captive populations]] and some [[endangered species]]. The study of two closely related behavioural traits of the free-living soil nematode [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']], [[chemotaxis]] and [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]], indicates that behavioural degradation is a direct source of competitive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] loss under genomic mutation accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.104.040014 |title=Behavioral Degradation Under Mutation Accumulation in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |year=2005 |last1=Ajie |first1=Beverly C. |journal=Genetics |volume=170 |issue=2 |pages=655–60 |pmid=15834141 |last2=Estes |first2=Suzanne |last3=Lynch |first3=Michael |last4=Phillips |first4=Patrick C. |pmc=1450389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Huey]] and his colleagues used the same MA lines method, suggesting that mutation accumulation in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' significantly depresses only some behavioural traits. There are several explanations for this. It is possible that traits are influenced only by few [[locus (genetics)|loci]] so that their mutational target is small. Alternatively, the values of the behavioural traits are not maximized by [[directional selection]], but rather are under the influence of [[stabilizing selection]]. Since behavioural traits are highly variable, mutation accumulation does not negatively affect all traits equivalently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/icb/43.3.387 |jstor=3884985 |title=Mutation Accumulation, Performance, Fitness |year=2003 |last1=Huey |first1=Raymond B. |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=387–95 |pmid=21680447 |last2=Gilchrist |first2=George W. |last3=Ward |first3=Kimiora |last4=Maves |first4=Lisa |last5=Pepin |first5=David |last6=Houle |first6=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex-ratio behaviour ===
The study of [[sex allocation]] has provided some of the most convincing tests of adaptive behaviour. Theory predicts that organisms can adjust the allocation of resources to male and female offspring in response to environmental conditions. [[Sex ratio]] behaviour is the sex ratio response of a female in various conditions. Mutation accumulation is important because it is one evolutionary cause that increases variation between individuals in sex-ratio behaviour. For example, female wasps can adjust their offspring sex ratios by choosing whether to fertilize an egg because they are [[haplodiploid]]. In particular, female ''Nasonia vitripennis'' produce less males when laying eggs alone, and more males when laying eggs on a patch with other females. If female parasitoid wasps produce too few male offspring, then some of the female offspring will remain unmated. On the other hand, if too many sons are produced, then resources are wasted that could have been used to produce more daughters. Females of other strains show no similar conditional sex ratio behaviours. Researchers find that these behaviours are indeed subject to genetic variation. However, genetic variation in natural population is low and it has low [[heritability]] as for other fitness-related traits. The observation of this type of behavioural mutation has been argued to pose a problem for sex-ratio theory because the mutations are likely to have decreased fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00434.x |title=Effects of Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation on Sex Ratio Traits in a Parasitoid Wasp |year=2008 |last1=Pannebakker |first1=Bart A. |last2=Halligan |first2=Daniel L. |last3=Reynolds |first3=K.

== Mutations affecting passive/aggressive characteristics ==
[[Aggression]] is a survival trait that can be favoured by [[Natural selection|Natural Selection]] in nearly any species. Aggressive individuals can be better able to compete for resources including food, territory and mates, as well as more successful in protecting themselves and their progeny from predators. It can also be energetically costly, and extreme or out of context aggression can be disadvantageous or deleterious, especially in social organisms.&lt;ref name="Edwards et al 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020154 |title=Quantitative Genomics of Aggressive Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster |year=2006 |last1=Edwards |first1=Alexis C. |last2=Rollmann |first2=Stephanie M. |last3=Morgan |first3=Theodore J. |last4=MacKay |first4=Trudy F. C. |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e154 |pmid=17044737 |pmc=1564424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggression is a complex trait that is regulated by many interacting genes and [[gene expression]] is highly variable depending on environment ([[phenotypic plasticity]]). Mutations in genes that influence aggressive behaviours can potentially increase aggression or [[deference|passivity]].

=== Neurotransmitters ===
[[Neurotransmitters]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] in particular, play an important role in the regulation of aggressive behaviours. Many studies are focused on genes that change the way neurotransmitters interact with receptors within the organism. For example, when individuals suffer from a mutation that causes them to have low levels of serotonin, there is an observed increase in impulsivity and depression&lt;ref name="Brunner et al 1993"/&gt; With neurotranmitters playing such a central role in the development of aggressive behaviour, it isn't surprising that many of the gene mutations that have been implicated with aggressive behaviours are involved in the breakdown and/or receipt of neurotransmitters.

Alexis Edwards and her team identified 59 mutations in 57 genes that affected aggressive behaviour in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.&lt;ref name="Edwards et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-7-29 |title=Mutations in many genes affect aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster |year=2009 |last1=Edwards |first1=Alexis C |last2=Zwarts |first2=Liesbeth |last3=Yamamoto |first3=Akihiko |last4=Callaerts |first4=Patrick |last5=MacKay |first5=Trudy FC |journal=BMC Biology |volume=7 |pages=29 |pmid=19519879 |pmc=2707370}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of their research showed that 32 of the mutants displayed increased aggression and 27 of the mutants displayed less aggression than the control group.  Several of the genes examined were found to affect [[nervous system]] development and function. Aggression was assessed in this experiment by depriving [[mutant]] Drosophila flies from food and then allowing them to defend a limited food source. The number of contest competitions between flies was recorded and compared to non-mutant flies to assess whether the mutants were more or less aggressive than the [[wild type]]. Examples of mutations that increase aggression are mutations in the [[Fruitless (gene)|''fruitless'']] or ''dissatisfaction'' genes which result in observable increases in male-male aggression.&lt;ref name="Edwards et al 2009"/&gt;

=== Amines ===

Mutations involving [[amines]] have been shown to be a prevalent source of changes in behaviour. A [[point mutation]] in the structural gene for [[Monoamine Oxidase A]], also known as MAO-A, is responsible for the breakdown of neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name="Brunner et al 1993"/&gt; This mutation is [[X-linked]], affecting only males, and eliminates the production of MAO-A. Males afflicted with this mutation are prone to mild mental retardation as well as violent and [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial behaviour]]. Another amine affecting aggression is [[β-alanine]] which is a bioamine neurotransmitter that has been implicated in Drosophila aggression. A mutation known as the ''black'' mutation causes reduced levels of β-alanine and results in less reactive flies than the wild type.

=== Testosterone ===
In nearly all species, there is an obvious disequilibrium between frequency and severity of aggression in males versus females.&lt;ref name="Jasnow et al 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2000.1604 |title=Short-Day Increases in Aggression Are Inversely Related to Circulating Testosterone Concentrations in Male Siberian Hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) |year=2000 |last1=Jasnow |first1=Aaron M. |last2=Huhman |first2=Kim L. |last3=Bartness |first3=Timothy J. |last4=Demas |first4=Gregory E. |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=102–10 |pmid=10964524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males are almost always the more aggressive sex and there are genetic differences that back up this observation. A common explanation for this phenomenon is the higher [[testosterone]] levels in males. Testosterone levels have a direct effect on neurotransmitter functioning contributing to physical aggression. Mutations affecting neurotransmitters, as stated above, are the dominanting cause of changes in aggressive behaviour. Another contributors to the unequal male-female aggression ratio are the sex-linked gene mutations that affect only male behaviour, such as MAO-A mentioned above. These mutations could be the reason why males are nearly always more aggressive than females, although, testosterone levels are a much more feasible explanation.

Other evolutionary and genetic explanations of violent behaviour include: dopamine receptors mutations, [[DRD2]] and [[DRD4]],&lt;ref name="Brunner et al 1993" /&gt; that, when mutate simultaneously, are hypothesized to cause [[personality disorders]], low serotonin levels increasing irritability and gloom&lt;ref name="Edwards et al 2006"/&gt; and the effects of testosterone&lt;ref name="Jasnow et al 2000" /&gt; on neurotransmitter functioning to explain the increased occurrence of aggression in males.

== Effects of mutations on mating ==
Behavioural mutations play a detrimental part towards the [[genome]]s of many species, however they can greatly affect the outcome of [[mating]]; affecting the success of fitness, how many offspring will arise and the likelihood that the male will actually procreate. When [[mutation]]s affect the mating habits of species, different traits that would otherwise benefit the species procreating are compromised.

A couple chemicals that are altered from mutation and have a great impact on mating, are [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]]. Each of these chemicals either has a reaction to how the animal acts, or how the species body is formed to benefit their mating success. An example of a mutation in serotonin was found in a species of [[Nematode]]s. The serotonin caused their tails to curl during mating, when the mutation occurred the tails did not curl. Without the curling of the tail the nematode was unlikely to find the hermaphrodites sex organs to procreate, and results in less of that nematodes sperm being spread to other offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loer |first1=Curtis M. |last2=Kenyon |first2=Cynthia J. |year=1993 |title=Serotonin-deficient mutants and male mating behavior in the nematode ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=8254383 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8254383 |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=5407–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is when the [[Dopamine receptor D1|D1 dopamine receptor]] has a mutation on it; the arousal of a ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is increased, which also increases the courtship of the animal.&lt;ref name="sdbonline"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Thomas B. |last1=Brody |title=Two different forms of arousal in Drosophila are oppositely regulated by the dopamine D1 receptor ortholog DopR via distinct neural circuits |year=1996 |work=The Interactive Fly |url=http://www.sdbonline.org/fly/aimain/6behavior.htm#Arousal}}{{self-published inline|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a study was found in the 'yellow' ''D.melanogaster'', the mating of these males was only beneficial when it was dark outside, or when they were in a dark environment. The mutation is not yet known why it occurs this way, but studies have mentioned that the females of this fly species may be turned off by the certain colour of the mutated fly, and therefore in the dark the female is less likely to tell what colour this fly is.&lt;ref name="sdbonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HeyJody"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Jody |editor1-last=Hey |editor2-first=Walter M. |editor2-last=Fitch |editor3-first=Francisco J. |editor3-last=Ayala |chapter=Drosophila mating behavior |chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11310&amp;page=308 |title=Systematics and the Origin of Species |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Academies Press |year=2005 |pages=308–31 |isbn=978-0-309-09536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beneficial component of a mutation in the behaviour of a mating ''D. melanogaster'', was when the mutation caused the male to have a longer courtship time period. The flies that had a longer courtship had a tendency to have a higher probability of procreating. This means that the fly that took longer to actually initiate the courtship with the female fly, was more likely to be successful with the female successfully accepting the male.&lt;ref name="HeyJody" /&gt;

{{Anthropology of art|Basic}}

'''Body culture studies''' describe and compare bodily practice in the larger context of [[culture]] and [[society]], i.e. in the tradition of [[anthropology]], [[history]] and [[sociology]]. As body culture studies analyse culture and society in terms of human bodily practices, they are sometimes viewed as a form of [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].
The significance of the body and of body culture (in German ''Körperkultur'', in Danish ''kropskultur'') was discovered since the early twentieth century by several historians and sociologists. During the 1980s, a particular school of body culture studies spread, in connection with – and critically related to – [[sport]]s studies. Body culture studies were especially established at Danish universities and academies and cooperated with Nordic, European and East Asian research networks.

Body culture studies include studies of [[dance]], play ([[play (activity)]]) and [[game]], outdoor activities, festivities and other forms of movement culture. The field of body culture studies is floating towards studies of medical cultures, of working habits, of [[gender]] and sexual cultures, of [[fashion]] and [[body decoration]], of popular [[festivity]] and more generally towards [[popular culture]] studies.

Body culture studies have shown useful by making the study of sport enter into broader historical and sociological discussion – from the level of subjectivity to civil society, state and market.

== Earlier studies in body and culture ==

Since early 20th century, sociologists and philosophers had discovered the significance of the body, especially [[Norbert Elias]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and some phenomenologists. Later, [[Michel Foucault]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and the Stuttgart [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] delivered important inspirations for the new body culture studies.

The sociologist Norbert Elias (1939) wrote the first sociology, which placed the body and bodily practice in its centre, describing the change of table manners, shame and violence from the Middle Ages to Early Modern court society as a process of civilisation. Later, Elias (1989) studied the culture of duel in Wilhelminian Prussia, throwing light on particular traits of the German [[sonderweg]]. Elias' figurational sociology of the body became productive especially in the field of sport studies (Elias/ Dunning 1986; [[Eric Dunning]] et al. 2004). His concept of the "process of civilisation" received, however, also critique from the side of comparative [[anthropology]] of bodily practices (Duerr 1988/2005).

The [[Frankfurt School]] of [[Critical Theory]] turned towards the body with [[Marxist]] and [[Freudian]] perspectives. [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (1947) described the Western "[[dialectics]] of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]" as including an underground history of the body. Body history lead from the living body to the dead body becoming a commodity under [[capitalism]]. A younger generation of the Frankfurt School launched the [[Neo-Marxist]] sports critique (Rigauer 1969) and developed alternative approaches to movement studies and movement culture (Lippe 1974; Moegling 1988). Historical studies about the body in industrial work (Rabinbach 1992), in transportation (Schivelbusch 1977), and in [[Fascist]] aesthetics ([[Theweleit]] 1977) as well as in the philosophy of [[space]] ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998/ 2004) had their roots in this critical approach.

Philosophical phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) paid attention to the body, too. [[Helmuth Plessner]] (1941) studied laughter and weeping as fundamental human expressions. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1945) placed the body in the centre of human existence, as a way of experiencing the world, challenging the traditional body-mind dualism of [[René Descartes]]. [[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) approached bodily existence via a phenomenology of the elements and of space, starting by "[[psychoanalysis]] of fire".

Based on phenomenological traditions, [[Michel Foucault]] (1975) studied the configurations of knowledge in the post-1800 society, launching the concept of modern panoptical control (→[[Panopticon]]). The body appeared as object of military discipline and of the panopticon as a mechanism of "the biopolitics of power". Foucault's approach became especially influential for studies in sport, space, and architecture (Vertinsky/ Bale 2004) as well as for studies in the discipline of [[gymnastic]] and sport ([[Vigarello]] 1978; Barreau/ Morne 1984; Vertinsky/ McKay 2004).

While Foucault's studies focused on top-down strategies of power, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] directed his attention more towards bottom-up processes of social-bodily practice. For analysing the class aspect of the body, Bourdieu (1966/67) developed the influential concept of habitus as an incorporated pattern becoming social practice by diverse forms of taste, distinction and display of the body. Some of Bourdieu's disciples applied these concepts to the study of sports and gymnastics (Defrance 1987).

In Germany, influences of phenomenology induced body culture studies in the historical field. The Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] focused from 1971 on [[gestures]] and laughter, [[martial arts]], sport and dance to analyze changes of society and differences between European and non-European cultures (Nitschke 1975, 1981, 1987, 1989, 2009; [[Henning Eichberg]] 1978).

These approaches met with tendencies of the late 1970s and 1980s, when [[humanities]] and [[sociology]] developed a new and broader interest in the body. Sociologists, historians, philosophers and anthropologists, scholars from sport studies and from medical studies met in talking about "the return of the body" or its "reappearance" (Kamper/ Wulf 1982). The new interest towards the body was soon followed up by the term "body culture" itself.

== The word and concept of "body culture" – alternative practice ==

The word "body culture" appeared for first time around 1900, but at that time signifying a certain form of physical practice. The so-called "life reform" (German ''[[Lebensreform]]'') aimed at the reform of clothing and of nurture and favoured new bodily activities, which constituted a new sector side by side with established gymnastics and sport. The main fields of this third sector of movement culture were [[nudism]], rhythmic-expressive gymnastics, [[yoga]] and [[body building]] (Wedemeyer-Kolwe 2004) as well as a new type of youth wandering. Though highly diverse, they found a comprehensive term in the German word ''Körperkultur'', in English [[physical culture]] (→[[physical education]]), in French ''culture physique'', and in Danish ''kropskultur''. Inspirations from the movement of body culture gave birth to early studies in the history of bodily positions and movements (Gaulhofer 1930; [[Marcel Mauss]] 1934).

In German Socialist workers' sport, the concept of ''Körperkultur'' had a prominent place. The concept also entered into Russian [[Socialism]] where ''fiskultura'' became an alternative to [[bourgeois]] sport, uniting the revolutionary fractions of more aesthetical ''[[Proletkult]]'' and more health-oriented "hygienism" (Riordan 1977). Later, [[Stalinism]] forced the contradictory terms under the formula "sport and body culture". This continued in the [[Soviet bloc]] after 1945.
When the 1968 [[student movement]] revived Marxism, the concept of body culture – ''Körperkultur'' in West Germany, "somatic culture" in America – re-entered into the sports-critical discourse, but received new analytical dimensions. ''Quel corps?'' (Which body?) was the title of a critical review of sports, edited by the French Marxist [[educationalist]] [[Jean-Marie Brohm]] in 1975-1997. In Germany, a series of books under the title ''Sport: Kultur, Veränderung'' (Sport: culture, change) marked the body cultural turn from 1981, with works of Rigauer, Elias, Eichberg and others.

== Body culture studies – a new critical school ==

In Denmark, a particular school of Body Culture Studies – ''kropskultur'' – developed since around 1980 in connection with the critique of sport (Korsgaard 1982; Eichberg 1998; Vestergård 2003; Nielsen 1993 and 2005). It had its background in Danish popular gymnastics and in alternative movement practices – outdoor activities, play and game, dance, [[meditation]]. In Finland, the concept ''ruumiinkulttuuri'' found a similar attention (Sironen 1995; Sparkes/ Silvennoinen 1999).

In international cooperation, "body anthropology" became the keyword for French, Danish and German philosophers, sociologists and educationalists who founded the ''Institut International d'Anthropologie Corporelle (IIAC)'' in 1987. They undertook case studies in traditional [[game]]s as well as in "scenes" of new urban body cultures (Barreau/ Morne 1984; Barreau/ Jaouen 1998; Dietrich 2001 and 2002).

Body culture studies found a particular interest in East Asian countries. In Japan, the sociologist Satoshi Shimizu from the University of Tsukuba established in 2002 a ''Centre for the Study of Body Culture'', publishing the review ''Gendai Sports Hyôron'' (Contemporary Sport Critique, in Japanese, since 1999). In Taiwan, Hsu I-hsiung from the National Taiwan Normal University founded in 2003 the ''Taiwan Body Culture Society'' (Taiwan shenti wenhua xiehui), publishing the reviews ''Sport Studies'' (in Chinese, since 2007) and ''Body Culture Journal'' (in Chinese, since 2005). And in Korea, Jong Young Lee from the University of Suwon published since 2004 the ''International Journal of Eastern Sport &amp; Physical Education'', focusing on body culture and traditional games.

These initiatives were connected with each other both by contents and by personal networks. In the English and American world, Allen Guttmann (1978, 1996, 2004), [[John Hoberman]] (1984), John Bale (1996, 2002, 2004), Susan Brownell (1995, 2008) and Patricia Vertinsky (2004) contributed by opening the history, sociology and geography of sports towards body culture studies.

While the concept of body culture earlier had denoted an alternative practice and was used in singular, it became now an analytical category describing body cultures in plural. The terms of physical culture (or [[physical education]]) and body culture separated – the first describing a practice, the second a subject of theoretical analysis.

== Questioning the "individual" body ==

Studies in body culture have shown that bodily existence is more than just "the body" as being an individual skin bag under control of an individual mind. Bodily practice happens between the different bodies. This questions current types of thinking "the [[individual]]": the [[epistemological]] [[individualism]] and the thesis of '[[Modern history#Late modern period|late-modern]] [[individualism|individualization]]'.

The methodological habit of counter-posing "the individual" and "the society" is largely disseminated in sociology. It was fundamentally criticized by [[Norbert Elias]] who underlined that there was no meaning in the separation between the individual as a sort of core of human existence and the society as a secondary environment around this core. Society was inside the human body. In contrast, the epistemological [[solipsism]] treated human existence as if the human being was alone in the world – and was only in a secondary process "socialized" ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998 vol. 1).

Another current assumption is the historical-sociological individualism. Sociologists as [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] have postulated that individualization during "high" or "late modernity" had replaced all earlier traditions – religion, nation, class – and left "the individual" alone with its body. The body, thus, got a central position as the only fix-point of "[[self-identity]]" left after the dissolution of the traditional norms. The individual chooses and makes its own body as a sort of "[[gesamtkunstwerk]] [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]".

Body-cultural studies have challenged this assumption ([[Henning Eichberg]] 2010: 58-79). They throw light on inter-bodily relations, within which the human individuality has a much more complex position.

== Social time ==

An important aspect of body culture is temporal. Modern society is characterized by the significance of speed and acceleration. Sport, giving priority to competitive running and racing, is central among the phenomena illustrating the specifically modern velocity (Eichberg 1978, Bale 2004). The historical change from the circulating stroll in aristocratic and early bourgeois culture to modern [[jogging]] as well as the changes from coach traffic via the railway (Schivelbusch 1977) to the sport race of automobiles (→[[auto racing]]) (Sachs 1984) produced new body-cultural configurations of social time.

On the basis of [[transportation]] and [[urbanism]], [[blitzkrieg]] and sports, the French architect and cultural theorist [[Paul Virilio]] (1977) launched the terms of "dromology" (i.e. science of racing) and "dromocracy" (power or dominance of velocity) to describe the knowledge and the politics of modern social acceleration. But the concept of social time embraces many more differentiations, which can be explored by comparing time-dynamic movements of different ethnic cultures (Hall 1984).

== Social space ==

Another important aspect of body culture is spatial. Bodily display and movement always create space – physical space as socio-psychical space and vice versa. Bodily activities have during history changed between indoor or outdoor milieus, between non-specialized environment, specialized facilities (→[[sports facilities]]) and bodily opposition against existing standardized facilities or what was called "sport scape". In movement, straight lines and the culture of the streamline were confronted by [[mazes]] and [[labyrinthine]] structures, by patterns of [[fractal]] geometry. All these patterns are not just spatial-practical arrangements, but they play together with societal orientations. Under this aspect, one has described the history of panoptical control (Foucault 1975; Vertinsky/ Bale 2004), the parcellation of the sportive space, and the hygienic purification of spaces (Augestad 2003). [[Proxemics]] (Hall 1966), the study of distance and space, has become a special field of body culture studies.

Body culture studies have also influenced the understanding of "nature". In the period around 1800, the "nature" of body culture – of outdoor life, [[naturism]] and green movements (→[[green politics]]) – became a world of liberation and opposition: "Back to nature!" In the course of modern industrial culture, this "other" nature became subjected to colonization and simulation, forming a "second nature". It even became a virtual world, which is simulating people's senses as a "third nature". The study of body culture contributed to a history of [[cultural ecology]] (Eichberg 1988).

Body cultural studies also contributed to a differentiation between what in everyday language often is confused as 'space' and 'place' whose dialectics were shown by the Chinese-American philosopher [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] (see Bale 2004). Space can be described by coordinates and by certain [[choreographies]]. Spatial structures can be standardized and transferred from place to place, which is the case with the standardized facilities of sports. Place, in contrast, is unique – it is only here or there. Locality is related to identity. People play in a certain place – and create the place by play and game. The place plays with the people, as a co-player.

== Body culture and politics ==
Body culture can also be considered political such as how the [[body shape]] and appearance as well as sports, dance, and other recreational activities manifest and influence social change driven by politics. This is best demonstrated by [[practice theory]], which explains that, since body techniques serve as the means by which existing social order is produced and maintained, it, therefore, become important sites for challenging and transforming the social order when change does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Training the Body for China: Sports in the Moral Order of the People's Republic|last=Brownell|first=Susan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0226076466|location=Chicago|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In power plays, for instance, the body is used in sporting events as a form of rhetoric, articulating political causes. Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, the body became an important part of [[George W. Bush]]'s [[geopolitics]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Politics of Post-9/11 American Sport: Power, Pedagogy and the Popular|last=Silk|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415873413|location=New York|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the projection of American power. On the other hand, the body was also used to condemn elitist and spectator sport within a mass physical culture starting this period in America, which evokes participation, inclusion, and populism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body is an integral component in the [[Feminist political theory|feminist politics]]. It is maintained that in order for this feminist initiatives to be effective, it is imperative that women's bodies, along with their works, labor, and voice, are present for everyone to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Body in Western Culture: Contemporary Perspectives|last=Suleiman|first=Susan|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=0674298713|location=Cambridge|pages=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilisation, discipline, modernity ==

Studies of body culture enriched the analysis of historical change by conflicting terms. [[Norbert Elias]] (1986) studied sport in order to throw light on the ''civilizing process'' (→[[The Civilizing Process]]). In sports, he saw a line going from original violence to civilized interlacement and pacification. Though there were undertones of hope, Elias tried to avoid [[evolutionism]], which since the nineteenth century postulated a 'progressive' way from 'primitive' to 'civilized' patterns.

While the concept of civilization normally had hopeful undertones, ''[[discipline]]'' had more critical undertones. Cultures of bodily discipline became visible – following [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and the [[Frankfurt School]] – in [[Baroque dance]] (Lippe 1974), in aristocratic and bourgeois pedagogy of the spinal column during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Vigarello 1978), and in [[hygienic]] strategies, school sanitation and school gymnastics during the twentieth century (Augestad 2003). Military exercise (→[[military drill]]) in Early Modern times was the classic field for body cultural discipline (Gaulhofer 1930; Kleinschmidt 1989).

In the field of sports, a central point of body-cultural dispute has been the question whether sport had its roots in Ancient Greek competitions of the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] type or whether it was fundamentally linked to modernity. While nineteenth century's Neo-Humanism, Classicism and [[Olympism]] assumed the ancient roots of sport, body cultural studies showed that the patterns central to modern sports – quantification, rationalisation, principle of achievement – could not be dated before the industrial culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). What was practiced before, were popular games, noble exercises, festivities of different character, children's games and competitions, but not sport in modern understanding. The emergence of modern sport was an eruptive innovation rather than a logical prolongation of earlier practices. As a revolution of body culture, this transformation contributed to a deeper understanding of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The so-called Eichberg-Mandell-Guttmann theory about the uniqueness of modern sport became, however, a matter of controversies and was opposed by other historians (Carter/Krüger 1990).

What came out of the controversies between the concepts of modernity, evolution, civilization, discipline and revolution was that "[[modernization]]" only can be thought as a non-lineal change with nuances and full of contradictions. This is how the history of sport (Nielsen 1993 and 2005) and of gymnastics (Defrance 1987; Vestergård Madsen 2003) as well as the history of [[running]] (Bale 2004) have been described in body-cultural terms.

One of the visible and at the same time deeper changes in relation to the modern body concerns the dress reform and the appearance of the naked body, especially in the years between 1900 and the 1920s. The change from noble pale skin to suntanned skin as a 'sportive' distinction was not only linked to sport, but had a strong impact on society as a whole. The change of appreciated body colour reversed the social-bodily distinctions between people and classes fundamentally, and nudism became a radical expression of this body-cultural change.

== Industrial body and production ==

Body culture studies have cast new light on the origins and conditions of the Industrial Revolution, which in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries transformed people's everyday life in a fundamental way. The traditional common-sense explanations of [[industrialization]] by technology and economy as 'driving forces' have shown as insufficient. Economic interests and technological change had their basic conditions in human social-bodily practice. The history of sport and games in body cultural perspective showed that this practice was changing one or two generations, before the Industrial Revolution as a technological and economic transformation took place. What had been [[carnival]]-like festivities, [[tournaments]] and popular games before, became modern sport by a new focus on results, measuring and quantifying records (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). Under the aspect of the principle of achievement, there was no sport in ancient Egypt, in ancient Greece, among the [[Aztecs]] or [[Vikings]], and in European [[Middle Ages]], though there were games, competitions and festivities. Sport as a new type of body culture resulted from societal changes in the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries.

The genesis of sport in connection with industrial [[productivity]] called to attention the historical-cultural relativity of "production" (→[[Manufacturing]]) itself. Studies in the history of "the human motor" and the "mortal engines" of sport showed reification (→[[reification (Marxism)]]) and technology as lines of historical dynamics (Rigauer 1969; Vigarello 1988; Rabinbach 1992; Hoberman 1992). Production became apparent not as a universal concept, but as something historically specific – and sport was its body-cultural ritual.

== Trialectics of body culture ==

Body culture as a field of contradictions demands a dialectical approach, but it is not dualistic in character. Body culture studies have revealed trialectical relations inside the world of sports (Eichberg 1998, 2010; Bale 1996, 2002 and 2004).

The hegemonic model of Western modern body culture is ''achievement sport'', translating movement into records. Sportive competition follows the logic of productivity by bodily strain and forms a ranking pyramid with elite sports placed at the top and the losers at the bottom. Through sportive movement, people display a theatre of production.

A contrasting model within modern body culture is delivered by ''mass sports''. In [[gymnastics]] and [[fitness training]], the body is disciplined by subjecting it to certain rules of "scientific", social geometrical or aesthetic order (Roubal 2007). By rhythmic repetition and formal homogenization, the individual bodies are integrated into a larger whole, which is recommended in terms of reproduction (→[[reproduction (economics)]]), as being healthy and educative. Through fitness sport, people absolve a ritual of reproductive correctness and integration.

A third model is present in ''popular festivity'', ''dance and play''. In carnival and folk sport, people meet people by festive movement. This type of gathering may give life to the top-down arrangements of both productive achievement sport and reproductive fitness sport, too. But the body experience of popular festivity, dance, play and game is a-productive in itself – it celebrates relation in movement.

Practices of sport in their diversity and their historical change, thus, clarify inner contradictions inside social life more generally – among these the contradictions between state, market and civil society. The trialectics of body culture throw light on the complexity of societal relations.

== Body cultures in plural ==

"Culture" in singular is an abstraction. The study of body culture is always a study of body cultures in plural. Body cultures show human life in variety and differences, assimilation and distinction, conflicts and contradictions. This demands a comparative approach to otherness, and this is the way several studies in body culture have gone.

Culture was studied as cultures already by the school of [[Cultural Relativism]] in American anthropology ([[American Anthropological Association]]) in the 1930s ([[Ruth Benedict]]). [[Postcolonial]] studies have taken this [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] perspective up again (Bale 1996 and 2004; Brownell 1995; Azoy 2003; Leseth 2004). The discourse in singular about "the body in our society" became problematic when confronted with body cultures in conflict and tension.

The plurality and diversity of body cultures is, however, not only a matter of outward relations. There are also body cultures in plural inside a given society. The study of different class habitus (→[[class culture]]), [[youth cultures]], gender cultures (→[[gender identity]]) etc. opened up for deeper insights into the differentiation of civil society.

== Configurational analysis ==

Body culture studies try to understand bodily practice as patterns revealing the inner tensions and contradictions of a given society. In order to analyze these connections, the study of body culture has turned attention to the configurations of movement in time and space, the energy of movement, its interpersonal relations and objectification (→[[Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)]]). Above this basis, people build a superstructure of institutions and ideas, organising and reflecting body culture in relation to collective actions and interests (Eichberg 1978; Dietrich 2001: 10-32; see keyword 2).

By elaborating the complex interplay between bodily practice and the superstructures of ideas and conscience, body cultures studies challenge the established history and sociology.

'''''Bowers v. Hardwick''''', 478 U.S. 186 (1986), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that upheld, in a 5–4 ruling, the constitutionality of a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[sodomy law]] criminalizing [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] in private between consenting adults, in this case with respect to homosexual sodomy, though the law did not differentiate between homosexual sodomy and heterosexual sodomy.&lt;ref name="decision"&gt;{{ussc|name=Bowers v. Hardwick|478|186|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This case was overturned in 2003 in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.

The majority opinion, by Justice [[Byron White]], reasoned that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] did not confer “a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy”.&lt;ref name="decision"/&gt; A concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] cited the “ancient roots” of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting [[William Blackstone]]’s description of homosexual sex as an “infamous crime against nature”, worse than rape, and “a crime not fit to be named”. Burger concluded: “To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.”&lt;ref name="concurrence"/&gt; Justice [[Lewis F. Powell]] later said he regretted joining the majority, but thought the case of little importance at the time.

The senior dissent, by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy. Blackmun's dissent accused the Court of an “almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity" and an “overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases”. In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality, Blackmun wrote: “That certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry. The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine.”&lt;ref name="blackmun-dissent"&gt;''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 211 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen years after ''Bowers v. Hardwick'', the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;{{ussc|name=Lawrence v. Texas|volume=539|page=558|pin=|year=2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and held that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional.

==Background==
In early July 1982, [[Atlanta Police Department (Georgia)|Atlanta police]] officer Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a citation for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle into a trash can outside the gay bar where he worked, allegedly observing him violating the city's ordinance that prohibits drinking in public.&lt;ref name=nussbaum&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195305319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a clerical error on the citation issued by Torick, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying a $50 fine at a court office, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's house three weeks later, on August 3, to serve the now-invalid warrant.&lt;ref name=eskridge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eskridge|first1=William N.|title=Sodomy Laws in America, 1861-2003|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|pages=232–234|isbn=9780670018628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murdoch and Price"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murdoch|first1=Joyce|last2=Price|first2=Deb|title=Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians V. The Supreme Court|date=2002|publisher=Basic Books|pages=277–280|isbn=9780465015146}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, an unrelated guest of Hardwick was sleeping on the couch in Hardwick's living room; at around 8:30 am, Officer Torick entered the house (the front door may have been ajar) and awoke the guest, then proceeded down a hallway towards Hardwick's bedroom.&lt;ref name="nussbaum"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt; The officer opened the bedroom door, and Torick observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=278}}

Hardwick was angry at the intrusion and threatened to have Torick fired for entering his home. Torick later stated that he "would never have made the case if [Hardwick] hadn't had an attitude problem."&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt; Torick then arrested both men for [[sodomy]], a felony under Georgia law that carried a sentence of one to twenty years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Code Ann. § 16-6-2 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; District Attorney Lewis Slaton chose not to prosecute the sodomy charge, considering that the warrant had expired, and his own belief that the sodomy law should not be used to prosecute consensual sexual activity.&lt;ref name=eskridge/&gt;

Hardwick then sued [[Mike Bowers|Michael Bowers]], the [[attorney general]] of Georgia, in federal court for a [[declaratory judgment]] that the state's sodomy law was invalid. He charged that as a non-celibate gay man, he was liable to eventually be prosecuted for his activities. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had been searching for a “perfect test case” to challenge anti-sodomy laws, and Hardwick's cause presented the one they were looking for.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=279}} They approached Hardwick, who agreed to be represented by ACLU attorneys.

In the lower federal courts, Hardwick was represented by attorney Kathleen Wilde. The case was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]], where it was dismissed, with the Court ruling in favor of Bowers. Hardwick appealed, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] reversed the lower court, finding that the Georgia sodomy statute was indeed an infringement upon Hardwick's Constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hardwick v. Bowers |vol=760 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1202 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=1985 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/760/1202/75648/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Georgia then appealed, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] granted [[certiorari]] on November&amp;nbsp;4, 1985, to review the case.

Hardwick was represented before the Supreme Court by [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Laurence Tribe]]. Michael Hobbs, assistant attorney general, argued the case for the State. The legality of the officer's entry into Hardwick's home was not contested; only the constitutionality of the sodomy statute was challenged.

A heterosexual married couple was initially named in the suit as plaintiffs [[John Doe|John and Mary Doe]], alleging that they wished to engage in sodomy but were prevented from doing so by the Georgia anti-sodomy law.&lt;ref name="decision" /&gt; But they failed to obtain [[Standing (law)|standing]] and were dropped from the suit.&lt;ref name="decision" /&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court issued a 5-4 ruling upholding the sodomy laws. Justice [[Byron White]] wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices [[William Rehnquist]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Warren E. Burger]], and [[Lewis F. Powell]]. Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] wrote a dissent joined by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and [[John Paul Stevens]]. Stevens also wrote a dissent joined by Brennan and Marshall.

===Majority opinion===
The issue in ''Bowers'' involved the right of [[privacy]]. Since 1965's ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'',&lt;ref name=Griswold&gt;{{ussc|name=Griswold v. Connecticut|volume=381|page=479|pin=|year=1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court had held that a right to privacy was implicit in the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In ''Bowers'', the Court held that this right did not extend to private, consensual sexual conduct, at least insofar as it involved homosexual sex. The majority opinion in ''Bowers'', written by Justice [[Byron White]], framed the legal question as whether the constitution confers “a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.” The opinion answered this question in the negative, stating that “to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’ is, at best, facetious.”

Justice White added a [[slippery slope]] warning about undesirable potential implications for other sex laws: &lt;blockquote&gt;And if respondent's submission is limited to the voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults, it would be difficult, except by fiat, to limit the claimed right to homosexual conduct [p196] while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, incest, and other sexual crimes even though they are committed in the home. We are unwilling to start down that road.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chief Justice Burger's concurrence===
The short concurring opinion by Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] emphasized historical negative attitudes toward homosexual sex, quoting Sir [[William Blackstone]]’s characterization of sodomy as “a crime not fit to be named”.&lt;ref name="concurrence"&gt;''Bowers'', 478 U.S. at 197 (Burger, C.J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Burger concluded, “To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.”

===Justice Powell's concurrence===
In a concurring opinion, Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] joined the majority opinion in upholding the law against a substantive due process attack. But he voiced doubts about the compatibility of Georgia's law with the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], noting that even consensual sodomy could be punished with up to twenty years in prison, the same sentence as aggravated battery or first-degree arson. However, since Hardwick had not been tried or sentenced, the question of the statute's constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment did not come up in the case.

Powell was considered the deciding vote during the case. He had initially voted to strike down the law but changed his mind after conservative clerk [[Michael W. Mosman]] advised him to uphold the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-9252-domestic_partner_decision_revisiting_old_wounds.html Domestic Partner Decision: Revisiting Old Wounds?], ''Willamette Week''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that Powell's decision to uphold the law was influenced by his belief that he had never known any [[homosexual]]s, even though one of his own law clerks was gay.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lazarus|Lazarus, Edward]]. ''[[Closed Chambers]]: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court,'' p. 386. “At the ''Bowers'' conference, Powell told his colleagues that he had ‘never met a homosexual’.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Extreme Makeover: The story behind the story of Lawrence v. Texas |author=Dahlia Lithwick |date=12 March 2012 |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/03/12/120312crbo_books_lithwick?google_editors_picks=true |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But that clerk has said that Powell had met his boyfriend, and that Powell had asked him about the mechanisms of homosexual sex when deciding the case. He felt that Powell had made the remark in order to avoid revealing that one of his clerks was gay at a time when such a revelation could have destroyed that clerk's future legal career. Journalists have since found that Powell hired more gay law clerks than any of the other justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exhibit ''A'' for a Major Shift: Justices’ Gay Clerks |date=June 10, 2013 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/us/exhibit-a-for-a-major-shift-justices-gay-clerks.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=recg |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissents===

====Justice Blackmun's dissent====
A sharply worded dissenting opinion by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] attacked the majority opinion as having an "almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity". Blackmun wrote, "Only the most willful blindness could obscure the fact that sexual intimacy is 'a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality{{'-}}” (ironically quoting from Burger's opinion in ''[[Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton]]'', which held that obscene films are not constitutionally protected). The dissent compared the majority opinion to that in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Minersville School District v. Gobitis|volume=310|page=586|pin=|year=1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was reversed by the Court after only three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette|volume=319|page=624|pin=|year=1943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmun revealed in a 1995 [[oral history]] with [[Harold Hongju Koh|Harold Koh]] that his dissent in ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' was written primarily by [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/groups-push-for-first-gay-justice-022106|title=Groups push for first gay justice|work=POLITICO|date=2009-05-05|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/stanford-law-professor-pam-karlan-concludes-2006-acs-national-convention|title=Stanford Law Professor Pam Karlan Concludes 2006 ACS National Convention {{!}} ACS|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en|date=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pamela S. Karlan|Pamela Karlan]] (then Blackmun's clerk and now a professor of law at [[Stanford Law School]]). Blackmun said of the dissent, "Karlan did a lot of very effective writing, and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out. She felt very strongly about it, and I think is correct in her approach to it. I think the dissent is correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_04_17-2005_04_23.shtml#1114025448 |title=The Volokh Conspiracy |publisher=Volokh.com |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Justice Stevens's dissent====
Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote a separate dissent that focused on the selective enforcement of the law against homosexuals. The Georgia statute could not be applied to married heterosexuals, as consensual sexual activity within the bounds of marriage was protected under ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.&lt;ref name=Griswold/&gt; Nor could the law be applied to unmarried heterosexuals, as ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Eisenstadt v. Baird|volume=405|page=438|pin=|year=1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried people. Since heterosexuals could never be prosecuted for sodomy, Georgia should have the burden of proving that selective enforcement against homosexuals was constitutional.

====Subsequent findings====
According to Daniel Richman, former law clerk for Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], Marshall's friendship with [[civil rights]] leader [[Bayard Rustin]] and Rustin's openness about his homosexuality played a significant role in Marshall's decision to join both dissents. Richman also recalled that Marshall thought that the case was a "no-brainer", and told Richman, who wrote a bench memo for Marshall on the case, that "this [case] is controlled by [[Stanley v. Georgia|''Stanley'']]".{{sfn|Murdoch and Price|p=292}}

==Subsequent events==

===Jurisprudence===
''Bowers'' was decided at a time when the court's privacy jurisprudence, and in particular the right to abortion recognized in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|volume=410|page=113|pin=|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had come under heavy criticism. ''Bowers'' signaled a reluctance by the Court to recognize a general constitutional right to privacy or to extend such a right further than they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Franke |first=Katherine |title=Dignifying Rights: A Comment on Jeremy Waldron's 'Dignity, Rights, and Responsibilities' |url=http://www2.law.columbia.edu/faculty_franke/Dignifying%20Rights%20%28Final%20Proof%29.pdf |publisher=Columbia Law School |accessdate=12 June 2013 |page=1188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia law upheld in ''Bowers'' criminalized oral sex and anal sex whether engaged in by people of the same sex or different sexes, but White's decision was restricted to homosexual sex. “The only claim properly before the Court, therefore, is Hardwick’s challenge to the Georgia statute as applied to consensual homosexual sodomy. We express no opinion on the constitutionality of the Georgia statute as applied to other acts of sodomy.” State sodomy laws were seldom enforced against private, consensual conduct in the decades following the decision, though many courts and state governments interpreted it to justify a wide variety of bans and limitations on the lives of [[gay]] people.&lt;ref name="keen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Strangers to the Law: Gay People on Trial |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/keen-law.html |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Lisa Keen |author2=Susanne B. Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bowers'' was used to deny suspect class qualification to gays and lesbians, thus restricting the standard of review to rational basis. Although ''Bowers'' was later overruled, decisions based on it, such as ''[[High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office |vol=895 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=563 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1990 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/895/563/46921/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes still cited as precedent in gay rights cases.

===Justice Powell's later comments===
In 1990, three years after retiring from the Court, Powell told a group of [[New York University]] law students that he considered his opinion in ''Bowers'' an error. “I do think it was inconsistent in a general way with ''Roe''. When I had the opportunity to reread the opinions a few months later I thought the dissent had the better of the arguments."&lt;ref name = shilts&gt;Shilts, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; But Powell believed the case was one of little importance and in 1990 said he hadn't devoted thirty minutes to thinking about it since the ruling.{{sfn|Murdoch and Price}}

===Repeal of state sodomy laws===
In the years after ''Bowers'' was decided, several state legislatures repealed their sodomy laws. In addition, a number of state courts invalidated sodomy laws under privacy or other provisions of their state constitutions. The same sodomy law that was upheld in ''Bowers'' was struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court under the Georgia state constitution in the case of ''[[Powell v. Georgia|Powell v. State]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Powell v. State |vol=270 |reporter=Ga. |opinion=327 |pinpoint= |court=Ga. |date=1998 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1338934/powell-v-state/ |accessdate=2018-05-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keen"/&gt;

====''Lawrence v. Texas''====
The remaining 13 state sodomy laws in the U.S. were invalidated, insofar as they applied to private consensual conduct among adults, by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref name=Lawrence/&gt; which explicitly overturned ''Bowers''. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas|Lawrence]]'', ruling that Texas's state sodomy law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause (adult consensual sexual intimacy in one's home is a vital interest in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause). Kennedy wrote: “''Bowers'' was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' should be and now is overruled.”&lt;ref&gt;''Lawrence'', 539 U.S. at 578.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media portrayal===
[[Bill Moyers]] discussed the decision at length in an interview with Blackmun on the episode "Mr. Justice Blackmun" of the 1987 Constitutional bicentennial documentary miniseries ''In Search of the Constitution''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://billmoyers.com/content/mr-justice-blackmun-supreme-court/ Mr. Justice Blackmun (April 16, 1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a play based on the life of Michael Hardwick and the judicial proceedings, ''Sodomy Rules: The Bowers v. Hardwick Trial'', was written and performed by Bill Crouch in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carol Polcovar and Festival Participants: Fresh Fruit Festival, June 28, 2009|url=http://www.nytheatre.com/Content/Interview/freshfruit|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130062125/http://www.nytheatre.com/Content/Interview/freshfruit|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 30, 2013|publisher=nytheater.com|accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
The last name of the satirical character Betty Bowers, played by [[Deven Green]], is taken from this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

===Hastening LGBTQ rights advocacy===
The decision was a watershed moment in LGBTQ rights, leading to renewed organizing, and directly to the formation of advocacy groups such as [[PROMO]].

'''Buddhist religious architecture''' developed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Three types of structures are associated with the [[sacred architecture|religious architecture]] of [[early Buddhism]]: monasteries ([[vihara]]s), places to venerate relics ([[stupa]]s), and shrines or prayer halls ([[chaitya]]s, also called ''chaitya grihas''), which later came to be called temples in some places.

The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The earliest surviving example of a stupa is in [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]).

In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (prayer halls). These are exemplified by the complexes of the [[Ajanta Caves]] and the [[Ellora Caves]] ([[Maharashtra]]). The [[Mahabodhi Temple]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] in [[Bihar]] is another well-known example.

The [[Pagoda]] is an evolution of the Indian stupa.

==Early development==
[[File:Sanchi1 N-MP-220.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Stupa in [[Sanchi]] ]]
[[File:Sanchi_temple_17.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gupta period]] temple at Sanchi besides the Apsidal hall with  [[Maurya]] foundation ]]
A characteristic new development at Buddhist religious sites was the [[stupa]]. Stupas were originally more sculpture than building, essentially markers of some holy site or commemorating a holy man who lived there. Later forms are more elaborate and also in many cases refer back to the Mount Meru model.

One of the earliest Buddhist sites still in existence is at [[Sanchi]], India, and this is centred on a stupa said to have been built by [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] (273–236 BCE). The original simple structure is encased in a later, more decorative one, and over two centuries the whole site was elaborated upon. The four cardinal points are marked by elaborate stone gateways.

As with [[Buddhist art]], architecture followed the spread of Buddhism throughout south and east Asia and it was the early Indian models that served as a first reference point, even though Buddhism virtually disappeared from India itself in the 10th century.

Decoration of Buddhist sites became steadily more elaborate through the last two centuries BCE, with the introduction of tablets and friezes, including human figures, particularly on stupas. However, the Buddha was not represented in human form until the 1st century CE. Instead, aniconic symbols were used. This is treated in more detail in [[Buddhist art]], Aniconic phase. It influenced the development of temples, which eventually became a backdrop for Buddha images in most cases.

As Buddhism spread, Buddhist architecture diverged in style, reflecting the similar trends in Buddhist art. Building form was also influenced to some extent by the different forms of Buddhism in the northern countries, practicing [[Mahayana]] Buddhism in the main and in the south where [[Theravada]] Buddhism prevailed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">The '''Central Economic Mathematical Institute''' ({{lang-ru|Центральный экономико-математический институт (ЦЭМИ)}}) of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] is an economic research institute located in [[Moscow]]. It focuses on economic theory, mathematical economics and [[econometrics]]. The CEMI was established in 1963 as an institute of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], superseding the ''Laboratory of Economics and Mathematical Methods'' which had been founded by [[Vasily Sergeevich Nemchinov]] in 1958. In 1964 a branch of the institute was created in [[Tallinn]], and in 1966 [[Leningrad]] branch was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/rus/index0.htm How CEMI Was Created] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622022515/http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/rus/index0.htm |date=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"When the Institute was founded in 1963, is main goal was an "introduction on the mathematical methods and computers in the practice of planning, creation of the theory of the optimal control of the national economy".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from [http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/about/how/?section=about_link official website].&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the initial founding vision of the Institute was more ambitious. Of six founding research objectives mentioned by Fedorenko in his 1964, three of them directly bore on the "development of a unified system of economic information", the "design and creation of a unified state network of computer centers", and "Derivation of specialized planning and management systems based on mathematical methods and computer technology." Although its failure has since obscured this history, the Institute was initially meant to be the leading organization charged with creating a nationwide economic information network.&lt;ref&gt;Kassel, Simon. ''Soviet Cybernetics Research: A Preliminary Study of Organizations and Personalities'', RAND, Dec. 1971, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerovitch |first=Slava |title=InterNyet: Why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network |journal=[[History and Technology]] |year=2008 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=335–350 |doi=10.1080/07341510802044736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nowadays CEMI's focus has been on the transition period from communism to capitalism in Russia, and on microeconomic models and models of enterprises' behaviour. The so-called System of Optimal Functioning of the Economy (SOFE), with its mathematical planning approach based on methods developed by [[Leonid Kantorovich]] and its IT approach, was intensively discussed during Soviet times. It was objected to by some Marxist economists{{who?|date=December 2015}} as representatives of the Political Economy, who were afraid that the mathematical formula approach was too close to Western economics, and might lead to Soviet economics converting to Western economics, which also rely on mathematical formulas.  CEMI's first director was [[Nikolay Fedorenko|N.P. Fedorenko]]. In 1985 he was succeeded by the Russian academic V.L. Makarov, who still directs the institute.

Academic N.P. Fedorenko and other Russian scientists have issued many books on SOFE; most of them are in Russian.

[[File:Venenivibrio.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Venenivibrio stagnispumantis]]'' gains energy by oxidizing hydrogen gas.]]

In biochemistry, '''chemosynthesis''' is the biological conversion of one or more carbon-containing molecules (usually [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]]) and nutrients into organic matter using the [[oxidation]] of inorganic compounds (e.g., [[hydrogen]] gas, [[hydrogen sulfide]]) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as in [[photosynthesis]]. [[Chemotroph|Chemoautotrophs]], [[organism]]s that obtain carbon through chemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse, but also groups that include conspicuous or biogeochemically-important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing gamma and epsilon [[proteobacteria]], the [[Aquificae]], the [[methanogen]]ic archaea and the neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria.

Many microorganisms in dark regions of the oceans use chemosynthesis to produce biomass from single carbon molecules. Two categories can be distinguished. In the rare sites at which hydrogen molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are available, the energy available from the reaction between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (leading to production of methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can be large enough to drive the production of biomass. Alternatively, in most oceanic environments, energy for chemosynthesis derives from reactions in which substances such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[ammonia]] are oxidized. This may occur with or without the presence of oxygen.

Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations between chemosynthesizers and respiring heterotrophs are quite common. Large populations of animals can be supported by chemosynthetic [[secondary production]] at [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[methane clathrate]]s, [[cold seep]]s, [[whale fall]]s, and [[Movile Cave|isolated cave water]].

It has been hypothesized that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of [[Mars]], [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and other planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Chela-Flores]] (2000): "Terrestrial microbes as candidates for survival on Mars and Europa", in: Seckbach, Joseph (ed.) ''Journey to Diverse Microbial Worlds: Adaptation to Exotic Environments'', Springer, pp. 387–398. {{ISBN|0-7923-6020-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemosynthesis may have also been the first type of metabolism that evolved on Earth, leading the way for cellular respiration and photosynthesis to develop later.

&lt;!--I am commenting this out because the reaction is wrong (it is unbalanced in oxygen) and since there's no reference. Thermodynamically it shouldn't be possible to make glucose and sulfur from CO2, H2S, and water. Eric Kvaalen Chemosynthesis may have also been the first type of metabolism that evolved on Earth, leading the way for cellular respiration and photosynthesis to develop later.

==Process==
An example of a chemosynthesis reaction using hydrogen sulfide proceeds as follows:
::6CO₂ + 6H₂S → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6S
This reaction is used by bacteria inhabiting [[hydrothermal vent]]s to generate C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a [[carbohydrate]].

End of commented out section.--&gt;

==Hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis process==
[[Giant tube worm]]s use bacteria in their [[trophosome]] to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon dioxide]] (using [[hydrogen sulfide]] as an energy source) and produce sugars and [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biotechnology for Environmental Management and Resource Recovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYJEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179 |publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9788132208761|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some reactions produce sulfur:
:hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis:&lt;ref&gt;Campbell N.A. e.a. (2008) ''Biology'' 8. ed. Pearson International Edition, San Francisco. {{ISBN|978-0-321-53616-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::12'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''S'''&lt;/span&gt; + 6C&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ([[carbohydrate]]) + 6'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt; + 12S
Instead of releasing [[oxygen]] gas while fixing carbon dioxide as in [[photosynthesis]], hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis produces solid globules of [[sulfur]] in the process. In bacteria capable of chemoautotrophy (a form a chemosynthesis), such as [[purple sulfur bacteria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/304494953|title=The purple phototrophic bacteria|date=2009|publisher=Springer|others=Hunter, C. Neil, 1954-|isbn=9781402088148|location=Dordrecht|oclc=304494953}}&lt;/ref&gt;, yellow globules of sulfur are present and visible in the cytoplasm.

==Discovery==
[[File:Gollner Riftia pachyptila.png|right|thumb| Giant tube worms (''[[Riftia pachyptila]]'') have an organ containing chemosynthetic bacteria instead of a gut.]]
In 1890, [[Sergei Winogradsky|Sergei Nikolaevich Vinogradskii]] (or Winogradsky) proposed a novel type of life process called "anorgoxydant". His discovery suggested that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter and emerged during his physiological research in the 1880s in Strassburg and Zurich on sulfur, iron, and nitrogen bacteria.

In 1897, [[Wilhelm Pfeffer]] coined the term "chemosynthesis" for the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances, in association with [[autotrophy|autotrophic]] carbon dioxide assimilation - what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would be expanded to include also chemoorganoautotrophs, which are organisms that use organic energy substrates in order to assimilate carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Kellerman, M.Y., G. Wegener, M. Elvert, M.Y. Yoshinaga, Y-S. Lin, T. Holler, X.P. Millar, K. Knittel, and K-U. Hinrichs (2012). Autotrophy as a predominant mode of carbon fixation in anaerobic methane-oxidizing microbial communities. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109(47):19321-19326&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, chemosynthesis can be seen as a synonym of [[chemoautotrophy]].

The term "[[chemotroph]]y", less restrictive, would be introduced in the 1940s by [[André Lwoff]] for the production of energy by the oxidation of electron donors, organic or not, associated with auto- or heterotrophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. P., &amp; Wood, A. P. (2006). The chemolithotrophic prokaryotes. In: ''The prokaryotes'' (pp. 441-456). Springer New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kyAZ47ZrazkC&amp;pg].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, H.G. (1975). Mechanisms of
chemo-autotrophy. In: ''Marine ecology'', Vol. 2, Part I (O. Kinne, ed.), pp. 9-60, [http://www.int-res.com/archive/me_books/me_vol2_(physiological_mechanisms)_pt1.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrothermal vents===
The suggestion of Vinogradskii was confirmed nearly 90 years later, when hydrothermal [[ocean]] vents were predicted to exist in the 1970s. The hot springs and strange creatures were discovered by ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', the world's first deep-sea submersible, in 1977 at the [[Galapagos Rift]]. At about the same time, Harvard graduate student [[Colleen Cavanaugh]] proposed chemosynthetic bacteria that oxidize sulfides or elemental sulfur as a mechanism by which [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]] could survive near hydrothermal vents. Cavanaugh later managed to confirm that this was indeed the method by which the worms could thrive, and is generally credited with the discovery of chemosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Cavenaugh, Colleen M., et al, "Prokaryotic Cells in the Hydrothermal Vent Tube Worms ''Rifttia'' Jones:Possible Chemoautotrophic Symbionts," ''Science,'' Vol 213, Issue 4505, 17 July 1981, pp. 340-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 [[television]] series hosted by [[Bill Nye]] named chemosynthesis as one of the 100 greatest scientific discoveries of all time.&lt;ref name="nye"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442715/ "100 Greatest Discoveries (2004-2005)"] ''IMDb''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/greatest-discoveries/videos/evolution.htm "Greatest Discoveries."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319001453/http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/greatest-discoveries/videos/evolution.htm |date=March 19, 2013 }}  ''Science''.  Watch the "Greatest Discoveries in Evolution" online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanic crust===
In 2013, researchers reported their discovery of bacteria living in the rock of the [[oceanic crust]] below the thick layers of sediment, and apart from the hydrothermal vents that form along the edges of the [[tectonic plate]]s.  Preliminary findings are that these bacteria subsist on the hydrogen produced by chemical reduction of [[olivine]] by seawater circulating in the small veins that permeate the [[basalt]] that comprises oceanic crust.  The bacteria synthesize methane by combining hydrogen and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130314144340.htm  "Life deep within oceanic crust sustained by energy from interior of Earth", ''ScienceDaily'', retrieved March 16, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Commenting this out since the reaction is dubious as I mentioned above.
The chemosynthetic reaction 6CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6S also helped to determine that it was water, rather than carbon dioxide, that generated oxygen in photosynthesis. This was because H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was seen as analogous to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and sulfur bacteria produced sulfur rather than oxygen as a [[Metabolism|metabolic]] byproduct.

The term '''coma cocktail''' refers to a combination of substances administered in an emergency to comatose individuals,&lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the cause of the [[coma]] in the individual was not yet known.

Some have proposed that the concept be abandoned completely because modern [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] providers should be able to determine the likely etiology of the change in mental status.

== History ==
The coma cocktail is thought to have been created in United States as a first line treatment for an unconscious patient in an era where intensive care was new and difficult to maintain. Original coma cocktails included [[Xanthine|methylxanthines]], [[physostigmine]], physical stimulation (such as cold water baths or ammonium carbonate ("[[smelling salts]]")), [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]], [[strychnine]], [[picrotoxin]], [[nikethamide]] and [[camphor]]. As medicine and assessment techniques have advanced, the preceding drugs have been mostly replaced by the modern coma cocktail as described above.&lt;ref name="Sivilotti"/&gt;

== Dextrose == 
If the blood glucose concentration of the patient is alternating consciousness or at least contributing to the alteration, said patient likely needs hypertonic dextrose. Another indicator is seizures.&lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypertonic dextrose is effective in treating [[hypoglycemia]], and one in twelve patients administered for altered mental status suffer from it. This statistic may be sufficient evidence for doctors to support the routine of administering the drug. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

	[[Naloxone]] has well-documented effectiveness; as a matter of fact, 575/609 patients (mainly with heroin overdose) showed improved consciousness and respiration within five minutes of treatment. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	The major downsides to naloxone are the hypersensitivity from the patient and its reaction with substances contaminating opioids/opiates. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of hypersensitivity, the patient may subsequently suffer from restlessness, headache, and vomiting. 
Opiates/opioids, such as heroin, can be contaminated with [[scopolamine]], and if it is present, the patient may face an anticholinergic crisis. &lt;ref name="pmid15565045"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=The coma cocktail: indications, contraindications, adverse effects, proper dose, and proper route |journal=J Emerg Nurs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=572–4 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15565045 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099176704005549}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Flumazenil == 
[[Flumazenil]] is an imidazobenzodiazepine that can help mediate and antagonize the effects of [[benzodiazepines]]. It can be used in [[anaesthesia]] as well as intensive care. &lt;ref name="Sivilotti" &gt;{{Cite journal

[[Flumazenil]] raises concerns with its tendency to induce [[benzodiazepine]] [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], and symptoms include [[seizures]] and agitation. When a patient overdoses intentionally, [[benzodiazepines]] can actually mediate the effects of other lethal drugs in the system, so flumazenil’s action to reverse its effects can actually be harmful. &lt;ref name="Sivilotti" &gt;{{Cite journal

For this reason, flumazenil is recommended in scenarios with only benzodiazepine ingestion so as to avoid the other negative effects. 

== Thiamine == 

[[Thiamine]] is effective for treatment of [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]] as well as [[ethylene glycol]] ingestion. For ethylene glycol, thiamine helps by preventing synthesis of the glycol’s metabolites.

	Overall, thiamine does not cause as notable issues in the cocktail, but patients can be sensitive to it nonetheless. If a physician administers both [[dextrose]] and [[thiamine]], as is common in comatose patients, [[thiamine]] should be administered first. &lt;ref name="Sivilotti" &gt;{{Cite journal

A '''continuing education unit''' ('''CEU''') or '''continuing education credit''' ('''CEC''') is a measure used in [[continuing education]] programs to assist the professional to maintain his or her license in their profession.  Continuing education or professional development is required in many fields, including teachers, insurance professionals, interior designers/interior architects, lighting designers, architects, engineers, [[Emergency management|emergency management professionals]], school administrators, educators, nurses, mental health professionals, psychologists and social workers.  The continuing education unit is described as ten hours of participation in an education program.  

The term CEU is not a trademarked term; therefore, any educational institution may use it to describe their courses.  In this regard, there are no requirements for educator qualifications that are attached to each institutions courses when offering CEUs.  There have been some bodies created which are attempting to standardize and accredit institutions using the term CEU, the International Association for Continuing Education and Training being one of them; however, professions and industries usually regulate their approved continuing education within their bylaws and not one institute or accrediting body has become a standard to accept in this regard.  Professionals should always consult their Association or regulating body prior to embarking on continuing education and not assume a CEU will be accepted as part of their professional development.

'''Critical realism''', a philosophical approach associated with [[Roy Bhaskar]] (1944–2014), combines a general [[philosophy of science]] ([[transcendental realism]]) with a [[philosophy of social science]] ([[critical naturalism]]) to describe an interface between the natural and social worlds.

==Contemporary critical realism==
===Overview&lt;!--'Critical naturalism' redirects here--&gt;===
Bhaskar developed a general [[philosophy of science]] that he described as transcendental realism and a special philosophy of the human sciences that he called '''critical naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The two terms were combined by other authors to form the umbrella term critical realism.

Transcendental realism attempts to establish that in order for scientific investigation to take place, the object of that investigation must have real, manipulable, internal mechanisms that can be ''actualized'' to produce particular outcomes.  This is what we do when we conduct experiments.  This stands in contrast to empiricist scientists' claim that all scientists can do is observe the relationship between [[Causality|cause and effect]] and impose meaning.  Whilst empiricism, and positivism more generally, locate causal relationships at the level of events, critical realism locates them at the level of the generative mechanism, arguing that causal relationships are irreducible to empirical [[constant conjunction]]s of [[David Hume]]'s doctrine; in other words, a constant conjunctive relationship between events is neither sufficient nor even necessary to establish a causal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Research design : qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches|last=W.|first=Creswell, John|others=Creswell, J. David|isbn=9781506386706|edition= Fifth |location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=1004576152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implication of this is that science should be understood as an ongoing process in which scientists improve the concepts they use to understand the mechanisms that they study.  It should not, in contrast to the claim of empiricists, be about the identification of a coincidence between a postulated independent variable and dependent variable. [[Positivism]]/[[falsificationism]] are also rejected due to the observation that it is highly plausible that a mechanism will exist but either a) go unactivated, b) be activated, but not perceived, or c) be activated, but counteracted by other mechanisms, which results in its having unpredictable effects.  Thus, non-realisation of a posited mechanism cannot (in contrast to the claim of some positivists) be taken to signify its non-existence. [[Falsificationism]] can be viewed at the statement level (naive falsificationism) or at the theorem level (more common in practice). In this way, the two approaches can be reconciled to some extent.

Critical naturalism argues that the transcendental realist model of science is equally applicable to both the physical and the human worlds.  However, when we study the human world we are studying something fundamentally different from the physical world and must, therefore, adapt our strategy to studying it.  Critical naturalism, therefore, prescribes social scientific method which seeks to identify the mechanisms producing social events, but with a recognition that these are in a much greater state of flux than those of the physical world (as human structures change much more readily than those of, say, a leaf).  In particular, we must understand that human agency is made possible by social structures that themselves require the reproduction of certain actions/pre-conditions.  Further, the individuals that inhabit these social structures are capable of consciously reflecting upon, and changing, the actions that produce them—a practice that is in part facilitated by social scientific research.

Critical realism has become an influential movement in British [[sociology]] and [[social science]] in general as a reaction to, and reconciliation of, [[postmodern]] critiques.

Since Bhaskar made the first big steps in popularising the theory of critical realism in the 1970s, it has become one of the major strands of social scientific method, rivalling positivism/empiricism, and [[post-structuralism]]/[[relativism]]/[[Antipositivism|interpretivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.e-ir.info/2014/12/11/the-impact-of-roy-bhaskar-and-critical-realism-on-international-relations/|title=The Impact of Roy Bhaskar and Critical Realism on International Relations|work=E-International Relations|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/roy-bhaskar-philosopher-whose-school-of-critical-realism-challenged-established-ways-of-thinking-10009456.html|title=Roy Bhaskar: Philosopher whose school of critical realism challenged|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/04/roy-bhaskar|title=Roy Bhaskar obituary|last=Graeber|first=David|date=2014-12-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his development of critical realism, Bhaskar went on to develop a philosophical system he calls dialectical critical realism, which is most clearly outlined in his weighty book, ''Dialectic: The Pulse of Freedom''.

An accessible introduction to Bhaskar's writings was written by Andrew Collier. [[Andrew Sayer]] has written accessible texts on critical realism in social science. Danermark et al. have also produced an accessible account. [[Margaret Archer]] is associated with this school, as is the [[ecosocialist]] writer [[Peter Dickens (ecosocialist)|Peter Dickens]].

[[David Graeber]] relies on critical realism, which he understands as a form of '[[Heraclitus|heraclitean]]' philosophy, emphasizing flux and change over stable essences, in his anthropological book on the concept of value, ''Toward an anthropological theory of value: the false coin of our own dreams''.

Recently, attention has turned to the challenge of implementing critical realism in applied social research. An edited volume examined the use of critical realism for studying organizations (Edwards, O'Mahoney, and Vincent 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Paul K.|last2=O'Mahoney|first2=Joe|last3=Vincent|first3=Steve|title=Studying Organizations Using Critical Realism: A Practical Guide|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966553-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Other authors (Fletcher 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fletcher|first1=Amber J.|title=Applying critical realism in qualitative research: methodology meets method|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=181–194|date=2016|doi=10.1080/13645579.2016.1144401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parr 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parr|first1=Sadie|title=Integrating critical realist and feminist methodologies: ethical and analytical dilemmas|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|date=2015|volume=8|issue=2|pages=193–207|doi=10.1080/13645579.2013.868572|url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/9155/1/Parr_Critical_Realist_Research.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunt 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunt|first1=Sarah|title=Critical realism and grounded theory: Analysing the adoption outcomes for disabled children using the retroduction framework|journal=Qualitative Social Work|volume=17|issue=2|pages=176–194|date=2018|doi=10.1177/1473325016664572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoddy 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoddy|first1=Eric|title=Critical realism in empirical research: employing techniques from Grounded theory methodology|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|pages=1–14|date=2018|doi=10.1080/13645579.2018.1503400}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have discussed which specific research methodologies and methods are conducive (or not) to research guided by critical realism as a philosophy of science.

==In economics==
Heterodox economists like [[Tony Lawson]], [[Lars Pålsson Syll]], [[Frederic Sterling Lee|Frederic Lee]] or [[Geoffrey Hodgson]] are trying to work the ideas of critical realism into economics, especially the dynamic idea of macro-micro interaction.

According to critical realist economists, the central aim of economic theory is to provide explanations in terms of hidden generative structures. This position combines [[transcendental realism]] with a critique of [[mainstream economics]]. It argues that mainstream economics (i) relies excessively on deductivist methodology, (ii) embraces an uncritical enthusiasm for formalism, and (iii) believes in strong conditional predictions in economics despite repeated failures.

The world that mainstream economists study is the empirical world. But this world is "out of phase" (Lawson) with the underlying [[ontology]] of economic regularities. The mainstream view is thus a limited reality because empirical realists presume that the objects of inquiry are solely "empirical regularities"—that is, objects and events at the level of the experienced.

The critical realist views the domain of real causal mechanisms as the appropriate object of economic science, whereas the positivist view is that the reality is exhausted in empirical, i.e. experienced reality. Tony Lawson argues that economics ought to embrace a "social ontology" to include the underlying causes of economic phenomena.

==Marxism==
A development of Bhaskar's critical realism lies at the ontological root of contemporary streams of Marxist political and economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, D. (2002), “Marxism”, in Marsh D. Stoker, G. (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, D, &amp; Furlong, P. (2002), “Ontology and Epistemology in Political Science”, in Marsh D. Stoker, G. (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science, Basingstoke'', Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The realist philosophy described by Bhaskar in ''A Realist Theory of Science'' is compatible with Marx's work in that it differentiates between an intransitive reality, which exists independently of human knowledge of it, and the socially produced world of science and empirical knowledge. This dualist logic is clearly present in the Marxian theory of ideology, according to which social reality may be very different from its empirically observable surface appearance. Notably, [[Alex Callinicos]] has argued for a 'critical realist' ontology in the philosophy of social science and explicitly acknowledges Bhaskar's influence (while also rejecting the latter's 'spiritualist turn' in his later work).&lt;ref&gt;Callinicos, A. (2006), ''The Resources of Critique'', Cambridge, Polity, pp.155-158&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between critical realist philosophy and Marxism has also been discussed in an article co-authored by Bhaskar and Callinicos and published in the ''Journal of Critical Realism''.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, R. Callinicos, A. (2003), 'Marxism and Critical Realism: A Debate', in ''Journal of Critical Realism'', 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international relations theory==
Since 2000, critical realist philosophy has also been increasingly influential in the field of international relations (IR) theory. Patrick Thaddeus Jackson has called it 'all the rage' in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Patrick Thaddeus (2011) The Conduct of Inquiry in International Relations, Routledge p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Jessop]], Colin Wight, Milja Kurki, Jonathan Joseph and Hidemi Suganami have all published major works on the utility of beginning IR research from a critical realist social ontology—an ontology they all credit Roy Bhaskar with originating.&lt;ref&gt;Jessop, Bob (2007) State Power, Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurki, Milja (2008), Causation in International Relations: Reclaiming Causal Analysis, Cambridge: CUP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wight, Colin (2006) Agents, Structures and International Relations: Politics as Ontology, Cambridge: CUP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Jonathan (2012) The Social in the Global, Cambridge: CUP&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological economics ==
The British [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Clive Spash]] holds the opinion that critical realism offers a thorough basis—as a philosophy of science—for the theoretical foundation of ecological economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spash|first=Clive L.|date=2012-05-26|title=New foundations for ecological economics|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=77|pages=36–47|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.004|issn=0921-8009|citeseerx=10.1.1.634.2763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spash|first=Clive|date=2017-01-31|publisher=transcript Verlag|language=en|doi=10.14361/9783839427255-008|isbn=9783839427255|title=Critical Realism meets kritische Sozialtheorie|chapter=Soziales, ökologisches und ökonomisches Wissen zum Synthetisierungspotenzial des Critical Realism}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore uses a critical realist lens for conducting research in (ecological) economics.

However, also other scholars base ecological economics on a critical realist foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge handbook of ecological economics : nature and society|others=Spash, Clive L.|isbn=9781317395096|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=982187453|last1 = Spash|first1 = Clive L.|date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Leigh Price]] from [[Rhodes University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical realism, environmental learning, and social-ecological change|others=Lotz-Sisitka, Heila, 1965-, Price, Leigh|isbn=9781317338475|location=London|oclc=932622677|last1 = Price|first1 = Leigh|last2=Lotz-Sistka|first2=Heila|date=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semiotics]], '''denotation''' is the surface or the [[literal and figurative language|literal]] [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. The [[definition]] most likely to appear in a [[dictionary]].

==Discussion ==
Drawing from the original word or definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857-1913), a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] has two parts:
*as a ''signifier'', i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and
*as the ''signified'', i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. 
To transmit [[information]], both the addresser and the addressee must use the same [[code (Semiotics)|code]], whether in the literal sense, e.g. [[Morse Code]] or in the form of a [[language]]. The denotative meaning of a signifier is intended to communicate the objective [[semantic]] content of the represented thing. So, in the case of a [[lexical (Semiotics)|lexical]] word, say "book", the intention is to do no more than describe the physical object. Any other meanings or implications will be [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings.

The distinction between denotation and connotation can be made in textual analysis and the existence of dictionaries is used to support the argument that the [[sign system]] begins with a simple meaning that is then glossed as new usages are developed. But this argument equally means that no sign can be separated from both its denotational and connotational meanings, and, since the addresser is always using the sign for a particular purpose in a context, no sign can be divorced from the [[value (Semiotics)|values]] of the addresser. [[Louis Hjelmslev]] (1899-1965) therefore proposes that although the [[grammatical function|function]] of [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] may be a single process, denotation is the first step, and connotation the second. [[Roland Barthes]] (1915-1980) added a third possible step in [[world view]] or ''Weltanschauung'' in which metacognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] such as ''liberty'', ''sexuality'', ''autonomy'', etc. create a framework of reference from which more abstract meanings may be attributed to the signs, depending on the context.

Barthes and others have argued that it is more difficult to make a clear distinction when analysing [[image]]s. For example, how is one to interpret a photograph? In the real world, a human observer has binocular vision, but the two-dimensional picture must be analysed to determine depth and the relative size of objects depicted by applying rules of perspective, the operation of which can be confused by focus and composition. One view might be that the picture as interpreted is evidence of what it depicts and, since the technology collects and stores data from the real world, the resulting picture is a definition of what the camera was pointed at, and so denotational. Adopting the classification of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],  this would be considered an indexical sign,  i.e. there is a direct connection between the signifier and the signified. While it is true that an unedited photograph may be an index, digital technology is eroding the viewer's confidence that the image is an objective representation of reality. Further, the photographer made conscious decisions about the composition of the image, how to light it, whether to take a close-up or long shot, etc. All of these decisions represent both the intention and the values of the photographer in wishing to preserve this image. This led John Fiske to suggest that, "denotation is what is photographed, connotation is how it is photographed". Such problems become even more difficult to resolve once the audience knows that the photograph or moving image has been edited or staged. (See also [[Modality (Semiotics)|modality]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21529">'''Eco-costs''' are the costs of the environmental burden of a product on the basis of prevention of that burden. They are the costs which should be made to reduce the [[environmental pollution]] and [[Resource depletion|materials depletion]] in our world to a level which is in line with the [[carrying capacity]] of our earth.

For example: for each 1000&amp;nbsp;kg [[Greenhouse effect|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission]], one should invest €116,- in [[Offshore wind power|offshore windmill park]]s (plus in the other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction systems at that price or less). When this is done consequently, the total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in the world will be reduced by 65% compared to the emissions in 2008. As a result, global warming will stabilise. In short: "the eco-costs of 1000kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are € 116,-".

[[Image:Ecocosts system (new).png|center|thumb|upright=3|Fig 1: Calculation structure of the eco-costs 2012 and 2017.]]

Similar calculations can be made on the environmental burden of [[Ocean acidification|acidification]], [[eutrophication]], [[summer smog]], [[fine dust]], [[eco-toxicity]], and the use of metals, [[Rare-earth mineral|rare earth]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s, water and [[land consumption|land]] (nature).
As such, the eco-costs are '[[external costs]]', since they are not yet integrated in the real life costs of current production chains ([[Whole-life cost|Life Cycle Costs]]). The eco-costs should be regarded as hidden [[obligation]]s.

The eco-costs of a product are the sum of all eco-costs of emissions and use of resources during the life cycle "[[Cradle to Cradle Design|from cradle to cradle]]". The widely accepted method to make such a calculation is called [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA), which is basically a mass and energy balance, defined in the ISO 14040, and the ISO 14044 (for the building industry the EN 15804).

The practical use of eco-costs is to compare the [[sustainability]] of several product types with the same functionality. 
The advantage of eco-costs is that they are expressed in a standardized [[value (economics)|monetary value]] (€) which appears to be easily understood 'by instinct'. Also the calculation is transparent and relatively easy, compared to damage based models which have the disadvantage of extremely complex calculations with subjective weighting of the various aspects contributing to the overall environmental burden.&lt;ref&gt;M.

In 2007 the system has been updated, and published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Vogtländer; [http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b004.htm ''EVR, LCA-based assessment of sustainability''], VSSD, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The next updates were in 2012 and 2017. It is planned to update the system every 5 years to incorporate the latest developments in science.&lt;br /&gt; 
The concept of eco-costs has been made operational with general databases of the Delft University of Technology, and is described at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com].&lt;br /&gt; The method of the eco-costs is based on the sum of the marginal prevention costs (end of pipe as well as system integrated) for toxic emissions related to human health as well as ecosystems, emissions that cause [[global warming]], and [[resource depletion]] (metals, rare earths, fossil fuels, water, and land-use). For a visual display of the system see Figure 1.

Marginal prevention costs of toxic emissions are derived from the so-called prevention curve as depicted in Figure 2. The basic idea behind such a curve is that a country (or a group of countries, such as the European Union), must take prevention measures to reduce toxic emissions (more than one measure is required to reach the target). From the point of view of the economy, the cheapest measures (in terms of euro/kg) are taken first. At a certain point at the curve, the reduction of the emissions is sufficient to bring the concentration of the pollution below the so-called no-effect-level. The no-effect-level of {{CO2}} emissions is the level that the emissions and the natural absorption of the earth are in equilibrium again at a maximum temperature rise of 2 degrees C. The no-effect-level of a toxic emission is the level where the concentration in nature is well below the toxicity threshold (most natural toxic substances have a toxicity threshold, below which they might even have a beneficial effect), or below the natural background level. For human toxicity the '[[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]' is used.
The eco-costs are the marginal prevention costs of the last measure of the prevention curve to reach the no-effect-level. See the abovementioned references 4 and 8 for a full description of the calculation method (note that in the calculation 'classes' of emissions with the same 'midpoint' are combined, as explained below).

The classical way to calculate a 'single indicator' in LCA is based on the damage of the emissions. Pollutants are grouped in 'classes', multiplied by a 'characterisation' factor to account for their relative importance within a class, and totalised to the level of their 'midpoint' effect ([[Greenhouse effect|global warming]], [[Multi-effect Protocol|acidification]], nutrification, etc.). The classical problem is then to determine the relative importance of each midpoint effect. In damage based systems this is done by 'normalisation' (= comparison with the pollution in a country or a region) and 'weighting' (= giving each midpoint a weight, to take the relative importance into account) by an expert panel.

The calculation of the eco-costs is based on classification and characterisation tables as well (combining tables from IPCC ([http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html]), the [[USEtox]] model ([http://usetox.org usetox.org]), tables of the [[ILCD]] ([http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf]), however has a different approach to the normalisation and weighting steps. Normalisation is done by calculating the marginal prevention costs for a region (i.e. the European Union), as described above. The weighting step is not required in the eco-costs system, since the total result is the sum of  the eco-costs of all midpoints.
The advantage of such a calculation is that the marginal prevention costs are related to the cost of the most expensive [[Best Available Technology]] which is needed to meet the target, and the corresponding level of  [[Emissions trading|Tradable Emission Rights]] which is required in future. From a business point of view, the eco-costs are the costs of non-compliance with future governmental regulations. Example from the past: NOx emissions of Volkswagen diesel.

The eco-costs have been calculated for the situation in the European Union. It is expected that the situation in some states in the USA, like California and Pennsylvania, give similar results. It might be argued that the eco-costs are also an indication of the marginal prevention costs for other parts of the globe, under the condition of a [[level playing field]] for production companies.

==Eco-costs 2017==
The method of the eco-costs 2017 (version 1.3) comprises tables of over 36.000 emissions, and has been made operational by special database for SimaPro: Idematapp 2018 and Idemat2018 (based on LCIs from Ecoinvent V3.4), Agri Footprint, and a database for CES (Cambridge Engineering Selector). Over 10.000 materials and processes are covered in total. Excel look-up tables are provided at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com].

For emissions of toxic substances, the following set of multipliers (marginal prevention costs) is used in the eco-costs 2017 system:
{|
|-
!eco-costs of!!equivalent
|-
|  acidification || 8.75 €/kg SOx equivalent
|-
| eutrophication|| 4.17 €/kg phosphate equivalent
|-
| ecotoxicity|| 55.0 €/kg Cu equivalent
|-
| human toxicity || 3754 €/kg Benzo(a)pyrene equivalent
|-
| summer smog (respiratory diseases)|| 10.38 €/kg C2H4 equivalent
|-
| fine dust|| 34.0 €/kg fine dust PM2.5

|-
| global warming  (GWP 100)|| 0.116 €/kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent
|}

The characterisation ('midpoint') tables which are applied in the eco-costs 2017 system, are recommended by the ILCD:&lt;ref&gt;Characterization factors of the ILCD Recommended Life Cycle Impact Assessment methods, ILCD [http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IPPC 2013, 100 years, for greenhouse gasses
* USETOX 2, for human toxicity (carcinogens), and ecotoxicity
* ILCD, for acidification, eutrification, and photochemical oxidant formation (summer smog)
* UNEP/SETAC 2016,&lt;ref&gt;Global Guidance for Life Cycle Impact assessment Indicators Volume 1, United Nations Environment Programme, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;, for fine dust PM2.5 (for PM10 the default factors are used of the ILCD Midpoint+)

In addition to abovementioned eco-costs for emissions, there is a set of eco-costs to characterize the 'midpoints' of resource depletion:
* eco-costs of abiotic scarcity (metals, including rare earth, and fossil fuels)
* eco-costs of land-use change (based on [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], of vascular plants and mammals, used for eco-costs of tropical hardwood)
* eco-costs of water scarcity (based on the midpoint Water Stress Indicator - WSI - of countries &lt;ref&gt;Boulay, Bulle, Bayart, Deschênes, and Margni; Regional Characterization of Freshwater Use in LCA: Modeling Direct Impacts on Human Health; Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 2011, 45, pp 8948 - 8957&lt;/ref&gt;)
* eco-costs of landfill

The abovementioned marginal prevention costs at midpoint level can be combined to 'endpoints' in three groups, plus global warming as a separate group:
{|
|-
| eco-costs of human health       ||= the sum of carcinogens, summer smog, fine dust
|-
| eco-costs of ecosystems         || = the sum of acidification, eutrophication, ecotoxicity
|-
| eco-costs of resource scarcity || = the sum of abiotic depletion, land-use, water, and land-fill
|-
| eco-costs of global warming     || = the sum of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (the GWP 100 table) 
|-
| total eco-costs    || = the sum of human health, ecosystems, resource scarcity and global warming
|}

Since the endpoints have the same monetary unit (e.g. euro, dollar), they are added up to the total eco-costs without applying a 'subjective' weighting system. This is an advantage of the eco-costs system (see also ISO 14044 section 4.4.3.4 and 4.4.5). 
So called 'double counting' (ISO 14044 section 4.4.2.2.3) is avoided in the eco-costs system.

The eco-costs of global warming (also called eco-costs of carbon footprint) can be used as an indicator for the [[carbon footprint]]. The eco-costs of resource depletion can be regarded as an indicator for 'circularity' in the theory of the [[circular economy]]. However, it is advised to include human toxicity and eco-toxicity, and include the eco-costs of global warming in the calculations on the circular economy as well. The eco-costs of global warming are required to reveal the difference between fossil-based products and bio-based products, since biogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not counted in LCA (biogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is part of the natural recycle loop in the biosphere).
Therefore,  total eco-costs can be regarded as a robust indicator for [[cradle-to-cradle]] calculations in LCA for products and services in the theory of the circular economy.
Since the economic viability of a business model is also an important aspect of the circular economy, the added value of a product-service system should be part of the analysis. This requires the two dimensional approach of Eco-efficient Value Creation &lt;ref&gt;Joost G. Vogtländer, A. Mestre, R. van der Helm, A. Scheepens and R. Wever; [http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b021.htm ''Eco-efficient Value creation, sustainable design and business strategies''], VSSD, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as described at the Wikipedia page on the model of the [[eco-costs value ratio|ecocosts/value ratio]], EVR.

The Delft University of Technology has developed a single indicator for S-LCA as well, the so-called s-eco-costs, to incorporate the sometimes appalling working conditions in production chains (e.g. production of garments, mining of metals). Aspects are the low [[List of minimum wages by country|minimum wages in developing countries]] (the "[[living wage|fair wage]] deficit"), the aspects of "[[child labour]]" and [[extreme poverty]]", the aspect of "excessive working hours", and the aspect of "OSH ([[Occupational Safety and Health]])". The s-eco-costs system has been published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.&lt;ref&gt;Natascha M. van der Velden and Joost G. Vogtländer; Monetisation of external socio-economic costs of industrial production: A social-LCA-based case of clothing production; Journal of Cleaner Production, 2017, 153, pp 320 - 330&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention costs versus damage costs==
Prevention measures will decrease the costs of the damage, related to environmental pollution. The damage costs are in most cases the same (or a bit higher) compared to the prevention costs. So the total effect of prevention measures on our society is that it results in a better environment at no extra costs.

==Discussion==
There are many 'single indicators' for LCA. Basically, they fall into three categories:
* single issue
* damage based
* prevention based

The best known 'single issue' indicator is the [[carbon footprint]]: the total emissions of kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''equivalent'' (taking methane and some other [[greenhouse gas]]ses into account as well). The advantage of a single issue indicator is, that its calculation is simple and transparent, without any complex assumptions. It is easy as well to communicate to the public. The disadvantage is that is ignores the problems caused by other pollutants and it is not suitable for cradle-to-cradle calculations (because materials depletion is not taken into account).&lt;br /&gt;
The most common single indicators are damage based. This stems from the period of the 1990s, when LCA was developed to make people aware of the damage of production and consumption. The advantage of damage based single indicators is, that they make people aware of the fact that they should consume less, and make companies aware that they should produce cleaner. The disadvantage is that these damage based systems are very complex, not transparent for others than who make the computer calculations, need many assumptions, and suffer from the subjective weighting procedure as last step at the end. Communication of the result is not easy, since the result is expressed in 'points' (attempts to express the results in money were never very successful, because of methodological flaws and uncertainties). The most recent endpoint indicators avoid the last step to a single indicator: UseTOX 2 and ReCiPe 2016, resulting in 2 respectively 3 endpoints (human health, ecosystems and resources separately).&lt;br /&gt;
Prevention based indicators, like the system of the eco-costs, are relatively new. The advantage, in comparison to the damage based systems, is that the calculations are relatively easy and transparent, and that the  results can be explained in terms of money and in measures to be taken. The system is focused on the decision taking processes of architects, business people, designers and engineers. The advantage is that it provides 1 single endpoint in euro's. The disadvantage is that the system is not focused on the fact that people should consume less.

The eco-costs are calculated for the situation of the European Union, but are applicable worldwide under the assumption of a level playing field for business, and under the precautionary principle. There are two other prevention based systems, developed after the introduction of the eco-costs, which are based on the local circumstances of a specific country:
* In the Netherlands, 'shadow prices' have been developed in 2004 by TNO/MEP on basis of a local prevention curve: it are the costs of the most expensive prevention measure required by the Dutch government for each midpoint.  It is obvious that such costs are relevant for the local companies, but such a shadow price system doesn't have any meaning outside the Netherlands, since it is not based on the no-effect-level
* In Japan, a group of universities have developed a set of data for maximum abatement costs (MAC, similar to the midpoint multipliers of the eco-costs as given in the previous section), for the Japanese conditions. The development of the MAC method started in 2002 and has been published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Tosihiro Oka, Masanobu Ishikawa, Yoshifumi Fujii, Gjalt Huppes; Calculating Cost-effectiveness for Activities with Multiple Environmental Effects Using the Maximum Abatement Cost Method; Journal of Industrial Ecology, Volume 9, Issue 4, pages 97–103, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called avoidable abatement cost (AAC) in this method is comparable to the eco-costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">'''Eco-investing''' or '''green investing''', is a form of [[socially responsible investing]] where investments are made in companies that support or provide [[environmentally friendly]] products and practices. These companies encourage (and often profit from) new technologies that support the transition from carbon dependence to more sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref name=chow&gt;{{Cite web|last=Henshaw |first=Mark |title=Eco Investor Guide |publisher=Eco Investor Guide, Inc. |year=2010 |url=http://www.ecoinvestorguide.com/wp-content/uploads/EcoInvestorGuide.pdf |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As industries' environmental impacts become more apparent, green topics have not only taken center stage in pop culture, but the financial world as well. In the 1990s many investors “began to look for those companies that were better than their competitors in terms of managing their environmental impact.” While some investors still focus their funds to avoid only “the most egregious polluters,” the emphasis for many investors has switched to changing “the way money is used,” and using “it in a positive, transformative way to get us from where we are now ultimately to a truly sustainable society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Keane |first=Robert F. |title=The Green Advisor: SRI &amp; Green Investing Grow Up |publisher=Investment Advisor |date=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.advisorone.com/2009/11/01/the-green-advisor-sri-green-investing-grow-up |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard – launched by Ethical Markets Media and The Climate Prosperity Alliance to monitor private investments in green companies – estimated that over $1.248 trillion has been invested in solar, wind, geothermal, ocean/hydro and other green sectors since 2007. This number represents investments from [[North America]], [[China]], [[India]], and [[Brazil]], as well at other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard Finds Over $1 Trillion Invested in Green Since 2007 |publisher=Green Money Journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.greenmoneyjournal.com/article.mpl?newsletterid=51&amp;articleid=749 |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco/Green Investing versus Socially Responsible Investing==
While many eco-investments may be considered socially responsible investments, and vice versa, the two are not mutually inclusive. [[Socially responsible investing]] is the practice of investing only in those companies which satisfy certain moral or ethical criteria. This may include companies with an interest in the environment, but also supports various other social and religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Socially Responsible Investing |publisher=Investor Glossary |url=http://www.investorglossary.com/socially-responsible-investing.htm |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-investing narrows in on the interests of sustainable environmental issues. Specifically, eco-investments focus on companies who work on renewable energy and clean technologies.

==Eco-investing sectors==
There are several sectors that fall under the eco-investing umbrella. [[Renewable energy]] refers to both solar, wind, tidal current,wave and conventional hydro technology. This includes companies that build [[solar panel]]s or [[wind turbine]]s, or the raw materials and services that contribute to these technologies&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt; It also refers to Energy Storage – companies that develop and use technologies to store large amounts of energy, particularly renewable energies. A good example of this is the fuel cells used in [[hybrid car]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Green Technology &amp; Alternative Fuels |publisher=Demand Media, Inc. |url=http://www.greencar.com/alternative-fuels-green-technology.php |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also under the renewable energy sector are Biofuels. This group includes companies that use or supply biological resources (like algae, corn or waster wood) to create energy or fuel. Other technologies that are included in the renewable energy group are: Geothermal (companies who use or convert heat to electric energy) and Hydroelectricity (companies who harness water energy to make electricity).&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Buildings and Efficiency sector refers to companies that manufacture green building materials or energy-efficient services in the world of engineering and architecture. Green building materials include energy-efficient glass, insulation, and lighting among others. Recycling companies and energy conservation companies also fall under this sector.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Eco Living sector refers to companies that offer sustainable goods and services for healthy living. This includes organic farming, green pesticides, health care and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

Green investment has significantly grown in the UK and there are now 136 funds listed on the [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/library Worldwise Investor fund library] under the themes: Agriculture, Carbon, Clean Energy, Forestry, Environmental, Multi-thematic and Water. All of these funds account for around [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/knowledge/reports?fd=%2527%2582%25F9%25B8%257F%25C5%2500%25BB%25E3%25B61sXm%25F1%259E%2584%252FK%2591%250E-%25F2%25B1x0L%25DFW%25B9%25C2Z%250Bf%2589%2501%25CCY%25C1%25D1%259A%2594%25E7%25C92s%25C5 £21.8bn] in the UK.

The '''Educator Astronaut Project''' is a [[NASA]] program designed to educate students and spur excitement in math, science, and [[space exploration]]. It is a successor to the [[Teacher in Space Project]] of the 1980s that was cancelled after the death of [[Christa McAuliffe]] in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|disaster]] ([[STS-51-L]]). NASA halted the teachers project amid concerns surrounding the risk of sending civilians to space.

== History ==
[[Image:Educator Astronauts.jpg|right|thumb|Educator Astronauts Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenberger, Richard Arnold, and Joseph Acaba during a microgravity flight.]]
In the 1990s, NASA created the Educator Astronaut Project, which carries on the objectives of the Teacher in Space Program -- seeking to elevate teaching as a profession and inspire students. Unlike the Teacher in Space Program, educator astronauts are fully trained astronauts who do the same jobs and duties that any other astronaut does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=NASA|title=Preflight Interview with Barbara Morgan|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts118/morgan_interview.html|accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They fly as crew members with critical mission responsibilities, as well as education-related goals. In addition to their technical assignments, they assist other astronauts in connecting to students and teachers through space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/archives/sts-118/index.html |title=STS-118 mission summary |publisher=Spaceflight.nasa.gov |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/showstory.cfm?ArticleID=4263 'Teachers in Space' will endure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227233146/http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/showstory.cfm?ArticleID=4263 |date=February 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/sciences/astronomy/civilians-in-space-spsc-03.html |title=Civilians in Space |publisher=Bookrags.com |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/space_educator_030203.html NASA Assures That Teachers Will Fly in Space] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125035402/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/space_educator_030203.html |date=November 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph M. Acaba]], [[Richard R. Arnold]] and [[Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger]] were selected as the first Educator Mission Specialists in the [[NASA Astronaut Group 19|2004 class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=NASA|title=NASA's New Astronauts Meet The Press|date=October 8, 2004|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/oct/HQ_n04160_new_ascans.html|accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Acaba and Arnold were part of the crew of [[STS-119]], a [[Space Shuttle]] mission to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) which was flown by [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] in March 2009. Metcalf-Lindenburger flew on [[STS-131]] in April 2010, also visiting the ISS aboard Space Shuttle ''Discovery''.

== Barbara Morgan ==
[[Barbara Morgan]], the backup to [[Christa McAuliffe]] in the Teacher in Space Project, remained involved with NASA after the ''Challenger'' disaster and continued to work with NASA’s Education Division until her selection as a [[Mission Specialist]] in 1998. Morgan completed two years of astronaut training and evaluation, and began official duties in 2000. Morgan became the first former teacher to travel to space on [[STS-118]]. While NASA press releases and media briefings often referred to her as a "Mission Specialist Educator" or "Educator Astronaut", Morgan did not train in the Educator Astronaut Project. [[NASA Administrator]] [[Michael D. Griffin]] clarified at a press conference after STS-118 that Morgan was not considered a Mission Specialist Educator, but rather was a standard Mission Specialist, who had once been a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Griffin, NASA TV: STS-118 Post-Landing briefing&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's duties as a Mission Specialist were no different from other Shuttle Mission Specialists.

'''Generación de la Ruptura''' ('''Breakaway Generation''') is the name given by art critic [[Teresa del Conde]]&lt;ref&gt;Teresa del Conde, “La aparición de la Ruptura”, en ''Un siglo de arte mexicano 1900-2000'', Italia, CNCA, INBA, Landucci Editores, 1999, pp. 187-212.&lt;/ref&gt; to the generation of Mexican artists against the established [[Mexican muralism|Mexican School of Painting, more commonly called Mexican muralism]] post [[World War II]]. It began with the criticisms of [[José Luis Cuevas]] in the early 1950s, followed by others who thought the established art had become dogmatic, formulaic and nationalistic and the artists too deferential to the government. This new generation of artists was not bound by a particular artistic style but was more interested in personal rather than social issues and influenced by a number of international trends in art such as [[Abstract expressionism]]. Early reaction to them was strong and negative but by the end of the 1950s, they had succeeded in having their art shown in the major venues of Mexico. The Generación de la Ruptura had influence on other arts in Mexico, such as literature but it did not end the production of murals in Mexico with social and nationalist purposes.

==Mexican muralism as antecedent==
From the 1920s to the beginning of the 1950s, the dominant painting style was what it is academically known as the ''Escuela Mexicana de la Pintura'' (Mexican School of Painting) also popularly known as "Mexican muralism." Mexican muralism came up to be from the convergence of the ideals of then-Mexico’s painters and the need of a post [[Mexican Revolution]] government to promote their ideas.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social ideals pursued the glorification of Mexico's mestizo identity.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The main representatives of this movement were [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

==Rise of the Generación de la Ruptura==
[[Image:Chivo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chivo ([[Goat]]) by [[Francisco Toledo]]]]
Despite the opposition from established artistic and official circles, the young generation of the post-WWII era continued to challenge the status quo. They named themselves the ''"Joven Escuela de Pintura Mexicana"'' (Young School of Mexican Painting) but in the end the name “Generación de la Ruptura” (The Breakaway Generation) stuck.&lt;ref name="decadencia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=1609&amp;id_seccion=6419&amp;id_subseccion=1416&amp;id_documento=540 |title=El Movimiento Muralista Mexicano La Decadencia |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Mexican Muralist Movement – The Decline |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209235510/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=1609&amp;id_seccion=6419&amp;id_subseccion=1416&amp;id_documento=540# |archive-date=2012-12-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early exhibitions of their art were mostly ignored by cultural authorities making it difficult for these artists to pursue their art.&lt;ref name="diceque"&gt;{{cite news |title=Felguérez dice que su generación no es de ruptura, sino de apertura universal |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2012/362340/6/felguerez-dice-que-su-generacion-no-es-de-ruptura-sino-de-apertura-universal.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Felguérez says that his generation is not of rupture but of universal opening }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruptura artists were a diverse group, not united by a single artistic movement but only by the belief that "muralism" had run its course.&lt;ref name="decadencia"/&gt; The "Ruptura" criticized old Mexican muralism as being chauvinistic, dogmatic, Manichean, stuck with old formulas, simplistic and being too deferential towards government. For the "Ruptura" artists, muralism had evolved into a nationalistic cult.&lt;ref name="grenier"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grenier |first= Yvon |year=2006 |title=The Politics of Art and Literature in Latin America |journal=Canadian Journal of Latin American &amp; Caribbean Studies |volume=31 |issue=62 |pages=245–258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lilia Carrillo's "Girl in Kitchen".jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lilia Carrillo]]'s "Girl in Kitchen"]]
Historically, the development of art in Mexico has always been intertwined with Europe since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. Many of the old muralist school artist had studied and worked in Europe before their careers in Mexico and the same holds true for the many of ''"Generación de la Ruptura"'' artists. The latter generation were influenced by the various then-new European movements such as Abstract expressionism and [[Cubism]] which rose out of social movements and philosophies of the mid 20th century in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistaunam"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.revistadelauniversidad.unam.mx/1805/pdfs/94-102.pdf |title= Arte entre dos continentes |author= Roberto García Bonilla |work=Revista de la Universidad |publisher=[[UNAM]] |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Art between two continents |accessdate=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''"Ruptura"'' artists abandoned nationalism in favor of internationalism and universalism. Manuel Felguérez says that the aim of the ''"Generación de la Ruptura"'' was not really to “discard” Mexican art but rather to universalize Mexican art.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;

However, the Mexican government controlled many venues where art could be promoted and it was directly censured by the ruling [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] party.&lt;ref name="decadencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amistad"&gt;{{cite news |title= La amistad reúne a generación de la Ruptura |author= Virginia Bautista |url= http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=especial-comunidad-expresiones&amp;cat=60&amp;id_nota=816894 |newspaper=Excélsior |location=Mexico City |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Friendship reunites the Generación de la Ruptura }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's only in the late 1950s into the 1960s when these artists began to exhibit their art at large venues such as the [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]].&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;

The members of this generation of artists include native-born Mexicans and immigrants, many of which were refugees from World War II. Along with José Luis Cuevas, these include Francisco Corzas, [[Fernando García Ponce]], [[Roger Von Gunten]], [[Edmundo Aquino]], [[Francisco Toledo]], [[Arturo Rivera]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Alberto Gironella]], [[Ricardo Martínez]], [[Arnaldo Coen]], [[Lilia Carrillo]], [[Vlady]], [[Manuel Felguérez]], [[Gastón González César]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Generación de la Ruptura]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} [[Myra Landau]], [[Gilberto Aceves Navarro]], [[Gustavo Arias Murueta]], [[Luis López Loza]], Luis Almeida, [[Peggy Espinosa]], [[Adolfo Falcón]], [[Efraín Herrero]], [[Rafael López Castro]], [[Bernardo Recamier]] and [[Pablo Rulfo]]. Of the foreign born Ruptura painters, the most important was [[Vicente Rojo Almazán|Vicente Rojo]] from [[Cataluña]] who reshaped Mexican graphic arts.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistaunam"/&gt;

==Influence of the movement==
The movement had influence in other areas such as literature, with authors such as Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Juan García Ponce and [[Jorge Ibargüengoitia]].&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt; Since the 1950s, the muralism tradition has waned, but it has not ended. While most mural painting in Mexico still has a certain nationalistic purpose, stylistic elements from the Ruptura have been integrated.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;

In addition, literary figure Juan García Ponce was a defender of the movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[José Luis Cuevas]] is considered as the leading artist of the ''"Ruptura"'' (Breakaway) as he was an early and very outspoken critic of the social-realist aesthetics of the Mexican muralist tradition.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Jose Luis Cuevas: un viaje hacia el interior |first= Juan |last= Rodriguez |newspaper=La Opinión |location=Los Angeles |date=September 15, 1995 |page=8E |language=Spanish |trans-title=Jose Luis Cuevas: a voyage to the interior }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite book |title= Performing Mexicanidad : Vendidas y Cabareteras on the Transnational Stage |first= Laura G. |last= Gutiérrez |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX, USA |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-292-72208-8 |page=157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main critiques focus on how the "Muralists" depict the Mexican social composition and lifestyle and how much their works were actually influenced by then-government patronage.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sjsu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gallery.sjsu.edu/mexican_amerixan_tradition/muralists/cuevas.html |title= Jose Luis Cuevas |publisher= San José State University Digital Art Lobby |accessdate= June 2, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121201143020/http://gallery.sjsu.edu/mexican_amerixan_tradition/muralists/cuevas.html# |archive-date= 2012-12-01 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the status quo and his aggressive art style caused extreme reactions towards his work and his own person, including violent public outcries to his work, written insults, personal threats and even a machine-gun attack to his home.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sjsu"/&gt; This has earned him the nickname of ''"l'enfant terrible"'' ("Bad Boy") of Mexican fine arts&lt;ref name="rendiran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Rendirán homenaje al artista plástico José Luis Cuevas |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/832149.html |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=February 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 2, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Will render homage to fine artista José Luis Cuevas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Museo José Luis Cuevas |author= |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/mexico/mexico-city/34335/museo-jose-luis-cuevas/attraction-detail.html |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=June 2, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Remedios Varo]] was a surrealist, not an abstract painter. The kind of painting that she created was based on her wild hallucinations.

[[Alberto Gironella]] was an innovator of his time. His work was so characteristic of him that created a new style called assembly.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This style consisted in creating a work with other parties. He worked with a Spanish theme, because of his background.

[[Mathias Goeritz]] was born in Germany and although it is recognized as an architect and sculptor, studied at the Bauhaus, his inspiration comes from the drawings and art from other artists. His projects are famous such as the Friendship Road to the Olympics in Mexico, held in 1968, the "Big Dipper" at the Palace of Sports and "Satellite Towers" in Mexico.

[[Myra Landau]] (born December 5, 1926) is an artist and painter involved in art research and the first to paint on raw linen. Though born in Bucharest, Romania, , she is known largely for her work while living in Brazil and Mexico. She was married to Miguel Salas Anzures ( head of fine arts, INBA ) who made possible to other ways of artistic expressions and not only the traditional and official art.

'''Helen Singer Kaplan''' (February 6, 1929 – August 17, 1995) was an [[Austrian-American]] [[sex therapist]] and the founder of the first clinic in the United States for [[sexual disorder]]s established at a [[medical school]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Kaplan as someone who was "considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-05 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/19/obituaries/dr-helen-kaplan-66-dies-pioneer-in-sex-therapy-field.html |title=Dr. Helen Kaplan, 66, Dies; Pioneer in Sex Therapy Field |work=The New York Times |date=1995-08-19 |author=Saxon, Wolfgang }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also dubbed the "Sex Queen" because of her role as a pioneer in sex therapy during the [[sexual revolution in 1960s America]], and because of her advocacy of the idea that people should enjoy [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] as much as possible, as opposed to seeing it as something dirty or harmful. The main purpose of her dissertation is to evaluate the psychosexual dysfunctions because these syndromes are among the most prevalent, worrying and distressing medical complaints of modern times.&lt;ref name=pa /&gt;

==Life==
Kaplan was born in [[Vienna]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], on February 6, 1929. In 1940, she emigrated to The United States, becoming a citizen in 1947. She received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] from [[Syracuse University]] in 1951, graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]''. She was then educated at [[Columbia University]], where she received a [[master's degree]] in [[psychology]] in 1952, and then a [[PhD]] in psychology in 1955. At [[New York Medical College]], she earned a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] in 1959, and later completed a comprehensive course in [[psychoanalysis]] there in 1970. In 1964, she initiated a unique residency program for women MDs with children at New York Medical College, the "mother's program" enabled residents to be free during vacations and emergencies to care for their children.&lt;ref&gt;Medical World News, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; She was a long-time professor of psychiatry at [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] and the [[Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic]]. She died of cancer at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; At the time of her death, she was married to [[Toys "R" Us]] founder [[Charles Lazarus]].

==Sex research and therapy==
A psychologist and psychiatrist by training, Kaplan viewed [[Sexual arousal|human sexual response]] as a triphasic phenomenon, consisting of separate—but interlocking—phases: desire, arousal, and orgasm.&lt;ref name=MJK&gt;William H. Masters, Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C. Kolodny, ''Human Sexuality'', 2nd ed.  Little, Brown, &amp; Co., Boston, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  She concluded that "desire" phase disorders are the most difficult to treat, being associated with deep-seated psychological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kaplan, ''Disorders of Sexual Desire''.  Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan wrote extensively on the treatment of sexual dysfunctions, integrating other methods with principles of psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=MJK /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Kaplan, ''The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy''.  Quadrangle/New York Times, New York, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  As did many other experts in her field, Kaplan believed that sexual difficulties typically had superficial origins.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; She suggested that premature ejaculation occurred if the subject did not have voluntary control over when he ejaculated, and that coitally anorgasmic women should not necessarily be thought of as having a problem.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Kaplan, ''The New Sex Therapy''.  Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan always encouraged people to enjoy having sex as much as possible. However, since the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|epidemic of AIDS into the United States]] from 1981 into the 1990s, she has had to add the caveat: "If you aren't extremely careful, it can kill you." Kaplan commented that she "absolutely hate[s] having to say that. [...] I have spent my whole life devising solutions to people's problems, telling them that sex is not dirty or harmful, but a natural function. And now I have to tell them, 'Hey, look out. You could die.'"&lt;ref name=pa&gt;{{cite news |title=Warning Women About AIDS for Years |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=1987-11-08 |author=Hacker, Kathy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her disciples are [[Ruth Westheimer]] and [[Hans-Werner Gessmann]] (in 1976, who added to sex therapy his own humanistic psychological and [[hypnosis]] approaches).

The '''historical-grammatical method''' is a Christian [[biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] method that strives to discover the biblical authors' original intended meaning in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Baker Book House | isbn = 0-8010-3413-2 | last = Elwell | first = Walter A. | title = [[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]] | location = Grand Rapids, Mich. | year = 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary method of interpretation for many conservative [[Protestantism|Protestant]] exegetes who reject the [[historical-critical method]] to various degrees (from the complete rejection of historical criticism of some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Protestants to the moderated acceptance of it in the Roman Catholic tradition since [[Pope]] [[Pius XII]]),&lt;ref&gt;The Biblical Commission's Document "The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church" Text and Commentary; ed. Joseph A. Fitzmyer; Subsidia Biblica 18; Rome: Editrice Pontificio Istituto Bibllico, 1995. See esp. p. 26, "The historical-critical method is the indispensable method for the scientific study of the meaning of ancient texts."&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the overwhelming reliance on historical-critical interpretation, often to the exclusion of all other hermeneutics, in [[liberal Christianity]].

The [[Orthodox Church]] primarily employs a spiritual, [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorizing hermeneutic]] heavily dependent on [[Christian typology|typological]] connections drawn by New Testament writers and the church fathers of the first several centuries of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;See T. G. Stylianopoulos, "Scripture and Tradition in the Church," in The Cambridge Companion to Orthodox Christian Theology (eds. M. Cunningham and E. Theokritoff; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 21-34.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Church]] divides hermeneutic into four senses: the literal, allegorical, moral, and anagogical; however, interpretation is always subject to the Church's [[magisterium]]. The process for determining the original meaning of the text is through examination of the grammatical and syntactical aspects, the historical background, the literary genre as well as theological (canonical) considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Academie Books | isbn = 978-0-310-34160-4 | last = Johnson | first = Elliott | title = Expository hermeneutics : an introduction | location = Grand Rapids  Mich. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The historical-grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning of the text and its significance. The significance of the text is essentially the application or contextualization of the principles from text.

==Original meaning of texts==
The aim of the historical-grammatical method is to discover the meaning of the passage as the original author would have intended and what the original hearers would have understood. The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense. As Milton S. Terry said, "A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection. The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Many practice the historical-grammatical method using the inductive method, a general three-fold approach to the text: observation, interpretation, and application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each step builds upon the other, which follows in order. The first step of observation involves an examination of words, structure, structural relationships and literary forms. After observations are formed, then the second step of interpretation involves asking interpretative questions, formulating answers to those questions, integration and summarization of the passage. After the meaning is derived through interpretation, the third step of application involves determining both the theoretical and practical significance of the text and appropriately applying this significance to today's modern context. There is also a heavy emphasis on personal application that extends into all aspects of the practitioner's life. Theologian Robert Traina, in his 1952 ''Methodical Bible Study'', wrote that "the applicatory step is that for which all else exists. It represents the final purpose of Bible study."&lt;ref name="Traina"&gt;{{Cite book

Technically speaking, the grammatical-historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage's significance in light of that interpretation. Together, interpretation of the passage and determining the meaning define the term "hermeneutics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Comparison with other methods of interpretations==
===Reader-response method===
In the [[reader-response]] method, the focus is on how the book is perceived by the reader, not on the intention of the author. Those who regard the text as divinely inspired and seek to determine the intention of the divine author tend to stay away from this method because of the many interpretations, often contrary to scripture, arising from a reader response of the text without any formal foundation of the text.

===Historical-critical method===
The [[historical-critical method]] is used by many academic Bible scholars in universities, including many Roman Catholic and Protestant institutions. The method uses [[higher criticism]], in an attempt to discover the sources and factors that contributed to the making of the text as well as to determine what it meant to the original audience. Scholars who use the historical-critical method treat the Bible as they would any other text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical-critical scholars as such are also typically less interested in determining what the text means for people today.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} For those reasons, some traditional scholars and conservative Christians tend to reject the method, but even many of them use aspects of it that naturally overlap with the historical-grammatical method, such as attempting to determine what was meant when the passage in question was written.

'''Hospitality management''' is the study of the [[hospitality industry]]. A degree in the subject may be awarded either by a university college dedicated to the studies of  hospitality management or a [[business school]] with a relevant department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is Hospitality management?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hospitality-management.htm|journal=http://www.wisegeek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://srihm.edu.in/ Degrees in hospitality management] may also be referred to as [[Hotel manager|hotel management]], hotel and tourism management, or hotel administration. Degrees conferred in this academic field include [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration]], [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], [[Bachelor of Applied Science|BASc]], [[Master of Science|MS]], [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]. Hospitality management covers [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[amusement parks]], [[destination marketing organization]]s, [[convention center]]s, and [[country club]]s.

==Curriculum==
In the USA, hospitality and tourism management curricula follow similar core subject applications to that of a [[business degree]], but with a focus on tourism development and hospitality management. Core subject areas include [[accounting]], [[administration (business)|administration]], [[finance]], [[information systems]], [[marketing]], [[human resource management]], [[public relations]], [[business strategy|strategy]], [[quantitative methods]], and sectoral studies in the various areas of hospitality business.

===Vegetarian option===
In 2016, Ministry of Tourism, [[Government of India]] started giving hospitality management students the option to choose only vegetarian cooking. This was introduced at three of the institutes (IHMCTAN Ahmedabad, IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur) affiliated with the Ministry. This decision to offer a vegetarian option by IHMCTANs may be the first amongst any of the hospitality training institutes of the world. It is expected that all IHMCTANs in India will start offering a vegetarian cooking option from academic year 2018 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31808&amp;articlexml=IHMs-to-offer-3-yr-course-in-vegetarian-11072016013026|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofjaipur.com/news/2016/07/13/vegetarian-cooking-courses-to-be-introduced-in-hotel-management-institutes/|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nchmcounselling.nic.in/nchminfo/Public/View.aspx?page=79 |title=NCHM Counselling 2018 |publisher=Nchmcounselling.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|thumb|upright=1.55|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Impression, soleil levant]]'' (''Impression, Sunrise''), 1872, oil on canvas, [[Musée Marmottan Monet]], [[Paris]]. This painting became the source of the movement's name, after [[Louis Leroy]]'s article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'' satirically implied that the painting was at most, a sketch.]]
'''Impressionism''' is a 19th-century [[art movement]] characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of ''movement'' as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a [[Claude Monet]] work, ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which provoked the critic [[Louis Leroy]] to [[word coinage|coin]] the term in a [[satire|satirical]] review published in the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]''.

The development of Impressionism in the [[visual arts]] was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as [[impressionist music]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist literature]].

==Overview==
[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s atmospheric work was influential on the birth of Impressionism, here ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'' (1839)]]

Radicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, [[still life]]s and [[portrait]]s as well as [[landscape art|landscapes]] were usually painted in a studio.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions include [[Canaletto#Outdoor painting|Canaletto]], who painted outside and may have used the [[camera obscura]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or ''[[en plein air]]''. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short "broken" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour—not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary—to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.

[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])'', 1876, [[Musée d'Orsay]], one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=AXdOAAAAYAAJ Ingo F. Walther, ''Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies from the Gothic to the Present Day, Part 1''], Centralibros Hispania Edicion y Distribucion, S.A., 1999, {{ISBN|3822870315}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Impressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the [[Macchiaioli]], and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States, were also exploring ''plein-air'' painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.

The public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.  By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], and [[Cubism]].

==Beginnings==
In the middle of the 19th century—a time of change, as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] rebuilt Paris and waged war—the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] dominated French art. The Académie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Académie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaya, Impressionism, Parkstone International, 2014, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm Samu, Margaret. "Impressionism: Art and Modernity". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Académie had an annual, juried art show, the [[Salon de Paris]], and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Académie, represented by the works of such artists as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].

In the early 1860s, four young painters—[[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[Frédéric Bazille]]—met while studying under the academic artist [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air,&lt;ref&gt;White, Harrison C., Cynthia A. White (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2D_ehhO_14QC&amp;pg=PA116 Canvases and Careers: Institutional Change in the French Painting World]''. University of Chicago Press. p. 116. {{ISBN|0226894878}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the [[realism (arts)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]]. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the [[Café Guerbois]] on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by [[Édouard Manet]], whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Armand Guillaumin]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Taube G. "Armand Guillaumin", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]], ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]
During the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style.&lt;ref&gt;Seiberling, Grace, "Impressionism", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' ''([[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]])'' primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.

After Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the [[Salon des Refusés]] (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refusés drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alfred Sisley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Sisley]], ''View of the Saint-Martin Canal, Paris'', 1870, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
Artists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refusés in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Edgar Degas]] and several other artists founded the ''Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' ("Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers") to exhibit their artworks independently.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1994, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older [[Eugène Boudin]], whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt ''plein air'' painting years before.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, [[Johan Jongkind]], declined to participate, as did [[Édouard Manet]]. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]].

[[File:Claude Monet - Graystaks I.JPG|thumb|left|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks, (sunset)]]'', 1890–1891, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]
The critical response was mixed. Monet and Cézanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist [[Louis Leroy]] wrote a scathing review in the newspaper ''Le Charivari'' in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' ''(Impression, soleil levant)'', he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'', Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.

He wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,
:''Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.''&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'' (Camille and Jean Monet), 1875, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The term ''Impressionist'' quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together—albeit with shifting membership—eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the "purest" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon; Forge (1988), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader,&lt;ref&gt;Distel et al. (1974), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting ''Spanish Singer'' had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that "the Salon is the real field of battle" where a reputation could be made.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1976), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camille Pissarro - Boulevard Montmartre - Eremitage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Boulevard Montmartre'', 1897, the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
Among the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870), defections occurred as Cézanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and Cézanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; Degas invited [[Mary Cassatt]] to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of [[Jean-François Raffaëlli]], [[Ludovic-Napoléon Lepic|Ludovic Lepic]], and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of "opening doors to first-come daubers".&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; The group divided over invitations to [[Paul Signac]] and [[Georges Seurat]] to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.

The individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Distel, Anne, Michel Hoog, and Charles S. Moffett. 1974. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dhc-U0t14vMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq= ''Impressionism; a Centenary Exhibition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 12, 1974–February 10, 1975'']. [New York]: [Metropolitan Museum of Art]. p. 190. {{ISBN|0870990977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet became secure financially during the early 1880s and so did Pissarro by the early 1890s. By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 475–476.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impressionist techniques==
[[File:Cassatt Mary At the Theater 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''Lydia Leaning on Her Arms'' (in a theatre box), 1879]]
French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] colourist [[Eugène Delacroix]], the leader of the realists [[Gustave Courbet]], and painters of the [[Barbizon school]] such as [[Théodore Rousseau]]. The Impressionists learned much from the work of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Eugène Boudin]], who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.

A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists—and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Constable]], and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Turner]]—the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:

* Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied [[impasto]].
* Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of [[simultaneous contrast]] to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.
* Grays and dark tones are produced by mixing [[complementary colour]]s. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.
* [[Wet-on-wet|Wet paint is placed into wet paint]] without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.
* Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.
* The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds. 
* The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce ''[[effets de soir]]''—the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.
* In paintings made ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)

New technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105173433/http://phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf |date=2011-01-05 }}.

Many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These included [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]], and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism.&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"/&gt; The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as [[cerulean blue]],&lt;ref name="The Met"/&gt; which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"&gt;Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pdFOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= ''Historical painting techniques, materials, and studio practice: preprints of a symposium, University of Leiden, Netherlands, 26-29 June, 1995'']. [Marina Del Rey, Calif.]: Getty Conservation Institute. p. 159. {{ISBN|0892363223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.&lt;ref name="Hill_177"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012).

London: Routledge. p. 177]. {{ISBN|1136000410}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting.&lt;ref name="Hill_177"/&gt; By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1msM3h9mbaoC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq= ''The conservation of easel paintings''. London: Routledge. p. 178]. {{ISBN|1136000410}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and composition==
[[File:Hay Harvest at Éragny, 1901, Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Hay Harvest at Éragny,'' 1901, [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]]]
Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such [[Dutch Golden Age painting|17th-century Dutch painters]] as [[Jan Steen]], had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] were traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum (1989), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photography]] was gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people.&lt;ref&gt;Varnedoe, J. Kirk T. ''The Artifice of Candor: Impressionism and Photography Reconsidered'', Art in America 68, January 1980, pp. 66-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Robert L. ''Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society'', Yale University Press, 1988, pp. 311, 319 {{ISBN|0300050836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berthe Morisot Reading.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berthe Morisot]], ''Reading,'' 1873, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]
The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and [[Landscape art|landscape]] paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography "produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably".&lt;ref name = "impressionism757"/&gt;

In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused "on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph—by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated".&lt;ref name = "impressionism757"/&gt; The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their "tacit imperatives of taste and conscience".&lt;ref name="impressionism758"&gt;Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London&lt;/ref&gt; Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: "The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph".&lt;ref name="impressionism757"&gt;Levinson, Paul (1997) ''The Soft Edge; a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Claude Monet - Jardin à Sainte-Adresse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Garden at Sainte-Adresse|Jardin à Sainte-Adresse]],'' 1867, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437133?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ao=on&amp;ft=Claude+Monet&amp;pos=1 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; a work showing the influence of Japanese prints]]
Another major influence was Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] art prints ([[Japonism]]). The art of these prints contributed significantly to the "snapshot" angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's ''Jardin à Sainte-Adresse'', 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kLEpf5a49V0C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=Terrasse+%C3%A0+Sainte-Adresse+japanese+prints&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dwnPUtm_GKnNsQTV-4KIDA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Terrasse%20%C3%A0%20Sainte-Adresse%20japanese%20prints&amp;f=false Gary Tinterow, Origins of Impressionism, Metropolitan Museum of Art,1994, page 433]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Degas]] was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann; Karabelnik, et al. (1994), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Dance Class'' ''(La classe de danse)'' of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the ''[[Little Dancer of Fourteen Years]]''.

==Associates and influenced artists==
[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'', 1874, [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]]]
Among the close associates of the Impressionists were several painters who adopted their methods to some degree. These include [[Jean-Louis Forain]] (who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1886)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/joconde/fr/decouvrir/expositions/impressionnisme/theme_imprart.htm|title=Joconde : catalogue collectif des collections des musées de France|website=www.culture.gouv.fr|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giuseppe De Nittis]], an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Zandomeneghi]] was another Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. [[Eva Gonzalès]] was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. [[Walter Sickert]], an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer [[Wynford Dewhurst]] wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, ''Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development'', which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.

By the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as [[Jean Béraud]] and [[Henri Gervex]] found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p.476–477.&lt;/ref&gt; Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.

The influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like [[Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum|J.D. Kirszenbaum]] were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.

==Beyond France==
[[File:Serov devochka s persikami.jpg|thumb|''[[Girl with Peaches|The Girl with Peaches]]'' (1887, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]) by [[Valentin Serov]]]]
[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Streeton]]'s 1889 landscape ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'', held at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], is an example of [[Heidelberg School|Australian impressionism]].]]

As the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists, too numerous to list, became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important examples are:
* The [[American Impressionism|American Impressionists]], including [[Mary Cassatt]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Willard Metcalf]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Theodore Robinson]], [[Edmund C. Tarbell|Edmund Charles Tarbell]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], [[Catherine Wiley]] and [[J. Alden Weir]].
* The [[Australian Impressionism|Australian Impressionists]], including [[Tom Roberts]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Walter Withers]], [[Charles Conder]] and [[Frederick McCubbin]] (who were prominent members of the [[Heidelberg School]]), and [[John Peter Russell]], a friend of Van Gogh, Rodin, Monet and Matisse.
* The [[Amsterdam Impressionism|Amsterdam Impressionists]] in the [[Netherlands]], including [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Isaac Israëls]], [[Willem Bastiaan Tholen]], [[Willem de Zwart]], [[Willem Witsen]] and [[Jan Toorop]].
* [[Anna Boch]], Vincent van Gogh's friend [[Eugène Boch]], [[Georges Lemmen]] and [[Théo van Rysselberghe]], Impressionist painters from [[Belgium]].
* [[Ivan Grohar]], [[Rihard Jakopič]], [[Matija Jama]], and [[Matej Sternen]], Impressionists from Slovenia. Their beginning was in the school of [[Anton Ažbe]] in Munich and they were influenced by [[Jurij Šubic]] and [[Ivana Kobilca]], Slovenian painters working in Paris
* [[Wynford Dewhurst]], [[Walter Richard Sickert]], and [[Philip Wilson Steer]] were well known Impressionist painters from the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Pierre Adolphe Valette]], who was born in France but who worked in Manchester, was the tutor of [[L. S. Lowry]].
* The [[German Impressionism|German Impressionists]], including [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[Ernst Oppler]], [[Max Slevogt]] and [[August von Brandis]].
* [[László Mednyánszky]] in Hungary
* [[Theodor von Ehrmanns]] and [[Hugo Charlemont]] who were rare Impressionists among the more dominant [[Vienna Secessionist]] painters in Austria
* [[William John Leech]], [[Roderic O'Conor]], and [[Walter Osborne]] in Ireland
* [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[Valentin Serov]] in Russia
* [[Francisco Oller|Francisco Oller y Cestero]], a native of [[Puerto Rico]] and a friend of Pissarro and Cézanne
* [[James Nairn]] in [[New Zealand]].
* [[William McTaggart]] in [[Scotland]].
* [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] artist
* [[Władysław Podkowiński]], a [[Poland|Polish]] Impressionist and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]

* [[Nadežda Petrović]] in [[Serbia]]
* [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]] in [[Iceland]]
* [[Fujishima Takeji]] in [[Japan]]
* [[Frits Thaulow]] in [[Norway]] and later France.

==Sculpture, photography and film==
The sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] is sometimes called an Impressionist for the way he used roughly modeled surfaces to suggest transient light effects.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S., and Helen Gardner (2014). ''Gardner's art through the ages: a concise Western history''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. p. 382. {{ISBN|9781133954798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.

[[French Impressionist Cinema]] is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919–1929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Germaine Dulac]], Marcel L’Herbier, [[Louis Delluc]], and Dmitry Kirsanoff.

==Music and literature==
{{Main|Impressionist music|Impressionism (literature)}}
[[File:Monet Water Lilies 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Water Lilies]],'' 1916, [[The National Museum of Western Art]], Tokyo]]
Musical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in [[European classical music]] that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the [[nocturne]], [[Arabesque (classical music)|arabesque]], and [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], and often explored uncommon scales such as the [[whole tone scale]]. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.

The influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. [[Erik Satie]] was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. [[Paul Dukas]] is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as [[Ottorino Respighi]] (Italy) [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Cyril Scott]], and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (England), and [[Manuel De Falla]], and [[Isaac Albeniz]] (Spain).

The term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with its major exemplars being [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]. Authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and [[Joseph Conrad]] have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.

[[File:Camille Pissarro 019.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Children on a Farm'', 1887]]

==Post-Impressionism==
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Post-Impressionism developed from Impressionism. During the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; [[Camille Pissarro]] briefly painted in a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] manner, and even Monet abandoned strict ''plein air'' painting. [[Paul Cézanne]], who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.

The '''Institute of Forestry''' ('''IoF''', {{lang-ne|वन विज्ञान अध्ययन संस्थान}}) is one of the five technical institutes under [[Tribhuvan University]], Nepal's largest academic institution. Under the Department of Forests, the IoF was founded as Nepal Forestry Institute in 1947 in [[Singha Durbar]]. However, it was relocated to [[Bhimphedi]] in 1957, then to [[Hetauda]] in 1965, before being incorporated into TU from 1972. The current head office of the institute, usually referred to as the ''dean's office'', is housed at Pokhara Campus.&lt;ref name="iofpc"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.iofpc.edu.np/about-us|website=iofpc.edu.np|publisher=Institute of Forestry, Pokhara Campus|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Forestry|url=http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/institutes/institute-of-forestry/|website=tribhuvan-university.edu.np|publisher=[[Tribhuvan University]]|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IoF implements forestry-related academic programs through its two constituent campuses, located in [[Pokhara]] and [[Hetauda]].&lt;ref name="edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Forestry, Pokhara Campus|url=http://edusanjal.com/college/institute-forestry-pokhara-campus|website=edusanjal.com|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current dean of the institute is Krishna Raj Tiwari, and he is backed by two assistant deans, presently Yajna P.

[[Image:Singes Sosen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Monkeys'' by [[Mori Sosen]]]]

The '''Kyoto school''' (京都派 ''-ha'') was a collection of several styles and schools of [[Japanese painting]] of the late [[Edo period]]. Though there are many broad similarities between the styles within the school, these styles display key differences that separate them. Many were in fact reactions to one another, an artist or group of artists seeking to express themselves differently from those around them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideals of the East: The Spirit of Japanese Art|last=Okakura|first=Kakuzo|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=978-0-486-44024-8|location=Mineola, New York|pages=87-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those subscribers of the Kyoto school found themselves at odds with the state sanctioned Kanō school, thus contributing to the vague nature of the former. 

[[Okakura Kakuzō|Kakuzo Okakura]], predominant Japanese art historian of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, traced the origins of the Kyoto school to the schools of both [[Qing dynasty|Manchu-shin]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties in China. The two latter schools focused on the power of the artist as a lay person or scholar, as opposed to a professional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Okakura is swift with a critique of the Kyoto school's attempts to repurpose the Japanese tradition of copying works from other (predominantly Chinese) cultures, a technique known as ''[[utsushi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kameda-Madar|first=Kazuko|date=2014-09-01|title=Copying and Theory in Edo-Period Japan (1615–1868)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8365.12111/abstract|journal=Art History|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=708–727|doi=10.1111/1467-8365.12111|issn=1467-8365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more prominent schools under the Kyoto school umbrella was the [[Shijo school|Shijō school]], named after the street where many of the artists had their studios. ''Shijō'' (四条) literally translates to 'fourth avenue.' This school sought to produce a synthesis of the more realistic style of [[Maruyama Okyo|Maruyama Ōkyo]] with that of the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' or Southern School styles. [[Mori Sosen]] was one of the more prominent painters in the Shijō school.

The ''nanga'' or Southern School, meanwhile, rebelled against the realism of Ōkyo and the Shijō artists, seeking to return to the inspiration and style of [[Chinese painting|China's]] [[Southern School]].

[[File:Sirjonathansacks.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Sacks Principal 1984-1990]]
The '''London School of Jewish Studies''' (commonly known as '''LSJS''', originally founded as '''Jews' College''')  is a [[London]]-based organisation providing adult educational courses and training to the wider Jewish community. Since 2012 LSJS also offers rabbinical training, returning to its roots.  

Many leading figures in British Jewry have been associated with the School, including [[Michael Friedländer]], Principal from 1865 to 1907;  [[Isidore Epstein]], Principal 1948–1961; [[Louis Jacobs]], Moral Tutor 1959–1961; and in recent years [[Jonathan Sacks]] (later [[Lord Sacks]]), Principal 1984–1990.

==History==
The '''London School of Jewish Studies''' was founded as '''Jews' College''' in 1855, a rabbinical seminary in [[London]]. The organisation was re-focussed and given its present name in 1999, with an emphasis on providing a broader range of adult educational courses and training to the wider Jewish community.  The rabbinical training programme was suspended, and much of the historical holdings of the library were sold off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/hebraica/lsjsrep.html Hebraica Libraries Group Report: London School of Jewish Studies], via Cambridge University Library, accessed 11 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  LSJS has had growing success in its new role, and since 2012 once again offers rabbinical training, in partnership with the programme set up by the London Sephardi community.

===Jews' College===
'''Jews' College''' was opened in [[Finsbury Square]], [[London]] as a rabbinical seminary in 1855 with the support of [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Nathan Marcus Adler|Nathan Adler]] and of [[Sir Moses Montefiore]], who had conceived the idea for such a venture as early as 1841. The college quickly established itself as a place where high quality [[rabbi]]nical training was available and its alumni and staff often became prominent in [[Anglo-Jewry]].

In 1881, the College moved to larger premises in [[Tavistock Square]], close to [[University College London|University College]], where it was envisaged that Jews’ College students would be able to combine their religious studies and university studies to degree level. As early as  1904, the [[University of London]] granted an [[Honours degree]] in Hebrew and Aramaic, all of the candidates being from Jews’ College. In 1932, with the building of [[Woburn House]], a centre for Anglo-Jewry, still in Tavistock Square, Jews' College moved again.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], despite the [[The Blitz|bombing of London]], the College kept its doors open. Apart from the rabbinical studies and degree course, [[Chazzan]]ut courses and teacher training programmes were now offered.

In 1954, the College moved, yet again, to larger premises in [[Montagu Place]]. That building in central London was sold in the early 1980s, and now houses the [[Embassy of Sweden, London|Embassy of Sweden]].  The College operated from temporary premises at Finchley Synagogue for a number of years, under the leadership of Rabbi Dr [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]. Under the auspices of Rabbi Dr [[Jonathan Sacks]] and with the financial backing of [[Stanley Kalms]], chairman of [[Dixons Retail|Dixons]], the College relocated in 1984 to its current building, now known as Schaller House, in [[Hendon]], North-West London, close to the hub of London’s Jewish community.

===London School of Jewish Studies===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
In 1998, the University of London announced that it would be terminating the "Associated Institute" status that the College and three other small institutions enjoyed. Jews' College was forced to seek an academic partner within the University in order to be able to continue its degree programmes. Without the freedom to determine its own curriculum and the financial security that came from student fee income, it became increasingly difficult for the College to survive in its previous form. Rabbinic training was also uneconomic as many students looked to the Torah centres of Israel and America for their education and the number of available rabbinic posts in the UK decreased.

In 2002, the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS) decided to terminate its relationship with LSJS, which threatened the organisation's status. A small team of young community leaders and educators, led by the late Marc Weinberg, presented the then Chair of Council, Howard Stanton, with a proposal to use the human and financial resources available to refocus the School's activities and to secure its future as a hub of academic study and lifelong learning, catering to a wide spectrum of the community.

Since then, under the leadership of Dr Raphael Zarum and Dr Tamra Wright, LSJS has welcomed hundreds of students to a range of academic courses and events. In addition to numerous community focused offerings, more formal programs include:
*The LSJS, as of 2012, offers a ''[[Semicha]]'' programme  [http://www.lsjs.ac.uk/london-montefiore-semicha-programme-2/], in conjunction with [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews#In Britain|The Judith Lady Montefiore College]]. The part-time programme is of four years' duration (38 study weeks per year; 16 lecture hours per week). The course focuses on Halacha, but the curriculum also includes [[Tanakh]], history and ethics, as well as practical community-directed subjects such as counselling, public speaking, life events, [[Hazzan|''hazanut'']] and teaching skills.[http://www.montefioreendowment.org.uk/college/semicha/] 
*LSJS also hosts The Montefiore [[Kollel]],[http://www.montefioreendowment.org.uk/college/kollel/] comprising an "intensive" one-year programme focused on in-depth [[Gemara#Argumentation and debate|Gemara study]] with emphasis on [[halacha|halachic applications]]. Applicants to the Semicha programme may be required to first spend one year in the Kollel.
*The LSJS also, once again, offers various degree opportunities: the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in [[Jewish Studies]] with [[King's College, London]] [http://www.lsjs.ac.uk/research-and-degrees/]; and the [[BA (Hons)]] and MA in [[Jewish education]] [http://www.lsjs.ac.uk/ba-hons-jewish-education/] with [[Middlesex University]].

==Alei Tzion==
The London School of Jewish Studies also houses the synagogue Alei Tzion. The synagogue refers to itself as a "young and vibrant congregation ". Services take place regularly. These include; Shacharit, Mincha and Maariv prayer. The highlight of the week are the complete shabbat services which include 2 children's services.

&lt;!-- no separate rationale for this article [[Image:Minerva logo.gif|right|frame]] --&gt;
The '''Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics''' ('''MPA''') is a research institute located in [[Garching bei München|Garching]], just north of [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is one of many [[scientific research]] institutes belonging to the Max Planck Society.

The MPA is widely considered to be one of the leading institutions in the world for [[theoretical astrophysics]] research.
According to [[Thomson Reuters]], from 1999-2009 the Max Planck Society as a whole published more papers and accumulated more citations in the fields of [[physics]] and [[space science]] than any other research organization in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencewatch.com/inter/ins/09/09Top20Overall/], Thomson Reuters Science Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Max Planck Society]] was founded on 26 February 1948. It effectively replaced the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] for the Advancement of Science, which was dissolved after [[World War II]]. The society is named after [[Max Planck]], one of the founders of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

The MPA was founded as [[Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics]] in 1958 and split into the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] in 1991. In 1995, the numerical relativity group moved to the [[Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics]].

==Organization==
The MPA is one of several Max Planck Institutes that specialize in [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]]. Others are the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] in Garching (located next-door to the MPA), the [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]] in Heidelberg, the [[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]] in Bonn, the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] in Göttingen, and the [[Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics]] (a.k.a. Albert Einstein Institute) in Golm.

The institute is located next-door to the MPI for Extraterrestrial Physics, as well as the headquarters of the [[European Southern Observatory]]. It also enjoys close working relationships with the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and [[Technical University Munich]].

At any given time, the institute employs approximately 50 scientists, instructs over 30 PhD students, and hosts about 20 visiting scientists (some 60 visitors stay for longer than 2 weeks in any given year).

As of 2018, the four directors of the MPA are [[Guinevere Kauffmann]], [[Eiichiro Komatsu]], [[Volker Springel]], and [[Simon White]].

==Science==
Focusing on theoretical investigations, the MPA covers a wide range of topics in [[astrophysics]]. These include:
* '''[[Physical cosmology|Cosmology]]''', in particular [[galaxy formation and evolution]], [[reionization]], and the [[cosmic microwave background]];
* '''[[High-energy astronomy]] and astrophysics''', including [[supermassive black holes]], [[galaxy clusters]], [[active galactic nuclei]] and [[quasars]], [[X-ray binaries]], and [[accretion disc]]s;
* '''[[Stellar physics]]''', including [[stellar evolution]] and stellar explosions such as [[supernovae]] and [[gamma-ray bursts]].

==Public outreach==
The MPA works to explain astrophysical concepts and disseminate its findings to the public. These activities include popular science articles written by MPA scientists, events hosting school groups, events open to the general public, and monthly research highlights written for a general audience.

==Graduate program==
The International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Astrophysics is a graduate program offering a PhD in [[astrophysics]]. The school is a cooperation with the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] and [[Technical University Munich]].

The '''McGovern Institute for Brain Research''' is a research institute within [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Its mission is to understand how the brain works and to discover new ways to prevent or treat brain disorders.   The institute was founded in 2000 by [[Patrick Joseph McGovern|Patrick McGovern]] and [[Lore Harp McGovern]] with a gift to MIT that is expected to total $350M over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/neurorelease.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The director is [[Robert Desimone]], formerly director of intramural research at the [[National Institute for Mental Health]].  The 19 current faculty members include a Nobel laureate ([[H. Robert Horvitz]]), a winner of the US National Medal of Science ([[Ann Graybiel]]) and 6 members of the US National Academy of Sciences (Desimone, Horvitz, Graybiel, and Feng Zhang, along with [[Emilio Bizzi]] and [[Nancy Kanwisher]]).   The founding director (2000-2004) was [[Phillip Sharp]], also a Nobel Laureate. 

The McGovern Institute conducts research into all aspects of brain function, including perception, cognition and action. It also conducts clinical and translational research on a wide range of brain disorders.

The Institute’s core facilities include the Martinos Imaging Center, which provides neuroimaging technologies for human and animal research, including [[MRI]], [[EEG]] and [[magnetoencephalography|MEG]].

The McGovern Institute occupies approximately 85,000 sq ft (net) within the MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences Complex.  This building, which was completed in 2005, also houses the [[Picower Institute for Learning and Memory]] and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and is among the largest neuroscience research buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/bcs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was designed by Indian architect [[Charles Correa]] in collaboration with the Boston-based firm [[Goody, Clancy &amp; Associates, Inc]].  It is one of the most distinctive landmarks on the MIT campus, notable especially for the [[Grand Junction Railroad and Depot Company|Grand Junction railroad]] that runs through the center of the building.

'''Mongol elements in Western medieval art''' can be seen in European works of art ranging from the 13th to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;The subject has been especially described by Rosamond E. Mack, in ''Bazaar to Piazza: Islamic Trade and Italian Art, 1300–1600''.&lt;/ref&gt; They encompass artistic areas such as painting and textile manufacture, and mainly consist in the European use of [[Mongol]] [['Phags-pa script]] in Medieval European art, as well as the representation of "Tartar" cloth and Mongol soldiers in a number of contemporary European paintings.

==Mongol script in medieval art==
[[File:Master Of The Isaac Stories - The Doctors of the Church (detail) - WGA14568.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Saint Jerome]] reading a pseudo-Mongol script, consisting of an imitation of blocks of [['Phags-pa script|'Phags-pa letters]], written horizontally rather than vertically. 1296–1300, Church of San Francesco Assisi.&lt;ref&gt;"Texts of Jerome (Fig.43; destroyed in the 1997 earthquake), Augustine, and Pope gregory I are written in squared units of vertical, horizontal, and curved strokes that can be called pseudo-Mongol. Though the artist has aligned the units horizontally on the page in Western style, the script itself imitates 'Phags Pa, which is written vertically", [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the period of interaction between the Mongols and the West, from the late 13th century to early 14th century, some Italian painters incorporated Mongol script (particularly the 'Phags-pa script) into their religious painting.&lt;ref name="Mack 51"&gt;"During the Pax Mongolica a few Italian painters imitated a Mongol script called 'Phags Pa", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA51 Mack p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kann 94"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2dt9WrHyed4C&amp;pg=PA94 ''The art, science, and technology of medieval travel'' by Andrea Kann p.94]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can be seen especially in the frescos of the Upper Church of San Francesco at [[Assisi]], or in the paintings of [[Giotto]] and related painters.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Assisi painters, and Giotto as is shown below, were imitating a Mongol script before 1307, when reports of Friar [[John of Montecorvino]]'s success in Beijing arrived in the West, precipitating major missionary efforts in central Asia and China" [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA51 Mack, p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liu Yigong 1324.jpg|thumb|Christian tombstone from [[Quanzhou]] with Mongol [['Phags-pa script|'Phags-pa]] inscriptions, 1324.&lt;ref name="Johnson 73"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWTDfRythVkC&amp;pg=PA73 ''Jesus on the Silk Road'' by Dale A. Johnson p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
These inscriptions often imitated the Mongol 'Phags-pa, probably discovered by the artists through Mongol paper money or ''[[paiza]]'' (travel passes) such as those [[Marco Polo]] was issued with during his travels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; Frescos of [[Saint Jerome]], [[Augustine]] and [[Pope Gregory I]] in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Church of San Francesco]] in [[Assisi]] (1296–1300) are known where they study books written in pseudo-Mongol.&lt;ref&gt;"The texts of Jerome (Fig.43, destroyed in the 1997 earthquake), Augustine and Pope Gregory I are written in squared units of vertical, horizontal, and curved strokes that can be called pseudo-Mongol. Though the artist has aligned the units horizontally on the page in Western style, the script itself imitates 'Pags Pa, which is written vertically" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Renaissance painter Giotto and his pupils often combined Arabic and 'Phags-pa script in their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA54 Mack, p.54]&lt;/ref&gt; In Giotto's ''The Crucifixion'' (1304-1312/1313), soldiers wear tunics inscribed with pseudo-Mongol bands.&lt;ref name="Mack 61"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA61 Mack, p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; In Giotto's ''Madonna and Child'' (1320–1330), the [[Virgin Mary]]'s robe is decorated with a hem in a mix of Arabic and Mongol script.&lt;ref name="Mack 61"/&gt; Giotto again used the Mongolian script in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

Besides the influence of exchanges between the Western and Mongol realms during the period, the exact reason for the incorporation of Mongol script in early Renaissance painting is unclear. It seems that Westerners believed 13–14th century Middle-Eastern scripts (such as Mongol and Arabic) to be the same as the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found it natural to represent early Christians in association with them.  This may have been partly because some objects from the Islamic era with inscriptions were treated as relics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52], [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA69 Mack, p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason might be that artist wished to express a cultural universality for the Christian faith, by blending together various written languages, at a time when the church had strong international ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;"Because the Arabic and 'Pag Pa were associated with the Holy Land and the Early Christian Era, the frames could emphasize the origin and age of the images they surround. Perhaps they marked the imagery of a universal faith, an artistic intention consistent with the Church's contemporary international program." [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA69 Mack, p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the usage of Mongol cultural markers was also a way to express the eastern links of European religious orders such as the Franciscans.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

In the East, a certain degree of cultural and artistic interaction is known due to the development of [[Christianity among the Mongols]]. The use of the Mongol script in association with representations of Christianity can be seen for example in [[Nestorian Christian]] steles, such as those found in [[Quanzhou]] which are dated to the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Johnson 73"/&gt;

The use of [['Phags-pa script|Phags-pa]] Mongol script in Medieval European painting had remained unnoticed however, until it was first identified in the 1980s by the Japanese scholar Hidemichi Tanaka.&lt;ref&gt;"Hidemichi Tanaka in a brilliant insight has persuasively established that Giotto was exposed to Mongol ''Phags-pa'' script, and that he used it as a decorative motif at [[Padua]] and elsewhere." in [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA124 Arnold, p.124]&lt;/ref&gt; His findings were published in his 1983 paper ''The Mongolian Script in Giotto Paintings at the Scrovegni Chapel at Padova''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mongolian Script in Giotto Paintings at the Scrovegni Chapel at Padova'' in Europäische Kunst um 1300, Akten des XXV. Internationalen Kongresses für Kunstgechichte, 1983 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f1HJjUB8FhIC&amp;pg=PA96 ''The oliphant: Islamic objects in historical context'' Avinoam Shalem p.96 Note 56]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kufic]] Arabic script is even more often used in a similar way, known as [[Pseudo-Kufic]].

==Mongol Empire "Tatar" textiles in medieval art==
[[File:Simone Martini 078.jpg|thumb|'''Fig. 23''': Small-patterned Tartar-style textiles are worn by [[Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] in the ''[[Annunciation with St Margaret and St Ansanus|Annunciation]]'' by [[Simone Martini]] (1333).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35-36]: "A well-documented example of a delayed but creative Italian response to the new Tatar cloths is that of the tiny-pattern design, in which small leaves or plants and animals rhythmically organized in dense, allover composition. (...) During the early fourteenth century, the Angevins of Naples donated numerous Tatar cloths, including velvets, to San Franceso at Assisi. Since Simone executed the painting in Naples, the Tatar cloths, as well as Oriental carpets -also the earliest in Italian painting- and a particular crozier in Figure 65 probably represent prized artifacts at king Robert's court. Later Simone brillantly captured the vibrant shimmering effect of the tiny pattern on a white ground in the archangel Gabriel's robe in the ''Annunciation'' painted for the cathedral of Sienna in 1333 (Fig. 23)" – [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold 121"&gt;"Simone Martini (...) depicted this angel wearing a robe of Mongol ''nasij'' cloth -a gold working of leaves on a white background- usually described in western inventories as ''panno tartarico albo ad floria aurea''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA121 ''Princely gifts and papal treasures'' by Lauren Arnold p.121]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Around 1300, an influx of Mongol Empire textiles found their way to Italy, and were to prove quite influential in Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pax Mongolica brought an influx of influential "Tatar" textiles into Italy about 1300 (see for example Fig. 22, 25, 32) and left its mark on fourteenth-century Italian art in Mongol figures, costumes (see Fig. 160), and script (see Fig. 43, 49) in paintings and in references to monuments along the caravan routes on the facades of the Doge's Palace in Venice (see Fig. 10)" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; These textiles even revolutionized Italian textile designs.&lt;ref&gt;"The fabrics that revolutionized Italian textile design beginning about the 1330s were the Tatar cloths arriving from Central Asia and Syria during the Pax Mongolica. Though they were foremost among imports in the Papal collections, probably thanks to [[diplomatic gift]]s from the [[Il-Khanate|Il-Khanids]] of Persia, the new imports attracted no attention from Italian painters for two more decades and from local designers for three.", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1265 and 1308, communications between Western and [[Il-Khanate|Il-Khanid]] rulers led to numerous exchanges of people and presents, as when about 100 Mongols in Mongol dress visited Rome for the [[Papal Jubilee]] of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of ''panni tartarici'' ([[Tatar]] cloth) were recorded in the Papal inventory of 1295, and must have been diplomatic gifts from the Il-Khanate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18], [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Western merchants were also able to purchase such textiles from [[Tabriz]], and the Mongol capital of [[Sultaniya]], established by [[Öljaitü]] between 1305 and 1313, and until the capture of the [[Cilician Armenia]] harbour of [[Ayas, Adana|Ayas]] by the [[Mamluk]]s in 1347.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA16 Mack, p.16-17]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tatar cloths were a produce of transcultural exchange under Mongol rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack p.35]: "Tatars cloths were themselves products of transcultural exchange. As the nomadic Mongol warriors became imperial rulers, they adopted many aspects of the sophisticated textile cultures in conquered Islamic lands and developed a preference for silk lavishly ornamented with gold threads. Customarily, the Mongols spared skilled weavers -both Muslim and Chinese- from the sword, distributed them as booty, and transported them to new workshops scattered across the empire. Captive artisans served royal courts, the military and government officials, who were often recruited from the conquered. For example, it is known that [[Herat]]i and Chinese craftsmen worked together, and some Herati were sent back to their homes in eastern Persia (now Afghanistan). The cultural mix among the imperial elite and the craftsmen working for them resulted in a rich and distinctive blend of Islamic and Chinese techniques and patterns."&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as Mongol ''nasij'' cloth, coming from Mongol, by author Lauren Arnold.&lt;ref name="Arnold 121"/&gt;

[[File:Boniface VIII with Tartar cloth.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Boniface VIII]] at the 1300 jubilee with a "Tartar cloth" in front of him, with a "rhythmic Sino-Mongolian pattern".&lt;ref&gt;"In this fragment of the fresco, attributed to Giotto, Pope [[Boniface VIII]] proclaims the jubilee year of 1300. Over the balcony is a "Tartar cloth", one of the many silks presented by the Persian [[Mongol]] ruler, and distinguished by its rhythmic '''Sino-Mongolian''' pattern" "Silk" p.41 [https://books.google.com/books?id=LpVdUddNkGUC&amp;pg=PA41].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mongol Empire textiles had a strong impact on Italian textile design from around 1330.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; A type of Tartar cloth that was adopted in the West consisted in small-pattern designs in dense composition. This sort of textile is represented in the clothing of the angel Gabriel in the ''[[The Annunciation (Simone Martini)|Annunciation]]'' by [[Simone Martini]] (1333).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35-36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other designs involved naturally flowing compositions of flowers and vines with fantastic animals.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.37"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA37 Mack, p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a textile is depicted as the background curtain in [[Giotto]]'s ''Coronation of the Virgin'' (circa 1330), the earliest such depiction of a Tartar cloth.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.37"/&gt; Chinese types of floral designs were also adopted, as visible in the mantles of Christ and Mary in ''Coronation of the Virgin'' by [[Paolo Veneziano]] (circa 1350).&lt;ref name="Mack, p.38"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA38 Mack, p.38]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission of Chinese textile designs from the Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]] also occurred: Textiles of [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] in the 14th century incorporated Chinese [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] designs in silk and gold thread, and Italian weavers adopted such designs from the second half of the 14th century, complete with phoenix designs and silk and gold thread. These designs are of Chinese origin, and reached Europe via the Mongol realm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Rosamond E.Mack], {{ISBN|0-520-22131-1}} p.27-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mongols in European painting==
[[File:Mongol tumen commander.jpg|thumb|200px|Mongol commander of a thousand troops, in [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Franciscans'', 1330.]]
Mongols are visible in a variety of European paintings from the 13–14th century. They suggest that Italian artists had been in direct contact with people from [[Tartary]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Legnica.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Legnica|battle of Liegnitz]], 1241, between the Mongols (left) and European knights (right). 14th century.]]
[[File:Kublai giving support to the Venetians.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kubilai Khan]] giving financial support to the Polo family]]
As early as 1253, during the initial encounters of the Mongols with the West following the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], [[Matthew Paris]] represented Mongol soldiers with their characteristic conical hat as [[cannibals]] in his ''[[Chronica Majora]]''.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

Later, the Mongols would appear in much less caricatural portrayals.

Mongols were then occasionally incorporated in the work of European painters, particularly illustrations of events in Asia or the [[Holy Land]]. Among other works, Mongol horsemen appear in the ''Crucifixion of Saint Peter'', [[Giotto]], circa 1299, probably following the visit of Mongol visitors from the East, such as the Mongol delegation who is known to have participated to the 1300 [[Papal Jubilee]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Arnold 54"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA54 Arnold, p.54]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative medicine''' is a [[medicine|medical]] approach that utilizes people's [[narrative]]s in [[clinical practice]], research, and education as a way to promote healing. It aims to address the relational and psychological dimensions that occur in tandem with physical illness, with the attempt to treat patients as humans with individual stories, rather than purely based on symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, narrative medicine aims not only to validate the experience of the patient, but also to encourage creativity and self-reflection in the physician.
==History==

In 1910, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching created Flexner's report, which set out to redefine medical educational practices. In this report, it argued that the proper goal of medicine is "to attempt to fight the battle against disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flexner|first=|date=1910|title=Medical Education in the United States and Canada|url=|journal=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the late 20th century, critics alleged that [[Western medicine]] had fallen victim to the professionalism movement. They argued that many [[medical schools]] and residency programs train physicians to treat medical problems purely on their symptoms without taking into account the specific psychological and personal history of the patient. The emergence of narrative medicine came as a contemporary effort to rehumanize medicine.

One prominent medical school that first began a program on narrative medicine was [[Columbia University Medical Center]] with their opening of the first Program in Narrative Medicine. Built within their College of Physicians and Surgeons, they believe that narrative medicine can make profound changes to the way medical treatment is administered:

“Narrative Medicine fortifies clinical practice with the narrative competence to recognize, absorb, metabolize, interpret, and be moved by the stories of illness. Through narrative training, the Program in Narrative Medicine helps physicians, nurses, social workers, mental health professionals, chaplains, social workers, academics, and all those interested in the intersection between narrative and medicine improve the effectiveness of care by developing these skills with patients and colleagues. Our research and outreach missions are conceptualizing, evaluating, and spear-heading these ideas and practices nationally and internationally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the executive director of this program and has published and lectured on the benefits of doctors receiving narrative training as a way to increase empathy and reflection in the medical professional field.

As of the late 1990s, physicians like [[Rachel Naomi Remen]] and [[Rita Charon]] have argued that medical practice should be structured around the narratives of patients. Charon stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Sick people need physicians who can understand their diseases, treat their medical problems, and accompany them through their illnesses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Educational Programs==
The number of schools in the United States that offer advanced classes in narrative medicine has been growing.
* The [[Columbia University Medical Center]] has been the leading pioneer of developing educational programs for the field of narrative medicine. In addition to lectures and seminars given throughout the year, Columbia University created the Master of Science in Narrative Medicine program for graduate students in 2009, making it one of the first graduate programs devoted strictly to narrative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03narrative.html "Learning to Listen"] New York Times (2009-12-29)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Montefiore Medical Center]] is the academic medical center and University Hospital for [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]]. This medical center created a program in Narrative Medicine as a subset of the Department of Family and Social Medicine. Residents at this school attend programs where they learn how to use personal narrative to enhance empathy, as well as topics including stress, loss, and balance.
* The [[Ohio State University]] Humanities Institute is also supporting the multidisciplinary initiative of narrative medicine. This program runs concurrently with their other undergraduate and graduate programs, where students "strive to develop narrative competence that enables them to deliver care that is not only more empathetic and compassionate, but also more effective." 
* The [[University of California, Irvine|University of California Irvine]] College of Medicine has created an Integrative Medicine Program within the Department of Family Medicine. This program "strives to change the focus of healthcare and medical education for our residents, medical students and faculty to include a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach that emphasizes wellness, prevention, and self-care skills, and the adoption of the principles for creating optimal healing environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Integrative Medicine Program {{!}} Department of Family Medicine {{!}} University of California, Irvine
| website = www.familymed.uci.edu
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2011, Western University created the Narrative Medicine Initiative (NMI) and has incorporated narrative medicine into the undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing medical education departments. They work to answer questions such as "How does the art of storytelling improve health care education and the experience of patient care?"
* Lenoir-Rhyne University has established the Thomas Wolfe Center for Narrative, with the slogan "Heeding the call for narrative in a fragmented world." This program offers graduate-level and certification courses in several narrative training disciplines, one of which is narrative medicine.
* Saybrook University takes a broad approach to narrative medicine through their mind-body medicine program. This seeks to approve the mind-body approach to health and wellness as a way to improve quality of life for patients.

This growing field of narrative medicine extends beyond the United States: The British Medical Journal have begun adding their own writing seminars to promote this type of narrative in its emerging physicians.

==Obstacles==
Rachel Remen asserts,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
People who are physicians have been trained to believe that it is a scientific objectivity that makes them most effective in their efforts to understand and resolve the pain that others bring them, and a mental distance that protects them from becoming wounded from this difficult work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Riverhead Books
| isbn = 9781594482090
| last = Remen
| first = Rachel Naomi
| title = Kitchen Table Wisdom: Stories That Heal
| date = 2006-08-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Objectivity, empathy, and global thinking are stated to not be incompatible with a degree of dissociation from the patient's suffering that is sufficient to protect oneself.

'''Natural religion''' most frequently means the "religion of nature", in which God, the soul, spirits, and all objects of the supernatural are considered as part of [[nature]] and not separate from it. Conversely, it is also used in [[philosophy]], specifically Roman Catholic philosophy, to describe some aspects of religion that are said to be knowable apart from divine revelation through logic and reason alone (see [[natural theology]] and [[Deism]]), for example, the existence of the [[God|unmoved Mover]], the [[first cause]] of the universe.

Most authors{{who|date=September 2018}} consider natural religion as not only the foundation of monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam but also distinct from them. According to some authors{{who|date=September 2018}}, aspects of natural religion are found universally among all peoples, often in such forms of [[shamanism]] and [[animism]]. They are still practiced in many parts of the world. The religions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies for example are considered as possessing some aspects of natural religion.

==Definition==

Natural religion might have the following meanings:

* In the modern [[Religious studies|study of religion]] it is used to refer to the notion that there is a spontaneous religious apprehension of the world common to all human beings, see:
**[[urreligion]]
**[[origin of religion]]
**[[anthropology of religion]]
* As a reverent form of [[nature worship]], embodied in a statement by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]: "I put a capital N on Nature, and call it my Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/wright_frank_lloyd_t.html |title=Frank Lloyd Wright |publisher=[[The Mike Wallace Interview]] |year=1957 |website=[[Harry Ransom Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Referring to the religions of people prior to their [[Christianization]].

==History==

The basic tenets of natural religion were outlined by [[Aristotle]], whose ''hylomorphism'' considered all things as made of matter and form. The form of all living things is the [[soul]], which guides and directs their development. Many natural religions{{which|date=September 2018}} consider God as the "soul of the universe".

Early [[monotheism]] had many naturalistic elements. Heaven and hell were considered physical places above and below the earth. "Salvation" was considered resurrection of the body.

In the fourth century, Christians were concerned that Jesus had not returned and wondered what happened to those who died before the Second Coming of Christ. Christians, led by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and under the influence of both [[gnosticism]] and [[neoplatonism]], developed a new belief in the soul as capable of a separate existence abstract from the material world. The human souls, unlike those of animals, would survive death and, depending on God's judgment, be transferred to the non-material realms of heaven or hell and the new realm of [[limbo]] for unbaptized persons and [[purgatory]] for those who do not deserve hell but are not purified for heaven..

Another distinction from monotheism is found in the Christian belief in miracles, in which God intervenes in history from outside nature. Ancient Roman philosophers and others since objected to this Christian doctrine as God violating his own natural laws. Christians had to separate God more completely from the natural universe in order to show how this could be possible. There were similar neoplatonist tendencies in Judaism and Islam, which also saw God as acting in history.

Natural religions, on the contrary, consider the supernatural as part of the natural universe.

==Modern views==
One of the first attempts to develop a science of religion was ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' by the American philosopher [[William James]].  James saw the basic experience which unified all religions as a sometimes life-changing personal event in which one perceives the connectedness of all things as one unified whole.

James defined the basics of all religion, including natural religion, when he wrote: "Were one to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it exists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves hereto."

Certain aspects of natural religion (that is, religious truths that are knowable by human reason alone) are found among different cultures, though not always entirely intact, and to varying degrees, according to philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]].

A few modern scientists such as UK biologist [[Rupert Sheldrake]] believe new discoveries coincide with Aristotle's belief in the soul. Forces such as [[magnetism]], [[gravity]], and [[quantum mechanics]] also point to non-material forces acting in nature.&lt;ref&gt;2012. Sheldrake, R. '''Set Science Free: 10 Paths to New Discoveries.''' Depak Chopra.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60207">'''Nutrient cycling in the Columbia River Basin''' involves the transport of nutrients through the system, as well as transformations from among dissolved, solid, and gaseous phases, depending on the element. The elements that constitute important [[nutrient cycle]]s include [[macronutrients]] such as [[nitrogen|nitrogen (as ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate)]], [[silicate]], [[phosphorus]], and [[micronutrient]]s, which are found in trace amounts, such as [[iron]]. Their [[Nutrient cycle|cycling]] within a system is controlled by many biological, chemical, and physical processes.

The [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia River Basin]] is the largest freshwater system of the [[Pacific Northwest]], and due to its complexity, size, and modification by humans, nutrient cycling within the system is affected by many different components. Both natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] processes are involved in the cycling of nutrients. Natural processes in the system include [[Estuary|estuarine]] mixing of fresh and ocean waters, and [[climate]] variability patterns such as the [[Pacific Decadal Oscillation]] and the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|El Nino Southern Oscillation]] (both climatic cycles that affect the amount of regional snowpack and river discharge).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/Nitrogen/FateTransport.html|title=Fate and Transport of Nitrogen {{!}} Environmental Assessment Program {{!}} Washington State Department of Ecology, Puget Sound|website=www.ecy.wa.gov|access-date=2017-11-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208003427/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/Nitrogen/FateTransport.html|archivedate=2017-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamlet|first=Alan F.|last2=Lettenmaier|first2=Dennis P.|date=1999-11-01|title=Columbia River Streamflow Forecasting Based on ENSO and PDO Climate Signals|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9496%281999%29125%3A6%28333%29|journal=Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management|volume=125|issue=6|pages=333–341|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1999)125:6(333)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural sources of nutrients in the [[Columbia River]] include [[weathering]], leaf litter, [[salmon]] carcasses, runoff from its [[Tributary|tributaries]], and [[Estuarine water circulation|ocean estuary exchange]].

The [[Columbia River]] basin is a major watershed and the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of [[North America]]. Extending from southern [[British Columbia]] to northern [[Nevada]], the watershed includes seven American states and two Canadian provinces and drains an area of about 260,000 square miles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wr/cwp/cwpfactmap.html|title=Columbia River Facts and Maps|website=www.ecy.wa.gov|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naik|first=Pradeep K.|last2=Jay|first2=David A.|date=July 2011|title=Distinguishing human and climate influences on the Columbia River: Changes in mean flow and sediment transport|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411002964|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=404|issue=3-4|pages=259–277|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.04.035|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbia River stretches 1,620 miles in length until its discharge into the Pacific Ocean near [[Astoria, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2007/5186/section3.html|title=Nutrient and Suspended-Sediment Transport and Trends in the Columbia River and Puget Sound Basins, 1993–2003|last=Sobieszczyk|first=By Daniel R.

Schwarz, and Steven|date=|website=pubs.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] rate of the Columbia River changes due to climate and land-use variability, but generally ranges from 120,000 to 260,000 cubic feet per second.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Finally, the population of the Columbia River Basin within the United States is about 4.6 million people (per the 2000 census).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The water cycle in the Columbia River is dependent on the relation between water flow and topography in the basin. Within the United States, only the [[Mississippi River System|Missouri-Mississippi]] River system has annual runoff greater than that of the Columbia River.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The amount of water that the river carries each year is determined by the precipitation, sunlight, and air temperature in the basin, which varies from year to year.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; West of the [[Cascade Range]], most of the winter precipitation falls as rain, but in the Cascade Mountains and eastward, precipitation through winter is snow. [[Snowmelt]] in the mountains begins to reach the river during early to mid-spring. About 30 percent of the streamflow in the Columbia River occurs between January and March (primarily from rainfall) and about 30 percent occurs between April and June (from a combination of rainfall and snowmelt).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Natural processes ==
[[Upwelling|Coastal upwelling]], [[discharge (hydrology)|river discharge]], [[Tide|tidal]] mixing, [[Estuarine water circulation|estuarine circulation]], [[climate oscillation]], and [[Remineralisation|remineralization]], are sources or sinks for the Columbia River basin nutrient budget.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitney|first1=F. A.|last2=Crawford|first2=W. R.|last3=Harrison|first3=P. J.|date=1 March 2005|title=Physical processes that enhance nutrient transport and primary productivity in the coastal and open ocean of the subarctic NE Pacific|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064505000044|journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|volume=52|issue=5|pages=681–706|doi=10.1016/j.dsr2.2004.12.023|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these transport processes the [[Columbia River Estuary]] provides large nutrient sources to the adjacent sub-arctic Northeast Pacific coastal surface water.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Nitrogen is added to rivers through many natural processes, such as the decomposition of leaf litter and organic matter. Nitrogen gas is the most abundant molecule in earth's atmosphere, comprising about 78 percent of the total composition of air,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/classes/m201/Atmosphere/AtmosphericComposition.html|title=Atmospheric Composition|website=tornado.sfsu.edu|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; however not typically a large source of nitrogen to the river. This form of nitrogen, dinitrogen gas (&lt;chem&gt;N2&lt;/chem&gt;), is inert and biologically unavailable to most living organisms. However, some [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] can utilize [[nitrogen fixation]] to convert dinitrogen into ammonia or other compounds accessible to organisms.

Finally, nitrogen load at the Columbia River mouth is about 2-20 times larger than that at the Canadian border.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This gradient in nitrogen distribution is partly a result of the inputs of the Columbia's major tributaries, the [[Snake River]] and the [[Willamette River]]. The Snake and Willamette rivers together contribute about 50-80 percent of the nitrogen load in a given year, coming from activities within those respective watersheds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Weathering and runoff ===
[[Weathering]] is the break down of rocks, soil, and minerals through contact with water, the atmosphere, and biological organisms, converting solid phase minerals to dissolved phase compounds. This process can introduce nutrients, most notably phosphorus, into the Columbia watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wise|first=Daniel R.|last2=Johnson|first2=Henry M.|date=2011-10-01|title=Surface-Water Nutrient Conditions and Sources in the United States Pacific Northwest1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00580.x/abstract|journal=JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association|language=en|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1110–1135|doi=10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00580.x|issn=1752-1688|pmc=3307616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Weathering|chemical]] and [[Weathering|physical weathering]] occur, usually together, and this coupling tends to accelerate the other. Precipitation varies across the basin, influencing the amount of weathering and subsequent runoff that transports this material into the basin.

Organic matter such as leaves may also naturally fall into the waterways through runoff. Over time, this material is [[Cellular respiration|respired]], releasing assimilated nutrients into the environment.

=== Salmon impacts on nutrient cycling ===
An important source of nutrients, such as [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]], for rivers in the Pacific Northwest is the [[spawning]] of salmon and subsequent death and decomposition of fish up-river.  Every fall, ocean salmon at the end of their life cycle swim upriver to spawn before they die. The [[Remineralisation|remineralization]] of their organic matter releases significant nitrogen loads into the river, although recent decades have observed decreased salmon runs and subsequently less impact on the total nitrogen budget.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Salmon are an [[anadromous]] family of fish that rear in freshwater, migrate to the ocean as juveniles, and then return to the freshwater as adults to lay their eggs and die in what is called a [[salmon run]]. Their death and subsequent [[decomposition]] releases substantial amounts of nitrogen and lower amounts of phosphorus into the system, boosting the [[Primary production|productivity]] of local headwaters and serving as a vector of material transport across the ocean to [[Drainage basin|watershed]] interface.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Studies have estimated salmon in some parts of the Columbia river contribute up to 60 percent of nitrogen to other [[trophic level]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cederholm|first=C. Jeff|last2=Kunze|first2=Matt D.|last3=Murota|first3=Takeshi|last4=Sibatani|first4=Atuhiro|date=1999-10-01|title=Pacific Salmon Carcasses: Essential Contributions of Nutrients and Energy for Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems|url=https://doi.org/10.1577/1548-8446(1999)0242.0.CO;2|journal=Fisheries|volume=24|issue=10|pages=6–15|doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1999)0242.0.CO;2|issn=0363-2415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regional ubiquity of salmon as a recreational and commercial [[fishery]] has led to increased attention on local populations within the Columbia River system.&amp;nbsp;Annual [[Salmon-fishing|salmon harvests]] are among the highest-earners of the Pacific Northwest fishery economy; in the lower Columbia River specifically, salmon account for over 84 percent of commercial fish landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 2008|title=Economic Analysis of the Non-Treaty Commercial and Recreational Fisheries in Washington State|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00464/wdfw00464.pdf|journal=Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While areas accessible to salmon have been reduced over the past century through the construction of dams and the modification of river channels, this group of fish historically inhabited almost 13,000 miles of the Columbia River basin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.critfc.org/fish-and-watersheds/columbia-river-fish-species/columbia-river-salmon/|title=Columbia River Salmon, Pacific Northwest {{!}} Chinook Salmon|work=CRITFC|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts from [[Fisheries management|fishery management]] and state agencies, as well as the listing of several resident salmon stocks under the protection of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]], has led to the re-establishment of accessibility to some parts of the Columbia River system for salmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/stories/2013/08_2013_07_11_lower_columbia_recovery_plan_adopted.html|title=Newly adopted Recovery Plan guides restoration of lower Columbia River salmon &amp; steelhead|last=Fisheries|first=NOAA|date=Summer 2013|website=www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional return of salmon runs restores an important segment of local nutrient cycles, particularly that of nitrogen and phosphorus, to the system.

===  Estuarine and ocean exchange ===
The [[Columbia River Estuary]] is the most downstream portion of the river that experiences ocean tides, generally defined as the furthest reach of the Columbia River plume to the [[Bonneville Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/creec_geomorphic_catena.xml|title=Columbia River Estuary Ecosystem Classification Geomorphic Catena|website=water.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, a transition zone occurs where freshwater discharge from the river meets and mixes with Pacific Ocean saltwater. In this region, physical processes that affect nutrients are the [[Ocean circulation|circulation]] (entrance/exit, movement) of specific water masses with their nutrient load, the magnitude of tidal flow distributing ocean waters inland, and bottom sediment exchange affecting nutrient particle mobility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the exception of nitrogen, the Columbia River estuary nutrient budget tends to be dominated by nutrient transport out of the system.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; During periods of high river flow, generally April to June, the estuary has a daily average residence time of less than a day.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kärnä|first=Tuomas|last2=Baptista|first2=António M.|title=Water age in the Columbia River estuary|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2016.09.001|journal=Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science|volume=183|pages=249–259|doi=10.1016/j.ecss.2016.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, at times of lowest river discharge, typically September to October, this [[turnover time]] lengthens to about three days.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The turnover time can also vary due to the tidal cycle, and affect the amount of oceanic exchange in the estuary; on the whole the residence time is fairly short. Through a more rapid transit time of waters within the river, local [[primary production]] tends to be lower as [[autotroph]]ic communities are quickly flushed out of the system.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Since there is less subsequent biological uptake of nutrients, there is a high rate of nutrient transport out of the Columbia River and into coastal waters.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The upwelled waters of the Pacific Ocean have very high concentrations of dissolved nutrients due to the history of [[Cellular respiration|biological respiration]] that has occurred throughout the water masses' time in circulation through the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickey|first=Barbara|last2=Banas|first2=Neil|date=2003|title=Oceanography of the U.S. Pacific Northwest Coastal Ocean and estuaries with application to coastal ecology|url=|journal=Estuaries|volume=26|issue=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] is the consumption of organic matter and concurrent release of nutrients contained in that biomass.  This process is an important source for nutrients that other organisms require. Examples of these organisms include [[phytoplankton]] and [[algae]], whose communities are often limited in growth by the availability of specific nutrients, most commonly nitrogen which is the primary limiting nutrient the Columbia River.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;   In addition, to nitrogen, iron, and silicate cycling in the estuary can impact local and coastal ocean phytoplankton communities.

==== Nitrate ====
Due to coastal upwelling, ocean sources of [[nitrate]] (an oxidized form of nitrogen) exceed river sources by a magnitude of roughly 3 to 1, and is a primary source of nitrogen for the Columbia River Estuary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is evident within the estuary by the positively correlated relationship of nitrate availability and salinity, the latter an identifying characteristic of highly saline marine waters.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haertel|first=Lois|last2=Osterberg|first2=Charles|last3=Curl|first3=Herbert|last4=Park|first4=P.

==== Phosphate ====
Although phosphorus is of interest in the mid-river, especially in and around reservoirs throughout the Columbia River Basin as discussed below, it is not typically a [[limiting nutrient]] for biological communities within the estuary.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LARA-LARA 1, FREY 2, SMALL 3|first=J. RUBEN 1, BRUCE E.2, LAWRENCE F. 3|date=1990|title=Primary Production in the Columbia River Estuary I.

[[File:Corps-engineers-archives bonneville dam looking east.jpg|thumb|452x452px|Aerial view of&amp;nbsp;Columbia River&amp;nbsp;and Bonneville Dam]]

==== Iron ====
The primary source of [[iron]] into the estuary is from geologic rock [[weathering]] and subsequent runoff delivery to the system. In addition, some iron may come from the Pacific Ocean and is transported into the estuary during tidal oscillation, enhanced seasonally during periods of upwelling.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Iron inputs derived from riverine and oceanic origins are typically on the magnitude of 14-30 nM and 6 nM in concentration respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These sources of iron are generally sufficient to meet biological demands, including those of primary production, in the estuary and upriver. Consequently, iron is commonly not the limiting nutrient in the system; rather, the river depending on season and flow may serve as a net source of iron to iron-deficient coastal regions of the Northeast Pacific, sometimes referred to as areas of [[High-Nutrient, low-chlorophyll|High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=John H.|last2=Fitzwater|first2=Steve E.|date=1988-01-28|title=Iron deficiency limits phytoplankton growth in the north-east Pacific subarctic|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/331341a0|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=331|issue=6154|pages=341–343|doi=10.1038/331341a0|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=John H.|last2=Michael Gordon|first2=R.|date=1988-02-01|title=Northeast Pacific iron distributions in relation to phytoplankton productivity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0198014988900350|journal=Deep Sea Research Part A. Oceanographic Research Papers|volume=35|issue=2|pages=177–196|doi=10.1016/0198-0149(88)90035-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silicate ====
As discussed in more detail below, dams can cause large scale [[hydrological]] changes by forming [[reservoir]]s.  These reservoirs can act as nutrient traps altering nutrient ratios and reducing silicate transport through rivers and into the estuary.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venugopalan|first=Ittekkot,|last2=Christoph|first2=Humborg,|last3=Petra|first3=Schäfer,|date=2000-09-01|title=Hydrological Alterations and Marine Biogeochemistry: A Silicate Issue?Silicate retention in reservoirs behind dams affects ecosystem structure in coastal seas|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/9/776/269450|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=50|issue=9|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2000)050[0776:HAAMBA]2.0.CO;2|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Since mid twentieth-century [[Columbia river dams|dam construction on the Columbia river]], seasonal silicate transport out of the Columbia River Estuary has shifted in magnitude since the historical, pre-alteration of the river hydrology.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Outside the estuary, the Columbia river is a source of silicate for the [[Subarctic|sub-arctic]] Northeast Pacific coast.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Silicate is a required nutrient for [[diatom]]s, which form [[siliceous]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;shells, within the surface waters of this coastal region.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takeda|first=Shigenobu|date=1998-06-25|title=Influence of iron availability on nutrient consumption ratio of diatoms in oceanic waters|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6687/abs/393774a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=393|issue=6687|pages=774–777|doi=10.1038/31674|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=C.

=== PDO and ENSO ===
[[Nutrient cycle|Nutrient dynamics]] are also affected on a long-term scale by human and climate influences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, the Columbia River discharge rates, which govern bulk nutrient transport, follow [[Pacific decadal oscillation|Pacific Decadal Oscillation]] (PDO) and [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). This is because of how these oscillations affect regional air temperature, [[precipitation]] patterns, and off shore wind, which in turn affect annual [[snowpack]], [[sea surface temperature]]s, and [[upwelling]] and [[downwelling]] trends.  Changes in these trends can alter the magnitude of [[Runoff (hydrology)|runoff]] from land incorporated into the Columbia River system as well as [[Estuarine water circulation|coastal ocean inflow]], which ultimately alter nutrient loading by either bringing in additional nutrients or washing them out.

Research indicates dam construction on the river has affected the strength of PDO and ENSO's influence through alteration of runoff residence times, but to date these effects have not been well described.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since 1858, total silicate transport has decreased by 50 percent, with 10 percent of that decrease directly linked to these climate oscillations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This alteration of net nutrient transport is critical to determining nutrient distribution and availability throughout the basin. Silicate, for example, may direct nutrient cycling by altering environmental parameters implicated in primary production by organisms, including river depth, flood frequency, and turbidity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Greening of the estuary ===
It has been observed that the Columbia River estuary is "greening". "Greening" of the estuary describes the movement of [[phytoplankton]] [[Algal bloom|bloom]]s that historically occurred outside the mouth of the river, and are now blooming much more frequently inside the estuary, effectively "greening" the river surface with colored microscopic organisms.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2000"/&gt;

[[Primary production]] in this region is often dominated by [[diatom]] species such as&amp;nbsp;''Skeletomema costatum, Chaetoceros''&amp;nbsp;spp. and&amp;nbsp;''Thalassiosira''&amp;nbsp;spp. which bloom seasonally in spring and summer.  Large blooms of these species consume the available nitrogen in the region, eventually hindering the furthering blooming by creating a nitrate-limited growth period.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Exacerbating this nitrogen depletion, high estuarine turnover times in the Columbia River Estuary displace these diatoms communities out into the ocean.  This export reduces rates of nitrogen [[Remineralisation|remineralization]] as the available nitrogen consumed by the diatom blooms is removed from the estuary system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The nitrogen-deplete conditions created by these blooms are improved as natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthroprogenic]] [[Macro-Nutrients|macro-nutrients]] and [[Micronutrient|micro-nutrients]] are transported into the system by river discharge.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meybeck|first=Michael|date=April 1982|title=Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus Transport by Worlds Rivers|url=http://earth.geology.yale.edu/~ajs/1982/04.1982.01.Maybeck.pdf|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=282|pages=401–450|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitney|first=F.

As an example of human impacts on this system, the increased footprint of water reservoirs caused by damning of the Columbia River has resulted in a standing pools of nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;   These nutrients mostly stay within the watershed during winter months instead of discharging to the ocean, as river discharge rates are controlled by dam release schedules.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As a result, these nutrients and organic matter are locally biochemically processed by plankton communities, increasing the biomass of life within the system, and resulting in high nutrient releases in spring and summer months when dam flow through is increased.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=B|date=2000|title=Seasonality of phytoplankton production in the Columbia River: A natural or anthropogenic pattern?|url=|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As a result, this [[Anthropogenic effect|anthroprogenic]] discharge cycle contributes to the seasonality of diatom blooms in the estuary.

Unlike other large estuaries, such as the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake Bay Estuary]], the Columbia River supplies little nitrate to the estuary relative to the overall local nitrogen budget. Rather, the primary source of nitrate into the estuary is from ocean exchange caused by wind-driven seasonal upwelling off the Oregon and Washington coasts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This influx of nitrate, generally the primary limiting nutrient to biological communities in the estuary, is an important driver of primary productivity in estuarine plumes of river discharge. Moreover, large scale upwelling on the Oregon-Washington coast typically occurs in spring and summer, and as discussed previously, is coupled with the PDO and ENSO, this seasonal upwelling further contributes to diatom bloom in the estuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://damp.coas.oregonstate.edu/windstress/|title=Wind stress, cumulative wind stress, and spring transition dates: data products for Oregon upwelling-related research|last=Pierce|first=S.D.|last2=Barth|first2=J.

=== Red blooms ===
[[File:Red tide＿2017.jpg|thumb|320x320px|Red bloom in a harbor. The vibrant color of the blooms attracts attention from scientists and local community members.]]

One question of interest associated with ''M. rubra'' is its ability to spread within the Columbia River estuary in spite of the short residence time of the water. The red blooms have been observed initiating near the river mouth, then establishing throughout the entire lower estuary.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herfort|first=Lydie|last2=Peterson|first2=Tawnya D.|last3=Campbell|first3=Victoria|last4=Futrell|first4=Sheedra|last5=Zuber|first5=Peter|date=December 2011|title=Myrionecta rubra (Mesodinium rubrum) bloom initiation in the Columbia River estuary|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.10.015|journal=Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science|language=en|volume=95|issue=4|pages=440–446|doi=10.1016/j.ecss.2011.10.015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M. rubra'' is quite motile and can swim (1.2&amp;nbsp;cm / second) and jump (as much as 160&amp;nbsp;µm in 20 milliseconds),&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; which could explain how they are able to stay within the estuary for months at a time. &amp;nbsp;

== Anthropogenic impacts on processes ==
Nutrient cycling is affected by human alteration refereed to as [[Anthropogenic effect|anthropogeni]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;c impacts. The Columbia River Basin is home to nearly five million residents, and the rapid alteration of land in the past several centuries has shifted many aspects of nutrient dynamics within this environment.  Human processes such as construction (such as for dams), [[logging]], and [[mining]] can impact [[sediment]] transport, resulting in decreased accumulation and/or the enhancement or removal of nutrients.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The cycling of nutrients within the Columbia River Basin is also affected by differences in [[Land use|land-use]] through variability in human development and vegetation.  Land use of the basin within the United States is primarily forested (87 percent),&amp;nbsp;with 11 percent of land used for agriculture, and 2 percent for urban areas.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
Human-related activity has contributed over 50 percent of the available global reactive nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galloway|first=James N.|last2=Cowling|first2=Ellis B.|date=2002-03-01|title=Reactive Nitrogen and The World: 200 Years of Change|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1579/0044-7447-31.2.64|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|volume=31|issue=2|pages=64–71|doi=10.1579/0044-7447-31.2.64|issn=0044-7447}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch process]] is an artificial means of nitrogen fixation, producing over 450 million tons of ammonia per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haber.co.za/haber-process/|title=Haber Process {{!}} Haber Transport|website=www.haber.co.za|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this yield is used for agricultural purposes through [[fertilizer]]s. [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] sources of nitrogen reach rivers primarily through the erosion of soil sediments, but also through airborne dust and gaseous transport of [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatilized]] [[Ammonia|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;from livestock manure and fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/landuse/crops/?cid=nrcs143_014202|title=Fate and Transport of Nutrients:  Nitrogen {{!}} NRCS|website=www.nrcs.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the twentieth century, agriculture began to exceed [[mining]] and became the Columbia River Basin's primary economic industry.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.17226/10962|title=Managing the Columbia River: Instream Flows, Water Withdrawals, and Salmon Survival|last=|first=|date=|publisher=National Research Council|year=2004|isbn=9780309091558|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.17226/10962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbia River has been subject to cultural [[eutrophication]] in part due to the use of the river and its tributaries to [[Irrigation|irrigate]] over seven million acres of farmland, an extraction that comprises an average of 93 percent of daily water use in the basin.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Natural run-off caused by precipitation and [[snowpack]] melt across agricultural lands further transports more of these nutrients into the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nwcouncil.org/history/Chronology|title=Columbia River Chronology|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1990s, the nitrogen load in the Columbia river was over twice the concentration historically observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Large Rivers|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/roe/|journal=EPA Report on the Environment|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logging ===
[[Forest]]s are important [[Terrestrial plant|terrestrial]] sinks for nutrients due to the ability of vegetation to sequester excess nutrients into their biomass.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maintaining the Long-term Productivity of Pacific Norhtwest Forest Ecosystems|last=Miller|first=Richard E.|publisher=College of Forestry|year=1989|isbn=|location=Corvallis, OR|pages=98–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, plant roots stabilize soils and consequently prevent a large portion of the nutrient pool to be transferred via runoff into rivers and other waterways.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Studies of nearby Pacific Northwest forests have found that [[Logging|logged]] forests lose 1.6 to 3 times the amount of nutrients over several years times compared to undisturbed areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredriksen|first=R.

=== Sewage and septic inputs ===
A significant nutrient source from developed areas into [[aquatic ecosystem]]s is through [[sewage]] and [[Septic tank|septic]] systems. [[Municipal waste]], high in nitrogen and phosphorus, is sometimes treated by wastewater facilities or through soil filtration, but often some excess nutrients leak and contribute to eutrophication.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/eutrophication-and-hypoxia/sources-eutrophication|title=Sources of Eutrophication {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human sewage waste in the United States accounts for about 12 percent of average annual nitrogen input into rivers.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Often, there are many small-scale sources of this discharge and no one input is clearly dominating nutrient loading. However, occasionally unexpected events, usually through sewer systems or at wastewater plants, occur that result in a significant singular emission. In the fall of 2017 for example, a power failure at a treatment facility in [[Vancouver, Washington]] led to the discharge of over 510,000 gallons of wholly untreated and partially treatment [[effluent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2017/oct/05/sewage-flows-into-columbia-r-after-power-failure-at-vancouver-treatment-plant/|title=Sewage flows into Columbia River after power failure at Vancouver treatment plant|date=2017-10-05|work=The Columbian|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing background discharge along with larger-scale, periodic emission events comprise a large input of human-derived nutrient loading.

=== Effects of dams ===
[[File:Columbia.png|thumb|382x382px|Map of Columbia River Basin showing locations of dams throughout the basin.

Notably, dam construction in the Columbia River Basin has impacted relative nutrient ratios, methane production, and salmon migration.   
[[File:Cascades rapids.jpg|thumb|Cascades Rapids prior to construction of the Bonneville Dam.]]
To provide context for the scale of change that dams can effect, the construction of the [[Bonneville Dam|Bonneville dam]] in the late 1930s completely submerged the [[Cascades Rapids]], permanently changing the local river hydrology and subsequently altering local nutrient transport and processes in the region.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The restriction of flow as well as the creation of standing water upriver of the dams have been linked to deleterious effects on nutrient cycling in similar ecosystems, such as the [[Murray River|Murray River Basin]] in Australia and the [[Danube|Danube River Basin]] in Europe, through processes such as the alteration of particle [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence times]] and [[Eutrophication|nutrient loading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GALLOWAY|first=JAMES N.|last2=ABER|first2=JOHN D.|last3=ERISMAN|first3=JAN WILLEM|last4=SEITZINGER|first4=SYBIL P.|last5=HOWARTH|first5=ROBERT W.|last6=COWLING|first6=ELLIS B.|last7=COSBY|first7=B.

[[File:Corps-engineers-archives bonneville dam looking east.jpg|thumb|Arial image of Bonneville dam showing reservoir.  Notice the widening of the river and calm water upstream of the dam as compared to the pre-dam photo of the Cascades Rapids.]]

==== Nutrient ratios ====
[[Macronutrients]], such as [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], and [[silicate]] are strongly impacted by increased residence times in reservoirs created by dam construction throughout the Columbia River Basin.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Exact nutrient retention rates can vary between 16 and 98 percent depending on local hydrology, reservoir design, and location in the basin.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  However, this increase in nutrient retention rates in the Columbia River basin has generally modified the relative ratios of available nutrients from their natural state, which has subsequently altered the efficiency of compound usage by [[primary producers]] such as [[diatom]]s.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Diatoms are directly affected by the [[hydrodynamic]] changes that reservoirs create.   The slow moving, fresh water in reservoirs facilitates high settling rates for [[siliceous]] diatom shells, which can both bloom in the reservoir or be carried into the river from upstream.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Diatom shells are negatively [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] and have a natural tenancy to settle, this coupled with the reduced forward momentum of standing water in a reservoir, and the physical barrier a dam increase the settling rate of diatom shells within the reservoir.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  This high settling rate, coupled with slow dissolution of silicate in freshwater, leads to a net decrease in silicate recycling and reduced silicate transport through the Columbia River Basin and export out of the estuary resulting in a net decrease in the overall silicate budget.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

These same hydrodynamic changes also result in a net increase in phosphorus and nitrogen recycling in reservoirs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Settling rates for algae, other than diatoms, are slow.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Slow settling rates allow for algae to remain in the water column longer, allowing for increased release for organically bound phosphorus and nitrogen into the water column through [[Remineralisation|remineralization]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The combine impact of increased silicate retention and increased remineralization of phosphorus and nitrogen can result in high N/Si and P/Si ratios within and below reservoirs; these increased rations can be further compounded by increase nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The high N/Si and P/Si rations caused by these processes can be harmful to the local ecosystem in the basin; for example, N/Si ratios greater than 1 can result in excess nitrogen relative to diatom requirements, this can promote the growth of other phytoplankton species, negatively affecting diatom communities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

This impact of reservoirs on the transport and recycling of silicate, phosphorus, and nitrogen, is not unique to the Columbia River Basin, but has had a measurable impact on the export of these nutrients through the basin and out of the estuary.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  As discussed in context with the [[Pacific decadal oscillation|PDO]] and [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|ENSO]], since 1858, total silicate export out of the Columbia river basin through the estuary has decreased over 50 percent with about 40 percent of that reduction liked directly to dam construction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Finally, as discussed above, these changed in nutrient ratios have largely contributed to the greening of the Columbia river estuary.

==== Methane ====
Reservoirs often serve as a [[catchment basin]] for organic matter such as vegetation, and waste transferred into the river via rainwater runoff.   Initially, this organic matter provides a nutrient source; however, as it continues to accumulate and begins to decompose, the [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] of this organic matter can quickly deplete oxygen levels leading to [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]].  Under anoxic conditions, the large amount of organic matter are further broken down through [[anaerobic respiration]] and [[methanogenesis]] into carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  These decomposition processes can occur rapidly after flooding, when large amount of fresh organic matter are transported into the river, and as a result methane and carbon dioxide release can be large.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Anaerobic respiration, which occurs in the absence of highly [[Redox|oxidizing]] molecular oxygen, utilizes less-oxidized [[electron acceptors]] such as [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).  As a result, high levels of anaerobic respiration can result in [[denitrification]].  This process of denitrification removes nitrogen from the Columbia River Basin, by converting available nitrogen, important for primary production, from its usable dissolved forms (i.e. NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to its gaseous form (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Salmon migration ====
Dams provide a barrier for migrating fish such as salmon, limiting their abilities to swim upstream.  As discussed above, studies in the Pacific Northwest and Scandinavia have demonstrated that migratory fish can provide 30 percent or more of the phosphorus input to [[oligotrophic lake]]s.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  These rates of phosphorus fertilization, as well as similarly high rates of nitrogen fertilization, come from the decomposition of adult carcasses after mating and can be significantly affected by reduced migration caused by dam construction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Research estimates as much as 7 to 15 percent of the migrating salmon stock perish as they cross each consecutive dam.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Lower rates of successful salmon migration redistribute the remineralization of nitrogen and phosphorus by reducing nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization upstream of dams, as a result there is a successive reduction in nutrients upstream of each consecutive dam.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The redistribution of nutrients in the Columbia River Basin is currently a popular area of research; however, additional data is needed to determine the lasting implications of these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naiman|first=Robert J.|last2=Bilby|first2=Robert E.|last3=Schindler|first3=Daniel E.|last4=Helfield|first4=James M.|date=2002-06-01|title=Pacific Salmon, Nutrients, and the Dynamics of Freshwater and Riparian Ecosystems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-001-0083-3|journal=Ecosystems|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=399–417|doi=10.1007/s10021-001-0083-3|issn=1432-9840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semiotic]] analysis (the studies of signs or symbols), an '''open text''' is a text that allows multiple or mediated [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]] by the readers.  In contrast, a closed text leads the reader to one intended interpretation.

The concept of the '''open text''' comes from [[Umberto Eco]]'s collection of essays ''The Role of the Reader'',&lt;ref&gt;Eco, U., 1984,The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Texts, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also derivative of [[Roland Barthes]]'s distinction between 'readerly' (lisible) and 'writerly' (scriptible) texts as set out in his 1968 essay, "[[The Death of the Author]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, R., 1977, 'The Death of the Author' in Image-Music-Text, Fontana&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}
In this essay, [[Umberto Eco]] describes a special kind of musical works that can be organized and re-organized by the performers before they are played to the audience. He then applied this idea of "open works" to literary texts and other works of art.

Every work of art can be read, according to Eco, in three distinct ways: the moral, the allegorical and the [[Anagoge|anagogical]]. Each is not only distinct but can be fully anticipated and directed by the author (or the artist) of the work. An example of this kind of reading is found in the stories by [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], in which his symbolic actions cannot be read in one definitive way; each reading will end up with similar and multiple meanings.

The reader will read a certain work differently every time, depending on his/her emotional state, physical state and political world view. We can find an example of this in plays written by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] , which are "open" in the same way that an argument between two people is open: both sides (the actors and the viewers) want and anticipate a solution at the end, but no solution ever comes, leaving us to wander to find meaning.

[[Umberto Eco]] makes a distinction between these kind of works, which are "open" in their interpretation, to the musical works from the beginning, which are open in their structural sense. These kind of "openness" is not only for musical works, it might be any kind of artistic work (painting, poem, performance etc.)

This kind of "openness" is derived from the science of the time, he says. When people believed in a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] world, they expected every work of art to have only one definitive interpretation, but as people found out about the universe and the magnitude of stars in the sky and their hierarchy, they began to expect more ideas to be interpreted from every work.

He continues by comparing open works to [[Quantum mechanics]], and he arrives at the conclusion that open works are more like [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s idea of the universe, which is governed by precise laws but seems random at first. The artist in those open works arranges  the work carefully so it could be re-organized by another but still keep the original voice or intent of the artist.

Every work can be read in infinite ways, depending on an individual's state of mind and perspective, and it also depends on a third person intervention, either the players of the orchestra or the curator at the museum. Eco understand the difficulties with this perspective, but he ends by saying that this article, as all works, is still a "work in movement", an "open work" and still a "work in progress".

'''Pervasive informatics''' is the study of how information affects interactions with the built environments they occupy. The term and concept were initially introduced by Professor [[Kecheng Liu]] during a keynote speech at the SOLI 2008 international conference.&lt;ref name="Keynote"&gt;[[Kecheng Liu|Liu, K.]] [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4686343&amp;tag=1"], ''Pervasive informatics in intelligent spaces for living and working'', Keynote, IEEE international Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics 2009, xviii –xix”&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation given|reason=This does not show the term was first established there|date=October 2015}}

The built environment is rich with information which can be utilised by its occupants to enhance the quality of their work and life. By introducing ICT systems, this information can be created, managed, distributed and consumed more effectively, leading to more advanced interactions between users and the environment. The social interactions in these spaces are of additional value, and Informatics can effectively capture the complexities of such information rich activities.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt; Information literally pervades, or spreads throughout, these socio-technical systems, and pervasive informatics aims to study, and assist in the design of, pervasive information environments, or pervasive spaces, for the benefit of their stakeholders and users.

== Pervasive computing ==
Pervasive informatics may be initially viewed as simply another branch of [[Pervasive Computing|pervasive]], or [[ubiquitous computing]]. However, pervasive informatics places a greater emphasis on the ICT-enhanced socio-technical pervasive spaces, as opposed to the technology driven direction of pervasive computing. This distinction between fields is analogous to that of  [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] and  [[computing]], where Informatics focuses on the study of information, while the primary concern of computing is the processing of information. Pervasive informatics aims to analyse the pervasive nature of information, examining its various representations and transformations in pervasive spaces, which are enabled by pervasive computing technologies e.g. [[smart device]]s and intelligent control systems.

== Pervasive spaces ==
A pervasive space is characterised by the physical and informational interaction between the occupants and the built environment e.g. the act of controlling the building is a physical interaction, while the space responding to this action/user instruction is an informational interaction. 

Intelligent pervasive spaces are those that display intelligent behaviour in the form of adaptation to user requirements or the environment itself. Such intelligent behaviour can be implemented using artificial intelligence algorithms and agent-based technologies. These intelligent spaces aim to provide communication and computing services to their occupants in such a way that the experience is almost transparent e.g. automated control of heating and ventilation based on occupant preference profiles.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

The term first appeared in an IBM Research Report &lt;ref&gt;Mcfaddin, S., D. Coffman et al.[http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/A164F52F0FE2A3DD85257379005811FE/$File/rc24381.pdf"], ''Celadon: Delivering Business Services to Mobile Users in Public Spaces'', IBM Research Report, RC24381.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not properly defined or discussed until later. An intelligent pervasive space is a “social and physical space with enhanced capability through ICT for human to interact with the built environments” &lt;ref name="Keynote" /&gt; An alternative definition is “an adaptable and dynamic area that optimises user services and management processes using information systems and networked ubiquitous technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, S. and Nakata, K. [http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/12316/"], ''Ubiquitous Monitoring and Behavioural Change: A Semiotic Perspective''. 11th International Conference on Informatics and Semiotics in Organisations (ICISO). Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China: 449-456”&lt;/ref&gt; A common point between these definitions is that pervasive computing technologies are the means by which intelligence and interactions are achieved in pervasive spaces, with the purpose of enhancing a users experience.

== Theories and techniques ==
Historically, there have been few attempts to consolidate approaches to studying the complex interplay between occupants and the built environment, and to assist in the design of pervasive information environments.  Many theoretical interdisciplinary approaches are relevant to the design of effective pervasive spaces. A core concept in pervasive informatics is the range of interactions that may occur in pervasive spaces: people to people, people to the physical and the physical space to technological artefacts such as sensors. In order to study these interactions it is necessary to have an understanding of what information is being created and exchanged.  In light of this, a series of theories which enable us to consider both social and technological interactions together form the foundations of pervasive informatics &lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;[[Kecheng Liu |Liu, K.]], Nakata, K. and Harty, C. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/inbi/2010/00000002/00000001/art00002"], ''Pervasive informatics: theory, practice and future directions.'' Intelligent Buildings International, Volume 2, Number 1, 2010 , pp. 5-19(15)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== STS ===
[[Socio-technical systems]] provide an approach which assists in understanding and supporting the use of pervasive technologies. The space could be considered as a network of artefacts, information, technology and occupants. By adopting STS approaches, a means for dynamically investigating and mapping such networks becomes possible.

=== Distributed cognition ===
[[Distributed cognition]] can be used to explain how information is passed and processed, with a focus on both interactions between people, in addition to their interactions with the environment.&lt;ref name="hollan"&gt;Hollan, J., HUtchins, E. and Krish, D. [http://cleo.ics.uci.edu/teaching/Winter10/231/readings/2A-HollanHutchinsKirsh-DCOG-TOCHI.pdf"], Distributed Cognition: Toward a New
Foundation for Human-Computer
Interaction Research. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000, Pages 174–196.&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions are analysed in terms of the trajectories of information.

=== CSCW ===
Human interactions with a space, and its effect on coordination mechanisms have been examined in the field of [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). The concepts of [[media space]]s&lt;ref name="gaver"&gt;Gaver, W., [http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/07gaver.videoAffs.cscw92.pdf"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325031918/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/07gaver.videoAffs.cscw92.pdf |date=2012-03-25 }}, ''The Affordances of Media Spaces for Collaboration''. In Proceedings of CSCW'92 (Toronto)&lt;/ref&gt; and awareness have also emerged from CSCW which are of relevance to pervasive informatics.

=== Semiotics ===
[[Semiotics]], the study of signs, can be used to assess the effectiveness of a built environment from six different levels: physical, empirical, syntactical, semantic, pragmatic and social. Semiotics enables us to understand the nature and characteristics of sign-based interactions in pervasive spaces.

== Trend and future research ==
The current technology-centred view of pervasive computing is no longer sufficient for studying the information in the built environment. Socio-technical approaches are required to direct attention to the interaction between the built environment and its occupants. 
The concept of pervasive informatics then captures this shift, and enables current research efforts in different fields to converge their focus and consolidate their methods under one label, leading to a better direction and understanding of this complex domain. Research issues identified for further study in pervasive informatics: 

*Understanding the impacts of intelligent pervasive spaces and enabling technologies on occupants &lt;ref&gt;Moran, S. and Nakata, K. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/inbi/2010/00000002/00000001/art00005"], ''Analysing the factors affecting users in intelligent pervasive spaces'', Intelligent Buildings International, Volume 2, Number 1, 2010 , pp. 57-71”&lt;/ref&gt;
*Designing organisations as pervasive information systems—the role of information and artefacts in communication and interaction.
*Context-dependent information and knowledge management, towards effective decision support in pervasive spaces.
*Service-oriented design of intelligent buildings as adaptive and learning information spaces with regards to norms and emerging practices in intelligent pervasive spaces.
*Through-life intelligent support in building management, with a better understanding of the lifecycle of pervasive spaces from the conception, design, implementation, utilisation till recycling to achieve the building performance and sustainability.

The list, of course, is not exhaustive, but they all address the issues that lie on the boundaries between the physical, informational and social-capturing the essence of pervasive spaces.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10813">{{Environmental law}}
In [[environmental law]], the '''polluter pays principle''' is enacted to make the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]]. It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Union]] countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.

== History ==
According to the French [[historian of the environment]] Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, [[financial compensation]] (not named "polluter pays principle" at that time) is already the regulation principle of [[Industrial pollution|pollution]] favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Ulmi&gt;{{fr}} Nic Ulmi, [https://www.letemps.ch/sciences/2016/10/18/aux-origines-crise-ecologique "Aux origines de la crise écologique"] [The origins of the ecological crisis], ''[[Le temps]]'', 18 October 2016 (page visited on 22 October 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that: "This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves."&lt;ref name=Ulmi/&gt;

== Applications in environmental law==
The polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an [[ecotax]], which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment.

===Australia===
The state of [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]] has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of [[ecologically sustainable development]] in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991, section 6(2)(d)(i)[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The polluter pays principle is set out in the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] &lt;ref&gt;Article 191(2) TFEU&lt;/ref&gt; and Directive 2004/35/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle. The directive entered into force on 30 April 2004; member states were allowed three years to transpose the [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] into their domestic law and by July 2010 all member states had completed this.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/liability/ Environmental Liability], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== France ===
In France, the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the polluter pays principle (article 4):
{{Block quote|Everyone shall be required, in the conditions provided for by law, to contribute to the making good of any damage he or she may have caused to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ghana===
In [[Ghana]], the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Business News, [https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2011/12/08/cabinet-approves-polluter-pays-principle/ Cabinet approves Polluter Pays Principle], 8 December 2011, accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The polluter pays principle is also known as '''extended producer responsibility''' (EPR). This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the [[Swedish government]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University, Sweden (2000).[http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf "Extended Producer Responsibility in Cleaner Production"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010736/http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf |date=2014-05-13 }} Doctoral Dissertation (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines extended producer responsibility as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
a concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from manufacturers’ production process itself, and downstream impacts from the use and disposal of the products. Producers accept their responsibility when designing their products to minimise life-cycle environmental impacts, and when accepting legal, physical or socio-economic responsibility for environmental impacts that cannot be eliminated by design.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Environment Directorate, Paris, France (2006).[http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,3343,en_2649_34395_37284725_1_1_1_1,00.html "Extended Producer Responsibility."] Project Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The [[waste management in Switzerland]] is based on the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref name=Skjellaug/&gt; [[Bin bag]]s (for [[municipal solid waste]]) are taxed with [[Pay as you throw|pay-per-bag fees]] in three quarters of the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]] (and the recycling rate doubled in twenty years).&lt;ref name=Skjellaug&gt;{{fr}} Aïna Skjellaug, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/09/06/lautre-or-suisse-dechets "L’autre or de la Suisse, ses déchets"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Tuesday 6 September 2016 (page visited on 6 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

* the Superfund law requires polluters to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste sites, when the polluters can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Psychogeography''' is an exploration of urban environments that emphasizes playfulness and "drifting".  It has links to the [[Situationist International]].  Psychogeography was defined in 1955 by [[Guy Debord]] as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/2 Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "a total dissolution of boundaries between art and life". Another definition is "a whole toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities... just about anything that takes [[pedestrians]] off their predictable paths and jolts them into a new [[awareness]] of the urban landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Joseph (July/August 2004).

Psychogeography was originally developed by the avant-garde movement [[Lettrist International]] in the journal ''Potlatch''.  The originator of what became known as [[unitary urbanism]], psychogeography, and the [[dérive]] was [[Ivan Chtcheglov]], in his highly influential 1953 essay "Formulaire pour un urbanisme nouveau" ("Formulary for a New Urbanism").&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"]. Full text at bopsecrets.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lettrists' reimagining of the city has its precursors in aspects of [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]].  The idea of urban wandering relates to the older concept of the [[flâneur]], theorized by [[Charles Baudelaire]].  Following Chtcheglov's exclusion from the Lettrists in 1954, [[Guy Debord]] and others worked to clarify the concept of unitary urbanism, in a bid to demand a revolutionary approach to architecture.  At a conference in Cosio di Arroscia, [[Italy]] in 1956, the Lettrists joined the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] to set a proper definition for the idea announced by [[Gil J. Wolman]]: "Unitary Urbanism - the synthesis of art and technology that we call for — must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated."&lt;ref&gt;Wolman, Gil (1956). ''Address by the Lettrist International Delegate to the Alba Conference of September 1956'' ALba: Lettrist International.&lt;/ref&gt;  It demanded the rejection of functional, [[Euclid]]ean values in [[architecture]], as well as the separation between art and its surroundings.  The implication of combining these two negations is that by creating abstraction, one creates art, which, in turn, creates a point of distinction that unitary urbanism insists must be nullified.  This confusion is also fundamental to the execution of unitary urbanism as it corrupts one's ability to identify where "function" ends and "play" (the "ludic") begins, resulting in what the Lettrist International and [[Situationist International]] believed to be a utopia where one was constantly exploring, free of determining factors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;!-- These last few sentences need referencing. Who is making these arguments? --&gt;

In "Formulary for a New Urbanism", Chtcheglov had written "Architecture is the simplest means of articulating time and space, of modulating reality, of engendering dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan (1953). [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Situationists found contemporary architecture both physically and ideologically restrictive, combining with outside cultural influence, effectively creating an undertow, and forcing oneself into a certain system of interaction with their environment: "[C]ities have a psychogeographical relief, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes which strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones".{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}

The Situationists' response was to create designs of new urbanized space, promising better opportunities for experimenting through mundane expression.  Their intentions remained completely as abstractions.  Guy Debord's truest intention was to unify two different factors of "ambiance" that, he felt, determined the values of the urban landscape: the soft ambiance — light, sound, time, the association of ideas — with the hard, the actual physical constructions.  Debord's vision was a combination of the two realms of opposing ambiance, where the play of the soft ambiance was actively considered in the rendering of the hard.  The new space creates a possibility for activity not formerly determined by one besides the individual.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

However, the Situationist International may have been [[tongue-in-cheek]] about some parts of psychogeography.  "This apparently serious term 'psychogeography'", writes Debord biographer Vincent Kaufman, "comprises an art of conversation and drunkenness, and everything leads us to believe that Debord excelled at both."{{Sfn|Kaufman|2006|p=114}}

Eventually, Debord and [[Asger Jorn]] resigned themselves to the fate of "urban relativity".  Debord readily admits in his 1961 film ''A Critique of Separation'', "The sectors of a city…are decipherable, but the personal meaning they have for us is incommunicable, as is the secrecy of private life in general, regarding which we possess nothing but pitiful documents".  Despite the ambiguity of the theory, Debord committed himself firmly to its practical basis in reality, even as he later confesses, "none of this is very clear. It is a completely typical drunken monologue…with its vain phrases that do not await response and its overbearing explanations. And its silences."&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of Separation'' (1961). Complete Cinematic Works ([[AK Press]], 2003, Trans. Knabb. K)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before settling on the impossibility of true psychogeography, Debord made another film, ''On the Passage of a Few Persons Through a Rather Brief Unity of Time'' (1959), the title of which suggests its own subject matter.  The film's narrated content concerns itself with the evolution of a generally passive group of unnamed people into a fully aware, anarchistic assemblage, and might be perceived as a biography of the situationists themselves.  Among the rants which construct the film (regarding art, ignorance, consumerism, militarism) is a desperate call for psychogeographic action:
{{cquote
|When freedom is practised in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, becomes a mere image of itself. The ambiance of play is by nature unstable. At any moment, "ordinary life" may prevail once again. The geographical limitation of play is even more striking than its temporal limitation. Every game takes place within the boundaries of its own spatial domain.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Moments later, Debord elaborates on the important goals of unitary urbanism in contemporary society:
{{cquote
|The atmosphere of a few places gave us a few intimations of the future powers of an architecture that it would be necessary to create in order to provide the setting for less mediocre games.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Quoting [[Karl Marx]], Debord says:
{{cquote
|People can see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them of themselves. Their very landscape is animated. Obstacles were everywhere. And they were all interrelated, maintaining a unified reign of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

While a reading of the texts included in the journal ''Internationale Situationniste'' may lead to an understanding of psychogeography as dictated by Guy Debord, a more comprehensive elucidation of the term would come from research into those who have put its techniques into a more developed practise.  While Debord's influence in bringing Chtchglov's text to an international audience is undoubted, his skill with the 'praxis' of unitary urbanism has been placed into question by almost all of the subsequent protagonists of the Formulary's directives.  Debord was indeed a notorious drunk (see his Panegyrique, Gallimard 1995) and this altered state of consciousness must be considered along with assertions he made regarding his attempts at psychogeographical activities such as dérive and constructed situation.  The researches undertaken by WNLA, AAA and the London Psychogeographical Association during the 1990s support the contention of Asger Jorn and the Scandinavian Situationniste (Drakagygett 1962 - 1998) that the psychogeographical is a concept only known through practise of its techniques.  Without undertaking the programme expounded by Chtchglov, and the resultant submission to the urban unknown, comprehension of the Formulary is not possible.  As Debord himself suggested, an understanding of the 'beautiful language' of situationist urbanism necessitates its practice.

==Dérive==
{{Main|Dérive}}
Psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies.  Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the Dérive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of dérive ("drift").

{{cquote
|In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there… But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}
}}

In the SI's 6th issue, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops — the geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher, ed. (1998). ''Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International'', London: Rebel Pub.. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".{{Sfn|McDonough|2004|p=259}}  To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation.  The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the {{clarify|text=situationist city|date=August 2016}}.

==Contemporary psychogeography==
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] serves as the focal point of local psychogeography oriented groups]]Since the 1990s, as situationist theory became popular in artistic and academic circles, [[avant-garde]], [[neoist]], and [[revolutionary]] groups emerged, developing psychogeographical [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in various ways.  Influenced primarily through the re-emergence of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] and the foundation of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]], these groups have assisted in the development of a contemporary psychogeography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychogeography.org |title=psychogeography.org weblog and archive |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1996 The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture undertook an extensive programme of practical research into classic (situationist) psychogeography in both [[Glasgow]] and London.  The discoveries made during this period, documented in the group's journal ''Viscosity'', expanded the terrain of the psychogeographic into that of [[urban design]] and architectural performance.

The journal ''[[Transgressions: A Journal of Urban Exploration]]'' (which appears to have ceased publication sometime in 2000) collated and developed a number of post-avant-garde revolutionary psychogeographical themes.  The journal also contributed to the use and development of psychogeographical maps&lt;ref&gt;"The production of psychogeographical maps, or even the introduction of alterations such as more or less arbitrarily transposing maps of two different regions, can contribute to clarifying certain wanderings that express not subordination to randomness but total insubordination to habitual influences (influences generally categorized as tourism, that popular drug as repugnant as sports or buying on credit)." from ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography'', Debord 55&lt;/ref&gt; which have, since 2000, been used in political actions, drifts and projections, distributed as flyers. Since 2003 in the [[United States]], separate events known as [[Provflux]] and [[Psy-Geo-conflux]] have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments, under the academic umbrella of psychogeography.

Psychogeography also become a device used in [[performance art]] and [[literature]].  In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in particular, psychogeography has become a recognised descriptive term used in discussion of successful writers such as [[Iain Sinclair]] and [[Peter Ackroyd]] and the documentaries of filmmaker [[Patrick Keiller]].  The popularity of Sinclair drew the term into greater public use in the United Kingdom.  Though Sinclair makes infrequent use of the jargon associated with the Situationists, he has certainly popularized the term by producing a large body of work based on pedestrian exploration of the urban and suburban landscape.  Sinclair and similar thinkers draw on a longstanding British literary tradition of the exploration of urban landscapes, predating the Situationists, found in the work of writers like [[William Blake]], [[Arthur Machen]], and [[Thomas de Quincey]].  The nature and history of [[London]] were a central focus of these writers, utilising [[Romanticism|romantic]], [[gothic novel|gothic]], and [[occult]] ideas to describe and transform the city.  Sinclair drew on this tradition combined with his own explorations as a way of criticising modern developments of urban space in such key texts as ''Lights Out for the Territory''.  Peter Ackroyd's bestselling ''London: A Biography'' was partially based on similar sources.  [[Merlin Coverley]] gives equal prominence to this literary tradition alongside Situationism in his 2006 book ''Psychogeography'', not only recognising that the situationist origins of psychogeography are sometimes forgotten, but that via certain writers like [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Daniel Defoe]], and Charles Baudelaire, they had a shared tradition. Novelist [[Will Self]] had a column "Psychogeography" which started out in the [[British Airways]] [[Inflight magazine]] and then appeared weekly in the Saturday magazine of ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper until October 2008.

The concepts and themes seen in popular comics writers such as [[Alan Moore]] in works like ''[[From Hell]]'' are also now seen as significant works of psychogeography.  Other key figures in this version of the idea are [[Walter Benjamin]], [[J. G. Ballard]], and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]].  Part of this development saw increasing use of ideas and terminology by some psychogeographers from [[Charles Fort|Fort]]ean and occult areas like [[earth mysteries]], [[ley lines]], and [[chaos magic]], a course pioneered by Sinclair.  A core element in virtually all these developments remains a dissatisfaction with the nature and design of the modern environment and a desire to make the everyday world more interesting.

After a few years of practicing, the psychogeography group that gravitates around the Urban Squares Initiative and Aleksandar Janicijevic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/07author.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033354/http://urbansquares.com/07author.html |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330183148/http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html |date=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the initiator of, and main figure in organizing and leading this group, came up with the working definition of this procedure as: "The subjective analysis–mental reaction, to neighbourhood behaviours related to geographic location. A chronological process based on the order of appearance of observed topics, with the time delayed inclusion of other relevant instances". In 2013 Aleksandar Janicijevic published "Urbis - Language of the urban fabric" as a visual attempt to rediscover lost or neglected urban symbols. In 2015 another book was published "MyPsychogeography", an attempt to synthesize sketches and ideas which have informed his art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |title=psychogeography now – window to the urban future &amp;#124; …… |publisher=Photoblog.urbansquares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606150623/http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |archivedate=2013-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate making dérives, a number of applications for mobile devices have been created over the last few years.  Most notably, Dérive app,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deriveapp.com/ Dérive app]&lt;/ref&gt; Serendipitor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serendipitor.net/ Serendipitor]&lt;/ref&gt; Drift,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brokencitylab.org/drift/ Drift]&lt;/ref&gt; and Random GPS&lt;ref&gt;[http://nogovoyages.com/random_gps.html Random GPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Social and Behavioral Sciences Team''' is a group of experts in applied behavioral science that translates findings and methods from the social and behavioral sciences into improvements in Federal policies and programs for the benefit of the American people. The SBST is chaired by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and represents a dozen member agencies across the Federal Government, as well as offices within the Executive Office of the President. SBST also receives critical support from the General Services Administration. The Executive Order charges SBST with providing advice and policy guidance to Federal agencies in support of the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/15/fact-sheet-president-obama-signs-executive-order-white-house-announces|title=Fact Sheet: President Obama Signs Executive Order; White House Announces New Steps to Improve Federal Programs by Leveraging Research Insights|date=2015-09-15|newspaper=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''solar chimney'''{{snd}} often referred to as a '''thermal chimney'''{{snd}} is a way of improving the natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] of [[building]]s by using [[convection]] of [[air]] heated by [[passive solar]] [[energy]]. A simple description of a solar chimney is that of a vertical shaft utilizing solar energy to enhance the natural [[Natural ventilation#Stack driven ventilation|stack ventilation]] through a building.

The [[Solar power|solar]] [[chimney]] has been in use for centuries, particularly in the [[Middle east]] and [[Near East]] by the [[Persian people|Persians]], as well as in [[Europe]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

==Description==
In its simplest form, the solar chimney consists of a black-painted [[chimney]]. During the day solar energy heats the chimney and the air within it, creating an [[updraft]] of air in the chimney. The [[suction]] created at the chimney's base can be used to ventilate and cool the building below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Solar powered Air Conditioning | url = http://www.sxlist.com/techref/other/spac.htm#Vent | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most parts of the world it is easier to harness [[wind power]] for such ventilation as with a [[windcatcher]], but on hot windless days a Solar chimney can provide ventilation where otherwise there would be none.

There are however a number of solar chimney variations. The basic design elements of a solar chimney are:

* The solar collector area: This can be located in the top part of the chimney or can include the entire shaft. The orientation, type of glazing, insulation and thermal properties of this element are crucial for harnessing, retaining and utilizing solar gains.
* The main ventilation shaft: The location, height, cross section and the thermal properties of this structure are also very important.
* The inlet and outlet air apertures: The sizes, location as well as aerodynamic aspects of these elements are also significant.

A [[principle]] has been proposed for [[solar power]] generation, using a large [[greenhouse]] at the base rather than relying solely on heating the chimney itself. (For further information on this issue, see [[Solar updraft tower]].)

Solar chimneys are painted black so that they absorb the sun's heat more effectively. When the air inside the chimney is heated, it rises and pulls cold air out from under the ground via the heat exchange tubes.

== Solar chimney and [[sustainable architecture]] ==
[[File:solarchimney.svg|right|thumb|268px|This solar chimney draws air through a geothermal heat exchange to provide passive home cooling.&lt;ref&gt;"A Theory of Power" {{ISBN|0-595-33030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vail | first = Jeff | title =  Passive Solar &amp; Independence | date = 2005-06-28 | url = http://www.jeffvail.net/2005/06/passive-solar-independence.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Solar chimneys, also called heat chimneys or heat stacks, can also be used in architectural settings to decrease the energy used by mechanical systems (systems that heat and cool the building through mechanical means). Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation have been for decades the standard method of environmental control in many building types, especially offices, in developed countries. Pollution and reallocating energy supplies have led to a new environmental approach in building design. Innovative technologies along with bioclimatic principles and traditional design strategies are often combined to create new and potentially successful design solutions. The solar chimney is one of these concepts currently explored by scientists as well as designers, mostly through research and experimentation.

A solar chimney can serve many purposes.  Direct gain warms air inside the chimney causing it to rise out the top and drawing air in from the bottom. This drawing of air can be used to ventilate a home or office, to draw air through a geothermal heat exchange, or to ventilate only a specific area such as a composting toilet.

Natural ventilation can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by [[convection]] and escape to the outside. At the same time cooler air can be drawn in through vents at the lower level.  Trees may be planted on that side of the building to provide shade for cooler outside air.

This natural ventilation process can be augmented by a solar chimney. The chimney has to be higher than the roof level, and has to be constructed on the wall facing the direction of the sun. Absorption of heat from the sun can be increased by using a [[glazing in construction|glazed]] surface on the side facing the sun. Heat absorbing material can be used on the opposing side. The size of the heat-absorbing surface is more important than the diameter of the chimney. A large surface area allows for more effective heat exchange with the air necessary for heating by solar radiation. Heating of the air within the chimney will enhance convection, and hence airflow through the chimney. Openings of the vents in the chimney should face away from the direction of the [[prevailing wind]].

To further maximize the cooling effect, the incoming air may be led through [[Earth cooling tubes|underground ducts]] before it is allowed to enter the building. The solar chimney can be improved by integrating it with a [[trombe wall]]. The added advantage of this design is that the system may be reversed during the cold season, providing solar heating instead.

A variation of the solar chimney concept is the solar [[attic]]. In a hot sunny climate the attic space is often blazingly hot in the summer. In a conventional building this presents a problem as it leads to the need for increased [[air conditioning]]. By integrating the attic space with a solar chimney, the hot air in the attic can be put to work. It can help the convection in the chimney, improving ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Murti Nugroho | first = Agung | author2=Mohd Hamdan bin Ahmad |author3=Makmal Sain Bangunan  | title = Possibility to Use Solar Induced Ventilation Strategies in Tropical Conditions by Computational Fluid Dynamic Simulation | url = http://eprints.utm.my/2315/1/17-Appendix_B.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a solar chimney may benefit natural ventilation and passive cooling strategies of buildings thus help reduce energy use, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and pollution in general. Potential benefits regarding natural ventilation and use of solar chimneys are:

[[Image:Solar chimney TAS model.jpg|thumb|300px|CAD (TAS) Solar Chimney model]]
* improved ventilation rates on still, hot days
* reduced reliance on wind and wind driven ventilation
* improved control of air flow through a building
* greater choice of air intake (i.e. leeward side of building)
* improved air quality and reduced noise levels in urban areas
* increased night time ventilation rates
* ventilation of narrow, small spaces with minimal exposure to external elements

Potential benefits regarding passive cooling may include:

* improved passive cooling during warm season (mostly on still, hot days)
* improved night cooling rates
* enhanced performance of thermal mass (cooling, cool storage)
* improved thermal comfort (improved air flow control, reduced draughts)

==Precedent Study: The Environmental Building==
The [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) office building in Garston, Watford, United Kingdom, incorporates solar-assisted passive ventilation stacks as part of its ventilation strategy.

Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim to reduce energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions without the use of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, solar shading, and hollow concrete slabs with embedded under floor cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the building management system (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants' needs.

The building utilizes five vertical shafts as an integral part of the ventilation and cooling strategy. The main components of these stacks are a south facing glass-block wall, thermal mass walls and stainless steel round exhausts rising a few meters above roof level. The chimneys are connected to the curved hollow concrete floor slabs which are cooled via night ventilation. Pipes embedded in the floor can provide additional cooling utilizing groundwater.

On warm windy days air is drawn in through passages in the curved hollow concrete floor slabs. Stack ventilation naturally rising out through the stainless steel chimneys enhances the air flow through the building. The movement of air across the chimney tops enhances the stack effect.
During warm, still days, the building relies mostly on the stack effect while air is taken from the shady north side of the building. Low-energy fans in the tops of the stacks can also be used to improve airflow.

Overnight, control systems enable ventilation paths through the hollow concrete slab removing the heat stored during the day, which then remains cold for the following day. The exposed curved ceiling gives more surface area than a flat ceiling would, acting as a [[heat sink]], again providing summer cooling.
Research based on actual performance measurements of the passive stacks found that they enhanced the cooling ventilation of the space during warm and still days and may also have the potential to assist night-time cooling due to their thermally massive structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ní Riain | first = C. | author2=M.

==Passive down-draft cool tower==
[[Image:Zion Visitors Center Cool Tower.PNG|thumb|right|245px|Cool tower at Zion National Park's Visitor Center provides cool air]]
A technology closely related to the solar chimney is the evaporative down-draft cooltower. In areas with a hot, arid climate this approach may contribute to a sustainable way to provide [[air conditioning]] for buildings.

The principle is to allow water to evaporate at the top of a tower, either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water. [[Evaporation]] cools the incoming air, causing a [[downdraft]] of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Torcellini | first = Paul A. | author2=Ron Judkoff |author3=Sheila J.

The Visitor Center was designed by the High Performance Buildings Research of the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL).

The principle of the downdraft cooltower has been proposed for solar power generation as well. (See [[Energy tower (downdraft)|Energy tower]] for more information.)

Evaporation of moisture from the pads on top of the Toguna buildings built by the Dogon people of Mali, Africa contribute to the coolness felt by the men who rest underneath. The women's buildings on the outskirts of town are functional as more conventional solar chimneys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2447">'''Symphorophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] in which [[sexual arousal]] involves staging and watching a [[tragedy]], such as a [[fire]] or a [[traffic accident]].

The term was coined by [[John Money]] in his 1984 paper ''Paraphilias: Phenomenology and classification'', formed from the Greek root "συμφορά" ("symphora", ''event, misfortune''):&lt;ref name = Money1984&gt;{{cite journal | last = Money | first = J | year = 1984 | title = Paraphilias: Phenomenology and classification  | authorlink = John Money | pmid = 6234812 | journal = [[American Journal of Psychotherapy]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A special form of sacrificial paraphilia, for which a suitable name is symphorophilia (being erotically turned on by accidents or catastrophes), culminates in an arranged disaster, such as an automobile crash. Like a game of Russian roulette, it may end in death &amp;mdash; alone or with the partner. However, flirting with disaster, rather than suicide and murder is the trigger responsible for autoerotic arousal and excitement. Being the daredevil who will live to risk a love-death again is an essential part of this paraphilia.

As a photographic print is the positive made from its negative, so also the positive of self-crashing is arranging for a disaster to occur on the highway, and then watching the carnage from a preselected observation post. Disasters other than on the highway may be arranged &amp;mdash; catastrophic fires, for example. For those members of the general public who have a touch of sadomasochism in them, disaster as an unrehearsed event is often a large part of the appeal of entertainment stunts and sports, from the circus to stock-car racing.}}

Although it does not use the term, a 1960 study in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' describes a man aroused by being injured by "an automobile operated by a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Keeler, M. H. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14405114 "An unusual perversion: the desire to be injured by an automobile operated by a woman."] ''Am J Psychiatry''. 1960 May;116:1032.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The main characters in the 1973 novel ''[[Crash (1973 novel)|Crash]]'' by [[J. G. Ballard]] and in the subsequent 1996 [[Crash (1996 film)|film adaptation]] are car-crash fetishists.

'''Ted Ellis''' (born 1963) is an [[United States|American]] artist and former [[environmental chemist]]. Ellis is best known for his [[African American art|African-American themed art]] and styles which blend elements of [[folk art]], [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]] and [[impressionism]]. His personal rendition of [[Barack Obama]] [[acrylic painting|in acrylic]], ''Obama, the 44th President'', was presented in honor of the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|2009 Presidential Inauguration]].

Ellis' art business has sold over 1.75&amp;nbsp;million fine art products, and he works with a number of prominent corporations. He is also known for his community work, especially advancing arts in children's education.

==Personal life and early career==
[[File:Woodlands 055c.jpg|thumb|Ted Ellis creating art.]]

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="class"/&gt; Ellis' first attempt at art was a third-grade freehand sketch of a dog from [[Archie Comics]], which he drew so accurately that friends and family believed it had been traced.&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt; Growing up, one of his favorite characters to draw was ''[[Wile E. Coyote]]'', and as an adult he continues to enjoy comic books as "refreshing".&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="city_social"&gt;{{cite news

When he was old enough, Ted would ride the bus alone to downtown New Orleans so as to be exposed to and spend time with the area artists.&lt;ref name="upscale"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; He and his friends would in their spare time compete with one another to see who could draw the best designs, and Ted continued developing his art skills throughout primary school despite only receiving "satisfactory" marks in art class. In elementary school he attended a summer program at the [[New Orleans Center for Creative Arts]], and later attended an [[after-school program]] at [[Lawless High School]].&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt; Ellis says that he knew he wanted to be an artist in the [[seventh grade]],&lt;ref name="irving_news93"/&gt; and credits his teacher in that class for keeping him focused.&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;

Ted worked for a time with [[Charcoal#Art|charcoal]] and [[pastel]] before settling on [[oil paint|oil]] and [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]].&lt;ref name="irving_news93"/&gt; He took art classes during high school and enrolled in four months of private art lessons, but is otherwise [[self-taught]].&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt; Ellis followed advice from Anna Torregano, his mentor, friend and high school art teacher, and his parents, all of whom advised him to pursue an academic career so as not to become a "[[starving artist]]".

Ted Ellis earned a [[B.Sc.]] in [[Chemistry]] at [[Dillard University]] on a [[United States Army]] [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC scholarship]] as well as academic [[scholarship]], and went on to be [[Commission (document)|commissioned]] a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army]]'s [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery Branch]].&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gdn980322_vision"/&gt;&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt; Ellis spent the next ten years working in the field of chemistry, eight years of which were as an [[environmental chemist]] at [[Rollins Engineering Services]].&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gdn980322_vision"/&gt;&lt;ref name="city_social"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle_purpose"&gt;{{cite news

Chaney is an aspiring [[rap]] artist and has produced a positive, parent-friendly CD about school and drugs titled ''Off the Chain''.&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt;

==Art career==
[[File:TheebaptismII-webc.jpg|thumb|''Thee Baptism'', Ted Ellis' first widely sold art.]]
Ted Ellis maintained a passion for art that preceded his professional art career; he painted throughout his time in the Army and as an [[environmental chemist]], generally working out of a studio in his garage.&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt; His first commissions were produced for two co-workers at Rollins. They had wanted to purchase the piece that he was then working on, but he refused and instead offered to paint them two similar pieces, which they purchased for $40.&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt;

When he first got started, Ellis passed on an opportunity to do work for the [[J. C. Penney]] catalog because he was too busy, but ultimately found success in a similar publication.&lt;ref name="gdn980322_vision"/&gt;

Ellis published his first prints through [[Market Arts]]' Dan Rose in Houston,&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt; but his art career took off when he noticed that his wife's [[Avon Products|Avon]] boutique magazine, targeted at [[African-American]]s, lacked any art. He sent Avon a proposal which they accepted, and through the magazine he sold 42,610 signed prints of ''Thee Baptism''. Since he was still working as an engineer at the time, he autographed the tens-of-thousands of prints during his lunch-break.&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle_purpose"/&gt;

After quitting his job as an engineer in 1996,&lt;ref name="gdn980322_vision"&gt;{{cite news
 | title=An Artist's Vision
 | author=Steve Mayo
 | publisher=''[[The Galveston Daily News]] Lifestyle''
 | date=March 22, 1998}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis competed against 500 others for, and won, a 1998 [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Studios]] commission for art in honor of [[Black History Month]]. The piece was used in the 1999 celebration at [[Epcot Center]] and appeared on T-shirts, souvenir-mugs, and posters.&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gdn070401_hope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle_purpose"/&gt;

===Art Business===
[[File:Prayers Healsmallc.jpg|thumb|''Prayers Heal'' depicts a surgeon who later bought it.]]
An entrepreneurial-minded Ted Ellis has marketed and sold his art throughout his career.&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt; He was already monetizing his creative talents in high school when his classmates and he sold their custom designed T-shirts, first to their school's [[junior (education)|junior]]s and [[senior (education)|senior]]s, and then throughout the [[school district]].&lt;ref name="capital_news"/&gt;

In building his art business over two decades, Ellis engaged in [[fact-finding]] missions in search of financial [[patron]]s and customers at art festivals, conventions, reunions and libraries, as well as local businesses. Ellis [[corporation|incorporated]] his business in 1991.&lt;ref name="capital_news"/&gt; He credits his time at Rollins for teaching him that "if you have a quality product and a good form of distribution, you'll succeed".&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt;

When he first got started, Ellis quickly realized that talent was not alone enough after he had to approach 30–40 galleries until he was picked up by two, one of which closed down. He says that "its a lot of marketing, planning, exhibiting and a lot of rejection".&lt;ref name="gdn980322_vision"/&gt;

Ted's wife Erenia, a loan officer, manages his business, "T. Ellis Art, Incorporated", out of a [[League City, Texas]] studio.&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt; Ellis has sold more than 1.75&amp;nbsp;million fine art products across the country through direct sales, art galleries, catalog outlets, fine art dealers, and licensing, and has marketed community partnership opportunities meant to educate and empower communities by offering maximum returns on minimal investments.&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="city_social"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capital_news"/&gt; In 2005 he signed for representation with art licensing agency "Alaska Momma" with the intent of opening new merchandising avenues in home décor, furnishings, calendars, apparel and stationery.&lt;ref name="gdn051127_katrina"/&gt;

Ellis has affiliated with and had art commissioned by corporations like [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Studios]], [[Minute Maid]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Marathon Oil]], [[ExxonMobile]], [[State Farm Insurance]], [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck Pharmaceutical]], [[J. C. Penney]], [[Southland Corporation]], and [[Avon Products]], [[Philip Morris USA]] and [[Integrity Music]].&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="city_social"/&gt;&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capital_news"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carolina_arts"/&gt;

Ellis' works have been sold  through [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]] catalogs and were available exclusively both through Avon's ''African American Boutique'' as well as their core brochures.&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt;

One of his first major sales was of an original depicting a God-like surgeon in an operating-room, sold to the surgeon.&lt;ref name="citizen"/&gt; Ellis' art has sold for prices ranging from $750 to $30,000.&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt;&lt;ref name="friendswood_journal"/&gt;

Despite his success, while Ellis initially had hoped to build his business up to [[Fortune 500]] stature, he now finds satisfaction in "helping others through art".&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt;

===Hurricane Katrina===
[[File:Surviving Katrinasmallc.jpg|thumb|''Surviving Katrina'', inspired by the hope he saw in a lone man rebuilding in [[New Orleans]] in the days after [[Hurricane Katrina]]/whose flag represents the need for the nation to unite behind those rebuilding.]]

Ted Ellis and his wife are both natives of New Orleans, and much of his art along with his passion for art are inspired by the vibrant city. As a young man, he would search the colorful [[French Quarter]] for subjects to paint.&lt;ref name="city_social"/&gt; In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and the devastation of parts of the city, the city's role in his art drastically changed so as to reflect the story of hope and rebirth that he saw in the disaster.&lt;ref name="gdn051127_katrina"/&gt;

On the night before the storm hit Louisiana, the Ellis home in Texas was a refuge for 10 New Orleans families, 50 people in all. After the storm, Ellis helped fly home friends stranded outside New Orleans, and he organized colleagues in the art community behind the relief effort.&lt;ref name="aac"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis was allowed to enter the city two weeks after the flood waters subsided in order to survey the damage to his mother's home in the [[Lower Ninth Ward]] and salvage her possessions.&lt;ref name="gdn070401_hope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gdn051127_katrina"&gt;{{cite news

 | date=November 27, 2005}}
&lt;/ref&gt; While travelling among the destroyed houses and deserted city, Ellis witnessed a lone man repairing his home's roof. The contrast resonated with Ellis, and he memorialized the hope he saw in the man's actions through his piece ''Surviving Katrina''.&lt;ref name="gdn070401_hope"/&gt; The scene is of rising floodwater that traps a family on their house's roof while the father holds up the [[Flag of the United States]], a flag that to Ellis symbolizes the need for the nation to come together to aid those affected by the storm.&lt;ref name="city_social"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gdn051127_katrina"/&gt;

In ''Life Begins Anew'', a father holds a baby above floodwaters while another man reaches out to take the child. Ellis describes the scene as symbolizing the promise of a new beginning for those who survived Katrina and its aftermath.&lt;ref name="gdn070401_hope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gdn051127_katrina"/&gt;
 
As its title indicates, the ''Katrina: The Hope, Healing and Rebirth of New Orleans'' collection was for Ellis about showing the power of art to assist the healing process: "The largest piece I did is about how life begins anew and how a person can find hope even after such devastation. I want this work to be uplifting, to be a fresh breath of life for the community."&lt;ref name="aac"/&gt;

===Obama Portrait===
[[File:Obamathe44th-web 426x450c.jpg|thumb|The many colors represent the unity that Ellis saw in the inauguration of ''Obama, the 44th President''.]]
One of Ted Ellis' more famous works is an [[abstract art|abstract]] depiction of [[Barack Obama]]'s signature 'hope' pose. Ellis painted the portrait in honor of [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Obama's 2008 Presidential inauguration]]. In ''Obama, the 44th President'', Ellis uses red, blue, yellow, and green [[acrylic paint]] to portray Obama as someone who unites people across lines of color, ethnicity, and religion.

The piece was presented at a January 19, 2009 gala held by the [[National Black Chamber of Commerce]] and the [[National Newspaper Publishers Association]] Foundation at the [[Embassy of France, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of France in Washington, D.C.]] The proceeds from the autographed prints sold at the event supported NNPA Foundation and the [[Howard University]] School of Communications Building Fund (NNPA Media Wing).&lt;ref name="crusader"&gt;{{cite news

===African-American history===
[[File:FreeAtLast-Tedtellissmallc.jpg|thumb|''Free At Last'' depicts several themes from [[African-American history]].]]
In 2009, Ted Ellis produced an exhibit focusing on the theme of [[African-American history]] in light of [[slavery]] and [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]]. The exhibit, ''American Slavery: The Reason Why We're Here'', tied into the [[Juneteenth]] commemoration of slavery's abolition in the State of Texas. It was located at and included tours of the historic residence of horticulturist [[Henry Stringfellow]], an innovator in [[organic gardening]] who was enlightened in how he employed of [[freedmen]]. Ellis began the series of works at a 2006 exhibition at the same house.&lt;ref name="gdn090619_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gdn090605_juneteenth2"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibit's more than 20 paintings were painted with brush and fingers, and Ellis sometimes added a collage of documents. The exhibit included images of the transportation of slaves, the industry of slavery in crop production, and the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name="gdn090619_history"/&gt;

The painting ''Free At Last'' includes depictions of [[Buffalo soldiers]], [[Harriet Tubman]], [[1865 in the United States|the year "1865"]], a mighty oak, and in the background, their heads bowed in prayer, the figures of the current owner and restorer of the house, Sam Collins III, and his wife and children. The exhibit also displayed Ellis' famous depiction of Barack Obama, ''Obama, the 44th President''.&lt;ref name="gdn090619_history"/&gt;

Ellis' art was featured at a 2011 exhibition at the [[Rosa Parks Library and Museum]]. The Museum, at [[Troy University]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], hosted the exhibit, called ''Our History, Heritage, and Culture: An American Story, the Art of Ted Ellis'', as part of its celebration of [[Black History Month]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/01/prweb4965074.htm Artist Ted Ellis Partners with the Rosa Parks Museum at Troy University to Celebrate Black History] Houston, TX (PRWEB) January 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

T. Ellis has been pictorially documenting African-American lifestyle, history and culture for thirty years. Ellis paintings are in the permanent collection of the [[DuSable Museum of African American History|DuSable museum]], [[Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History|Charles Wright museum]], the McKenna museum, Free People of Color Museum, and the [[Amistad Research Center]]. The City of Selma, Alabama, commissioned T. Ellis as the official artist for the 50th anniversary for the civil rights march, known as "Bloody Sunday".&lt;ref name="free" /&gt; The City and County of Galveston, Texas, recognized T. Ellis for the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth. The Juneteenth Freedom Project was exhibited at the State Capitol in Washington, DC at the U.S. Senate Rotunda and House of Representatives Rayburn Building.&lt;ref name="june" /&gt; President Barack Obama and the First Lady, Michelle Obama of the White House has thanked T.

Bush and Speaker of the House of T Representatives Nancy Pelosi stand amidst 300 Tuskegee Airmen during a photo opportunity Thursday, March 29, 2007, in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol.

==Educational work==
Ted Ellis views education as one of his primary missions, and he is involved with several educational initiatives.&lt;ref name="city_social"/&gt;&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt; He has a run a number of art workshops with children, including drawing and touching up the school mural which local sixth-graders paint every year,&lt;ref name="gdn040527_mural"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; and joining with his wife Erania to illustrate while she reads aloud to children from books about topics like the [[Buffalo Soldiers]]. When working with children with autism, he employs a strategy of engaging the children's creativity in a non-judgemental setting where there is no wrong way for them to express themselves; he hopes to put their art on display at the [[Houston Children's Museum]].&lt;ref name="chronicle_purpose"/&gt;

He has partnered with the [[Tom Joyner|Tom Joyner Foundation]] to fund-raise for students, while "Art with a Purpose", his own nonprofit program, was awarded a [[federal grant]] to help disadvantaged students.&lt;ref name="rollingout"/&gt;

Ellis serves together with [[Gregory Michael Carter]] as an [[artist-in-residence]] for an [[Art education in the United States|arts enrichment]] program at a [[Galveston, Texas]] [[charter school]], "Ambassadors Preparatory Academy". The program, called "Ambassadors for Art", is led by school administrators and members of the community through the [[Gulf Coast]] Apollo Chapter of nonprofit volunteer service organization [[The Links, Incorporated]].&lt;ref name="gdn120109_ambassadors"&gt;{{cite news

==Style==
[[File:Sundayworship-webc.jpg|thumb|''Sunday Worship'' is Ellis' most popular work and personal favorite.]]
Ted Ellis has over his career created art in a number of styles and has incorporated several primary influences.

[[African American history]] and [[African American culture]] play central roles in Ellis' art, which regularly feature themes like [[Buffalo Soldiers]], [[cotton]] fields, and [[Jazz music]];&lt;ref name="friendswood_journal"/&gt; his Jazz works especially lean towards the [[impressionist]]ic. Other common themes range from fisherman to religious scenes&lt;ref name="carolina_arts"/&gt; as in ''Thee Baptism'', ''My Father's Baptism'', and ''Deacon's Door'', to African ethnic scenes like ''Afrimage'' and ''Ashanti''.&lt;ref name="class"/&gt;

The Church-related themes in his art he attributes to formative experiences with his mother at their local house of worship, "Beulah Land Church".&lt;ref name="southern_living"/&gt;

While he is best known for his ethnic art, many of Ellis' pieces are [[landscape]]s, [[seascape]]s, and [[portrait]]s.&lt;ref name="class"/&gt;

Ted Ellis is a [[self-taught art]]ist. He has describes his style at times as "conventional realism",&lt;ref name="class"/&gt; as a bold blend of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]],&lt;ref name="crusader"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irving_news93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gpn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="city_social"/&gt; and as impressionist and [[naturalist]], an [[old master]]s' style that is sometimes [[Figurative art|figurative]] and sometimes [[folk art]]. "I try to capture the essence in one stroke" he said.&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;

Ellis has also coined the term "Tedism" to describe his style. "Tedism" blends impressionism, [[soul]], and folk stories to create representational pieces.&lt;ref name="capital_news"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingout"/&gt;

Ted Ellis considers himself to be a social, political and spiritual artist as well as educator and "creative historian". "I paint subjects that are representative of the many facets of American life as I know it" says Ellis. "I like to think of myself as a creative historian. I was put here to record history...all aspects of American culture and heritage. My sole purpose has always been to educate through my art".&lt;ref name="crusader"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capital_news"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; He draws inspiration from people's memories of family or from history, and says that he's "a history buff at heart. I read a lot, and I have more books than paint."&lt;ref name="rollingout"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

As an artist who focuses on African American history, Ellis intentionally does not approach its difficult chapters from a position of pain: "I have to be careful what I do [...] there's a power to art. I don't want to be from an angry position. That's out there, and maybe they do that to shake you up and make you think. I want to be one step ahead. When you're talking about healing, you're in the right zone." As such, his images of slavery and historical Southern life focus on positive values such as family, character, and church.&lt;ref name="gdn070401_hope"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis attributes a love for and influence in his art to New Orleans and its rich culture of creativity. He compared the city to an [[Business incubator|incubator]] for young talent. The city offered Ted art clubs and opportunities to design murals for school and create signs for special events. New Orleans gave him access to art classes, summer art programs, and the vibrant [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], somewhere he could talk with and get to know many artists.&lt;ref name="capital_news"/&gt;

Ellis' favorite artists include [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]], [[Edward Bannister]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Samella Lewis]], and [[John T. Scott]], while among his work the favorite painting is ''Sunday Worship''.&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;

Ellis donated two of the exhibition's pieces to the Center: ''We Are Americans'' (2002) and ''The Struggle Continues'' (2003).

==Charity Work==
Ted Ellis is involved with various causes and charitable organizations including [[United Way of America|United Way]], [[ICLS]], [[African American Visual Arts Association]],&lt;ref name="gdn120109_ambassadors"/&gt; [[Jack and Jill (organization)#Jack and Jill of America Foundation|Jack and Jill of America Inc.]], the [[United Negro College Fund]], Heritage Christian Academy, and various [[State school|public school]] districts.

==Views on African American art==
In a column published in ''Images Magazine'', Ted Ellis calls on the younger generations of black artists to recognize the hardship faced by and the effort put in by the previous generation of black artists in order to pave the way for the newer generation to be able to succeed, and to do so with far less difficulty.&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="images"&gt;''[[Images Magazine]]'' Volume II Number 4. Perspectives. Ted Ellis. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

He says African-American are still not within the mainstream, and despite being the most financially minded black artists yet, that the current generation still earns less than it should. Ellis further assigns partial responsibility on an academic world that he sees as not paying sufficient attention to the genre.&lt;ref name="capital_news"/&gt;

He believes strongly that African-Americans should value their art on their terms, looking past aesthetics, and that only thus will the genre grow and be better appreciated.&lt;ref name="upscale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capital_news"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; is recognized as a field of [[computer-assisted language learning]] as it relates to the use of technology in language learning. Outside the field of language education this type of pedagogic practice is increasingly being used to internationalize the curriculum and offer students the possibility to engage with peers in other parts of the world in collaborative online projects. Different terms are used to refer to this practice, for example [[virtual exchange]], collaborative online international learning ([http://coil.suny.edu/page/brief-history-suny-coil-center COIL]),&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, J. &amp; Guth, S.

==Telecollaboration 2.0==
Guth and Helm (2010)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=S |first1=Guth |last2=F |first2=Helm |title=Telecollaboration 2.0: Language, literacies and intercultural learning in the 21st century (Vol. 1) |date=2010 |publisher=Peter Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; built on the pedagogy of telecollaboration by expanding on its traditional practices via incorporating [[Web 2.0|'''Web 2.0''']] tools in online collaborative projects. This enriched practice widely became known as telecollaboration 2.0.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Telecollaboration 2.0, [Http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Telecollaboration|not being a completely new phase], serves to achieve nearly the same goals of telecollaboration. A distinctive feature of Telecollaboration 2.0, however, lies in prioritizing promoting the development and mastery of new online literacies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although telecollaboration and telecollaboration 2.0 are used interchangeably, the latter slightly differs in affording "a complex context for language education as it involves the simultaneous use and development" of intercultural competencies,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; internationalize classrooms and promotes authentic intercultural communication&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; among partnering schools/students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Models==
There are several different 'models' of telecollaboration which have been extensively described in the literature.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;O’Rourke, B. (2007). Models of telecollaboration (1): eTandem. In R. O’Dowd (Ed.). ''Online intercultural exchange: An introduction for foreign language teachers'' (pp. 41-61). Clevedon: Multilingual Matters. 
&lt;/ref&gt;  The first models to be developed were based on the partnering of foreign language students with "native speakers" of the target language, usually by organizing exchanges between two classes of foreign language students studying one another's languages. The most well established models are the eTandem and the [https://cultura.mit.edu Cultura], and [[eTwinning]] models.

eTandem, which developed from the face to face Tandem Learning approach, has been widely adopted by individual learners who seek partners on the many available educational websites which offer to help find partners and suggest activities for tandem partners to engage in.  However, the eTandem model has also been used for class-to-class telecollaboration projects where teachers establish specific objectives, tasks, and/or topics for discussion.&lt;ref&gt;
O’Rourke, B. (2007). Models of telecollaboration (1): eTandem. In R. O’Dowd (Ed.). ''Online intercultural exchange: An introduction for foreign language teachers'' (pp. 41-61). Clevedon: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Dowd (ends), ''Online Intercultural Exchange: Policy, Pedagogy, Practice'' (pp. 241-249). London/New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on eTandem and was developed in Brazil, but focuses on oral communication through VOIP tools such as Skype and Google Hangouts. Until recent years, however, telecollaboration has generally used asynchronous communication tools.

The Cultura project was developed by teachers of French as a foreign language at MIT in the late 1990s with the aim of making culture the focus of their foreign language class.&lt;ref&gt;Furstenberg, G., Levet, S., English, K., &amp; Maillet, K. (2001). Giving a voice to the silent culture of language: The CULTURA project. ''[http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num1/furstenberg/default.pdf Language Learning &amp; Technology]'', 5(1), 55–102.&lt;/ref&gt; This model takes its inspiration from the words of the Russian philosopher [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]: "It is only in the eyes of another culture that foreign culture reveals itself fully and profoundly ... A meaning only reveals its depths once it has encountered and come into contact with another foreign meaning" (as cited in Furstenberg, Levet, English, &amp; Maillet, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;58). Cultura is based on the notion and process of cultural comparison and entails students analysing cultural products in class with their teachers and interacting with students of the target languages and cultures through which they develop a deeper understanding of each other's culture, attitudes, representations, values, and frames of reference.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Furstenberg, G. (2016).  The Cultura exchange program. In O'Dowd, R. &amp; Lewis, T. (2016) (Eds.), Online intercultural exchange: Policy, pedagogy, practice (pp. 248-255). London/New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The eTwinning project, which essentially is a network of schools and educators within the European Union and part of [http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en Eramus+], contrasts with its earlier counterparts in not setting specific guidelines apropos of language use, themes or structure.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Languages for Intercultural Communication and Education|last=Miguela|first=A. D.|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=O’Dowd|editor-first=R.|location=Clevedon|pages=15, 85|chapter=Models of telecollaboration (3): eTwinning}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model serves as a broad platform for schools within the EU to exchange information and share materials online, and provides a virtual space for countless pedagogical opportunities where teachers and students collectively learn, communicate and collaborate using a foreign language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Quintessentially, eTwinning has the following four objectives: '''1.''' setting up a collaborative network among European schools by connecting them via [https://teaching.pitt.edu/blog/web-2-0-tools-in-teaching-and-learning/ Web 2.0 tools]; '''2.''' encouraging educators and students to collaborate with their counterparts in other European countries; '''3.''' fostering a learning environment in which European identity is integrated with multilingualism and multiculturalism; '''4.''' continuously developing educators' professional skills "in the pedagogical and collaborative use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  eTwinning has thus proven to be a strong model for telecollaboration in recent years, since it enables the authentic use of foreign language among virtual partners, i.e. teachers and students. Not surprisingly, eTwinning projects have become increasingly recognized at various educational institutions across the continent.
Each of the telecollaborative models discussed above has its strengths and weaknesses:

The '''Thawri''' (Arabic:الثوري) [[Madhhab]] was a short lived school of [[Fiqh|Islamic Jurisprudence]]. Its founder was [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Sufyan Al-Thawri]], a great 8th Century [[alim|scholar]], jurist and hadith compiler.&lt;ref name=Judd&gt;Steven C. Judd, “Competitive hagiography in biographies of al-Awzaʿi and Sufyan al-Thawri”, Journal of the American Oriental Society 122:1 (Jan–March, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Ath-Thawri's]] move to Basra later in his life, his jurisprudential thought ([[Usul al-fiqh|usul]]) became more closely aligned to that of the [[Umayyads]] and of [[al-Awza'i|Al-Azwa'i]].&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt;

He spent the last year of his life hiding after a dispute between him and the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mahdi|Muhammad Ibn Mansur Al-Mahdi]]. After his death, the Thawri [[Madhhab]] was taken up by his students, including notably Yahya al-Qattan.&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt; However, his school did not survive, but his jurisprudential thought and especially hadith transmission are highly regarded in Islam, and have influenced all the major [[madh'hab|schools]].

"'''The Esoteric Character of the Gospels'''" is an article published in three parts: in November-December 1887, and in February 1888, in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] magazine [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']]; it was written by [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{refn|group=note|''Lucifer,'' Vol. 1, November 1887, p. 173–80; December 1887, p. 299–309; February 1888, p. 490–96.{{sfn|Index}}}} It was included in the 8th volume of the author's ''Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Price|1985}} In 1888, for this work, the author was awarded [[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] medal.{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|When the [[Theosophical Society]] was created, the encouraging of "the study of [[comparative religion]], philosophy, and science" was proclaimed his second major task.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992}}}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Versus clerics ===
An American author [[Gary Lachman]], noting Blavatsky's "animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos," has cited her article in which she writes that "[[Christianity]] is now the religion of arrogance ''par excellence,'' a stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth, sham and power; a convenient screen for hypocrisy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=176|Lachman|2012|2p=112}} A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] has noted that she did not make secrets out of her "skeptical attitude towards the [[Gospel]]s," considering them unrelated to either [[Jesus]] or his [[Apostles]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=297}}{{refn|group=note|Noting in church Christianity the dogmatism generated by the "painful ambition of its hierarchs," Blavatsky regarded it exclusively as a religious sanctification of "power over people."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=298}}}} Joseph Tyson wrote in his book that, according to Blavatsky, for example, in the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] camp there are 350 dissenting [[sect]]s, and she commented that if "one of these may have the approximate truth, still 349 must be necessarily false."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=175|Tyson|2006|2p=384}} A Russian philosopher Lydia Fesenkova wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the Christian sacred books are "magazines of falsehoods," and all of them have served {{quote|"as a means for securing power and of supporting the ambitious policy of an unscrupulous priesthood. All have promoted superstition, all made of their gods blood-thirsty and ever-damning Molochs and fiends, as all have made nations to serve the latter more than the God of Truth."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1pp=179–80|Фесенкова|2001|2p=18}}}}

Professor [[Robert Ellwood]] wrote that Blavatsky was a ruthless critic of the church tradition of Christianity, whether in relation to "the [[Church Fathers]] or modern priests, pastors and missionaries." The reason for her hostility to church Christianity "was what she perceived as arrogance combined with misplaced concreteness." She believed that "churchmen, past and present, whether through intentional deceit or mere stupidity, had concealed the real origin and meaning of Christianity as a vehicle of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|ancient wisdom]]."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

=== Historical Jesus ===
A Russian orthodox theologian, Dimitry Drujinin wrote that in her article Blavatsky calls [[Lod|Lüd]] as the "hometown" of Jesus. This indicates that she supported the statements of [[Talmud]] that Jesus was the [[Yeshu|son of a man named Pandira]] and "lived a hundred years before the beginning of the Gospel events." In his youth, he lived for many years in Egypt, where he "was initiated" in esoteric wisdom. After returning to Palestine, he reorganized the movement of the [[Essenes]], who worshipped him as a teacher. Slandered by his enemies, he was killed in his hometown. Drujinin quotes the article with "He was stoned and then crucified on a tree, on the eve of [[Passover]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Дружинин|2012|2p=68}}

=== Chrestos and Christos ===
Drujinin wrote that, according to Blavatsky, it is necessary to distinguish between Chrêstos and [[Christ (title)|Christos]] (Christ). The first name, in hers opinion, means neophyte who approaching to Initiation, and the second one she defines in this way: "Christ— the true esoteric [[Salvation in Christianity|'''Saviour''']]—is no man, but the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'''Divine Principle''']] in every human being."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Дружинин|2012|2p=66}}{{refn|group=note|"'''Chrestes''', '''Chrestos''' (Greek). Applied by the Greeks as a title of respect equivalent to 'the worthy.' Chrestes meant an interpreter of oracles. In the language of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mysteries]], a chrestos was a candidate or neophyte, and a christos (anointed) was an initiate. Christ is a mystical expression for the human [[Ātman (Hinduism)|inner god]], while chrest is the good but as yet unregenerated nature."{{sfn|Glossary|1999|loc=Chrestes}}}} Drujinin added that she believes that Christians have lost the understanding of the true meaning of the word Christos: "The very meaning of the terms Chrêstos and Christos, and the bearing of both on 'Jesus of Nazareth,' a name coined out of Joshua the Nazar, has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian Occultists."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=215|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} He wrote that Christians, according to Blavatsky, only afterwards unfairly put aside "all the other Chrêstoi, who have appeared to them as rivals of their Man-God."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=205|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} The Russian ''Encyclopedia of Sages, Mystics, and Magicians'' wrote that in her article Blavatsky "allegorically" proclaims: "Christos was 'the '''Way''',' while Chrêstos was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal through that 'Path,' which goal was Christos, the glorified Spirit of ''''Truth'''.'"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Беренс|2003|2p=64}} In a like manner Drujinin has quoted hers article: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To the true follower of the '''Spirit of Truth''', it matters little, therefore, whether Jesus, as man and Chrêstos, lived during the era called Christian, or before, or never lived at all. The Adepts, who lived and died for humanity, have existed in many and all the ages."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=204|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tyson wrote that "sanctification," in Blavatsky's opinion, "was ever the synonym (for) the '[[Mahatma|Mahatmic]]-condition,' i.e., the union of the man with the divine principle (Augoeides) in him."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=190|Tyson|2006|2p=183}} In this connection, he has said that [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] friars "practiced fasting, celibacy, contemplative prayer, and charity in order to," as Blavatsky writes, "kill one's personality and its passions, to blot out... separateness from one's 'Father,' the Divine [[Spirit]] in man."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=201|Tyson|2006|2p=183}}

=== Esotericism in the Gospels ===
While studying the Theosophical doctrine, Drujinin has stated that Blavatsky considers the "story of Jesus Christ," which was told in the Gospels, as a fantasy. In support of this he has quoted hers article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whence, then, the Gospels, the life of Jesus of Nazareth? Has it not been repeatedly stated that no human, mortal brain could have invented the life of the Jewish Reformer, followed by the awful drama on [[Calvary]]? We say on the authority of the [[esoteric]] Eastern School, that all this came from the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], as far as the name [[Christ (title)|Christos]] and the astronomico-mystical allegories are concerned, and from the writings of the ancient [[Tannaim|Tanaïm]] as regards the [[Kabbalah|Kabalistic]] connection of Jesus or Joshua, with the Biblical personifications."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=210|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to French philosopher [[Édouard Schuré]], [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esotericism]] in the Gospels is revealed if to approach them from the standpoint of the "[[Essenes|Essenian]] and Gnostic traditions."{{sfn|Schuré|1921}} A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] stated that the "Gospels" in ancient times were not "the biographies of one, or of any, living earthly person, but were held as the literary forms of a universal dramatical representation of the experience of our divine [[soul]]s in the mortal body here on earth."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=9}}

== Criticism ==
This article by Blavatsky always aroused rejection on the part of those who professed the teachings of Jesus only literally.{{sfn|Cranston|1993}} Thus, a priest Drujinin ([[Russian Orthodox Church]]) claimed that the Theosophists "had reduced" Jesus Christ to the level of one of the Adepts and even generally questioned his existence.{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}} And moreover:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The founders of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] deny the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. Recognizing within the framework of the concepts [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] the possibility of paying by sufferings only for their own sins, they actually represent the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ only as a tragicomic mistake."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the other hand, Alvin Kuhn, being a supporter of [[Christ myth theory]], stated that esotericism "hung up midway" between recognizing the Gospels as documents of early Christian history or treating them as an allegory. He wrote that Blavatsky contributed to this "anomalous" situation: arguing in one place that "Christ— the true esoteric '''Saviour'''—is no man, but the '''Divine Principle''' in every human being,"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Kuhn|1990|2p=16}} she in another place supports a thesis about the real existence of the [[Master Jesus|Jewish Adept Jesus]]. Kuhn proclaimed: "The matter of the existence or non-existence of a certain man in human history is not dual in nature. Either Jesus, the Gospel Figure, was a person in human body, or he was not."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=17}}

According to Ellwood, many of Blavatsky's "onslaughts" against Christianity, including her attacks on organizations that devoted themselves to "good works such as [[the Salvation Army]], were not always even-handed." Moreover, she apparently didn't know about the nascent [[Liberal Christianity|liberal branch of Christian theology]] — "[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], Coleridge, [[William Ellery Channing|Channing]], Kingsley and many others" who had nothing to do to the primitive "dogmatism she so hated." Nevertheless, her attacks on church Christianity can be seen as necessary to fulfill the task of the [[Theosophical Society]] connected with the formation of a "new spirituality based on an immanent universalism" which opposing [[Religious intolerance|aggressive religiosity]] "she saw all around, whether in European bishops or in missionaries abroad."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

'''Télécom ParisTech''' (also known as '''ENST''' or '''Télécom''' or '''École nationale supérieure des télécommunications''') is one of the top French public institutions of higher education and research ([[grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]]) of engineering in France. Located in [[Paris]], it is also a member of the [[ParisTech]] Group and the [[Institut Télécom|Institut Telecom]].

In 1991, Télécom ParisTech and the [[EPFL]] collaborated and established a school named [[EURECOM]] located in [[Sophia-Antipolis]]. Students can now be admitted in two different curriculums, located either in the Paris or the Sophia-Antipolis campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/enseignement/cursus.html|title = Les cursus de la formation d'ingénieur|date = |accessdate = |website = Télécom ParisTech|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

*In 1845, Alphonse Foy, director of telegraphic lines, proposed a school specializing in telegraphy for Polytechnicians. His proposition was rejected.
*The school was founded on 12 July 1878 as the École professionnelle supérieure des postes et télégraphes (EPSPT).
*In 1912 the school's name was changed to École supérieure des postes et télégraphes (ESPT).
*In 1934 the ESPT moved to rue Barrault, in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]].
*In 1938 the school was renamed École nationale supérieure des postes, télégraphes et téléphones (ENSPTT), and in the same year, the [[President of France]], [[Albert Lebrun]] honored the school [[Legion of Honor]].
*During the [[Second World War]], in 1942, the school was divided into two schools: the ENSPTT and École nationale supérieure des télécommunications (ENST). The ENSPTT was closed on 31 December 2002.
*In 1971 the ENST passed under the direct guardianship of the ''Direction générale des télécommunications'', and the development of telecommunications during this period drove the state to create two associate schools: the [[ENST Bretagne]] in 1977 in [[Brest, France|Brest]], and the [[Telecom &amp; Management SudParis|INT]] in 1979 at [[Évry, Essonne|Évry]].
*In 1992 the ENST, together with the [[EPFL]], founded the [[EURECOM]] at [[Sophia-Antipolis]].
*On 26 December 1996 the [[Groupe des Écoles des Télécommunications]] (GET) was established. It consists of a group of telecommunications schools including the ENST, the [[ENST Bretagne|Telecom Bretagne]], the [[Telecom SudParis]], and [[EURECOM]].
*On 21 September 2009, the school's name was changed to Télécom ParisTech.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000021059936 Décret n° 2009-1136 du 21 septembre 2009 relatif à l'Institut Télécom]. Legifrance. Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
There are two ways to get admitted into Télécom ParisTech as an undergraduate student:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usine-digitale.fr/article/telecom-paristech-les-telecoms-en-heritage-le-web-en-destinee.N239204|title = Admission Process|date = |accessdate = |website = L'Usine Nouvelle|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Through a selective entrance examination ([[:fr:Concours commun Mines-Ponts|Concours Commun Mines Ponts]]) after at least two years of preparation in [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|Classes préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles]] curriculum following high school
* Through an application-based admission process for university students
** After a scientific bachelor's degree (Mathematics, Physics, Mechanics, Computer science etc.)
** After a [[:fr:Diplôme universitaire de technologie|DUT]] degree from a French university of technology
University students can also get admitted into Télécom ParisTech's [[Master of Science]] (MSc.) programme through an application-based admission process for university students from all over the world.

Télécom ParisTech is also one of the approved application schools for the [[École Polytechnique]], making it possible for fourth-year students to complete their studies with a one-year specialization at Télécom ParisTech. Télécom ParisTech also provides education for the [[Corps des télécommunications]].

Around 250 engineers graduate each year from Télécom ParisTech. Thirty to thirty-five percent of the graduates are foreign students coming from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/palmares-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs/telecom-paristech.html|title = Palmarès des Écoles d'ingénieurs|date = |accessdate = |website = L'Étudiant|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialization courses cover all aspects of computer science and communication engineering: Electronics, Signal processing, Software engineering, Networking, Economics, Finance etc.

==Research at Télécom ParisTech==
Research at Télécom ParisTech consists of:

*Optimization and transmission of information
*Improvements in Data processing
*Microelectronics, such as FPGA and DSP systems
*Image and Signal processing, wavelets
*Artificial intelligence, data mining, distributed and real-time systems
*User experience Design, Information visualisation and computer human interfaces

Télécom ParisTech has four research laboratories:

*The Department of Electronics and Communications: This laboratory consists of about one hundred researchers and teaching researchers (37 tenured) within 7 research groups
*The Department of Computer Science and Networking
*The Department of Signal and Image Processing
*The Department of Economic and Social Sciences

These departments are associated with the [[CNRS]] through the "Laboratory of the Communication and Processing of Information" and the "Interdisciplinary Institute for Innovation".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-3.fr/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training for engineering degrees==
*'''First year - Multidisciplinary studies'''
For undergraduate students, the core curriculum, commonly referred to as ''tronc commun,'' consists of courses in most areas of science (Mathematics, Economics, applied Mathematics, Computer science, Physics, etc.), as well as compulsory courses in the humanities (foreign languages, social sciences, liberal arts, etc.)

Taking place in the Paris campus of Télécom ParisTech, this primary year of multidisciplinary studies is common to both Paris curriculum students and Sophia-Antipolis curriculum students; and is followed by a one or two month mandatory summer internship. 
*'''Second and Third Year - Specialization in Paris or at Sophia-Antipolis (at [[EURECOM]])''' 
Starting from their second year, students have to choose a specialization in which they'll receive in-depth courses and that will conclude their engineering curriculum. Based on 13 specialization tracks more than 120 courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/enseignement/cursus/cycle-master-cursus-paris.html|title = Cycle Master: Campus Paris|date = |accessdate = |website = Télécom ParisTech|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; these two years eventually unfold into a six-month internship through which the engineering student will acquire their first real professional experience.

Third year students can also choose to complete their studies in an approved university in France or abroad, as part of a Double-Degree or a Master of Science program.
