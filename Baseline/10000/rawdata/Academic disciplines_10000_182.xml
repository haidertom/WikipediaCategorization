[[Image:Red Ribbon.svg|200px|thumb|A red ribbon is often used to signify the fight against AIDS]]
[[AIDS]], caused by the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), has become a global health issue, and various ways are being explored in order to combat the spread of the [[disease]]. One such way to somewhat limit the spread of AIDS is through [[education]]. Societies with significant number of HIV positive individuals and people that have been diagnosed with having cases of AIDS are societies in which education about the disease is limited to almost non-existent and where culture and [[tradition]] clash with [[modern medicine]]. Thus, education and training are of great importance and a number of organizations have been formed within the past two decades. Organizations vary from being government funded to private and/or are formed by health and social advocates. Organizations provide range of services from support for families and individuals affected by the [[disease]], classes in academic settings ranging from preschools to universities, available resources to updates on the latest advances in medical treatments.

In many societies, even in many [[Western cultures]], stereotyping exists and one way to stop or prevent [[discrimination]] is through education and passing out information about the ways the disease is spread. Big problem in containing the spread of the disease are cultural and religious backgrounds where usage of common [[contraceptives]], such as [[latex condoms]], are prohibited. Unfortunate events such as wars and armed conflicts often employ [[rape]] as a mean of terrorizing local population, in which AIDS, among other [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs), is spread almost exponentially and, very often, it is impossible to trace back to the individual that was the original HIV carrier.  The consequences of such horrific acts are infected mothers who give births to infected babies and the disease is spread vertically. Because of its impact on global population and the high rate of spreading, AIDS has been classified as being [[pandemic]].

There is a growing number of organizations exclusively dedicated to AIDS education and prevention, as well as organized training of medical staff and any individuals that may be interested. Main goals of these organizations are:
* Education about the disease (acquisition and transmission process) 
* Training 
* Support
* Updates on latest research efforts

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26216">'''Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom''',  also known as the '''ABC strategy''' or '''abstinence-plus sex education''', also known as abstinence-based sex education, is a [[sex education]] policy based on a combination of "risk avoidance" and [[harm reduction]] which modifies the approach of [[abstinence-only sex education]] by including education about the value of partner reduction [[safe sex]] and [[birth control]] methods. Abstinence-only sex education is strictly to promote the sexual abstinence until marriage, and does not teach about safe sex or contraceptives. The abstinence-based sex education program is meant to stress abstinence and include information on safe sex practices. In general terms, this strategy of sex education is a compromise between abstinence-only education and comprehensive sex education. The ABC approach was developed in response to the growing epidemic of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]], and to prevent the spread of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. This approach has been credited by some with the falling numbers of those infected with AIDS in Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe, among others. From 1990 to 2001 the percentage of Ugandans living with AIDS fell from 15% to between 5 and 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|year=2005|title=ABC in Uganda: success or subterfuge?|url=|journal=HIV/AIDS Policy&amp;Law Review|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Edward C.|last2=Halperin|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Nantulya|first3=Vinand|last4=Hogle|first4=Janice A.|date=2006-05-11|title=Uganda's HIV Prevention Success: The Role of Sexual Behavior Change and the National Response|journal=AIDS and Behavior|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=335–346|doi=10.1007/s10461-006-9073-y|issn=1090-7165|pmc=1544373|pmid=16688475}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fall is believed to result from the employment of the ABC approach, especially reduction in the number of sex partners, called "Zero-Grazing" in Uganda.

Abstinence-based sex education can include issues of human relationships, the basic biology of human reproduction, safe sex methods and contraceptives, [[HIV/AIDS]] information, and masturbation in place of sex. It recommends [[sexual abstinence]] outside marriage as an ideal, having only a single long-term sexual partner. The use of [[condom]]s and other safe sex practices is advocated only if it is not possible to remain with a single sexual partner. Advocating this ideal, whilst pragmatically dealing with the fact that abstinence only sex education is ineffective by itself, has made the ABC approach popular with many African governments and relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Edward C.|title=Rethinking AIDS Prevention|type=book |publisher=Preager|year=2003 |oclc=612065556|isbn=978-0865693166}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC approach has notably been used in African countries. Versions of this approach have been used for [[abstinence-only sex education in Uganda]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ABC of HIV prevention |publisher=[[AVERT]] |url=http://www.avert.org/abc-hiv.htm|date=2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its positive impact has been confirmed by a 2009 Stanford University survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eran |last1=Bendavid |first2=Jayanta |last2=Bhattacharya |title=The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=19349625 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19349625 |laysummary=http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/news/stanford_study_first_ever_to_show_us_aids_relief_program_saved_a_million_lives_20090406/ |laysource=[[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]] |laydate=April 6, 2009 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-10-200905190-00117 |year=2009 |volume=150 |issue=10 |pages=688–95 |pmc=2892894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Abstinence, be faithful, use a Condom consists of three components:
*'''Abstinence''': The ABC approach encourages young adults to delay "sexual debut" (age of first sexual intercourse), or to use abstinence until marriage, the most effective way to avoid HIV infection, as advocated as the ideal by Christianity.  The program develops skills for practicing abstinence and encourages participants to adopt social norms that support abstinence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  
*'''Be Faithful''': In addition to abstinence, the ABC approach encourages participants to eliminate casual or other concurrent sex partners and to practice fidelity within their marriages and other sexual relationships.  This reduces exposure to HIV..{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* '''Use a Condom''': The Catholic Church has publicly stated its opposition to condom use. However, in 2010, during an interview, Pope Benedict XVI addressed the use of condoms and his view that condoms are the "first step" of morality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengiano|first=Giuseppe|last2=Carrara|first2=Sabina|last3=Filipi|first3=Valentina|last4=Brosens|first4=Ivo|year=2011|title=Condoms, HIV and the Roman Catholic Church|url=|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=22|pages=701–709|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Starting primarily in the 1980s and 1990s, the popularity of the "abstinence plus" sex education program grew into a common method of teaching students, in the [[United States]], about sexuality. The program understood that it would not be possible to stop all teenagers from having sex, but still stressed that abstinence is the only guaranteed way of avoiding unwanted pregnancies and contraction of STDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashbee |first=Edward |title=The Bush Administration, Sex and the Moral Agenda |location=New York |publisher=Manchester UP |year=2007 |pages=102–36 |isbn=978-0-7190-7277-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important message to teens from the program comes from [[Joycelyn Elders]], [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] first [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], that "if they have a baby there is an 80% likelihood they'll be poor, ignorant, and slaves for the rest of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;"Illegitimate rhetoric- Clinton administration's policies towards sex education", ''National Review'' (15 August 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] established a "Girl Power!" campaign focusing on girls ages 9–14 which encouraged abstinence as a form of empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE NATIONAL STRATEGY TO PREVENT OUT-OF-WEDLOCK TEEN PREGNANCIES|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/teenp/strategy.htm|work=aspe.hhs.gov|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who would reject abstinence, or have early sex forced upon them, abstinence-only messages provided little to no hope to prevent pregnancy and spread of disease. To account for this, some states included information about contraceptives in their sex education programs along with encouragement for students to be abstinent. Of the states that, in 1995, required abstinence education, fourteen also included the use of contraception within the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=327–39 |doi=10.1016/S0190-7409(97)00021-2 |title=Sex Education and Abstinence: Programs and Evaluation |year=1997 |last1=Besharov |first1=Douglas J. |last2=Gardiner |first2=Karen N. |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=19 |issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1995, [[Hawaii]] passed the Abstinence-Based Education Policy. (Policy # 2110). It is meant to support abstinence and help develop skills to continue abstinence, help teens who have had sexual intercourse to abstain from further, and to provide teens with information on contraceptives and methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lilinote.k12.hi.us/STATE/BOE/POL1.NSF/85255a0a0010ae82852555340060479d/1bb88fd5ec2ea5940a2566a3000110ef?OpenDocument|title=Abstinence-Based Education Policy|publisher=Hawaii State Government|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the federal government increased funding for state abstinence education as an inclusion of the Welfare Reform Act, creating Title V, and the abstinence-only-until-marriage program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Jillian B.|last2=Packham|first2=Analisa|year=2016|title=The Effects of State-Mandated Abstinence-Based Sex Education on Teen Health Outcomes|url=|journal=Health Economics|volume=26|issue=4|pages=403–420|doi=10.1002/hec.3315|pmid=26918400|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in abstinence funding created incentives for states to maintain these rulings, which over 20 states have.

In 2006 and 2007, $176 million was given annually to abstinence-only programs, whose central message was to delay sexual activity until marriage, preventing the inclusion of information about safe-sex practices or contraception.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|year=2011|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e24658|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|via=|pmid=22022362|pmc=3194801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2009, funding was cut off for abstinence-only education programs, with no further fund allocated in the 2010 FY budget, and the push for evidence-based sex education and teen pregnancy prevention programs. However, on September 29, 2009 funding was restored to abstinence-only programs, as well as leaving the decision of what sex education program would be taught in public schools up to the individual states&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The state of Texas, where the law states that comprehensive sex education is allowed to be taught, but 94% of school districts have been reported to use abstinence-only sex education, developed an abstinence-plus sex education program called ''Big Decisions'', which not only emphasized abstinence to high school students, but integrated education about condom use and contraception, contradicting the majority of the school districts' decisions to maintain an abstinence-only education program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Realini|first=Janet P.|last2=Buzi|first2=Ruth S.|last3=Smith|first3=Peggy B.|last4=Martinez|first4=Mario|year=2010|title=Evaluation of "Big Decisions": An Abstinence-Plus Sexuality Curriculum|url=|journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy|volume=36|issue=4|pages=313–326|via=|doi=10.1080/0092623x.2010.488113|pmid=20574887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==

=== Uganda ===
Uganda has been touted as the success story of the ABC strategy, with a significant reduction of HIV/AIDS infection rates and a push towards sexual behavior change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This shift in sexual behavior began in the mid 1980s, when AIDS was a global disease, resulting in the reduction of multiple sexual partners for an individual, and the increase of condom use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkhurst|first=Justin O.|year=2010|title=Evidence, politics and Uganda's HIV success: Moving forward with ABC and HIV prevention|url=|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=23|issue=2|pages=240–252|doi=10.1002/jid.1667|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  there is debate over whether the ABC strategy was the sole factor that contributed to the decline in HIV/AIDS infection. There has also been debate and discourse over the emphasis of one tenet of ABC sex education over the other. Currently there is the debate over the emphasis of "A" over "C" and vis versa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Uganda's HIV/AIDS and sex education program has a greater focus on the use of condoms in preventing HIV/AIDS, however, religious institutions emphasize abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The success of the ABC strategy in sex education is in part due to the fact that the branches of this strategy are "proximate determinants of HIV infection", also known as ways of reducing or even avoiding the risk of infection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Malawi ===
Like Uganda, there is a push to change the sexual behaviors, however, this message is being emphasized by religious leaders rather than state officials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trinitapoli|first=Jenny|year=2009|title=Religious teachings and influences on the ABCs of HIV prevention in Malawi|url=|journal=Social Science and Medicine|volume=69|issue=2|pages=199–209|via=|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.04.018|pmid=19447536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three tenets of ABC are broken down in Malawi into groups. Abstinence is emphasized for individuals who are young and unmarried, who hear messages about AIDS regularly; Be faithful is emphasized with married couples whose religious leader "polices" their sexual behavior; Condom use is a contested area with religious leaders due to the fact that religious openly denounce condom use, however some leaders have privately consulted individuals on condom use, resulting in many members doing so.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, religious leaders do not comment on the risks and issues of AIDS, which can potentially put an entire congregation at risk.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Religious and Ideological Influences ==
Many communities that have adopted the ABC strategy of sex education have used this strategy of sex education in congruence with religious or ideological influences. In Malawi, religious leaders influence and emphasize the use  this strategy&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, in the United States, ideologies influence the use of ABC strategy. In this case, political ideologies influence the use of various sex education programs. For example, conservatism had previously taught young women that sex was about danger, not pleasure, focusing on an abstinence-only education program, reinforcing the foundational conservative ideas  of fear, and that society is fragile and human nature is inherently bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Citizen's Guide to American Ideology|last=Marietta|first=Morgan|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=14–17|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes to School|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=130|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political ideologies have long been influences in the debate over sex education programs, pushing political agendas.

Globally, the debate of sex education divides liberals and conservatives. In many countries, children do not receive proper sex education, and discourage the act of sex itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Jonathan|year=2014|title=Sex education is a global dividing line between liberals and conservatives|url=|journal=The Washington Post|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==
The usefulness of the ABC approach is highly debated. The three elements are interpreted differently by different actors and critics argue that often abstinence and faithfulness are unduly promoted over condoms and other measures such as education, female empowerment and making available modern antiviral drugs.&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite journal |pages=590–3 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70219-X |title=HIV/AIDS: Sex, abstinence, and behaviour change |year=2005 |last1=Barnett |first1=Tony |last2=Parkhurst |first2=Justin |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=5 |issue=9 |pmid=16122682}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] under President George W Bush has been criticized for seeming to prioritize "A" and "B" over "C" within its funding criteria. "C" activities may only be directed at "high-risk" groups, and not to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Accountability Office, 2006; Cohen J. Tate T. 2005.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, donor funding has always been allocated overwhelmingly to condoms, reflecting clear US and European policy priorities, including under George W Bush.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Criticisms ===
Critics argue that in many countries women are frequently infected by their unfaithful husbands while being faithfully married, and thus women who follow the recommendations of ABC promoters face an increased risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref name=Sinding&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Steven W. |last1=Sinding |title=Does 'CNN' (Condoms, Needles, Negotiation) Work Better than 'ABC' (Abstinence, Being Faithful and Condom Use) in Attacking the AIDS Epidemic? |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |jstor=3649501 |pmid=15888408 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3103805.html |pages=38–40 |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |doi=10.1363/ifpp.31.38.05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Condoms, needles, and negotiation]] is a proposed alternative approach  as is ''SAVE'' (Safer practices, Available medication, Voluntary testing &amp; counseling and Empowerment through education).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anerela.org/prevention-model.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over anerela. Deze website is te koop! |publisher=anerela.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics furthermore allege that the strategy overlooks the epidemic's social, political, and economic causes and "vulnerable populations", e.g. [[sex worker]]s and "those who lack the ability to negotiate safe sex" as well as risk groups such as [[homosexual]]s and [[intravenous drug user]]s. However, most infections in Africa occur outside these vulnerable groups, and ABC  was a US donor policy only for the "generalized" epidemics in Africa. Murphy et al. found that Uganda's ABC approach empowered  women. "Remarkably, in the 2000–2001 Uganda DHS, 91 percent of women said they could refuse sex with their husbands if they knew their husbands had STIs, a somewhat higher percentage than in several other African countries" &lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030379 |title=Was the "ABC" Approach (Abstinence, Being Faithful, Using Condoms) Responsible for Uganda's Decline in HIV? |year=2006 |last1=Murphy |first1=Elaine M. |last2=Greene |first2=Margaret E. |last3=Mihailovic |first3=Alexandra |last4=Olupot-Olupot |first4=Peter |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e379 |pmid=17002505 |pmc=1564179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also argue that using the word "abstinence," then teaching about safe sex and contraceptives, can be contradictory.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jonathan |last1=Cohen |first2=Tony |last2=Tate |title=The Less They Know, the Better: Abstinence-Only HIV/AIDS Programs in Uganda |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |jstor=25475267 |pmid=18446994 |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/uganda0305/index.htm |pages=174–178 |volume=14 |issue=28 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28249-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the argument of the gendered presentation of ABC success stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Shari L.|last2=Ehrhardt|first2=Anke A.|year=2007|title=Going Beyond "ABC" to Include "GEM": Critical Reflections on Progress in the HIV/AIDS Epidemic|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=97|issue=1|pages=13–18|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.074591|pmid=17138923|via=|pmc=1716252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has indicated that the power roles in which men and women fall in the gender dynamic of relationships, as well as sexual double standards, sexual violence, and harmful cultural practices affect a greater number of women when trying to implement HIV/AIDS prevention through individual decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Critiques of geographic location are also relevant in the success of ABC success. Migration patterns within a population affect both men and women where men who migrate are more likely to contract the infection and bring it back and infect their female partner, whose greatest risk of contracting HIV is from their husbands extramarital sexual encounters, but women are also seen contracting the disease outside of their primary relationship, focusing the ABC strategy on morality and "static individualized behavior".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parikh|first=Shanti A.|year=2007|title=The Political Economy of Marriage and HIV: The ABC Approach, "Safe" Infidelity, and Managing Moral Risk in Uganda|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=97|issue=7|pages=1198–1208|via=|doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.088682|pmid=17538057|pmc=1913085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate in the U.S. ===
How sex education should be taught in public schools in the United States has been a topic for debate since the sexual revolution.  A majority of the debate is focused on whether or not there should be a comprehensive sex education program or an abstinence-only program.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Abstinence-only sex education programs have been proven to be ineffective and there is little evidence showing that abstinence-only, or abstinence-only-until-marriage programs lower [[risky sexual behavior]] in teens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kelly L.|last2=Lee Smith|first2=Matthew|last3=Rosen|first3=Brittany L.|last4=Wiley|first4=David C.|year=2012|title=Adoption and implementation characteristics for abstinence-plus curriculum|url=|journal=American Journal of Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence to support a parental push for earlier sex education for students, starting in elementary school rather than middle school. Along with the push for earlier sex education, there is the call for age-appropriate sex education. This means that for elementary school students, the sex education they receive will be tailored to their age. A study conducted in 2013 found that parents who pushed for earlier sex education settled on the sex education elementary school students receive will be 89% communication skills, 65% human anatomy/reproductive information, 61% abstinence, 53% HIV/STD infection information, and 52% gender/sexual orientation issues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Elissa M.|last2=Moore|first2=Michelle J.|last3=Johnson|first3=Tammie|last4=Forrest|first4=Jamie|last5=Jordan|first5=Melissa|year=2014|title=New Evidence: Data Documenting Parental Support for Earlier Sexuality Education Authors|url=|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=84|issue=1|pages=10–17|doi=10.1111/josh.12112|via=|pmid=24320147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents in this study also supported a greater emphasis on sex education in middle schools and an increase in the teaching of the same topics from elementary school as well as a greater emphasis on birth control and condom use&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Pope]] [[Benedict XVI]] has criticized some harm reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that "if the soul is lacking, if Africans do not help one another, the scourge [of HIV] cannot be resolved by distributing condoms; quite the contrary, we risk worsening the problem".{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Whilst this position has been widely denounced for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yankee |last1=Doodling |title=The papal position on condoms and HIV |journal=BMJ |pmid=19321547 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19321547 |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1217 |year=2009 |volume=338 |pages=b1217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1206 |title=Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem |year=2009 |last1=Roehr |first1=B. |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b1206 |pmid=19321545}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been expert scientific opinion and evidence supporting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Pope May Be Right |first=Edward C. |last=Green |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032702825.html |work=The Washington Post |date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Archbishop Gabriel Charles Palmer-Buckle of Accra has stated that "the Catholic Church [offers] three methods to help solve this problem of AIDS in Africa: "A", abstain; "B", be faithful; "C", chastity, which is in consonance with traditional African values. Those [[Planned Parenthood]] people are only talking about condoms. By the way, they know full well that the condoms devoted to Africa are sub-standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/ghanaian-archbishop-says-church-has-failed-africa |title=Ghanaian archbishop says church has failed Africa |date=October 14, 2009 |first=John L. |last=Allen |work=National Catholic Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|no reliable sources]] that condoms distributed in Africa are inferior to those elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12294480 |year=1999 |title=South Africa plays down faulty condom scare |pages=10–1 |journal=AIDS Weekly Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major proponent of the ABC approach, author and member of Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and Aids in 2003-2007, Harvard University's Edward C Green, stated “Advocates of the ABCs often use the term to mean a primary emphasis on abstinence/delay of sexual debut and faithfulness/partner reduction, with condom use being a secondary but necessary strategy for those who do not or cannot practice abstinence or fidelity." Furthermore, Green in his seminal book Rethinking AIDS Prevention (Praeger 2003) argued  that the success in Uganda, where prevalence feel 21% to 6% between 1989-2003 was largely due to the "B" of the ABC approach, fidelity or reduction in multiple partners. This conclusion was validated and expanded to underscore the dangers of concurrent sexual partners by Helen Epstein, in The Invisible Cure &lt;ref&gt;{The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West, and the Fight Against AIDS. Farrar, Straus and Giroux 2007 |&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''administration of justice''' is the process by which the [[legal system]] of a government is executed. The presumed goal of such administration is to provide [[justice]] for all those accessing the legal system. The phrase is also used commonly to describe a University degree (as in: a BA in Administration of Justice), which can be a prerequisite for a job in law enforcement or government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807231503/http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |archivedate=2016-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In ''Attorney General for New South Wales v Love'', the appellant argued that section 24 of the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 did not have the effect applying the [[Nullum Tempus Act]] (9 Geo 3 c 16) (1768) to [[New South Wales]]. Counsel for the appellant said that ''Whicker v Hume''&lt;ref&gt;Whicker v Hume (1858) 7 HL 124&lt;/ref&gt; decided that section 24 referred not to laws generally, but only to laws as to modes of procedure, and that the Nullum Tempus Act did not deal merely with procedure. The Lord Chancellor said that the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 ''prima facie'' "applied the Nullum Tempus Act to the Colony in question as much as if it had re-enacted it for that Colony." He then said:

{{Blockquote|Sect. 24 of that Act provides "that all the laws and statutes in force within the realm of England at the passing of this Act" (that is to say, the year 1828) "shall be applied in the administration of justice in the courts of New South Wales," and it is sought by construction to limit the words "all laws and statutes" by introducing into the section the words "having relation to procedure" or some equivalent expression. At least that is the only intelligible mode in which the argument can be supported, because the words which do occur in the section - "in the administration of justice" - would certainly include a limitation of the time within which actions can be brought, and their Lordships are of the opinion that the language of the section cannot be limited so as to exclude the statute, which for the reasons pointed out by the learned judges were and are so important in the administration of justice in the Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General for New South Wales v Love [1898] AC 679 at 685, [[Privy Council|PC]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Canada==
[[Section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867]], also known as the administration of justice power, grants the provincial legislatures of Canada the authority to legislate on:
:14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.

===Ontario===
Section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1990 c A6) provides:

{{Blockquote|In this Act, "administration of justice" means the provision, maintenance and operation of,
:(a) the courts of justice of the Province of Ontario,
:(b) land registry offices,
:(c) jails, and
:(d) the offices of coroners and Crown Attorneys,
for the performance of their functions, including any functions delegated to such courts, institutions or offices or any official thereof by or under any Act; (“administration de la justice”)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90a06 Digitised copy]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This provision was previously section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1980 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1982) 37 Ontario Reports 246 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xj9SAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1970 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1995) Ontario Reports 387 and 389 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kEJSAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act 1968 (SO 1968 c 1) (17 Eliz 2 c 1).&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Law Reform Commission. Report on Section 16 of the Mortgages Act. 1970. p 143 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BPlKAQAAIAAJ]. (1979) Ontario Reports 285 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TEFSAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; Queen's printer copies of the Statutes of the Province of Ontario 1968 describe this provision as "new".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/statutesofprovin1968onta Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This statute replaced the Administration of Justice Expenses Act (RSO 1960 c 5).

==Republic of Ireland==
"Offence against the administration of justice" is defined by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/sec0007.html section 7] of the [[Criminal Procedure Act 2010]].

==United Kingdom==
In England, the administration of justice is a [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|prerogative]] of the [[Crown of the United Kingdom|Crown]]. It may be exercised only through duly-appointed [[Judiciary of England and Wales|judges]] and [[Courts of England and Wales|courts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. ''[[A First Book of English Law]]''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following matters and things pertain to the administration of justice: the organisation of the courts; the prerogative of justice, the [[prerogative of mercy]], and any prerogative power to create new courts; [[nolle prosequi]]; the appointment, tenure and immunity of judges; the immunity of other participants in legal proceedings; [[contempt of court]]; the composition and availability of juries, any requirement that their verdict be unanimous, and the allowances they receive; the branches of the legal profession; and the provision of [[legal aid]] and advice.&lt;ref&gt;O. Hood Phillips. ''A First Book of English Law''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Chapter 2. (These matters and things are discussed by the author  in a chapter titled "The Administration of Justice").&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of justice is an act which is normally associated with the carrying on of the business of government. When a government does that act, it is thereby exercising its sovereignty. It would accordingly be a violation of British sovereignty for a foreign government to do that act in British territory without authorisation.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Sir Arnold Duncan. Legal Effects of War. Second Edition. Cambridge University Press. 1944. Page 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]] authorises foreign service courts to exercise their jurisdiction in the United Kingdom.

There are [[offences against the administration of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Card, Richard. [[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]. Twelfth Edition. Butterworths. 1992. {{ISBN|0 406 00086 7}}. Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone's Statutes on Criminal Law: 2004-2005. Fourteenth Edition. Part XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], the following are administration of justice offences:
*The offence of [[perverting the course of justice]]
*The offence under section 51(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]
*An offence of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, suborning or inciting another person to commit an offence under section 1 of the [[Perjury Act 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/25/section/54 section 54(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence of perverting the course of justice has been referred to as "interfering with the administration of justice" and as "obstructing the administration of justice".&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences relating to the Administration of Justice. Working Paper No 62. HMSO. 1975. Paragraph 10 at page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 6(c) of the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] provides that nothing in the foregoing provisions of that Act restricts liability for contempt of court in respect of conduct intended to impede or prejudice the administration of justice.

An [[arrestable offence]], other than one specified in Schedule 5 to the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], was [[serious arrestable offence|serious]] for the purposes of that Act if it led to, or was intended or likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice. An arrestable offence which consisted of making a threat was serious for the purposes of that Act if carrying out the threat would be likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/116/enacted sections 116(1) to (4) and (6)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal proceedings held in public, the court may, where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings, or in any other proceedings pending or imminent, order that the publication of any report of the proceedings, or any part of the proceedings, be postponed for such period as the court thinks necessary for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]], section 4(2). Where in proceedings for any offence which is an administration of justice offence for the purposes of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]] it appears to the court that there is a possibility that (by virtue of that section) proceedings may be taken against a person for an offence of which he has been acquitted, section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 applies as if those proceedings were pending or imminent: The Contempt of Court Act 1981, section 4(2A).&lt;/ref&gt;

Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] is exempt information if its disclosure under that Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/31 section 31(1)(c)]&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a derivative of the [[amino acid]] [[cysteine]]. When fresh garlic is chopped or crushed, the enzyme [[alliinase]] converts alliin into [[allicin]], which is responsible for the aroma of fresh garlic. 

Garlic has been used since antiquity as a therapeutic remedy for certain conditions now associated with [[oxygen toxicity]], and, when this was investigated, garlic did indeed show strong [[antioxidant]] and [[hydroxyl]] [[free radical|radical]]-scavenging properties, it is presumed owing to the alliin contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Chemical synthesis ==
The first reported synthesis, by Stoll and Seebeck in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chemical investigations on alliin, the specific principle of garlic|last = Stoll , Seeback|first = Arthur, Ewald|date = 1951|journal = Advanced Enzymology |volume=11 |pages=377–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; begins the alkylation of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-cysteine with [[allyl bromide]] to form deoxyalliin. Oxidation of this sulfide with [[hydrogen peroxide]] gives both [[diastereomer]]s of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alliin, differing in the orientation of the oxygen atom on the [[sulfur]] [[stereocenter]].
[[File:H2O2toAlliin.png|centre|frameless|420 px]]
A newer route, reported by Koch and Keusgen in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diastereoselective synthesis of alliin by an asymmetric sulfur oxidation|last = Koch, Keusgen|date = 1998|journal = Pharmazie |volume=53 |issue=668-671}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows stereospecific oxidation using conditions similar to the [[Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation]]. The chiral catalyst is produced from [[diethyl tartrate]] and [[titanium isopropoxide]].

'''Alpine lakes''' are classified as [[lake]]s or [[reservoir]]s at high altitudes, usually starting around 5,000 feet (1524 metres) in elevation above sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Henry B.|last2=Marsh|first2=C.

Alpine lakes are usually clearer than lakes at lower elevations due to the colder water which decreases the speed and amount of [[algae]] and [[moss]] growth in the water.  Often these lakes are surrounded by varieties of [[pine tree]]s, [[aspen]]s, and other high altitude trees.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Annealing''' of [[glass]] is a process of slowly cooling hot glass objects after they have been formed, to relieve residual internal stresses introduced during manufacture. Especially for smaller, simpler objects, annealing may be incidental to the process of manufacture, but in larger or more complex products it commonly demands a special process of annealing in a temperature-controlled [[kiln]] known as a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr]].&lt;ref &gt;E. F. Collins (1921) Electrically heated glass annealing lehr. Journal of the American Ceramic Society 4 (5), pp. 335–349&lt;/ref&gt; Annealing of glass is critical to its durability. Glass that has not been properly annealed retains thermal stresses caused by [[quenching]], which indefinitely decrease the strength and reliability of the product. Inadequately annealed glass is likely to crack or shatter when subjected to relatively small temperature changes or to mechanical shock or stress. It even may fail spontaneously. 

To anneal glass, it is necessary to heat it to its '''annealing [[temperature]]''', at which its [[viscosity]], η, drops to 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;{{citationneeded|date=July 2018}} [[Poise (unit)|Poise]] ("Poise" is a measure of absolute viscosity; 1 poise = 1 dyne-second/cm²). For most kinds of glass, this annealing temperature is in the range of 454–482 °C (850–900 °F){{citationneeded|date=July 2018}}, and is the so-called [[stress (physics)|stress]]-relief point or '''annealing point''' of the glass. At such a viscosity, the glass is still too hard for significant external [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] without breaking, but it is soft enough to relax internal [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]]s by microscopic flow in response to the intense stresses they introduce internally. The piece then heat-soaks until its temperature is even throughout and the stress relaxation is adequate. The time necessary for this step varies depending on the type of glass and its maximum thickness. The glass then is permitted to cool at a predetermined rate until its temperature passes the '''strain point''' (η = 10&lt;sup&gt;14.5&lt;/sup&gt; Poise){{citationneeded|date=July 2018}}, below which even microscopic internal flow effectively stops and annealing stops with it. It then is safe to cool the product to [[room temperature]] at a rate limited by the [[heat capacity]], thickness, [[thermal conductivity]], and [[thermal expansion coefficient]] of the glass. After annealing is complete the material can be cut to size, drilled, or polished without risk of its internal stresses shattering it. 

At the ''annealing point'' (η = 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Poise), stresses relax within several minutes, while at the ''strain point'' (η = 10&lt;sup&gt;14.5&lt;/sup&gt; Poise) stresses relax within several hours.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Vogel: "Glass Chemistry"; Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co. K; 2nd revised edition (November 1994), {{ISBN|3-540-57572-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stresses acquired at temperatures above the strain point, and not relaxed by annealing, remain in the glass  indefinitely and may cause either short-term or much delayed failure. Stresses resulting from cooling too rapidly below the strain point largely are considered temporary, although they may be adequate to promote short-term failure.

[[File:Bimetallic stripe.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a bimetallic strip showing how the difference in thermal expansion in the two metals leads to a much larger sideways displacement of the strip]]
[[File:Bimetal coil reacts to lighter.gif|frame|right|A bimetallic coil from a thermometer reacts to the heat from a lighter, by uncoiling and then coiling back up when the lighter is removed.]]
A '''bimetallic strip''' is used to convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement. The strip consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated, usually [[steel]] and [[copper]], or in some cases steel and [[brass]]. The strips are joined together throughout their length by [[rivet]]ing, [[brazing]] or [[welding]]. The different expansions force the flat strip to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its initial temperature. The metal with the higher [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled.

The sideways displacement of the strip is much larger than the small lengthways expansion in either of the two metals. This effect is used in a range of mechanical and electrical devices. In some applications the bimetal strip is used in the flat form. In others, it is wrapped into a coil for compactness. The greater length of the coiled version gives improved sensitivity.

== History ==
[[File:John Harrison memorial 02.jpg|thumb|200px|John Harrison's Memorial in Westminster Abbey, London]]

The earliest surviving bimetallic strip was made by the eighteenth-century [[clockmaker]] [[John Harrison]] who is generally credited with its invention. He made it for his third [[marine chronometer]] (H3) of 1759  to compensate for temperature-induced changes in the [[balance spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sobel |first= Dava | authorlink= Dava Sobel |title= [[Longitude (book)|Longitude]] |year= 1995 |publisher= Fourth Estate |location= London |isbn= 0-00-721446-4 | pages= 103 | quote= One of the inventions Harrison introduced in H-3... is called... a bi-metallic strip.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the bimetallic mechanism for correcting for thermal expansion in his [[gridiron pendulum]]. His earliest examples had two individual metal strips joined by rivets but he also invented the later technique of directly fusing molten brass onto a steel substrate. A strip of this type was fitted to his last timekeeper, H5. Harrison's invention is recognized in the memorial to him in [[Westminster Abbey]], England.

==Applications==

===Clocks===
Mechanical [[clock]] mechanisms are sensitive to temperature changes as each part has tiny tolerance and it leads to errors in time keeping. A bimetallic strip is used to compensate this phenomenon in the mechanism of some timepieces. The most common method is to use a bimetallic construction for the circular rim of the [[balance wheel]]. What it does is move a weight in a radial way looking at the circular plane down by the balance wheel, varying then, the momentum of inertia of the balance wheel. As the spring controlling the balance becomes weaker with the increasing temperature, the balance becomes smaller in diameter to decrease the momentum of inertia and keep the period of oscillation (and hence timekeeping) constant.

Nowadays this system is not used anymore since the appearance of low temperature coefficient alloys like [[nivarox]], parachrom and many others depending on each brand.

===Thermostats===
[[File:WPThermostat new.jpg|thumb|Thermostat with bimetal coil at (2)]]

{{see also|Tipping point (physics)#Set-point thermostats|label 1=Tipping points and 'popping disc' bimetal thermostats}}
In the regulation of heating and cooling, [[thermostat]]s that operate over a wide range of temperatures are used. In these, one end of the bimetallic strip is mechanically fixed and attached to an electrical power source, while the other (moving) end carries an electrical contact. In adjustable thermostats another contact is positioned with a regulating knob or lever. The position so set controls the regulated temperature, called the ''set point''.

Some thermostats use a [[mercury switch]] connected to both electrical leads. The angle of the entire mechanism is adjustable to control the set point of the thermostat.

Depending upon the application, a higher temperature may open a contact (as in a [[heater]] control) or it may close a contact (as in a [[refrigerator]] or [[air conditioner]]).

The electrical contacts may control the power directly (as in a household iron) or indirectly, switching electrical power through a [[relay]] or the supply of [[natural gas]] or [[fuel oil]] through an electrically operated valve. In some natural gas heaters the power may be provided with a [[thermocouple]] that is heated by a pilot light (a small, continuously burning, flame). In devices without pilot lights for ignition (as in most modern gas clothes dryers and some natural gas heaters and decorative fireplaces) the power for the contacts is provided by reduced household electrical power that operates a relay controlling an electronic ignitor, either a resistance heater or an electrically powered [[spark gap|spark]] generating device.

===Thermometers===
A direct indicating dial [[thermometer]] really common in daily use devices (such as a patio thermometer or a meat thermometer) uses a bimetallic strip wrapped into a coil in its most used design. The coil changes the lineal movement of the metal expansion into a circular movement thanks to the helicoidal shape it draws. One end of the coil is fixed to the housing of the device as a fix point and the other drives an indicating needle inside a circular indicator. A bimetallic strip is also used in a [[recording thermometer]]. [[Breguet's thermometer]] consists of a tri-metallic helix in order to have a more accurate results.

===Heat engine===
Heat engines are not the most efficient ones, and with the use of bimetallic strips the efficiency of the heat engines is even lower as there is no chamber to contain the heat. Moreover, the bimetallic strips cannot produce strength in its moves, the reason why is that in order to achieve reasonables bendings (movements) both metallic strips have to be thin to make the difference between the expansion noticeable.  So the uses for metallic strips in heat engines are mostly in simple toys that have been built to demonstrate how the principle can be used to drive a [[heat engine]].&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

===Electrical devices===
Bimetal strips are used in miniature [[circuit breaker]]s to protect circuits from excess current. A coil of wire is used to heat a bimetal strip, which bends and operates a linkage that unlatches a spring-operated contact. This interrupts the circuit and can be reset when the bimetal strip has cooled down.

Bimetal strips are also used in time-delay relays, lamp flashers, and [[Fluorescent lamp#Starting|fluorescent lamp starters]]. In some devices the current running directly through the bimetal strip is sufficient to heat it and operate contacts directly.

==Calculations==
[[Curvature]] of a bimetallic beam:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{6 E_1 E_2 (h_1 + h_2)h_1 h_2 \epsilon }{E_1^2 h_1^4 + 4 E_1 E_2 h_1^3 h_2 + 6 E_1 E_2 h_1^2 h_2^2 + 4 E_1 E_2 h_2^3 h_1 + E_2^2 h_2^4}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Young's modulus]] and height (thickness) of material one and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt; are the Young's modulus and height (thickness) of material two. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the misfit strain, calculated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = (\alpha_1-\alpha_2) \Delta T \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of thermal expansion of material one and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of thermal expansion of material two. ΔT is the current temperature minus the reference temperature (the temperature where the beam has no flexure).&lt;ref&gt;Clyne, TW. “Residual stresses in surface coatings and their effects on interfacial debonding.” Key Engineering Materials (Switzerland).

Kurien|others=R.

In a [[dot blot]], macromolecules are applied directly to the matrix. Macromolecules can also be separated and transferred via [[gel electrophoresis]].&lt;ref name="Kurien"/&gt;

One of the most common blotting matrices for protein analysis is [[nitrocellulose]], which has a high affinity for proteins due to hydrophobic interactions. However, proteins with low molecular weight have a small affinity for nitrocellulose, limiting potential applications. This defect may be remedied by [[glutaraldehyde]], which can covalently bond proteins to nitrocellulose. Another matrix is [[cellulose]] paper modified with diazophenylthiother, which can also facilitate covalent bonding of proteins. Nylon membranes are also used for protein blotting, although they may result in the binding of anionic dyes such as [[Coomassie blue]] and [[Amido black]]. [[Polyvinylidene fluoride]] membranes are also commonly used, due to their hydrophobicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Carl R. |last1=Merril |first2=Karen M. |last2=Washart|title=Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins|url=http://www.aun.edu.eg/molecular_biology/Protein%20workshop/Hames_Gel%20Electrophoresis%20of%20Proteins-A%20Practical%20Approach%203rd%20ed.pdf|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3038">The '''Bridge Stress Committee''' was appointed in 1923 by the UK [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] under Sir Alfred Ewing, to investigate stresses in railway bridges, especially as regards the effects of moving loads. Its report, published in 1928, was very influential in British locomotive design as it enabled larger multi-cylinder locomotive classes.

==Background==
The increased weight of express trains in the United Kingdom during the first quarter of the twentieth century required larger, six-coupled locomotives, but new designs were being limited by the weight restrictions imposed on many underline bridges. On most mainlines this was restricted to no more than {{convert|20|LT|t ST|1|abbr=on}} on any axle. However, engineers were becoming increasingly aware of the significance of ‘[[hammer blow]]’ rather than [[Deadweight tonnage|’deadweight’]] in determining the safe loads for such bridges.

==Committee==
A committee of was established in 1923, funded jointly by the UK government and the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|railway companies]], to carry out investigations in to the effects of hammer blow on bridges. The committee under chairmanship of the physicist Sir [[James Alfred Ewing]] consisted primarily of railway civil engineers, but [[Henry Fowler (engineer)|Sir Henry Fowler]], [[chief mechanical engineer|Chief Mechanical Engineer]] of the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] was also later invited to join.
Among the results was a better understanding of hammer blow and the effects of [[oscillation]]s in both locomotive springs and bridges. One immediate impact of the investigations was an easing of the axle-load limit for locomotives with both inside and outside cylinders from {{convert|20|LT|t ST|1|abbr=on}}  to {{convert|22|LT|t ST|1|abbr=on}}. This enabled successful new designs such as the [[GWR 6000 Class]] and the fitting of larger {{convert|220|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on}} boilers to [[LNER Gresley Classes A1 and A3|Gresley A1 class]].&lt;ref&gt;Nock (1983) 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16606">'''Cultural group selection''' is an explanatory model within [[cultural evolution]] of how cultural traits evolve according to the competitive advantage they bestow upon a group. This multidisciplinary approach to the question of human culture engages research from the fields of [[anthropology]], [[behavioural economics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[evolutionary game theory]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]].

While cultural norms are often beneficial to the individuals who hold them, they need not be.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. "The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race." Discover Magazine. May. 64-66. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Norms can spread by cultural group selection when they are practiced within successful groups, and norms are more likely to spread from groups that are successful. But, for cultural group selection to occur, there must exist, between groups, cultural differences that when transmitted across time affect the persistence or proliferation of the groups.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, D.T. Variation and selective retention in sociocultural evolution. Social change in developing areas: A reinterpretation of evolutionary theory. Cambridge: Schenkman. 1965. 19-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural norms that provide these advantages will, in turn, lead to the displacement, absorption or even extinction of other, less successful cultural groups.&lt;ref name="sol" &gt;Soltis, J., Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1995. Can group-functional behaviours evolve by cultural group selection? An empirical test. Current Anthropology 36 (3), 473–494.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[game theory|game theoretic]] models suggest that if individuals are able to migrate between groups (which is common in small-scale societies), differences between groups should be difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name="joe" &gt;Henrich, J. Cultural group selection, coevolutionary processes and large-scale cooperation. Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization. Volume 53, Issue 1, January 2004, 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in psychology reveals that humans have a particular set of traits, which include [[imitation]], [[conformity]], and [[in-group bias]], that are capable of supporting the maintenance of these group differences over extended periods of time.

Cultural group selection gives a compelling explanation for how large-scale complex societies have formed. While altruistic behaviour such as [[kin selection]] and [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] can explain the behaviour of small social groups common in many species, it is unable to explain the large complex societies of unrelated, anonymous individuals that we see in the human species.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; However, one of the major distinctions between humans and other species is our reliance on [[Observational learning|social learning]] in acquiring behaviours.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;Horner, V. Whiten, A. Causal knowledge and imitation/emulation switching in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and children (Homo sapiens). Animal Cognition (2005) 8: 164–181&lt;/ref&gt; These instincts allow for the acquisition and persistence of culture.&lt;ref name="tomasello"&gt;Tomasello, M. The Human Adaptation for Culture. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28, (1999), pp. 509-529&lt;/ref&gt; Through cultural group selection, culturally specific cooperative behaviour can evolve to support large societies.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; For example, in a study that spanned a variety of cultures, testing behaviour in [[Ultimatum game|Ultimatum]], [[Dictator game|Dictator]], and [[Third-party punishment]] games, it was found that standards of fairness and inclination to punish were correlated with both participation in world religions and market integration.&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., et al. Markets, Religion, Community Size, and the Evolution of Fairness and Punishment. Science 327, 1480 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates how many of the behaviours necessary for complex societies are the result of cultural exposure rather than any evolution of our psychology.

== Human adaptations for culture ==
For cultural knowledge and behaviour to persist across multiple generations, humans need to have the capacity to acquire, retain, and transmit cultural information. While many species engage in social learning, humans consistently rely upon it for behavioural cues and information about the environment. In a study comparing human children and young chimpanzees, it was shown that, when given a demonstration on how to retrieve a reward from a box, chimps copy relevant behaviour, while ignoring irrelevant behaviour, to solve the task. Meanwhile, human children will faithfully imitate both relevant and irrelevant behaviour to solve the same task.&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; While this may seem like a negative quality, it is what allows for reliable, high-fidelity transmission of cultural information, and produces stable behavioural equilibria within cultural groups.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

[[Michael Tomasello]] suggests the following three adaptations are necessary for human culture:&lt;ref name="tomasello" /&gt;

=== Joint attention ===
At around 9–12 months infants begin engaging in [[joint attention]]. This involves following the gaze of an adult or using them as social reference points. Put simply, they become aware of the adult's attention and behaviour towards objects in the environment. In this sense, the child is beginning to understand people as goal-oriented intentional agents. This is vitally important for learning through imitation and, eventually, language acquisition.

=== Imitative learning ===
By about 1 year of age, children begin to learn by imitation. At this point, children are capable of discriminating intentional actions from unintentional ones, and will attempt to accurately copy those intentional actions to accomplish tasks they've seen adults do. Because of [[imitative learning]], children will copy those intentional acts which have no perceivable effect on the outcome,&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; as well as strange or unnatural actions when easier methods are available. For example, an [[Andrew Meltzoff]] study found that 14-month-old children will, after seeing an adult do it, bend at the waist and press a panel with their head to turn on a light, instead of using their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzoff A. 1988. Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli. Dev. Psychol. 24:470-76&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tomasello, imitative learning is necessary for learning the symbolic conventions of language.

=== Linguistic symbols and cognitive representation ===
Through imitatively learning, the child comprehends that linguistic symbols are intended to focus attention to some specific aspect of the shared experience. In doing this, the child must be able to take the perspective of the speaker. Due to the intersubjectivity of linguistic symbols, language allows one to communicate various perspectives and shift attention to one aspect of the world over another. In learning a language, a child is inheriting a vast set of linguistic symbols that have been passed down many generations. What is inherited then is the methods of shifting attention and perspective that were historically of importance to the people of that culture.

== Mechanisms that maintain between-group variation ==
Without between-group variation, cultural group selection could not occur, as there would be no group differentiation to select for. While processes such as cultural drift, epidemics, and natural disasters increase between-group variation, migration and genetic mixing decrease between-group variation ''and'' increase within-group variation. Variation is only maintained when cultural groups have mechanisms that prevent the norms of outside groups from invading the cultural group. These ‘mechanisms’ are those uniquely human psychological traits and behaviours that encourage imitation, conformity, and in-group biases.

According to [[Joseph Henrich]], between-group variation is maintained by the following four mechanisms:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Conformist transmission ===
Conformist transmission refers to the psychological bias to preferentially imitate high frequency behaviors in the cultural group. This homogenizes the social group and reinforces widely held cultural norms. This explains why individuals within a social group hold the same beliefs and why these beliefs persist over time. While individuals will rely on copying high frequency behaviors under various conditions, this reliance increases when an individual is exposed to ambiguous environmental or social information.&lt;ref name="Boyd85"&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1985. Culture and the Evolutionary Process. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, G., Fudenberg, D., 1993. Rules of thumb for social learning. Journal of Political Economy 101 (4),
612–643.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R., Vandello, J., Brunsman, B., 1996. The forgotten variable in conformity research: impact of task
importance on social influence. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (5), 915–927.&lt;/ref&gt; Conformist transmission can maintain between-group variation by reducing within-group variation, but it also facilitates the rapid spread of novel ideas, which increases between-group variation.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt; Taken together, reduced within-group variation and increased between-group variation lead to the cultural divergence between groups that is the driving force of cultural group selection.

=== Prestige-biased and self-similarity transmission ===
Prestige-biased transmission is the tendency the copy those members of the group that are more successful. Preferentially copying successful members of the group allows individuals to avoid costly trial-and-error learning by imitating the better-than-average skills of the more prestigious cultural models. Individual can determine the rank of potential models by how much deference they are shown by the rest of the group. Deference is shown to high-prestige individuals to gain the opportunity to copy their successful models. We can see evidence for this bias in how new technologies, or economic practices spread to different groups according to how quick "opinion leaders" adopt them.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M., 1995. Diffusion of Innovations. Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[self-similarity]] transmission is the tendency to copy those individuals who are similar in language, appearance, social standing and other behavioral and cultural traits. In the context of prestige-biased transmission, self-similarity means that individuals will preferentially imitate those high-prestige individuals who are similar to them. From the perspective of an imitator, this trait is adaptive. By only imitating those high-prestige individuals who are similar, the imitator avoids adopting traits or behaviors that are not compatible with his or her knowledge or social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1987. The evolution of ethnic markers. Cultural Anthropology 2 (1), 27–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two social biases act together in reducing within-group variation. Additionally, prestige-biased transmission increases between-group variation by contributing to the spread of novel ideas.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt;

=== Punishment of non-conformists ===
Non-conformists threaten to increase within-group variation by introducing deviant behaviours to the group and must receive costly punishment to maintain a homogenous social group. As a consequence of being punished, non-conformists will be less successful than other members of the group. Prestige-biased transmission would suggest that non-conformist behaviors would, therefore, not spread through the population. Papers on the topic suggest that this kind of punishment is prevalent across many different societies.&lt;ref&gt;Sober, E., Wilson, D.S., 1998. Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior. Harvard
University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, A.E., Prasnikar, V., Okuno-Fujiwara, M., Zamir, S., 1991. Bargaining and market behavior in Jerusalem, Ljubljana, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study. American Economic Review 81 (5), 1068–1095.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., Boyd, R., Bowles, S., Gintis, H., Camerer, C., Fehr, E., McElreath, R., 2001. In search of Homo economicus: experiments in 15 small-scale societies. American Economic Review 91, 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., Gächter, S., 2002. Altruistic punishment in humans. Nature 415, 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative conformity ===
Normative conformity is the act of changing one’s visible behaviour, simply to appear to match the majority, and without actually internalizing the groups opinions. This differs from conformist transmission since normative conformity does not consider frequency of a behaviour as an indicator of worth. The [[Asch conformity experiments]] are a perfect example of how robust this effect is&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S.E., 1951. Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments. In: Guetzkow, H. (Ed.), Groups, Leadership and Men. Carnegie, Pittsburgh, pp. 177–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and its replication across many cultures shows that this behaviour is very common.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A., 1984. Studies of cross-cultural conformity: a brief and critical review. Psychologia: An International
Journal of Psychology in the Orient 27 (1), 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neto, F., 1995. Conformity and independence revisited. Social Behavior and Personality 23 (3), 217–222.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrich suggests that normative conformity may have evolved to respond to the spread of punishing behaviour toward non-conformists.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; By appearing similar to the group, one can gain the advantages of in-group membership, while also avoiding punishment. A curious byproduct of normative conformity is that it can contribute to the conformity transmission of norms that the transmitter does not hold, because they were mistakenly attributed by the imitator.

== Mechanisms ==
As [[Donald T. Campbell]] says, for cultural group selection to occur, there must be cultural differences between groups which affect their persistence or proliferation.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; This means groups are selected ''for'' or ''against'' according to their respective ''gains'' or ''losses'' relative to other groups.

Joseph Henrich describes the three mechanisms through which this process occurs:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Demographic swamping ===
Demographic swamping occurs when one or more cultural groups reproduces individuals faster than other groups in the region because of stable, culturally transmitted ideas or practices.  This is the slowest kind of cultural groups selection as it depends on natural selection of between-group cultural variation operating on a scale of millennia. It has been suggested that this is how early agriculturalist displaced hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., Menozzi, P., Piazza, A., 1994. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton
University Press, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young and Bettinger, 1992Young, D., Bettinger, R.L., 1992. The numic spread: a computer simulation. American Antiquity 57 (1), 85–99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, J.M., 1997. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct intergroup competition ===
Direct intergroup competition is the process by which cultural groups compete with each other over resources by engaging in warfare and raiding. The cultural practices and behaviour that gives an advantage to one group over another will proliferate at the expense of those who cannot compete. There are many possible traits that could contribute to a group's success, such as technological development, social and political organization, economic development, nationalism, etc. According to Joseph Soltis, it would take 500–1000 years for group selection to happen this way.&lt;ref name="sol" /&gt;

=== Prestige-biased group selection ===
In prestige-biased group selection, when individuals have opportunities to copy people from nearby groups, they will preferentially imitate the members of groups that are more cooperative than their own. Since cooperative groups have a higher average payoff than non-cooperative groups, members of cooperative groups will be considered more prestigious and worthy of imitation.

The '''Dmanisi skull''', also known as '''Skull 5''' or '''D4500''', is one of five ''[[Homo erectus]]'' skulls discovered in [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

The skull has been the cause of a paleontological controversy that is still ongoing as of 2017: many hominin fossils thought to be from different species such as ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' or ''[[Homo habilis]]'' may not have been separate species at all. Rather, they may have been a single evolving [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]].&lt;ref name=nature /&gt;

== Discovery of the skull ==
[[File:Dmanissi, Georgia ; Homo georgicus 1999 discovery map.png|thumb|[[Dmanisi]] geographical localization in the middle of the [[Caucasus]]]]
In 1991, Georgian scientist [[David Lordkipanidze]] found traces of early human occupation in the cave at [[Dmanisi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]: a hamlet and an [[archaeological site]] about {{convert|90|km|mi}} southwest of the country's capital, [[Tbilisi]]. Since then, five early hominin skulls have been discovered at the site. '''Skull 5''', found in 2005, is the most complete specimen of them all. After further analysis, it was coupled with its [[mandible]] (D2600) found 5 years earlier. The final analysis of the discovery took many years and was only published in 2013.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

== Description of the skull ==
[[File:Amb. Bass-with D.Lordkipanidze at Dmanisi.JPG|thumb|[[David Lordkipanidze]] (centre) on the archeological site at [[Dmanisi]], 2010]]
Despite a brain volume the size of a large [[Australopithecus]] male, ({{convert|546|cm3|in3}}) all the characteristics of [[Homo erectus]] are clearly visible on '''Skull 5'''. The [[Neurocranium|braincase]] sizes of the other Dmanisi skulls are between {{convert|601|cm3|in3}} and {{convert|730|cm3|in3}}.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

The cranial superstructures of '''Skull 5''', which are prominent and massive, suggest that it was probably a male. Its face is one of the largest of any human ancestor discovered to date.&lt;ref name=article/&gt; The [[zygomatic arch]]es are massive with the right one displaying many traces of deformations, probably due to fractures and injuries. Researchers estimate that the height of the individual was between {{convert|146|cm|ft}} and {{convert|166|cm|ft}} and his weight between {{convert|47|kg|lb}} and {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=article /&gt;

== Dating ==
[[File:Dmanisi_stone_tool_1.jpg|thumb|Stone tools found on the [[Dmanisi]] [[paleontological]] site]]
Until the 1980s, scientists assumed that [[hominins]] had been restricted to the African continent for the whole of the [[Early Pleistocene]] (until about 0.8 [[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), only migrating out during a phase named [[Out of Africa I]]. Thus, the vast majority of archaeological effort was disproportionately focused on Africa.&lt;ref name = "Lahr 2010"&gt;Lahr, M.M., 2010. “Saharan Corridors and Their Role in the Evolutionary Geography of ‘Out of Africa I’”. In: A. Baden et al. (Eds.), Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia. Springer Netherlands, 27–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The  Dmanisi archeological site is the earliest hominin site out of Africa and the analysis of its [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] showed that some hominins, chiefly the ''[[Homo erectus#Homo erectus georgicus|Homo erectus georgicus]]'' had left [[Africa]] as far back as 1.85 million years ago. All of the 5 skulls are roughly the same age.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

Consequently, the paleontological significance of the [[Radiocarbon dating|dating]] of the Dmanisi skulls is major. It is worth noting that it was not associated with the discovery of skull 5, but with another specimen found at the same site, the [[D2700|Dmanisi Skull 3]], also known as D2700.

== Controversy and significance of the discovery==

The Dmanisi skulls, especially '''Skull 5''' with its comparatively tiny {{convert|546|cm3|in3}} brain compared to other skulls found at the site, suggests that the earliest species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' were actually subspecies of the species ''erectus''.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; The variation in [[Morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] of all the Dmanisi skulls is so large that had they been discovered on different archaeological sites, they most likely would have been classified as different species. However, all Dmanisi skulls have the same age and have been found at exactly the same place.

Faced with the wide variation between '''Skull 5''' and the other Dmanisi skulls, Georgian and University of Zurich researchers were prompted to examine normal variations in modern human skulls and chimpanzees skulls. They found that while they looked different from one another, the great variations among all Dmanisi skulls were no greater than those seen among modern people and among chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; Consequently, it was entirely possible that such a discrepancy could be found in ''Homo erectus''.

This discovery led the scientists to suggest that two species of early hominins, ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' and  ''[[Homo habilis]]'', were actually both ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref name=nature /&gt; This is an ongoing debate among the scientific community.&lt;ref name=National_Geographic&gt;{{cite news |last=Switek |first=Brian |date=17 October 2013 |title= Beautiful Skull Spurs Debate on Human History |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131017-skull-human-origins-dmanisi-georgia-erectus/ |newspaper= National Geographic |accessdate=22 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Douglas–Coldwell Foundation''' is a left-wing [[Canada|Canadian]] [[think tank]] devoted, in the words of its slogan, to "promoting education and research into [[social democracy]]." It was founded in 1971, and is based in [[Ottawa]].

The Foundation was named for and inspired by [[Tommy Douglas]], the first federal leader of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] from 1961 to 1971, and [[Major James Coldwell|M. J. Coldwell]], leader of its predecessor [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] from 1942 to 1960. Both had desired a Canadian counterpart to the [[Fabian Society]].

In 1987, it merged with the Ontario Woodsworth Memorial Foundation of [[Toronto]], named for Coldwell's predecessor as CCF leader, [[J. S. Woodsworth]].

The foundation has underwritten biographies of Douglas, Coldwell, [[Clarence Gillis]], [[Stanley Knowles]], and [[Grace MacInnis]], and scholarships and lectureships at Canadian post-secondary institutions. The foundation also gives out yearly grants totalling up to $25,000 for projects supporting its mandate of "promoting education and research in social democracy."

The foundation is a registered [[Charitable organization|charitable]] foundation, contributions to which are [[tax deduction|tax-deductible]] in Canada; it accepts memberships and solicits donations from individuals and organizations in the general public. While predominantly associated with NDP members and activists, and concerned in part with the history and future of the party, it is an independent group with no administrative connection to any political party.

Tommy Douglas was the foundation's first president. [[Kalmen Kaplansky]] led the think tank in the 1980s and 1990s. [[Karl Bélanger]] became president of the foundation in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.dcf.ca/2016nov24president The Douglas-Coldwell Foundation elects Karl Bélanger as President] ''Douglas-Coldwell Foundation'', November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''energy flow''', also called the '''calorific flow''', refers to the flow of [[energy]] through a [[food chain]], and is the focus of study in '''ecological energetics'''. In an [[ecosystem]], [[ecologist]]s seek to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the relative importance of different component [[species]] and feeding relationships.

A general energy flow scenario follows:
*[[Solar energy]] is fixed by the [[photoautotroph]]s, called primary producers, like green [[plant]]s. [[Primary consumers]] absorb most of the stored energy in the plant through [[digestion]], and transform it into the form of energy they need, such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), through [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. A part of the energy received by primary consumers, [[herbivore]]s, is converted to [[thermoregulation|body heat]] (an effect of respiration), which is [[radiant energy|radiated]] away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in [[warm-blooded]] animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of [[digestion|undigested]] food (egesta) by [[excrement|excretion]] or [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].
*Secondary consumers, [[carnivore]]s, then consume the primary consumers, although [[omnivore]]s also consume primary producers. Energy that had been used by the primary consumers for growth and storage is thus absorbed into the secondary consumers through the process of digestion. As with primary consumers, secondary consumers convert this energy into a more suitable form (ATP) during respiration. Again, some energy is lost from the system, since energy which the primary consumers had used for respiration and regulation of body temperature cannot be utilized by the secondary consumers.
*Tertiary consumers, which may or may not be [[apex predator]]s, then consume the secondary consumers, with some energy passed on and some lost, as with the lower levels of the food chain.
*A final link in the food chain are [[decomposer]]s which break down the [[organic matter]] of the tertiary consumers (or whichever consumer is at the top of the chain) and release [[nutrient]]s into the [[soil]]. They also break down plants, herbivores and carnivores that were not eaten by organisms higher on the food chain, as well as the undigested food that is excreted by herbivores and carnivores. [[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are decomposers, and play a pivotal role in the [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[carbon cycle]]s.

The energy is passed on from [[trophic level]] to trophic level and each time about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the environment (an effect of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta). Therefore, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a [[food chain]] receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels. This loss of energy at each level limits typical food chains to only four to six links.

== History of ecological energetics ==
Ecological energetics appears to have grown out of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concerns of the [[Physiocrats]]. It began in the works of [[Sergei Podolinsky]] in the late 1800s, and subsequently was developed by the Soviet ecologist [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]], the Austro-American [[Alfred J. Lotka]], and American limnologists, [[Raymond Lindeman]] and [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]. It underwent substantial development by [[Howard T. Odum]] and was applied by [[systems ecology|systems ecologists]], and [[radiation ecology|radiation ecologists]].

'''The Engineers Museum''' (officially ''The pioneer museum'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kymi.fi/en/attractions-and-shopping/service/198&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Finnish language|Finnish:]] valtakunnallinen, i.e., all-national, Pioneerimuseo, in [[Russian language|Russian:]] Музей саперных войск) is the oldest corps museum in Finland. It was opened 13 May 1945 in the garrison of [[Koria (Kouvola)|Koria]], which was the part of [[Elimäki|Elimäki municipality]], now [[Kouvola]] town. The Engineers Museum has the status of the scientific military museum and it is supervised by the [[Military Museum of Finland]] (in [[Finnish language|Finnish:]] Sotamuseo). The Engineers Museum was re-opened in [[Miehikkälä]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salpakeskus.fi/index.php?l=3&amp;path=214,0,0|title=Salpakeskus|work=salpakeskus.fi|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Engineers Museum will stay in [[Miehikkälä]] still in 2012. In 2013 it will be opened in [[Hämeenlinna]] near [[The Artillery Museum of Finland]]. Two other attractions related to the Engineer corps of Finland will stay at their present places: [[Salpa Line]] museum and the Bunker museum.

==History==

===Lieutenant's idea===
The history of the Engineer Museum starts in 1929, when a second lieutenant Eero-Eetu Saarinen made a proposal to the commander of the engineer battalion, concerning an engineer corps museum. The engineer troops started to collect materials for the museum. Most of the collectibles achieved by Saarinen got lost during the [[Winter War]].

===Opening after the wars===
On 12 May 1945 lieutenant colonel Eero-Eetu Saarinen delivered an opening speech of the museum. The museum worked in the barracks until 1965, when the municipality of [[Elimäki]] donated a log house the museum, so that the museum could become enlarged.

===Organised Engineers Corps Union===
Already in the beginning of the 1970s it became obvious that a new building would be needed. In the Koria garrison area, which was the main base of the Engineers corps, the new build main building was built opened by the lieutenant colonel Eero-Eetu Saarinen 25 July 1974 in [[Kivimäki]]{{dn|date=January 2017}}&lt;!--Nothing helpful on the Finnish DAB page. Google Translate of the corresponding passage in the Finnish article didn't help either--&gt; of [[Koria]]. The next year, in 1975, the Pioneeriaselajin Liitto ry, was established to govern the Engineers Museum.

===Englargening===
The other outer building was built and opened in 1976. The construction site manager and inspector was military technician Arvo Tolmunen.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Aimo Hattula, the Hakku (Pickaxe) magazine, number 3, 2007, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The corps museum was granted an officials status as an official war historical museum by the minister of defence, Veikko Pihlajamäki, 24 March 1987.

===Diaspora and fire===
As the Kymi Engineer Battalion was moved from Koria to Vekaranjärvi garrison of the [[Karelia Brigade]], the activities of the museum halted in Koria. The exhibits were packed and were delivered to separate locations. Most of the exhibits ended up to [[Kouvola]] and were burned also a kind of vandalism destroyed the materials.

===New start===
[[Kouvola]] municipality had planned to support the museum, but the idea did not survive, so that the registered Union of the Engineers Corps.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Until the beginning of the 2000s a new plan was made in cooperation with [[Miehikkälä]] municipality. In 2003 a project for opening the museum was started with the financial help of the European union structural funds. The general headquarters did not take the museum to the category of the further developed museums on 4 March 2004, but it was added to the list 18 May 2005.

==Exhibitions==
The museum will be open in June, July and August, from 10 o'clock to 18 o'clock.  The museum has a relatively small number of visitors due to the distant location.  In the same region there are two other museums related to the military engineering: Salpa-museo (The Salpa defence line museum) and Bunkkerimuseo (The bunker museum).

===Main building===

In the main exhibition there are about 500 exhibits. Specialities in the main building are models of the Kiviniemi, Vuoksi ja Syvärinniska field bridges. On the other half of the main building there is the '''Pitäjämuseo''', a local rural museum presenting the past agrarian life from the point of view of the household woodware.rf

====Kiviniemi bridge====

There has been at least six bridges over the [[Vuoksi]] river in [[Sakkola]].  The first known bridge was a wooden bridge in the 1800s, which was replaced by a stone bridge in 1827.  The Vuoksi river was enlargened and the flow eroded the soil structures of the stone bridge, so that it had to be break down.  Nordestam senate in 1870 authorised rebuilding, which was started in 1878, but the works ended during the first phases of the construction works.

According to the next plan the new bridge was to be built, in the new place, onto the narrowest part of the Kiviniemi falls area, 300 metres further from the place, where the bridge had been two times.  The new length of the bridge would be 74.8 metres. The construction works started in winter 1876 and the bridge was opened for the traffic in 1878. The budget of the construction works reached 139,000 [[Finnish mark]]s.

During the [[Winter War]] the Finns explored the bridge.  The Soviets built another bridge from steel after the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] of 1940 in the inter-war period. Before the advancing Finnish troops reached the bridge, the Soviet troops explored the bridge in the beginning of the [[Continuation War]] in 1941.  The Finns built a railway bridge from steel, which was destroyed in 1944.  Now there is a Soviet made bridge made of steel crossing Vuoksi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.lut.fi/eki/vuoksivirtaa/virtuaalimatka_vuoksella/jokihaasteena/kiviniemen_silta.html|title=Virtuaali Vuoksi - Virtuaalimatka vuoksella - Joki ihmisten haasteena - Kiviniemen silta|work=lut.fi|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StuG III Ausf G, Dezember 1942.jpg|thumb|265px|right|An anti-tank armoured assault vehicle Sturmgeschütz III Ausf. G]]

===Front- and backyard===

There is a [[Sturmgeschütz III|Sturmgeschütz III Ausf. G]] on the frontyard of the museum, On the backyard there are several aluminic assault boats, [[KrAZ]] lorry with and without a pontoon bridge equipment.  The heaviest vehicle is a [[T-72]] main battle tank with a [[Mine plow|mine plough]].

==Collections==
There are about 3 700 collectibles in the museum.

==Salpa Centre==
The Salpa Centre (Salpakeskus), which was established 7 July 2005, is a voluntary consortium of four participating communities: The Engineers Museum (governed by the Union of the Engineer Corps), The [[Salpa Line Museum|Salpa (Defence) Line Museum]] and the Salpa Line Tradition Association, the registered society, (Salpalinjan perinneyhdistys ry), both in [[Miehikkälä]], the [[Bunker Museum]] in [[Virolahti]].

The parties have been cooperation in developing the Bunker Museum, Engineers Museum and Salpa Line Museum with the support of the European union structural funds for less than a decade.

On the [[Salpa Line|Salpa defence line]] there will be organised annually a hiking tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salpakeskus.fi/index.php?l=1&amp;path=1,164,0|title=Salpakeskus|work=salpakeskus.fi|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th Salpa trekking was to take place in 2012 from 29 June to 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fi-fi.facebook.com/pages/Salpavaellus/105964786101271|title=Turvallisuustarkistus vaaditaan|work=facebook.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salpa defence line is in some parts relatively good condition as it was never needed due to the truce of 5 September 1944 and [[Moscow Armistice]], 19 September 1944, which ended the co-belligerence of Finland with the [[Greater German Realm]] and made the [[Lapland War]] inevitable.

Although originally experimented upon by the [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] science community in the [[Philippines]] in the early 1990s as adjuncts to [[environmental impact assessment]]s (EIAs), studies of indigenous knowledge systems and documentation of agricultural [[best practice]], it traces its roots in the [[cinéma vérité]] movement of the 1950s and 1960s, the difference being its emphasis on small format or digital format video and its adoption of extra-sociological subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, A.G. 1983. Participatory Film-Making: A Structural Analysis of Cinema Direct. ''DevCom Quarterly''. UPLB Institute of Development Communication&lt;/ref&gt; Being a methodology, ethnovideography is theory-based and adopts a set of procedures or protocols.

==History==
The earliest mention of ethnovideography in current literature comes from an [[Asian Development Bank]] project document written by a team of environmental consultants headed by Sylvia Guerrero, former Dean of the [[University of the Philippines]] College of Social Work and Community Development. Guerrero et al. (1992) defined ethnovideography as:

''...a research procedure developed at the UPLB Institute of Development Communication, which makes use of small-format video-generated non-alphanumeric data for social analysis. This procedure entails video documentation of five types of subjects: people, places, processes, events and social problems...''&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, S.H. 1992. ''Inception Report for Improving the Implementation of Environmental impact Assessment''. Asian Development Bank&lt;/ref&gt; 

Credited for coining the term ethnovideography as well as its development as a methodology, Alexander Flor considers it more than a research procedure but a [[knowledge management]] system and a form of development intervention as well. Flor was a professor of [[development communication]] at the [[University of the Philippines Los Banos]] who underwent a [[Fulbright]]-PAEF post-doctoral tour in the US in 1989. The tour included a summer at the [[USC Center for Visual Anthropology]], wherein exposure to the use of video in urban anthropology contributed to his early constructs on ethnovideography. Other influences include Professor Alain Martenot who mentored Flor on [[Direct Cinema]] technique under a French Foreign Ministry grant. His early work on ethnovideography was sponsored by the Users' Perspectives with Agricultural and Rural Development (UPWARD) facility of the Lima-based [[International Potato Center]]. Succeeding research were conducted mostly by [[development communication]] graduate students, e.g. Bandara,&lt;ref&gt;Bandara, R. 1994. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography as a Training Tool in Sri Lanka''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; Hardono,&lt;ref&gt;Hardono.1993. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography in Documenting Indigenous Knowledge on Sustainable Agriculture in Indonesia''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; and Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Iis Nana Maya. 1993. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography in Research Agenda Setting''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, ethnovideographic studies have been uploaded to [[YouTube]].

In 2002, the book [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL5866684W/Ethnovideography Ethnovideography: Video Based Indigenous Knowledge Systems] was co-published by [http://www.searca.org SEAMEO-SEARCA] and [[International Potato Center|CIP]]-UPWARD.

{{italic title}}
'''''Etymologicum Magnum''''' ({{lang-el|Ἐτυμολογικὸν Μέγα}}, ''Ἐtymologikὸn Mέga'') (standard abbreviation '''''EM''''', or '''''Etym. M.''''' in older literature) is the traditional title of a Greek lexical [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] by an unknown [[lexicographer]] around 1150 AD. It is the largest Byzantine lexicon and draws on many earlier grammatical, lexical and rhetorical works. Its main sources were two previous ''etymologica'', the so-called ''[[Etymologicum Genuinum]]'' and the ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]''. Other sources include [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the ''Epitome'' of [[Diogenianus]], the so-called ''Lexicon'' Αἱμωδεῖν (''Haimōdeῖn''), Eulogius’ Ἀπορίαι καὶ λύσεις (''Ἀporίai kaὶ lύseis''), [[Georgius Choeroboscus|George Choeroboscus]]’ ''Epimerismi ad Psalmos'', the ''Etymologicon'' of [[Orion of Thebes]], and collections of [[Scholion|''scholia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897), 248–253, 351–352; Sturz (1820)&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was not a mere copyist; rather he amalgamated, reorganised, augmented and freely modified his source material to create a new and individual work.

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was published by [[Zacharias Calliergi|Zacharias Kallierges]] and [[Nikolaos Vlastos]] under the patronage of [[Anna Notaras]] at [[Venice]] in 1499. The typeface was designed and cut by Kallierges, modeled on his own handwriting. The decorative initial letters and headpieces are patterned on the decorations of the Byzantine manuscript tradition, and the woodcut borders incorporate elaborate arabesque designs, usually colored white on red, but also white on gold. The decorations of the Kallierges edition had a great influence in printing, especially on Greek liturgical books.&lt;ref&gt;Ecro Layton, ''Five Centuries of Books and Manuscripts in Modern Greek: A Catalogue of an Exhibition at the Houghton Library December 4, 1987, through February 17, 1988'' (Cambridge: Harvard College Library, 1990), pp. 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figure of Insensitiveness''' (or ''F of I'') is an inverse scale of measure of the impact sensitivity of an explosive substance.  In this particular context the term 'Insensitiveness' refers to the likelihood of initiation/[[detonation]] by accidental means e.g. impact, friction, electrostatic discharge, application of flame, etc. It is a quantitative measure of the level of stimulus required to cause initiation, typically by shock/impact. 

The Figure of Insensitiveness is determined from impact testing, typically using a drop-weight tower. In this test, a small sample of the explosive is placed on a small steel anvil which  is slotted into a recess in the base of the drop tower. A cylindrical, 1 kilogram steel weight (mounted inside a tube to accurately guide its descent to the impact point in the centre of the anvil) is then dropped onto the test specimen from a measured height. The specimen is monitored both during and after this process to determine whether initiation occurs. This test is repeated many times, varying the drop height according to a prescribed method. Various heights are used, starting with a small distance (e.g. 10&amp;nbsp;cm) and then progressively increasing it to as high as 3 metres. The series of drop heights and whether initiation occurred are analysed statistically to determine the drop height which has a 50% likelihood of initiating the explosives. The intention of these tests is to develop safety policies/rules which will govern the design, manufacturing, handling and storage of the explosive and any munitions containing it.

A reference standard sample of [[RDX]] is currently used to calibrate the drop tower, so that the drop height to produce 50% likelihood of initiation in this material is measured and recorded. The drop height required to initiate other explosives can then be related to the RDX standard, so that a ready comparison of impact sensitiveness between different explosives can be made.  By convention, explosives having a 50% initiation drop height equal to that of RDX are given a F of I of 80.

The scale was originally defined using [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] as the reference standard, with TNT having, by definition, an F of I of exactly 100. On this original scale, RDX yielded an F&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;I of around 80.  Following [[World War II]], when more complex explosive compositions replaced pure TNT as the most common energetic component of weapon systems, RDX was adopted as the reference standard.

Sensitiveness should not be confused with ''Sensitivity'' which is a measure of how easy it is to detonate an explosive, i.e. how sensitive it is to the mode of initiation to achieve a detonation.  In this context an explosive which has greater sensitivity, (like specificity) requires a more specific stimulus in order to detonate it.

'''Protein electrophoresis''' is a method for analysing the proteins in a fluid or an extract. The electrophoresis may be performed with a small volume of sample in a number of alternative ways with or without a supporting medium: [[gel electrophoresis|SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]] (in short: gel electrophoresis, PAGE, or SDS-electrophoresis), [[free-flow electrophoresis]], [[electrofocusing]], [[isotachophoresis]], [[affinity electrophoresis]], [[immunoelectrophoresis]], [[counterelectrophoresis]], and [[capillary electrophoresis]]. Each method has many variations with individual advantages and limitations. [[Gel electrophoresis]] is often performed in combination with [[electroblotting]] [[immunoblotting]] to give additional information about a specific protein. Because of practical limitations, protein electrophoresis is generally not suited as a preparative method.{{Clarify|post-text=: What does this sentence mean? What is a "preparative method"? |date=June 2018}}

==Denaturing gel methods==

===SDS-PAGE===
{{main|SDS-PAGE}}

SDS-PAGE, [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, describes a collection of related techniques to separate [[protein]]s according to their [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic mobility]] (a function of the length of a polypeptide chain and its charge) while in the [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (unfolded) state. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis.

SDS is a strong detergent agent used to denature native proteins to unfolded, individual [[polypeptide]]s. When a protein mixture is heated to 100&amp;nbsp;°C in presence of SDS, the [[detergent]] wraps around the polypeptide backbone. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides becomes negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit length. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins will be a linear function of the [[logarithm]]s of their molecular weights.

==Native gel methods==

Native gels, also known as non-denaturing gels, analyze proteins that are still in their folded state.  Thus, the electrophoretic mobility depends not only on the charge-to-mass ratio, but also on the physical shape and size of the protein.

===Blue native PAGE===

BN-PAGE is a native [[PAGE]] technique, where the [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]] dye provides the necessary [[charge (physics)|charge]]s to the protein complexes for the electrophoretic separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Schägger | first1=H. | last2=Jagow | first2= G. | year=1991 | title= Blue native electrophoresis for isolation of membrane protein complexes in enzymatically active form | journal= Anal.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantage of Coomassie is that in binding to proteins it can act like a [[detergent]] causing complexes to [[dissociate]]. Another drawback is the potential [[quenching]] of [[chemoluminescence]] (e.g. in subsequent [[western blot]] detection or activity assays) or [[fluorescence]] of proteins with [[prosthetic group]]s (e.g. [[heme]] or [[chlorophyll]]) or labelled with fluorescent dyes.

===Clear native PAGE===

CN-PAGE (commonly referred to as Native PAGE) separates acidic water-soluble and membrane [[proteins]] in a [[polyacrylamide]] gradient gel. It uses no charged dye so the electrophoretic mobility of proteins in CN-PAGE (in contrast to the charge shift technique BN-PAGE) is related to the intrinsic charge of the proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittig | first1 = I. | last2 = Schägger | first2 = H. |date=Nov 2005 | title = Advantages and limitations of clear-native PAGE | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112101783/abstract | journal = Proteomics | volume = 5 | issue = 17| pages = 4338–46 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200500081 | pmid = 16220535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The migration distance depends on the protein charge, its size and the pore size of the gel. In many cases this method has lower resolution than BN-PAGE, but CN-PAGE offers advantages whenever [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie]] dye would interfere with further analytical techniques, for example it has been described as a very efficient microscale separation technique for [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gavin P.D. |author2=Devenish R.J. |author3=Prescott M. | year = 2003 | title = FRET reveals changes in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–stator stalk interaction during activity of F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-ATP synthase | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T1S-49VC5Y4-1&amp;_user=8074278&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000073488&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=8074278&amp;md5=cc26305868f4f6ad080e06a304e9a6e1 | journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1607 | issue = 2–3| pages = 167–79 | doi=10.1016/j.bbabio.2003.09.013|pmid=14670607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also CN-PAGE is milder than BN-PAGE so it can retain labile supramolecular assemblies of [[membrane protein]] complexes that are [[dissociate]]d under the conditions of BN-PAGE.

===Quantitative native PAGE===

{{main|QPNC-PAGE}}

The [[protein folding|folded]] [[protein complex]]es of interest separate cleanly and predictably due to the specific properties of the polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins are continuously eluted into a physiological eluent and transported to a fraction collector. In four to five PAGE fractions each the metal cofactors can be identified and absolutely quantified by high-resolution [[ICP-MS]]. The respective structures of the isolated [[metalloproteins]] can be determined by solution [[NMR]] spectroscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kastenholz | first1 = B. | year = 2004 | title = Preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PNC‐PAGE): an efficient method for isolating cadmium cofactors in biological systems | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/AL-120029742#.VerDcj_osy8 | journal = Protein Pept Lett | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 657–65 | doi = 10.1081/AL-120029742 | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buffer systems==
[[Image:Laemmli System.png|thumb|right| Postulated migration of proteins in a Laemmli gel system A: Stacking gel, B: Resolving gel, o: sample application c: discontinuities in the buffer and electrophoretic matrix]]
Most protein separations are performed using a "discontinuous" (or DISC) [[Buffer solution|buffer]] system that significantly enhances the sharpness of the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus into a single sharp band. The formation of the ion gradient is achieved by choosing a pH value at which the ions of the buffer are only moderately charged compared to the SDS-coated proteins. These conditions provide an environment in which [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Kohlrausch's]] reactions determine the [[molar conductivity]]. As a result, SDS-coated proteins are concentrated to several fold in a thin zone of the order of 19&amp;nbsp;μm within a few minutes. At this stage all proteins migrate at the same migration speed by [[isotachophoresis]]. This occurs in a region of the gel that has larger pores so that the gel matrix does not retard the migration during the focusing or "stacking" event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Ornstein L|title= Disc Electrophoresis. I. Background and Theory |journal= Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume= 121|pages=321–349|date=December 1964 |pmid=14240533 |doi= 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1964.tb14207.x|issue= 2 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.140.7598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Davis BJ |title= Disc Electrophoresis. 2, Method and application to human serum proteins|journal= Ann.

The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins. At the same time, the separating part of the gel also has a pH value in which the buffer ions on average carry a greater charge, causing them to "outrun" the SDS-covered proteins and eliminate the ion gradient and thereby the stacking effect.

A very widespread discontinuous buffer system is the tris-glycine or "[[Ulrich K. Laemmli|Laemmli]]" system that stacks at a [[pH]] of 6.8 and resolves at a [[pH]] of ~8.3-9.0. A drawback of this system is that these pH values may promote [[disulfide]] bond formation between [[cysteine]] residues in the proteins because the [[pKa]] of cysteine ranges from 8-9 and because reducing agent present in the loading buffer doesn't co-migrate with the proteins. Recent advances in buffering technology alleviate this problem by resolving the proteins at a pH well below the pKa of cysteine (e.g., [[bis-tris]], pH 6.5) and include reducing agents (e.g. sodium bisulfite) that move into the gel ahead of the proteins to maintain a reducing environment. An additional benefit of using buffers with lower pH values is that the acrylamide gel is more stable at lower pH values, so the gels can be stored for long periods of time before use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schägger H, von Jagow G |title= Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa |journal= Anal.

===SDS gradient gel electrophoresis of proteins===
As voltage is applied, the anions (and negatively charged sample molecules) migrate toward the positive electrode (anode) in the lower chamber, the leading ion is [[Chlorine|Cl]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ( high mobility and high concentration); glycinate is the trailing ion (low mobility and low concentration).  SDS-protein particles do not migrate freely at the border between the Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; of the gel buffer and the [[Glycine|Gly]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; of the cathode buffer. [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch]] found that [[Ohm's law]] also applies to dissolved [[electrolyte]]s. Because of the voltage drop between the Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and Glycine-buffers,  proteins are compressed (stacked) into micrometer thin layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Kohlrausch F|title= Ueber Concentrations-Verschiebungen durch Electrolyse im Inneren von Lösungen und Lösungsgemischen |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume= 62 |pages= 209–239 |year= 1897 |doi= 10.1002/andp.18972981002|issue= 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The boundary  moves through a pore gradient and the protein stack gradually disperses due to a frictional resistance increase of the gel matrix. Stacking and unstacking occurs continuously in the gradient gel, for every protein at a different position. For a complete protein unstacking the polyacrylamide-gel concentration must exceed 16% T. The two-gel system of "Laemmli" is a simple gradient gel. The pH discontinuity of the buffers is of no significance for the separation quality, and a "stacking-gel" with a different pH is not needed.

==Visualization==

The most popular protein stain is [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]]. It is an anionic dye, which non-specifically binds to proteins. Proteins in the gel are fixed by acetic acid and simultaneously stained. The excess dye incorporated into the gel can be removed by destaining with the same solution without the dye. The proteins are detected as blue bands on a clear background.

When more sensitive method than staining by Coomassie is needed silver staining is usually used. Silver staining is a sensitive procedure to detect trace amounts of proteins in gels, but can also visualize nucleic acid or polysaccharides.

Similarly as in nucleic acid gel electrophoresis, '''tracking dye''' is often used. Anionic dyes of a known electrophoretic mobility are usually included in the sample buffer. A very common tracking dye is [[Bromophenol blue]]. This dye is coloured at alkali and neutral pH and is a small negatively charged molecule that moves towards the anode. Being a highly mobile molecule it moves ahead of most proteins.

{{Main|Serum protein electrophoresis|Blood proteins}}

In [[medicine]], '''protein electrophoresis''' is a method of analysing the [[protein]]s mainly in [[blood serum]].  Before the widespread use of [[gel electrophoresis]], protein electrophoresis was performed as free-flow electrophoresis (on paper) or as immunoelectrophoresis.

Traditionally, two classes of [[blood proteins]] are considered: [[serum albumin]] and [[globulin]]. They are generally equal in proportion, but [[albumin]] as a molecule is much smaller and lightly, negatively-charged, leading to an accumulation of albumin on the electrophoretic gel. A small band before albumin represents [[transthyretin]] (also named prealbumin). Some forms of medication or body chemicals can cause their own band, but it usually is small. Abnormal bands (spikes) are seen in [[monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance]] and [[multiple myeloma]], and are useful in the diagnosis of these conditions.

The globulins are classified by their banding pattern (with their main representatives):
* The ''[[alpha globulin|alpha]]'' (α) band consists of two parts, 1 and 2:
** '''α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' - [[alpha 1-antitrypsin|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antitrypsin]], α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acid glycoprotein.
** '''α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' - [[haptoglobin]], [[alpha 2-macroglobulin|α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-macroglobulin]], [[Alpha 2-antiplasmin|α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-antiplasmin]], [[ceruloplasmin]].
* The ''[[beta globulin|beta]]'' (β) band - [[transferrin]], [[LDL]], [[complement system|complement]]
* The ''[[Gamma globulin|gamma]]'' (γ) band - [[immunoglobulin]] (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM). [[Paraprotein]]s (in multiple myeloma) usually appear in this band.

Normal present medical procedure involves determination of numerous proteins in plasma including hormones and enzymes, some of them also determined by electrophoresis. However, gel electrophoresis is mainly a research tool, also when the subject is blood proteins.

==Coloring ions==
[[File:Iron2GlassStonePile.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Iron(II) oxide glass]]
Ordinary [[soda-lime glass]] appears [[color]]less to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a [[green]] tint which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further [[metal]]s and metal [[oxide]]s can be added to glass during its manufacture to change its color which can enhance its aesthetic appeal. Examples of these additives are listed below:

[[File:Amber Glass Flask.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Amber Glass]]
[[File:U glass with black light.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Uranium glass]] glowing under [[UV light]]]]
[[File:bristol.blue.glass.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cobalt glass]] for decoration]]
[[File:Beer_bottles_2018_G1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beer]] [[bottle|bottles]] of different colors]]

* [[Iron(II) oxide]] may be added to glass resulting in bluish-green glass which is frequently used in beer bottles. Together with [[chromium]] it gives a richer green color, used for [[wine bottle]]s.
* [[Sulfur]], together with [[carbon]] and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. In [[borosilicate glass]]es rich in boron, sulfur imparts a blue color. With [[calcium]] it yields a deep yellow color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1st-glass.1st-things.com/articles/glasscolouring.html Substances Used in the Making of Coloured Glass] 1st-glass.1st-things.com (David M Issitt). Retrieved 9 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manganese]] can be added in small amounts to remove the [[green]] tint given by iron, or in higher concentrations to give glass an [[Amethyst (color)|amethyst]] color. Manganese is one of the oldest glass additives, and purple manganese glass was used since early Egyptian history.
* [[Manganese dioxide]], which is [[black]], is used to remove the green color from the glass; in a very slow process this is converted to [[sodium permanganate]], a dark [[purple]] compound. In [[New England]] some houses built more than 300 years ago have window glass which is lightly tinted [[Violet (color)|violet]] because of this chemical change; and such glass panes are prized as antiques. This process is widely confused with the formation of "desert amethyst glass", in which glass exposed to desert sunshine with a high ultraviolet component develops a delicate violet tint. Details of the process and the composition of the glass vary and so do the results, because it is not a simple matter to obtain or produce properly controlled specimens.&lt;ref name="Nassau2001"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kurt|last=Nassau|title=The physics and chemistry of color: the fifteen causes of color|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oasPAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-39106-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Small concentrations of [[cobalt]] (0.025 to 0.1%) yield [[blue]] glass. The best results are achieved when using glass containing [[potash]]. Very small amounts can be used for decolorizing.
* 2 to 3% of [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]] produces a [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]] color.
* [[Nickel]], depending on the concentration, produces blue, or [[violet (colour)|violet]], or even [[black]] glass. [[Lead crystal]] with added nickel acquires purplish color. Nickel together with a small amount of cobalt was used for decolorizing of [[lead glass]].
* [[Chromium]] is a very powerful colorizing agent, yielding dark green&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speclab.com/elements/chromium.htm Chemical Fact Sheet - Chromium] www.speclab.com. Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or in higher concentrations even black color. Together with tin oxide and arsenic it yields [[emerald (color)|emerald green]] glass. Chromium [[aventurine]], in which [[aventurescence]] was achieved by growth of large parallel [[chromium(III) oxide]] plates during cooling, was also made from glass with added chromium oxide in amount above its solubility limit in glass.
* [[Cadmium]] together with sulphur forms [[cadmium sulfide]] and results in deep yellow color, often used in glazes. However, cadmium is toxic. Together with selenium and sulphur it yields shades of bright red and orange.&lt;ref name="glassblow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glassblowing for Laboratory Technicians|url=http://wiredfreak.com/.Chemistry%20eBooks%20Collection/Laboratory/Glassblowing/Glassblowing%20for%20laboratory%20technicians%20-%20Barbour/Glassblowing%20for%20laboratory%20technicians%20-%20Barbour.pdf|publisher=wiredfreak.com|accessdate=9 April 2014|author=R.

* Adding [[titanium]] produces [[yellow]]ish-[[brown]] glass. Titanium, rarely used on its own, is more often employed to intensify and brighten other colorizing additives.
* [[Uranium]] (0.1 to 2%) can be added to give glass a fluorescent yellow or [[green]] color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glassassociation.org.uk/sites/default/files/WEBSITE%20Uranium%20Glass%20website%20%282%29.pdf Uranium Glass] www.glassassociation.org.uk (Barrie Skelcher). Retrieved 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uranium glass]] is typically not [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] enough to be dangerous, but if ground into a powder, such as by polishing with sandpaper, and inhaled, it can be [[carcinogenic]]. When used with lead glass with very high proportion of lead, produces a deep red color.
* [[Didymium]] gives green color (used in UV filters) or lilac red.&lt;ref name="glassblow"/&gt;

==Striking glasses==
[[File:Vintage cranberry glass.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cranberry glass]] bowl]]
[[File:PhotochromicLens.jpg|thumb|[[Photochromic lens|Photochromic eyeglass lens]]. The coloring is caused by [[silver nanoparticle]]s.]]

* [[Selenium]], like manganese, can be used in small concentrations to decolorize glass, or in higher concentrations to impart a [[red]]dish color, caused by selenium nanoparticles dispersed in glass. It is a very important agent to make pink and red glass. When used together with cadmium sulfide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selenium|url=http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html|work=Illustrated Glass Dictionary|publisher=www.glassonline.com|accessdate=9 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001052915/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/355.html|archivedate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it yields a brilliant red color known as "Selenium Ruby".
* Pure metallic [[copper]] produces a very dark red, opaque glass, which is sometimes used as a substitute for gold in the production of [[ruby]]-colored glass.
* Metallic [[gold]], in very small concentrations (around 0.001%, or 10 ppm), produces a rich ruby-colored glass ("Ruby Gold" or "Rubino Oro"), while lower concentrations produces a less intense red, often [[marketing|marketed]] as "[[Cranberry glass|cranberry]]". The color is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of [[lead glass]] with added [[tin]].
* [[Silver]] compounds such as [[silver nitrate]] and [[silver halide]]s can produce a range of colors from [[Orange (colour)|orange]]-red to yellow. The way the glass is heated and cooled can significantly affect the colors produced by these compounds. Also [[photochromic lens]]es and [[photosensitive glass]] are based on silver.

==Colored inclusions==
[[Tin oxide]] with [[antimony trioxide|antimony]] and [[arsenic trioxide|arsenic]] oxides produce an opaque [[white]] glass ([[milk glass]]), first used in [[Venice]] to produce an imitation [[porcelain]]. Similarly, some [[smoked glass]]es may be based on dark-colored inclusions, but with ionic coloring it is also possible to produce dark colors (see above).

==Color caused by scattering==
[[File:Why is the sky blue.jpg|thumb|The [[Tyndall effect]] in [[Opalescence|opalescent]] glass: it appears blue from the side, but orange light shines through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is the sky blue, and sunsets red?: Blue and Red|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/14B.html|work=Causes of Color|publisher=Institute for Dynamic Educational Advancement|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:WetPorousGlass.jpg|thumb|[[Porous glass]] pore-size gradient (large pores on the right); coloring based on the [[Tyndall effect]].]]
Glass containing two or more [[phase (matter)|phase]]s with different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] shows coloring based on the [[Tyndall effect]] and explained by the [[Mie theory]], if the dimensions of the phases are similar or larger than the [[Frequency#Physics of light|wavelength of visible light]]. The scattered light is blue and violet as seen in the image, while the transmitted light is yellow and red.

==Dichroic glass==
{{main|Dichroic glass}}
[[File:Dichroic glass pendant.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A pendant made from [[dichroic glass]]]]
Dichroic glass has one or several coatings in the nanometer-range (for example metals, metal oxides, or nitrides) which give the glass [[dichroic]] optical properties. Also the blue appearance of some automobile [[windshield]]s is caused by dichroism.

Usually the [[Logarithmic timeline|logarithmic scale]] is used for such timelines but it compresses the most interesting Stelliferous Era too much as [[Future of an expanding universe#Graphical timeline|this]] example shows. Therefore, a [[Logarithm#Related operations and generalizations|double-logarithmic]] scale ''s'' (''s*100'' in the graphics) is used instead. The minimum of it is only 1, not 0 as needed, and the negative outputs for inputs smaller than 10 are useless. Therefore, the time from 0.1 to 10 years is collapsed to a single point 0, but that does not matter in this case because nothing special happens in the history of the universe during that time.

 \begin{cases}

[[File:MI with contraction bands very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Micrograph]] showing [[contraction band necrosis]], a histopathologic finding of [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).]]
'''Histopathology''' (compound of three [[Greek language|Greek]] words: {{lang|grc|ἱστός}} ''histos'' "tissue", πάθος ''pathos'' "suffering", and -λογία ''[[-logy|-logia]]'' "study of") refers to the [[light microscope|microscopic]] examination of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] in order to study the manifestations of [[disease]]. Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology refers to the examination of a [[biopsy]] or surgical [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] by a [[pathology|pathologist]], after the specimen has been processed and [[histological section]]s have been placed onto glass slides. In contrast, [[cytopathology]] examines (1) free cells or (2) tissue micro-fragments (as "cell blocks").

== Collection of tissues ==
Histopathological examination of tissues starts with [[surgery]], [[biopsy]], or [[autopsy]]. The tissue is removed from the [[Human body|body]] or [[plant]], and then...often following expert dissection in the fresh state...placed in a [[fixation (histology)|fixative]] which stabilizes the tissues to prevent [[Decomposition|decay]]. The most common fixative is [[formalin]] (10% neutral buffered [[formaldehyde]] in water).

== Preparation for histology ==
{{Main article|Histology}}
The tissue is then prepared for viewing under a [[microscope]] using either chemical fixation or frozen section.

If a large sample is provided e.g. from a surgical procedure then a pathologist looks at the tissue sample and selects the part most likely to yield a useful and accurate diagnosis - this part is removed for examination in a process commonly known as grossing or cut up. Larger samples are cut to correctly situate their anatomical structures in the cassette. Certain specimens (especially biopsies) can undergo [[agar]] pre-embedding to assure correct tissue orientation in cassette &amp; then in the block &amp; then on the diagnostic microscopy slide. This is then placed into a plastic cassette for most of the rest of the process.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Chemical fixation===
In addition to formalin, other chemical fixatives have been used. But, with the advent of [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) staining and diagnostic [[molecular pathology]] testing on these specimen samples, formalin has become the standard chemical fixative in human diagnostic histopathology. Fixation times for very small specimens are shorter, and standards exist in human diagnostic histopathology.

===Processing===
Water is removed from the sample in successive stages by the use of increasing concentrations of [[alcohol]].&lt;ref name=mwap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwap.co.uk/path_staining.html|title=Welcome mwap.co.uk - Justhost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xylene is used in the last dehydration phase instead of alcohol - this is because the wax used in the next stage is soluble in [[xylene]] where it is not in alcohol allowing wax to permeate (infiltrate) the specimen.&lt;ref name=mwap /&gt; This process is generally automated and done overnight. The wax infiltrated specimen is then transferred to an individual specimen embedding (usually metal) container. Finally, molten wax is introduced around the specimen in the container and cooled to solidification so as to embed it in the wax block.&lt;ref name=mwap /&gt;  This process is needed to provide a properly oriented sample sturdy enough for obtaining a thin [[microtome]] section(s) for the slide.

Once the wax embedded block is finished, sections will be cut from it and usually placed to float on a waterbath surface which spreads the section out. This is usually done by hand and is a skilled job (histotechnologist) with the lab personnel making choices about which parts of the specimen microtome wax ribbon to place on slides. A number of slides will usually be prepared from different levels throughout the block. After this the thin section mounted slide is stained and a protective cover slip is mounted on it. For common stains, an automatic process is normally used; but rarely used stains are often done by hand.&lt;ref name=mwap /&gt;

=== Frozen section processing ===
The second method of histology processing is called [[frozen section]] processing. This is a highly technical scientific method performed by a trained histoscientist (a Medical Laboratory scientist specialist in Histopathology. 5–6 years degree training) In this method, the tissue is frozen and sliced thinly using a [[microtome]] mounted in a below-freezing refrigeration device called the [[cryostat]].  The thin frozen sections are mounted on a glass slide, fixed immediately &amp; briefly in liquid fixative, and stained using the similar staining techniques as traditional wax embedded sections.  The advantages of this method is rapid processing time, less equipment requirement, and less need for ventilation in the laboratory.  The disadvantage is the poor quality of the final slide.  It is used in intra-operative pathology for determinations that might help in choosing the next step in surgery during that surgical session (for example, to preliminarily determine clearness of the [[resection margin]] of a tumor during surgery).

== Staining of processed histology slides ==

This can be done to slides processed by the chemical fixation or frozen section slides.  To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more [[pigments]]. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast.

The most commonly used stain in histopathology is a combination of [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] (often abbreviated H&amp;E). Hematoxylin is used to stain [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] '''blue''', while eosin stains [[cytoplasm]] and the extracellular connective tissue matrix '''pink'''. There are hundreds of various other techniques which have been used to selectively stain cells. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include [[safranin]], [[Oil Red O]], [[congo red]], [[Silver compounds|silver salts]] and artificial dyes. '''Histochemistry''' refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the [[Perls' Prussian blue]] reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like [[Hemochromatosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4448747/Perl|title=Perl - Red Blood Cell - Staining|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[antibody|antibodies]] have been used to stain particular [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s. Called [[immunohistochemistry]], this technique has greatly increased the ability to specifically identify categories of cells under a microscope. Other advanced techniques include '''in situ hybridization''' to identify specific [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] molecules.  These antibody staining methods often require the use of frozen section histology. These procedures above are also carried out in the laboratory under scrutiny and precision by a trained specialist Medical laboratory scientist (Histoscientist)
Digital cameras are increasingly used to capture histopathological images.

== Interpretation ==
The histological slides are examined under a microscope by a [[pathology|pathologist]], a medically qualified specialist who has completed a recognised training program. This [[medical diagnosis]] is formulated as a '''pathology report''' describing the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. In the case of [[cancer]], this represents the '''tissue diagnosis''' required for most treatment protocols.  In the removal of [[cancer]], the pathologist will indicate whether the [[surgical margin]] is cleared, or is involved (residual cancer is left behind).  This is done using either the [[bread loafing]] or [[CCPDMA]] method of processing.

== In myocardial infarction ==
{{Further|Timeline of myocardial infarction pathology}}
After a [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), no histopathology is seen the first ~30 minutes. The only possible sign the first 4 hours is waviness of fibres at border. Later, however, a [[coagulation necrosis]] is initiated, with edema and hemorrhage. After 12 hours, there can be seen [[karyopyknosis]] and hypereosinophilia of myocytes with contraction band necrosis in margins, as well as beginning of neutrophil infiltration. At 1 – 3 days there is continued coagulation necrosis with loss of nuclei and striations and an increased infiltration of neutrophils to interstitium. Until the end of the first week after infarction there is beginning of disintegration of dead muscle fibres, necrosis of neutrophils and beginning of macrophage removal of dead cells at border, which increases the succeeding days. After a week there is also beginning of granulation tissue formation at margins, which matures during the following month, and gets increased collagen deposition and decreased cellularity until the [[myocardial scarring]] is fully mature at approximately 2 months after infarction.&lt;ref name=Kumar11&gt;Chapter 11 in: {{cite book |author1=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard |author2=Kumar, Vinay |author3=Abbas, Abul K. |author4=Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camera obscura2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Camera obscura]], from a manuscript of military designs.  Seventeenth century, possibly Italian.]]
The '''history of the camera''' can be traced much further back than the introduction of [[photography]].   Cameras evolved from the [[camera obscura]], and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including [[daguerreotype]]s, [[calotype]]s, [[dry plate]]s, [[photographic film|film]], and to the modern day with [[digital camera]]s.

==Camera obscura==
[[File:Camera Obscura box18thCentury.jpg|thumb|right|An artist using an 18th-century camera obscura to trace an image]]
The forerunner to the photographic camera was the ''[[camera obscura]]''. Camera obscura ([[Latin]] for "dark room") is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The oldest known record of this principle is a description by [[History of Science and Technology in China|Han Chinese]] philosopher [[Mozi]] (ca. 470 to ca. 391 BC). Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because [[light]] travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen)'s wrote very influential books about optics, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room.

The use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project images used as a drawing aid has been traced back to circa 1550. Since the late 17th century portable camera obscura devices in tents and boxes were used as a drawing aid.
{{further|Camera obscura}}

Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models. By Niépce's time portable box camerae obscurae suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by [[Johann Zahn]] in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.

==Early fixed images==

The first partially successful [[photograph]] of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by [[Nicéphore Niépce]],&lt;ref name=newhall13&gt;{{cite book

using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with [[silver chloride]], which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with [[Bitumen of Judea]].&lt;ref name="Davenport1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Alma|title=The history of photography: an overview|year=1999|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque, NM|isbn=0-8263-2076-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. [[View from the Window at Le Gras|One of those photographs]] has survived.

[[File:Susse Frére Daguerreotype camera 1839.jpg|thumb|right|Daguerreotype camera made by &lt;!-- article "La" is not a part of this firm name --&gt;Maison [[Susse Frères]] in 1839, with a lens by Charles Chevalier]]

==Daguerreotypes and calotypes==
After Niépce's death in 1833, his partner [[Louis Daguerre]] continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the [[daguerreotype]] and publicly unveiled in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Kosinski Dorothy, The Artist and the Camera, Degas to Picasso. New Haven: Yale University Press,1999. p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with [[iodine|iodine vapor]] to give it a coating of light-sensitive [[silver iodide]]. After exposure in the camera, the image was [[photographic processing|developed]] by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). [[Henry Fox Talbot]] perfected a different process, the [[calotype]], in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many minutes as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality [[achromatic lens]]es were standard.&lt;ref name=wade&gt;{{cite book | last=Wade | first=John | title=A Short History of the Camera | year=1979 | publisher=Fountain Press | location=Watford | isbn=0-85242-640-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dry plates==
[[Collodion process|Collodion dry plates]] had been available since 1857, thanks to the work of [[Désiré van Monckhoven]], but it was not until the invention of the [[gelatin]] dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. With daylight and a fast plate or film, a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture. The ranks of amateur photographers swelled and informal "candid" portraits became popular. There was a proliferation of camera designs, from single- and twin-lens reflexes to large and bulky field cameras, simple [[box camera]]s, and even "detective cameras" disguised as pocket watches, hats, or other objects.

The short exposure times that made candid photography possible also necessitated another innovation, the mechanical [[shutter (photography)|shutter]]. The very first shutters were separate accessories, though built-in shutters were common by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=wade/&gt;{{clear left}}

==Kodak and the birth of film==

[[File:Brownie2 overview3.jpg|thumb|right|Kodak No. 2 Brownie box camera, circa 1910]]

The use of [[photographic film]] was pioneered by [[George Eastman]], who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to [[celluloid]] in 1888-1889. His first camera, which he called the "[[Kodak]]," was first offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple [[box camera]] with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed, which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer. The Kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished. By the end of the 19th century Eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras.

In 1900, Eastman took mass-market photography one step further with the [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]], a simple and very inexpensive box camera that introduced the concept of the [[snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]. The Brownie was extremely popular and various models remained on sale until the 1960s.

Film also allowed the [[movie camera]] to develop from an expensive toy to a practical commercial tool.

Despite the advances in low-cost photography made possible by Eastman, plate cameras still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with rollfilm cameras, which offered a larger number of exposures per loading, many inexpensive plate cameras from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available, as were backs that enabled rollfilm cameras to use plates.

Except for a few special types such as [[Schmidt camera]]s, most professional [[astrograph]]s continued to use plates until the end of the 20th century when electronic photography replaced them.

==35 mm==

[[File:Leica-I-1.jpg|thumb|right|Leica I, 1925]]

[[File:Argus C3.jpg|thumb|right|Argus C3, 1939]]

{{See also|135 film#History|l1=History of 135 film}}

A number of manufacturers started to use 35mm film for still photography between 1905 and 1913. The first 35mm cameras available to the public, and reaching significant numbers in sales were the Tourist Multiple, in 1913, and the Simplex, in 1914. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Oskar Barnack]], who was in charge of research and development at &lt;!-- DO NOT DISAMBIGUATE, [[Leica Camera]] DID NOT EXIST UNTIL 1986; DEVELOP THE [[Ernst Leitz GmbH]] ARTICLE INSTEAD! --&gt;[[Ernst Leitz GmbH|Leitz]], decided to investigate using [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm cine film]] for still cameras while attempting to build a [[compact camera]] capable of making high-quality enlargements. He built his prototype 35&amp;nbsp;mm camera (Ur-Leica) around 1913, though further development was delayed for several years by World War I. It wasn't until after World War I that Leica commercialized their first 35mm Cameras. Leitz test-marketed the design between 1923 and 1924, receiving enough positive feedback that the camera was put into production as the [[Leica Camera|Leica I]] (for '''Lei'''tz '''ca'''mera) in 1925. The Leica's immediate popularity spawned a number of competitors, most notably the [[Contax]] (introduced in 1932), and cemented the position of [[35 mm]] as the format of choice for high-end compact cameras.

Kodak got into the market with the [[Kodak Retina|Retina I]] in 1934, which introduced the [[135 film|135]] cartridge used in all modern 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras. Although the Retina was comparatively inexpensive, 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras were still out of reach for most people and rollfilm remained the format of choice for mass-market cameras. This changed in 1936 with the introduction of the inexpensive Argus A and to an even greater extent in 1939 with the arrival of the immensely popular [[Argus C3]]. Although the cheapest cameras still used rollfilm, 35&amp;nbsp;mm film had come to dominate the market by the time the C3 was discontinued in 1966.

The fledgling Japanese camera industry began to take off in 1936 with the [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] 35&amp;nbsp;mm rangefinder, an improved version of the 1933 Kwanon prototype. Japanese cameras would begin to become popular in the West after Korean War veterans and soldiers stationed in Japan brought them back to the United States and elsewhere.

==TLRs and SLRs==

{{See also|History of the single-lens reflex camera}}

[[File:Contax-s.jpg|thumb|left|A historic camera:  the [[Contax]] S of 1949 — the first [[pentaprism]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]]]]

[[File:Asahiflex IIb Model I.jpg|thumb|right|Asahiflex IIb, 1954]]

[[File:Nikonf.jpg|thumb|[[Nikon F]] of 1959 — the first Japanese [[system camera]]]]

The first practical reflex camera was the [[Rollei|Franke &amp; Heidecke]] [[Rolleiflex]] [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] [[Twin-lens reflex camera|TLR]] of 1928. Though both single- and twin-lens reflex cameras had been available for decades, they were too bulky to achieve much popularity. The Rolleiflex, however, was sufficiently compact to achieve widespread popularity and the medium-format TLR design became popular for both high- and low-end cameras.

A similar revolution in [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] design began in 1933 with the introduction of the [[Ihagee]] [[Exakta]], a compact SLR which used [[127 film|127]] rollfilm. This was followed three years later by the first Western SLR to use [[135 film]], the Kine Exakta (World's first true [[35mm format|35mm]] SLR was [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Sport (camera)|"Sport" camera]], marketed several months before Kine Exakta, though "Sport" used its own film cartridge). The [[35mm format|35mm]] SLR design gained immediate popularity and there was an explosion of new models and innovative features after World War II. There were also a few 35mm TLRs, the best-known of which was the [[Contaflex]] of 1935, but for the most part these met with little success.

The first major post-war SLR innovation was the eye-level viewfinder, which first appeared on the Hungarian [[Duflex]] in 1947 and was refined in 1948 with the [[Contax]] S, the first camera to use a [[pentaprism]]. Prior to this, all SLRs were equipped with waist-level focusing screens. The Duflex was also the first SLR with an instant-return mirror, which prevented the viewfinder from being blacked out after  each exposure. This same time period also saw the introduction of the [[Hasselblad|Hasselblad 1600F]], which set the standard for medium format SLRs for decades.

In 1952 the [[Pentax|Asahi Optical Company]] (which later became well known for its Pentax cameras) introduced the first Japanese SLR using [[135 film]], the [[Asahiflex]]. Several other Japanese camera makers also entered the SLR market in the 1950s, including Canon, [[Yashica]], and [[Nikon]]. Nikon's entry, the [[Nikon F]], had a full line of interchangeable components and accessories and is generally regarded as the first Japanese [[system camera]]. It was the F, along with the earlier [[Nikon S|S]] series of rangefinder cameras, that helped establish Nikon's reputation as a maker of professional-quality equipment.

==Instant cameras==

[[File:Polaroid Land Camera Model J66.jpg|thumb|right|Polaroid Model J66, 1961]]

While conventional cameras were becoming more refined and sophisticated, an entirely new type of camera appeared on the market in 1948. This was the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] Model 95, the world's first viable [[instant camera|instant-picture camera]]. Known as a [[Land Camera]] after its inventor, [[Edwin Land]], the Model 95 used a patented chemical process to produce finished positive prints from the exposed negatives in under a minute. The Land Camera caught on despite its relatively high price and the Polaroid lineup had expanded to dozens of models by the 1960s. The first Polaroid camera aimed at the popular market, the [[Polaroid Swinger|Model 20 Swinger]] of 1965, was a huge success and remains one of the top-selling cameras of all time.

==Automation==

The first camera to feature automatic [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] was the [[selenium]] [[light meter]]-equipped, fully automatic Super Kodak Six-20 pack of 1938, but its extremely high price (for the time) of $225 (${{Inflation|US|225|1938}} in present terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}) kept it from achieving any degree of success. By the 1960s, however, low-cost electronic components were commonplace and cameras equipped with light meters and automatic exposure systems became increasingly widespread.

The next technological advance came in 1960, when the German [[Mec 16 SB]] [[subminiature camera|subminiature]] became the first camera to place the light meter behind the [[photographic lens|lens]] for more accurate metering. However, [[through-the-lens]] metering ultimately became a feature more commonly found on SLRs than other types of camera; the first SLR equipped with a TTL system was the [[Topcon|Topcon RE Super]] of 1962.

==Digital cameras==
{{See also|DSLR#History}}
[[Digital camera]]s differ from their analog predecessors primarily in that they do not use film, but capture and save photographs on digital memory cards or internal storage instead.  Their low operating costs have relegated chemical cameras to [[niche market]]s. Digital cameras now include wireless communication capabilities (for example [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Bluetooth]]) to transfer, print or share photos, and are commonly found on [[Camera phone|mobile phones]].

===Early development===

The concept of digitizing images on scanners, and the concept of digitizing video signals, predate the concept of making still pictures by digitizing signals from an array of discrete sensor elements.  Early [[spy satellites]] used the extremely complex and expensive method of de-orbit and airborne retrieval of film canisters.  Technology was pushed to skip these steps through the use of in-satellite developing and electronic scanning of the film for direct transmission to the ground.  The amount of film was still a major limitation, and this was overcome and greatly simplified by the push to develop an electronic image capturing array that could be used instead of film.  The first electronic imaging satellite was the [[KH-11]] launched by the [[National Reconnaissance Office|NRO]] in late 1976.  It had a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) array with a resolution of {{nowrap|800 x 800 pixels}} (0.64 megapixels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/kh-11.htm globalsecurity.org – KH-11 KENNAN], 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  At Philips Labs in New York, [[Edward Stupp]], [[Pieter Cath]] and [[Zsolt Szilagyi (scientist)|Zsolt Szilagyi]] filed for a patent on "All Solid State Radiation Imagers" on 6 September 1968 and constructed a flat-screen target for receiving and storing an optical image on a matrix composed of an array of photodiodes connected to a capacitor to form an array of two terminal devices connected in rows and columns. Their US patent was granted on 10 November 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|3540011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Texas Instruments engineer [[Willis Adcock]] designed a filmless camera that was not digital and applied for a patent in 1972, but it is not known whether it was ever built.&lt;ref name="digicamhistory_1970s"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4057830}} and {{Cite patent|US|4163256}} were filed in 1972 but were only later awarded in 1976 and 1977. {{cite web|url=http://www.digicamhistory.com/1970s.html|title=1970s|accessdate=15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cromemco CYCLOPS]] introduced as a hobbyist construction project in 1975&lt;ref name="PE"&gt;{{Cite journal

The prototype camera was a technical exercise, not intended for production.

===Analog electronic cameras===
[[File:Sony Mavica 1981 prototype CP+ 2011.jpg|thumb|Sony Mavica, 1981]]
{{main|Still video camera}}

Handheld electronic cameras, in the sense of a device meant to be carried and used like a handheld film camera, appeared in 1981 with the demonstration of the [[Sony Mavica]] (Magnetic Video Camera). This is not to be confused with the later cameras by Sony that also bore the Mavica name. This was an analog camera, in that it recorded pixel signals continuously, as videotape machines did, without converting them to discrete levels; it recorded television-like signals to a 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;inch "[[video floppy]]".&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In essence it was a video movie camera that recorded single frames, 50 per disk in field mode and 25 per disk in frame mode. The image quality was considered equal to that of then-current televisions.

[[File:Canon RC-701 img 0829.jpg|thumb|Canon RC-701, 1986]]

Analog electronic cameras do not appear to have reached the market until 1986 with the Canon RC-701. Canon demonstrated a prototype of this model at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], printing the images in the ''[[Yomiuri Shinbun]]'', a Japanese newspaper. In the United States, the first publication to use these cameras for real reportage was [[USA Today]], in its coverage of World Series baseball. Several factors held back the widespread adoption of analog cameras; the cost (upwards of [[United States Dollar|$]]20,000), poor image quality compared to film, and the lack of quality affordable printers. Capturing and printing an image originally required access to equipment such as a frame grabber, which was beyond the reach of the average consumer. The "video floppy" disks later had several reader devices available for viewing on a screen, but were never standardized as a computer drive.

The early adopters tended to be in the news media, where the cost was negated by the utility and the ability to transmit images by telephone lines. The poor image quality was offset by the low resolution of newspaper graphics. This capability to transmit images without a satellite link was useful during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] and the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991.

US government agencies also took a strong interest in the still video concept, notably the US Navy for use as a real time air-to-sea surveillance system.

The first analog electronic camera marketed to consumers may have been the Casio VS-101 in 1987. A notable analog camera produced the same year was the [http://imaging.nikon.com/history/chronicle/cousins16-e/ Nikon QV-1000C], designed as a press camera and not offered for sale to general users, which sold only a few hundred units. It recorded images in [[greyscale]], and the quality in newspaper print was equal to film cameras. In appearance it closely resembled a modern digital [[single-lens reflex camera]]. Images were stored on video floppy disks.

Silicon Film, a proposed digital sensor cartridge for film cameras that would allow 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras to take digital photographs without modification was announced in late 1998. Silicon Film was to work like a roll of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, with a 1.3 [[megapixel]] sensor behind the lens and a battery and storage unit fitting in the film holder in the camera.  The product, which was never released, became increasingly obsolete due to improvements in digital camera technology and affordability. Silicon Films' parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/0109/01091702siliconfilmvaporizes.asp| title=Silicon Film – vaporized-ware| first=Phil| last=Askey| year=2001| accessdate=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of true digital cameras===
[[File:Minolta RD-175 Digital SLR.JPG|thumb|The first portable digital SLR camera, introduced by Minolta in 1995.]]
[[File:Capas-d1.jpg|thumb|Nikon D1, 1999]]

By the late 1980s, the technology required to produce truly commercial digital cameras existed. The first true portable digital camera that recorded images as a computerized file was likely the [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] DS-1P of 1988, which recorded to a 2&amp;nbsp;MB SRAM memory card that used a battery to keep the data in memory. This camera was never marketed to the public.

The first digital camera of any kind ever sold commercially was possibly the MegaVision Tessera in 1987 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mega-vision.com/why_Measured_Photography.html MegaVision Professional Camera Backs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though there is not extensive documentation of its sale known. The first ''portable'' digital camera that was actually marketed commercially was sold in December 1989 in Japan, the DS-X by

It used a CCD [[image sensor]], stored pictures digitally, and connected directly to a computer for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1990 | work = digicammuseum.com | url = http://www.digicammuseum.com/en/history | accessdate = 17 September 2007 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dycam Model 1: The world's first consumer digital still camera | work = DigiBarn computer museum | url = http://www.digibarn.com/collections/cameras/dycam-model1/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Said, "DYCAM Model 1: The first portable Digital Still Camera", ''MacWeek'', vol. 4, No. 35, 16 Oct. 1990, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Kodak brought to market the [[Kodak DCS]] (Kodak Digital Camera System), the beginning of a long line of professional [[Kodak DCS]] SLR cameras that were based in part on film bodies, often Nikons. It used a 1.3&amp;nbsp;megapixel sensor, had a bulky external digital storage system and was priced at $13,000. At the arrival of the [[Kodak DCS-200]], the [[Kodak DCS]] was dubbed [[Kodak DCS-100]].

The move to digital formats was helped by the formation of the first [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]] standards in 1988, which allowed image and video files to be compressed for storage. The first consumer camera with a liquid crystal display on the back was the [[Casio]] [[QV-10]] developed by a team led by [[Hiroyuki Suetaka]] in 1995. The first camera to use [[CompactFlash]] was the [[Kodak DC-25]] in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. The first camera that offered the ability to record [[video]] clips may have been the [[Ricoh RDC-1]] in 1995.

In 1995 Minolta introduced the [[Minolta RD-175|RD-175]], which was based on the Minolta 500si SLR with a splitter and three independent CCDs. This combination delivered 1.75M pixels. The benefit of using an SLR base was the ability to use any existing Minolta AF mount lens. 1999 saw the introduction of the [[Nikon D1]], a 2.74&amp;nbsp;megapixel camera that was the first [[digital SLR]] developed entirely from the ground up by a major manufacturer, and at a cost of under $6,000 at introduction was affordable by professional photographers and high-end consumers. This camera also used Nikon F-mount lenses, which meant film photographers could use many of the same lenses they already owned.

Digital camera sales continued to flourish, driven by technology advances. The digital market segmented into different categories, Compact Digital Still Cameras, Bridge Cameras, Mirrorless Compacts and Digital SLRs. One of the major technology advances was the development of [[CMOS]] sensors, which helped drive sensor costs low enough to enable the widespread adoption of camera phones.

Since 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/1039455/digitalfilm.html Digital outsells film, but film still king to some | Macworld&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kodak]] announced in January 2004 that they would no longer sell Kodak-branded film cameras in the [[developed world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/20/kodak_to_drop_35mm_cameras/ | title=Kodak to drop 35mm cameras in Europe, US | first=Tony | last=Smith | date=2004-01-20 | publisher=The Register | accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  - and 2012 filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/eastman-kodak-files-for-bankruptcy/ | work=The New York Times | title=Eastman Kodak Files for Bankruptcy | date=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smartphone]]s now routinely include high resolution digital cameras.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5144">'''Ingression''' is one of the many changes in the location or relative position of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that takes place during the [[gastrulation]] stage of animal development.  It produces an animal's [[mesenchyme]] cells at the onset of gastrulation.  During the [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]] (EMT), the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) detach from the [[epithelium]] and become internalized mesenchyme cells that can migrate freely (Figure 1).  Each animal system utilizes an EMT to produce mesenchyme cells.&lt;ref name="PMID 18228256"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu SY, Ferkowicz M, McClay DR |title= Ingression of primary mesenchyme cells of the sea urchin embryo: a precisely timed epithelial mesenchymal transition.|journal= Birth Defects Res C Embryo Today|volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=241–52|year=2007 |pmid= 18228256|doi=10.1002/bdrc.20113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the mechanisms of ingression are not fully understood, studies using the sea urchin as a model organism have begun to shed light on this developmental process, and will be the focus here.  There are three main changes that must occur within a cell to enable the process of ingression.  The ingressing PMCs must first alter their affinity for the neighboring epithelial cells that will remain in the [[vegetal plate]] (vertebrate PMCs ingress from the [[primitive streak]]).  During this time, these cells must lose their affinity for the hyaline layer to which their [[apical surface]] is attached.  The ingressing cells will then apically constrict and alter their cellular architecture through a dramatic reorganization of their [[cytoskeleton]].  Lastly, these cells will modify their mode of motility and presumably gain affinity for the basal lamina which composes the lining of the [[blastocoel]], the future migration substrate of the PMCs,.&lt;ref name="PMID 12606282"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson RE, McClay DR |title= Primary mesenchyme cell patterning during the early stages following ingression. |journal= Dev. Biol.|volume=254 |issue=1 |pages=68–78|year=2003 |pmid= 12606282|doi=10.1016/S0012-1606(02)00025-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://worms.zoology.wisc.edu/frogs/gast/gast_morph.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the adhesion properties of these cells are the best characterized and understood mechanism of ingression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In sea urchins, epithelial cells adhere to one another as well as the hyaline layer through classic adherens and [[cadherin]] junctions.  Ingression is a very dynamic process however, and the first sign of an ingressing cell is seen when a future PMC loses its adhesion to hyaline, loses adhesion and cadherin, and increase their adhesion to a [[basal laminal]] substrate.  These processes occur rapidly, over approximately 30 minutes.  It is not understood how the PMCs penetrate the basal lamina.  The basal lamina is a loose matrix, therefore it is possible that the ingressing cells squeeze through the matrix.  It is also hypothesized that the PMCs use a [[protease]].&lt;ref name="PMID 18228256"/&gt; EMT is determined by a dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN). snail and twist are two key [[transcription factors]] that makes up the GRN. Within an hour of ingression, numerous transcript factors are activated.  It is known that [[beta-catenin]] (β-catenin) plays a key role in EMT.  When β-catenin function is blocked, no EMT results.  If β-catenin is over-expressed, too many cells undergo EMT.  The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) is also necessary for the PMCs to function as mesenchymal cells.&lt;ref name="PMID 18228256"/&gt;  Lastly, it is thought that the ingression of PMCs is further facilitated simply through the simultaneous ingression neighboring cells.&lt;ref name="PMID 12606282"/&gt;

Within birds and mammals, [[epiblast]] cells converge at the midline and ingress at the primitive streak.  Ingression of these cells results in formation of the [[mesoderm]].&lt;ref&gt;. http://biology.kenyon.edu/courses/biol114/Chap14/Chapter_14.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of ingression to internalize presumptive mesoderm is considered a major evolutionary change in mesoderm morphogenesis within [[chordates]].  Within chordate embryos, there is an evolutionary trend exhibited in the mechanisms used to internalize presumptive mesoderm.  Basal chordates rely predominantly on invagination, anamniote vertebrates and reptiles on a varying combination of involution and ingression, and birds and mammals primarily on ingression.&lt;ref name="PMID 18041055"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shook DR, Keller R |title= Epithelial type, ingression, blastopore architecture and the evolution of chordate mesoderm morphogenesis. |journal= J Exp Zool B Mol Dev Evol.|volume=310 |issue=1 |pages=85–110|year=2008 |pmid= 18041055|doi=10.1002/jez.b.21198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ingression, two other types of internalizing cell movements may occur during gastrulation: [[invagination]] and [[Involution (medicine)|involution]].&lt;ref name="worms.zoology.wisc.edu"&gt;"http://worms.zoology.wisc.edu/frogs/gast/gast_morph.html"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38897">The '''Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS)''', which was previously known as the '''Joint Army-Navy Nomenclature System''' (AN System. JAN) and the '''Joint Communications-Electronics Nomenclature System''', is a method developed by the [[U.S. War Department]] during [[World War II]] for assigning an [[Classified information in the United States|unclassified]] designator to electronic equipment. In 1957, the JETDS was formalized in '''MIL-STD-196'''.

Computer software and commercial unmodified electronics for which the manufacturer maintains design control are not covered.

==Usage==
Electronic materiel, from a military point of view, generally includes those electronic devices employed in data processing, detection and tracking (underwater, sea, land-based, air and space), recognition and identification, communications, aids to navigation, weapons control and evaluation, flight control, and electronics countermeasures. Nomenclature is assigned to:
* Electronic materiel of military design
* Commercial electronic materiel that has been modified for military use and requires military identification and design control
* Electronic materiel which is intended for use by other Federal agencies or other governments that participate in the nomenclature system.

===Systems===

In the JETDS system, complete equipment sets or systems are designated with a sequence of letters and digits prefixed by '''AN/''', then three letters, a hyphen, a number, and (occasionally) some optional letters (AN/AAA-nnn suffixed by (Vn){hardware/software version} or (T){training equipment} . The three letters tell where the equipment is used, what it does and its purpose. For example, the [[AN/PRC-77]] is a '''P'''ortable '''R'''adio used for two way '''C'''ommunications. The model numbers for any given type of equipment are assigned sequentially, thus higher numbers indicate more modern systems.

The three letter codes have the following meanings:

==== First letter: installation ====
* A - Piloted Aircraft
* B - Underwater Mobile (submarine)
* C - Cryptographic Equipment ([[National Security Agency|NSA]] use only) (was Air Transportable)
* D - Pilotless Carrier (drone, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]])
* F - Fixed Ground
* G - General Ground Use
* K - Amphibious
* M - Mobile (ground) 
* P - Portable 
* S - Water (surface ship)
* T - Transportable (ground)
* U - General Utility (multi use)
* V - Vehicular (ground)
* W - Water Surface and Underwater combined
* Z - Piloted-Pilotless Airborne Vehicles combined

==== Second letter: type of equipment ====
* A - Invisible Light, Heat Radiation (e.g., infrared)
* B - [[Communications Security|COMSEC]] (NSA use only)  (was [[Homing pigeon|Pigeon]])
* C - Carrier (electronic wave or signal)
* D - Radiac (Radioactivity Detection, Identification, and Computation)
* E - Laser  (was NUPAC, Nuclear Protection &amp; Control)
* F - Fiber Optics (was Photographic)
* G - Telegraph or Teletype
* I - Interphone and Public Address
* J - Electromechanical or Inertial Wire Covered
* K - Telemetering
* L - Countermeasures
* M - Meteorological
* N - Sound in Air
* P - Radar
* Q - Sonar and Underwater Sound
* R - Radio
* S - Special or Combination
* T - Telephone (Wire)
* V - Visual, Visible Light
* W - Armament (not otherwise covered)
* X - Facsimile or Television
* Y - Data Processing or Computer
* Z - Communications (NSA use only)

==== Third letter: purpose ====
* A - Auxiliary Assembly
* B - Bombing
* C - Communications (Receiving/Transmitting, two way)
* D - Direction Finder, Reconnaissance and Surveillance
* E - Ejection and/or Release
* G - Fire Control or Search Light Directing
* H - Recording and/or Reproducing
* K - Computing
* L - no longer used (was Searchlight Control, now covered by "G")
* M - Maintenance or Test Assemblies
* N - Navigational Aids
* P - no longer used (was Reproducing, now covered by "H")
* Q - Special or Combination
* R - Receiving or Passive Detecting
* S - Detecting or Range and Bearing, Search
* T - Transmitting
* W - Automatic Flight or Remote Control
* X - Identification and Recognition
* Y - Surveillance (search, detect, and multiple target tracking) and Control (both fire control and/or air control)
* Z - Secure (NSA use only)

====Model number====
Following the three-letter designation, after a dash, is a number, uniquely identifying the equipment. Different variants of the same equipment may be given an additional letter and other suffixes (for example, [[AN/SPY-1]]A, AN/SPY-1B, etc.), while entirely new equipment within the same category is given a new number (for example, [[AN/SPY-3]]).

====Variants and training equipment====

A suffix "(V)", parenthetical V, indicates variable components.  A number may follow the parenthetical V to identify a specific configuration.  Or the number will identify the precise quantity of equipment required for a specific configuration.

A suffix of "(P)", parenthetical P, indicates a plug in module or component of a system which changes the function, frequency, or characteristics.

A suffix of "(C)", parenthetical C, indicates NSA-controlled cryptographic/classified item.

A suffix of "-T", dash T, indicates equipment designed to provide training in the operation of a specific set.

For example:

AN/ABC-1(V)4 would be the 4th variable of the AN/ABC-1 equipment.
OT-1957(V)1/ABC-1(V) would be one OT-1957 required for the particular configuration. 
AN/ABC-1(C) would be an NSA-controlled cryptographic/classified item.
R00(P)/ABC-1 would be a plug in module for the AN/ABC-1 equipment.  
AN/ABC-1-T1 would be the first training set for the AN/ABC-1 equipment.  

===Subsystems===

Subsystems ("groups") are designated by a two letter code (without the AN/ prefix), followed by a number, followed by slash and one, two or three letters from the three letter codes for systems. For example, BA-1234/PRC would be a battery for portable radio sets. Some subsystems will have the designation for the system they belong to. For example, RT-859/APX-72 and C-6820/APX-72, the /APX-72 indicates both are part of the AN/APX-72 system.

== History ==
JETDS was adopted 16 February 1943 by the Joint Communications Board for all new [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] airborne, radio, and radar equipment. Over time it was extended to cover the Marine Corps and the Navy's ship, submarine, amphibious, and ground electronic equipment.  When the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] was established as a separate department, it continued the use of the system for electronic equipment. JETDS was adopted by the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1950, [[Canada]] in 1951 and the [[NSA]] in 1959 (though the NSA continued to use its own TSEC telecommunications security nomenclature&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/miscsystems.html#_TSEC Telecommunications Security (TSEC) Nomenclature System]&lt;/ref&gt;).  In 1957 the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] approved a [[United States Military Standard|military standard]] for the nomenclature, MIL-STD-196. The system has been modified over time, with some types (e.g. [[carrier pigeon]] '''-B-''') dropped and others (e.g. computers and cryptographic equipment) added. The latest version, MIL-STD-196F, was issued in 2013.

The '''Korea Institute of Maritime and Fisheries Technology''', or '''KIMFT''',  is a maritime education and research institute operated by the government of [[South Korea]].  It is based in [[Yeongdang-dong]], [[Nam-gu (Busan)|Nam-gu]], [[Busan]], with an auxiliary campus on [[Yeongdo]] island near [[Busan Port]].  Each campus includes a dormitory for trainees.

The Institute was formed in 1998 from the merger of the Korea Fishing Training Center with the Korea Maritime Training and Research Institute.  The first was established in 1965 as the Korea Deep-sea Training Institute.  In 1978, it became an independent corporation.  The research institute was founded in 1983, attached to [[Pukyong National University]].  The two were merged by an act of the [[National Assembly of South Korea]] passed in 1997.

In addition to its research work, KIMFT offers a range of professional certifications.  These include a certification in [[fish medicine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33143">A '''lie-to-children''' (plural '''lies-to-children''') is a simplified explanation of technical or complex subjects as a teaching method for children and [[Layperson|laypeople]]. The technique has been incorporated by academics within the fields of [[biology]], [[evolution]], [[bioinformatics]] and the [[social sciences]]. It is closely related to the philosophical concept known as [[Wittgenstein's ladder]].

Stewart and Cohen wrote in ''Figments of Reality'' (1997) that the lie-to-children concept reflected the difficulty inherent in reducing complex concepts during the education process.&lt;ref name="figments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="douglaschapman"&gt;{{cite news|first=Douglas|last=Chapman|title=Book Review – Figments of Reality: The Evolution of the Curious Mind|work=Strange Magazine|year=1997|accessdate=28 February 2016|url=http://www.strangemag.com/reviews/figmentsofreality.html|archivedate=19 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919014619/http://www.strangemag.com/reviews/figmentsofreality.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart and Cohen noted reality itself was viewed within the prism of human perspective: "Any description suitable for human minds to grasp must be ''some'' type of lie-to-children — real reality is always much too complicated for our limited minds."&lt;ref name="figments" /&gt;

Librarian and editor [[Andrew Sawyer]] discussed the "lie-to-children" concept introduced by scientists Cohen and Stewart in their early two non-fiction books.&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Sawyer wrote: "In ''The Collapse of Chaos'' and ''Figments of Reality'', we also come across the concept of 'lies-to-children' — the necessarily simplified stories we tell children and students as a foundation for understanding so that eventually they can discover that they are not, in fact, ''true''."&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;

The definition given in ''The Science of Discworld'' (1999) is as follows: "A lie-to-children is a statement that is false, but which nevertheless leads the child's mind towards a more accurate explanation, one that the child will only be able to appreciate if it has been primed with the lie".&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kirsten|last1=Walsh|first2=Adrian|last2=Currie|title=Caricatures, Myths, and White Lies|journal=[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]] |volume=46|issue=3|date=22 July 2015|pages=414–435|doi=10.1111/meta.12139|issn=1467-9973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fallis"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Don|last=Fallis|title=What Is Disinformation?|journal=[[Library Trends]]|volume=63|issue=3|year=2015|pages=401–426|doi=10.1353/lib.2015.0014|issn=0024-2594}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors acknowledge that some people might dispute the applicability of the term ''lie'', while defending it on the grounds that "it is for the best possible reasons, but it is still a lie".&lt;ref name="pratchett" /&gt; This viewpoint is derived from earlier perspectives within the field of [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name="judge"&gt;{{cite book|first=Anthony|last=Judge|accessdate=28 February 2016|url=https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs00s/mislead.php|chapter=Strategic leadership as essentially a "shell game" with potential opponents, followers and dissidents?|title=Emergence of a Global Misleadership Council – misleading as vital to governance of the future?|date=1 July 2007|archivedate=31 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031134328/http://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs00s/mislead.php|publisher=Laetus in Praesens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 interview, Pratchett commented upon the phrase: "I ''like'' the lies-to-children motif, because it underlies the way we run our society and resonates nicely with Discworld."&lt;ref name="davidlangford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="langfordamazon" /&gt; He was critical of problems inherent in early education: "You arrive with your sparkling A-levels all agleam, and the first job of the tutors is to reveal that what you thought was true is only true for a given value of 'truth'."&lt;ref name="davidlangford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="langfordamazon" /&gt; Pratchett cautioned: "Most of us need just 'enough' knowledge of the sciences, and it's delivered to us in metaphors and analogies that bite us in the bum if we think they're the same as the truth."&lt;ref name="davidlangford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="langfordamazon" /&gt;

Cohen and Stewart further elaborated upon the lie-to-children trope in a 2002 book they coauthored on [[exobiology]], ''[[Evolving the Alien]]: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life''.&lt;ref name="langfordevolving"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Langford|authorlink=David Langford|work=[[New Scientist]]|title=Evolving the Alien: The science of extraterrestrial life by Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart|date=5 October 2002|accessdate=28 February 2016|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623636-300-evolving-the-alien-the-science-of-extraterrestrial-life-by-jack-cohen-and-ian-stewart/|subscription=yes|archivedate=28 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172211/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623636-300-evolving-the-alien-the-science-of-extraterrestrial-life-by-jack-cohen-and-ian-stewart/|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the work, the authors were critical of use of lie-to-children as an educational methodology which had an unfortunate side-effect of reducing complex science concepts to overly simplified explanations.&lt;ref name="langfordevolving" /&gt; Stewart was asked in a 2015 interview about his views on Pratchett beyond the influence of lie-to-children, and the author's take on the understanding of science.&lt;ref name="guardianstewart" /&gt; Stewart commented upon the interaction between himself and Cohen with Pratchett during the writing process: "Terry wasn't trained as a scientist, but he had the right kind of critical attitude. He was extraordinarily widely read, and would ask all sorts of unexpected questions that really got me and Jack thinking."&lt;ref name="guardianstewart"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=28 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2015/jun/05/ian-stewart-on-the-science-of-terry-pratchetts-discworld-webchat|title=Ian Stewart on the science of Terry Pratchett's Discworld – as it happened|first=Sam|last=Jordison|date=9 June 2015|archivedate=29 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229081705/http://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2015/jun/05/ian-stewart-on-the-science-of-terry-pratchetts-discworld-webchat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry recommended the original works discussing the concept for further analysis of the phenomenon: "These are well worth a read if you fancy a laugh while pretending to work."&lt;ref name="moorhouse" /&gt;

== Use in adult education ==
The term "lie to children" should not be taken to imply that it is exclusively used in childhood education. Educators in secondary and post-secondary schools employ increasingly-accurate yet still "untrue" models as a means of explicating complex topics.

A typical example of this is found in physics, where the [[Bohr model]] of atomic electron shells is still often used to introduce atomic structure before moving on to [[Bohr model#Refinements|more complex models]] based on [[matrix mechanics]]; and in chemistry, where the [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius definition |Arrhenius definitions of acids and bases]] are often introduced, followed (in a manner similar to the historical development of the model) by the [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory |Brønsted–Lowry]] definitions and then the [[Lewis acids and bases |Lewis]] definitions.

High school teachers and university instructors often explain at the outset that the model they are about to present is incomplete. An example of this is given by [[Gerald Sussman]] during the 1986 video recording of the [[Hal Abelson |Abelson]]-Sussman Lectures ([https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/1b-procedures-and-processes-substitution-model/ lecture 1-b]):&lt;blockquote&gt;If we're going to understand processes and how we control them, then we have to have a mapping from the mechanisms of this procedure into the way in which these processes behave. What we're going to have is a formal, or semi-formal, mechanical model whereby you understand how a machine could, in fact, in principle, do this. Whether or not the actual machine really does what I'm about to tell you is completely irrelevant at this moment.

In fact, this is an [[Function model|engineering model]], in the same way that, [for an] electrical resistor, we write down a model V = IR — it's approximately true, but it's not really true; if I put enough current through the resistor, it goes boom, so the voltage is not always proportional to the current, but for some purposes the model is appropriate.

In particular, the model we're going to describe right now, which I call the substitution model, is the simplest model that we have for understanding how procedures work and how processes work — how procedures yield processes.

And that substitution model will be accurate for most of the things we'll be dealing with in the next few days. But eventually, it will become impossible to sustain the illusion that that's the way the machine works, and we'll go to other, more specific and particular models that will show more detail.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of lie-to-children was discussed at-length in 2000 by [[Andrew Sawyer]], where the subject itself was included in the article title: "Narrativium and Lies-to-Children: 'Palatable Instruction in 'The Science of Discworld'".&lt;ref name="andysawyer"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andy|last=Sawyer|journal=Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies (HJEAS)|volume=6|issue=1|year=2000|pages=155–178|publisher=Centre for Arts, Humanities and Sciences (CAHS), acting on behalf of the University of Debrecen CAHS|jstor=41274079|subscription=yes|title=Narrativium and Lies-to-Children: 'Palatable Instruction in 'The Science of Discworld'|issn=1218-7364|authorlink=Andrew Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Sawyer wrote that: "The 'lies-to-children' we tell ourselves about science are a different form of science fiction: one, perhaps where 'fiction' qualifies the word 'science.' They are 'fictions about science' rather than 'science fictions.'"&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Sawyer concluded: "The strength of ''The Science of Discworld'' — and why in many ways it is something new in science writing — derives from Pratchett's story being more than a parable constructed for the specific purpose of explaining what the scientists have to say. It is, as has been said, a commentary/parody of the scientific method".&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;

In a contribution about [[evolution]] for the 2001 book ''Nonlinear Dynamics in the Life and Social Sciences'', [[Reproductive biology|reproductive biologist]] [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] discussed the lie-to-children teaching technique and its use educating students on the concept of evolution and its complex facets including the notion that [[DNA]] is an architectural guide for life.&lt;ref name="nonlinear" /&gt; The author concluded: "Only the search for universal features, while treasuring all the exceptional specifics, offers some hope of sketching out the general shape of the evolutionary process so that we can explain it honestly as a Lie-to-Children."&lt;ref name="nonlinear"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jack|last=Cohen|authorlink=Jack Cohen (scientist)|chapter=Complexity of Evolution|pages=357–359|editor1-first=William H. |editor1-last=Sulis|editor2-first= Irina Nikolaevna |editor2-last=Trofimova|title=Nonlinear Dynamics in the Life and Social Sciences|year=2001|series=NATO Science, Series A: Life Sciences, Vol. 320|publisher=IOS|isbn=978-1-58603-020-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2004 book ''Bioinformatics, Biocomputing and Perl'', authors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry explained how the lie-to-children model may be utilized as a teaching technique for the concepts of [[protein]], [[RNA]], and DNA.&lt;ref name="moorhouse" /&gt; Moorhouse and Barry wrote that the lie-to-children methodology can reduce complex academic notions to a simpler format for basic understanding.&lt;ref name="moorhouse" /&gt; The authors conclude that the lie-to-children teaching technique: "allows the basic features to be understood without confusing things by considering exceptions and enhancements."&lt;ref name="moorhouse"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael|last1=Moorhouse|first2=Paul|last2=Barry|year=2004|pages=4–6|title=Bioinformatics Biocomputing and Perl: An Introduction to Bioinformatics Computing Skills and Practice|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-85331-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Haroom Kharem and Genevieve Collura were critical of the teaching practice, in a contribution to the 2010 book ''Teaching Bilingual/Bicultural Children''.&lt;ref name="kharem"&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|title=Teaching Bilingual/Bicultural Children: Teachers Talk about Language and Learning |chapter=Chapter Seventeen: Teachers Rethinking Their Pedagogical Attitudes in the Bicultural/Bilingual Classroom|pages=152–155|first1=Haroom|last1=Kharem|first2=Genevieve|last2=Collura|editor1-first=Lourdes Diaz|editor1-last= Soto|editor2-first=Haroon|editor2-last=Kharem|series=Counterpoints (Book 371)|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-0718-4|jstor=42980693|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors wrote that using this teaching method was a form of disrespect for the truth.&lt;ref name="kharem" /&gt; Kharem and Collura lament that rather than imparting truth to children, "a pedagogy of stupidification is promoted in which teachers imbue students with untruths and then wonder why education has problems.

[[North Eastern Hill University]] [[economics]] professor Sudhanshu K.

Writing for ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2015, [[physics]] [[professor]] and [[science journalist]] [[Chad Orzel]] explained the concept: "Lies-to-children are not strictly true, but they’re simplified in a way that makes them easier to grasp for children, and provide a framework that allows for future elaboration."&lt;ref name="orzel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/11/03/the-scientific-method-is-a-myth-long-live-the-scientific-method|accessdate=26 February 2016|work=[[Forbes]]|title='The Scientific Method' Is A Myth, Long Live The Scientific Method|first=Chad|last=Orzel|authorlink=Chad Orzel|date=3 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112005555/http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/11/03/the-scientific-method-is-a-myth-long-live-the-scientific-method/|archivedate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orzel praised the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] initiative ''Understanding Science'' for its strategy of going beyond a simple explanation of the [[scientific method]] in a lie-to-children format, and instead going into more depth and specifics to directly inform others on how science impacts their daily quality of living.&lt;ref name="orzel" /&gt;

British writer [[Tim Worstall]] expounded upon the lie-to-children phenomenon in education, in a 2015 article for ''Forbes''.&lt;ref name="worstall" /&gt; He wrote: "that’s what Terry Pratchett pointed out education was: lies to children to help them make some sense of the world. When they become older, more capable of nuance, then we point this out to them: those previous stories were gross simplifications and now you need to know the caveats."&lt;ref name="worstall" /&gt; Worstall stressed that this form of educational methodology was ubiquitous across multiple academic disciplines: "This is true of any form of education by the way. We don’t start music classes with atonality, we start with simple scales. We don’t do syncopation until we’ve mastered 2/4 and 4/4. Einstein’s corrections at the margin to Newton come quite late in a physics education."&lt;ref name="worstall"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Worstall|authorlink=Tim Worstall|accessdate=28 February 2016|work=[[Forbes]]|title=To Prove Econ 101 Is Wrong You Do Need To Understand Econ 101|date=25 November 2015|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/11/25/to-prove-econ-101-is-wrong-you-do-need-to-understand-econ-101|archivedate=11 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211163351/http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/11/25/to-prove-econ-101-is-wrong-you-do-need-to-understand-econ-101/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MedicalExaminerVan.jpg|right|thumb|Medical examiner van]]

A '''medical examiner''' is a person trained in medicine or a medical organization that investigates deaths and injuries that occur under unusual or suspicious circumstances, to perform [[post-mortem]] examinations, and in some jurisdictions to initiate [[inquest]]s.&lt;ref name=CvM&gt;{{cite web|title=Coroner vs. medical examiner|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/examiner.html|website=Visible Proofs|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical examiners, [[coroner]]s and [[forensic pathologist]]s are often thought to be the same, but they are different professions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/medical-examiner/|title=Forensic Medical Examiner Jobs in Forensic Criminal Investigations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}} Coroners have a completely different role as well as having differing responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some parts of the United States, unlike a medical examiner or forensic pathologist, coroners are elected officials and may not require the extensive medical training that the former must go through.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Job roles==
A medical examiner's duties may vary depending on location. The medical examiners’ job is usually extensive and has a lot that goes into it. Typically, a medical examiner's duties may include:

* investigating human organs like the stomach, liver, brain,
* determining cause of death,
* examining the condition of the body&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* studying tissue, organs, cells, and bodily fluids&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* issuing [[death certificates]],
* maintaining [[Death Records|death records]],
* responding to deaths in mass disasters,
* working closely with [[law enforcement]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/forensic-science/forensic-pathologist/|title=Forensic Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* identifying unknown dead, or
* performing other functions depending on local law.

In some [[jurisdictions]],  a [[coroner]] performs these and other duties. It’s not uncommon for a medical examiner to visit [[crime scene]]s or to testify in [[court]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This takes a certain amount of confidence in which the medical examiner has to rely on their expertise to make a true [[testimony]] and accurately testify the facts of their findings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Medical examiners specialize in [[Forensic science|forensic]] knowledge and rely on this during their work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to studying [[cadaver]]s, they are also trained in [[toxicology]], DNA technology and [[forensic serology]] (blood analysis).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pulling from each area of knowledge, a medical examiner can accurately determine a cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This information can help law enforcement crack a case and is crucial to their ability to track criminals in the event of a [[homicide]] or other related events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Within the United States, there is a mixture of coroner and medical examiner systems, and in some states, [[Dual systems model|dual systems]].  The requirements to hold office vary widely between jurisdictions.

==Qualifications==

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|formal medical training]] is required for medical examiners. Many employers also request training in [[pathology]] while others do not. In the UK, a medical examiner is always a medically trained professional, whereas a [[Coroner#England and Wales|coroner]] is a [[judicial officer]].

Pilot studies in Sheffield and seven other areas, which involved medical examiners looking at more than 27,000 deaths since 2008, found 25% of hospital death certificates were inaccurate and 20% of causes of death were wrong. [[Suzy Lishman]], president of the [[Royal College of Pathologists]], said it was crucial there was "independent scrutiny of causes of death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical examiners help expose patient safety risks|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-medical-examiners-help-expose-patient-safety-risks/5081968.article#.VP9HiPzkdc4|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Qualifications for medical examiners in the US vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  In Wisconsin, for example, some counties do not require individuals to have any special educational or medical training to hold this office.&lt;ref&gt;Coroners and Medical Examiners: A Comparison of Options Offered by Both Systems in Wisconsin Jenifer Keach, Rock (WI) County Coroner, April 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In most jurisdictions, a medical examiner is required to have a [[medical degree]], although in many this need not be in pathology. Other jurisdictions have stricter requirements, including additional education in [[pathology]], law, and [[forensic pathology]]. Medical examiners are typically appointed officers.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, (2009), pp 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In the United States, the road to becoming a medical examiner is a long and hard one. They require a lot of extensive training in order to become experts in their field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After high school, the additional schooling may take 11–18 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They must attend a [[college]] or [[university]] to receive a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor’s degree]] in the sciences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Biology]] is usually the most common.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/Medical_Examiner_How_to_Become_a_Medical_Examiner_in_5_Steps.html|title=How to Become a Medical Examiner in 5 Steps|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, it takes four years to complete a bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A medical degree (Doctor of Medicine, MD) is required to become a medical examiner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forensicsciencecareers.net/medical-examiner.html|title=Medical Examiner - Forensic Science Careers|work=Forensic Science Careers|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To prepare for medical school, the [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] (Medical College Admissions Test) must be taken and passed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Medical school]] is another four years with the first two dedicated to academics and the rest of the two used to gain [[clinic]]al experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additional training is required after medical school. The first step is to complete pathological forensic training.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This usually consists of anatomic and clinical pathology training which takes anywhere from four to five years to complete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After this, an anatomic pathology [[residency (medicine)|residency]] and/or a [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in forensic pathology should be completed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before practicing, they must also become certified through the [[American Board of Pathology]];&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this certificate is good for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learningpath.org/articles/Becoming_a_Medical_Examiner_Salary_Info_Job_Description.html|title=Becoming a Medical Examiner: Salary Info &amp; Job Description|website=learningpath.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job outlook ==
The general job outlook for medical examiners in the United States is considered to be excellent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Salary varies greatly by state and location, but it is estimated to average between $105,000 and $500,000 a year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==In popular culture==

'''Medical humanities''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[medicine]] which includes the [[humanities]] ([[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[literature]] and [[religion]]), [[social science]] ( [[psychology]], [[sociology]],[[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[health geography]]) and the [[arts]] ([[literature]], [[theater]], [[film]], and [[visual arts]]) and their application to [[medical education]] and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aull |first=Felice |title=Medical Humanities |url=http://medhum.med.nyu.edu |work=Medical Humanities Community |publisher=New York University School of Medicine |accessdate=25 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518130445/http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/ |archivedate=May 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core strengths of the medical humanities are the imaginative nonconformist qualities and practices.&lt;ref name="Kirklin 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirklin|first=D|title=The Centre for Medical Humanities, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, England.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=October 2003|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1048–53|pmid=14534108|doi=10.1097/00001888-200310000-00023}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Medical humanities is mainly concerned with training medical practitioners. This contrasts with [[health humanities]] which more broadly links health and social care disciplines with the arts and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Medical humanities can be defined as an interdisciplinary, and increasingly international endeavor that draws on the creative and intellectual strengths of diverse disciplines, including literature, art, creative writing, drama, film, music, philosophy, ethical decision making, anthropology, and history, in pursuit of medical educational goals.&lt;ref name="Kirklin 2003"/&gt; The humanistic sciences are relevant when multiple people’s perspectives on issues are compiled together to answer questions or even create questions. The arts can provide additional perspective to the sciences.

Critical medical humanities is an approach which argues that the arts and humanities have more to offer to healthcare than simply improving medical education. It proposes that the arts and humanities offer different ways of thinking about human history, culture, behaviour and experience which can be used to dissect, critique and influence healthcare practices and priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Viney |first=William |last2=Callard |first2=Felicity |last3=Woods |first3=Angela |date=2015-06-01 |title=Critical medical humanities: embracing entanglement, taking risks |url=http://mh.bmj.com/content/41/1/2 |journal=Medical Humanities |language=en |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=2–7 |doi=10.1136/medhum-2015-010692 |issn=1473-4265 |pmc=4484495 |pmid=26052111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-the-edinburgh-companion-to-the-critical-medical-humanities.html |title=The Edinburgh Companion to the Critical Medical Humanities |website=Edinburgh University Press Books |language=en |access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==
Medical books, pictures, and diagrams help medical students build an appreciation for anything in the medical field from the human body to diseases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahlzen|first=Rolf|date=2007|title=Medical humanities - arts and humanistic science|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11019-007-9081-3|journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy|doi=10.1007/s11019-007-9081-3|volume=10|pages=385–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical humanities can assist medical practitioners with viewing issues from more than one perspective, such as the [[visual arts]] and [[Visual culture|culture]] are supposed to do. Both patients and doctors/medical professionals deal with facing decision-making. Each person’s perspective of [[medical ethics]] is different from one another due to different cultures, religions, societies, and traditions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiapperino|first=Luca|last2=Boniolo|first2=Giovanni|date=December 2014 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=377–387 |title=Rethinking Medical Humanities |pmid=24477428 |journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|doi=10.1007/s10912-014-9269-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humanities also assist and attempt to create a closer or more meaningful relationship between [[medical practitioners]] and their peers/patients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ethics are perceived differently from person to person, so answering ethical questions requires the viewpoints of several different people who may have different opinions of what is right from wrong.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Bioethics ===

The first category is [[bioethics]], which includes the morals of healthcare. As science and technology develop, so does healthcare and medicine, and there is discussion and debate in society and healthcare committees that go over the ethics of these certain situations that pertain to medical humanities. For example, one of these cases involves the practice of [[Human enhancement|body enhancements]] in which the ethics of this practice are questioned due to the fact that bio-medical and technological practices are making changes to a person’s body to improve the body and/or its appearance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://mh.bmj.com/content/early/2015/08/10/medhum-2015-010718.full|title=Enhancement, ethics and society: towards an empirical research agenda for the medical humanities and social sciences|last1=Pickersgill|first1=Martyn |last2=Hogle |first2=Linda |date=10 August 2015 |journal=Medical Humanities |doi=10.1136/medhum-2015-010718 |volume=41 |pages=136–142|pmc=4717454}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical ethics ===

The second category in ethics of the medical humanities is clinical ethics, which refers to the respect that healthcare professionals have for patients and families, and this helps develop a sort of professionalism, respectability, and expertise that healthcare professionals must use in respect to their patients.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Another example in the ethics of the medical humanities is bias people and society have against others with [[Disability|disabilities]], and how these disabilities correlate with success or what the disabled person is able to do.  It is unethical to judge or assume the incapability of a disabled person because disabled people are able to find ways to become successful through modern technology and even through self-determination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=22377079|title=Medical Humanities, Ethics, and Disability|last=Vertrees|first=Stephanie|date=April 2012|publisher=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|doi=10.1017/S0963180111000764|volume=21|journal=Camb Q Healthc Ethics|pages=260–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academic institutions offer courses of study in the ethics of medical humanities. These programs help their students learn professionalism in the medical field so that they may respectfully help their patients and do what it is right in any situation that may arise.

===Literature and medicine===
Formerly called medicine in literature, literature and medicine is an interdisciplinary subfield of the medical humanities considered a "dialogue rather than a merger" between the literary and the medical. Literature and medicine is flourishing in undergraduate programs&lt;ref&gt;Health Humanities Programs in the United States, Hiram College, The Center for Literature and Medicine. (March 2016) http://www.hiram.edu/centers-of-distinction/litmed/baccalaureate-health-humanities&lt;/ref&gt; and in medical schools at all levels. The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine-Hershey was the first to introduced literature into a medical school curriculum when Joanne Trautmann (Banks), an English professor, was appointed to a position in literature there in 1972. The rationale for using literature and medicine in medical education is three-fold: reading the stories of patients and writing about their experiences gives doctors in training the tools they need to better understand their patients; discussing and reflecting on literature brings the medical practitioner's biases and assumptions into focus, heightening awareness; and reading literature requires critical thinking and empathetic awareness about moral issues in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Anne Hunsaker and Marilyn Chandler McEntrye.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7251">'''Multimedia Studies''' is an interdisciplinary field of academic discourse focused on the understanding of technologies and cultural dimensions of linking traditional media sources with ones based on new media to support social systems.

==History==
Multimedia Studies as a discipline came out of the need for media studies to be made relevant to the new world of CD-ROMs and [[hypertext]] in the 1990s. Revolutionary books like Jakob Nielsen's 'Hypertext and Hypermedia' book lay the foundations for understanding multimedia alongside traditional cognitive science and interface design issues.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J. (1990). Hypertext and Hypermedia. Saunders College Publishing/Harcourt Brace. {{ISBN|0125184107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software like [[Adobe Authorware|Authorware Attain]], now owned by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], made the design of multimedia systems accessible to those unskilled in programming and became major applications by the end of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Schifman, R.S. (1999). The Ultimate Authorware Tutorial. Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|3540641238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent Challenges===
The Internet age that has been growing since the launch of [[Windows 98]] has brought new challenges for the discipline including developing new models and rules for the World Wide Web. Areas such as usability have had to develop specific guidelines for Website design&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J. &amp; Tahir, M. (2001). Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed. {{ISBN|073571102X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and traditional concepts like genre, narrative theory, and stereotypes have had to be updated to take account of Cyberculture.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S.C., Scheidt, L.A. ;  Bonus, S. ;  Wright, E. (2004). Bridging the gap: a genre analysis of Weblogs. In: Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.M. (2001). Unsolicited Narratives from the Internet: A Rich Source of Qualitative Data. Qual Health Res 11 (5), 706-714&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural aspects of Multimedia Studies have been conceptualised by authors such as [[Lev Manovich]],&lt;ref name="Manovich 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last= Manovich |first= Lev |authorlink= Lev Manovich |editor= Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Nick Montfort |title= The New Media Reader |format= PDF |accessdate= 6 May 2007 |year= 2003 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |pages= 13–25 |chapter= New Media from Borges to HTML |chapterurl= http://mrl.nyu.edu/~noah/nmr/book_samples/nmr-intro-manovich-excerpt.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061210054445/http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/~noah/nmr/book_samples/nmr-intro-manovich-excerpt.pdf |archivedate= 10 December 2006 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manovich 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= Manovich |first= Lev | authorlink= Lev Manovich |title= The Language of a New Media |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-63255-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] and [[Fred Forest]].&lt;ref name="Macek 2005"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Forest, Fred| title = Pour un art actuel, l'art à l'heure d'Internet | date = | url = http://www.fredforest.org/artactuel/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in [[Troll (Internet)|Internet trolling]] and so-called [[Internet addiction]] has thrown up new problems. Concepts like emotional design &lt;ref&gt;Norman, D.A. (2005). Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and affective computing &lt;ref&gt;Picard, R. (2000). Affective Computing. MIT Press. {{ISBN|0262661152}}&lt;/ref&gt; are driving Multimedia Studies research to consider ways of becoming more seductive and able to take account of the different needs of users.

====Media Studies 2.0====
Some academics, such as [[David Gauntlett]], have preferred the neologism, 'Media Studies 2.0' to Multimedia Studies, in order to give it the feel of other fields like [[Web 2.0]] and Classroom 2.0.&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;British Film Institute, [http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/mediastudies2007/ Media Studies Conference 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107113722/http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/mediastudies2007/ |date=2007-11-07 }}, 4–6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;[http://www.transformingaudiences.org.uk Transforming Audiences International Conference], 6–7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AR2"&gt;Andy Ruddock (2008), [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00040.x 'Media Studies 2.0? Binge Drinking and Why Audiences Still Matter'], ''Sociology Compass'', Volume 2 Issue 1 Page 1-15, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GL"&gt;[http://www.rickinstrell.co.uk/GeoffLealand.ppt 'Towards a Brave New World? The Media Studies 2.0 Debate'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003185242/http://www.rickinstrell.co.uk/GeoffLealand.ppt |date=2011-10-03 }}, presentation by Geoff Lealand, University of Waikato, at AMES conference, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;[http://twopointzeroforum.blogspot.com/ Blog/forum about Media Studies 2.0] by William Merrin&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Media Studies 2.0 neologism has received strong criticism. Andy Medhurst at Sussex University for instance wrote of the Media Studies 2.0 neologism introduced by David Gauntlett, 'Isn't it odd that whenever someone purportedly identifies a new paradigm, they see themselves as already a leading practitioner of it?'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13480">'''Naturalistic pantheism''' is a kind of [[pantheism]]. It has been used in various ways such as to relate [[God]] or divinity with concrete things,&lt;ref&gt;Ethical and Religious Thought in Analytic Philosophy of Language by Quentin Smith, 1998, Yale University Press, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; determinism,&lt;ref name="Tillich"&gt;Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries by [[Paul Tillich]], Mark K. Taylor, Mark Lewis Taylor, Collins, 1987, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; or the substance of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="Panentheism"&gt;Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers, John W. Cooper, Baker Academic, 2006, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; God, from these perspectives, is seen as the aggregate of all unified natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Lectures on Divine Humanity by Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov, Lindisfarne Press, 1995, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has often been associated with the philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=Marvin&gt;''The history of European philosophy: an introductory book'' by Walter Taylor Marvin, Macmillan Company, 1917, p.&amp;nbsp;325: “Naturalistic pantheism had already made its appearance in the sixteenth century and most notably in the writings of Giordano Bruno; but its most famous teacher was the seventeenth century philosopher Benedict Spinoza.”&lt;/ref&gt; although academics differ on how it is used.

==Component definitions==
The term “pantheism" is derived from Greek words ''pan'' (Greek: πᾶν) meaning "all" and ''theos'' (θεός) meaning God. It was coined by [[Joseph Raphson]] in his work ''De spatio reali'', published in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Thomson]]; ''Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment'', 2008, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to English by Irish writer [[John Toland]] in his 1705 work ''Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist'' that described pantheism as the "opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe."&lt;ref name=Toland&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Toland: the father of modern pantheism|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/toland.htm|work=Pantheist History|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "naturalistic" derives from the word "[[Naturalism (disambiguation)|naturalism]]", which has several meanings in philosophy and aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;A Dictionary of Philosophy, ed. T. Mautner, Blackwell, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy the term frequently denotes the view that everything belongs to the world of nature and can be studied with the methods appropriate for studying that world, ''i.e.'' the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy, ed. Ted Honderich, Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It generally implies an absence of belief in supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;

==Early conceptions==
[[Joseph Needham]], a modern British scholar of Chinese philosophy and science, has identified [[Taoism]] as "a naturalistic pantheism which emphasizes the unity and spontaneity of the operations of Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 2, Joseph Needham, Cambridge University Press, 1956, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy can be dated to the late 4th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, Russell. ''Taoism: The Enduring Tradition.'' (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). p. 61. {{ISBN|978-0-415-26321-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hellenistic Greek philosophical school of [[Stoicism]] (which started in the early 3rd century BCE)&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]] idea of the separate ideal/conscious and material realms, and identified the substance of God with the entire cosmos and heaven.&lt;ref name="Panentheism" /&gt; However, not all philosophers who did so can be classified as naturalistic pantheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=John W.|title=Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|year=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|page=16|quote=Naturalistic pantheism anticipates Bruno, Spinoza, Toland, Einstein (not Schelling, Hegel) defining God in terms of Nature should not be construed as naturalistic pantheism. By "Nature" Eriugena means something like "Reality" rather than the mere physical universe. "But his position is in fact closer to the naturalistic pantheism of ancient Stoicism. The World-Soul is not a higher reality that generates the physical world but the rational causal agent immanent in the world"...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern conceptions==
Naturalistic pantheism was expressed by various thinkers,&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt; including [[Giordano Bruno]], who was burned at the stake for his views.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, William (prof. of philosophy at the Catholic University), "History of Philosophy", 1903, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 17th century Dutch philosopher Spinoza became particularly known for it.&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt;

===Baruch Spinoza===
{{Main|Philosophy of Spinoza}}
Possibly drawing upon the ideas of Descartes,&lt;ref&gt;Elements of general philosophy By George Croom Robertson, p. 282
:"The pantheistic element in Descartes’ thought viz. the tendency to conceive the notion of substance in the truest sence as being only One, and the naturalistic element, viz. the tendency to conceive the One Substance of God as Order of Nature, were brought together and set in the front of Spinoza’s thought as the mother-idea of it all…Spinoza’s philosophy remains as yet and is likely to remain, the very type of a Naturalistic Pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Spinoza|Baruch Spinoza]] connected God and Nature through the phrase ''deus sive natura'' ("God, or Nature"),&lt;ref&gt;Elements of General Philosophy, George Croom Robertson, John Murray, 1896, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Concise Dictionary of Theology by Gerald O'Collins, Edward G. Farrugia, Paulist Press, 2000, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; making him the father of [[classical pantheism]]. He relied upon rationalism rather than the more intuitive approach of some Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophies of History: Meeting of East and West in Cycle-pattern ... Grace Edith Cairns, 1962
:This attitude is close to that of Spinoza's naturalistic pantheism in the West although Spinoza reached it by the more characteristically Western method, rationalism, versus the intuitive way of the Taoists&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's philosophy, sometimes known as [[Spinozism]], has been understood in a number of ways, and caused disagreements such as the [[Pantheism controversy]]. However, many scholars have considered it to be a form of naturalistic pantheism. This has included viewing the pantheistic unity as natural.&lt;ref name=Pafumi&gt;{{cite book|last=Pafumi|first=G.R.|title=Is Our Vision of God Obsolete|year=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=1441590404|page=153|quote=Spinoza = naturalistic pantheism — universe as a "single, interconnected, and solely natural substance."}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Others focus on the deterministic aspect of naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tillich|first=Paul|title=Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries|year=1987|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=9780800634032|page=165|edition=1. Fortress Press|author2=Taylor, Mark Kline|quote=Naturalistic pantheism "denies finite freedom" as in Spinoza (as opposed to idealistic type of pantheism which identifies God with the universal essence of being)...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian philosophy, God: being a contribution to a philosophy of theism by John Thomas Driscoll, Benzinger 1904, p. 190
:“In the criticism of his system we meet with the same difficulties that we find in Spinoza, i.e., the nature of the mind and of matter, the character of their interaction and the doctrine of determinism. Both Spinoza and Spencer teach a pure Naturalism … The two theories set forth are phases of Realistic or Naturalistic Pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
Spinoza inspired a number of other pantheists, with varying degrees of idealism towards nature.&lt;ref&gt;
Goethe, Nietzsche, And Wagner: Their Spinozan Epics of Love And Power by T. K. Seung, p. 11
:“The second function of the Earth Spirit was to clarify Goethe’s own version of pantheism. With the revival of Spinoza’s philosophy, naturalistic pantheism became a groundswell for the German intellectuals of Goethe’s generation. Although they rejected the other world, many of them subscribed to an idealistic or Romantic view of Nature, which Goethe regarded as an unreal view of reality…”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The five great skeptical dramas of history by John Owen (theologian), 1896, p. 13
:“If he could be said to have owned a master of philosophy it was Spinoza. Of none other does he speak in such terms of commendation … In all probability Spinoza found his greatest disciple on the road to a naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spinoza's influence in his own time was limited.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Ethics by Adolf Wuttke (theologian), 1876, p. 289, p. 327
:“Spinoza exerted in his own age but little influence. Notwithstanding the deep spiritually-moral declension of that dark period, the religious God-consciousness was as yet too vital to fall in with this naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press... Page 5
:"the naturalistic pantheism he then or somewhat later learned from Spinoza"&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have considered Spinoza the founder of a line of naturalistic pantheism, though not necessarily the only one.&lt;ref&gt;Nothingness in the theology of Paul Tillich and Karl Barth by Sung Min Jeong University Press of America, 2003, p. 24
:"Spinoza establishes a naturalistic pantheism. Tillich considers Spinoza’s substance as a category"...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Finger Thomas (prof of religious thought), "Philosophy and religious belief", 1970, p. 92
:"..two forms of pantheism we have distinguished, idealistic monism and naturalistic pantheism. Here we shall consider only the naturalistic pantheism we have been describing, especially that of Spinoza."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;The riddle of the universe by Edward Douglas, London: Fawcett, 1893, p. 30
:"Spinoza carried philosophy into the realms of a naturalistic pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
In 1705 the Irish writer [[John Toland]] endorsed a form of pantheism in which the God-soul is identical with the material universe.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Materialism in Eighteenth-Century European Thought" in New Dictionary of the History of Ideas, 2005, ed. Peter Machamer and Francesca di Poppa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Middle Works of John Dewey, Volume 2, SIU Press, 1976, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

German naturalist [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919&lt;ref&gt;"Ernst Haeckel – Britannica Concise" (biography), ''Encyclopædia Britannica Concise'', 2006, Concise. Britannica.com webpage: [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9366404/Ernst-Haeckel CBritannica-Haeckel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111013059/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9366404/Ernst-Haeckel |date=2006-11-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;) proposed a monistic pantheism in which the idea of God is identical with that of nature or substance.&lt;ref&gt;The Presbyterian and reformed review, Volume 7, Anson D.F. Randolph, 1896, p217&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pantheist Movement]], started in 1999, describes Naturalistic Pantheism as including reverence for the universe, [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[metaphysical naturalism|strong naturalism]], and respect for reason and the scientific method as methods of understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is your spiritual home right here on Earth?|url=http://www.pantheism.net|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] considers its position the closest modern equivalent to Toland's.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20086">'''New Philology''' generally refers to a branch of Mexican [[ethnohistory]] and [[philology]] that uses colonial-era native language texts written by Indians to construct history from the indigenous point of view. The name New Philology was coined by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] to describe work that he and his doctoral students and scholarly collaborators in history, anthropology, and linguistics had pursued since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Lockhart published a great many essays elaborating on the concept and content of the New Philology and [[Matthew Restall]] published a description of it in the ''Latin American Research Review.''&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques of the New Philology have also been applied in other disciplines such as European [[medieval]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Driscoll, "[http://www.driscoll.dk/docs/words.html The words on the page: Thoughts on philology, old and new]", in: ''Creating the medieval saga: Versions, variability, and editorial interpretations of Old Norse saga literature,'' edited by Judy Quinn &amp; Emily Lethbridge. Syddansk Universitetsforlag, Odense 2010, pp. 85–102.&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
==Historical Development==
Lockhart's discusses philology and in particular the new philology in an essay for a collection of essays hosted digitally at University of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: Background and Course of the New Philology" ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest [[Mesoamerican]] Ethnohistory'', Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the new philology was built upon the foundation of the old, which focuses on close reading of texts and resulted in collections of printed documentation. An important nineteenth-century Mexican philologist was [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]].  In Mexico and Latin America, nineteenth-century scholars mined the Spanish archives for colonial documentation for their national histories. A feature of the New Philology is that the publication of indigenous texts in the original language with translations with introductions was standard.  The translated texts often appeared first, followed by a separate scholarly monograph analyzing the texts. The two should be considered two parts of the same scholarly publication. Many of the scholars working in the New Philology did so before it gained that designation.  A particularly valuable online publication are essays where individual scholars discuss the process and product of translating and publishing particular native language documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Philology was developed from the 1970s and onwards, building on the work of a previous generation of scholars, most especially historian [[Charles Gibson]], whose ''Aztecs under Spanish Rule'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&gt;'' Charles Gibson, 1964 Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and his earlier ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)&lt;ref&gt;''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' Charles Gibson, 1952. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; were major scholarly achievements, placing colonial-era Aztecs (now more commonly called [[Nahuas]]) at the center of historical analysis. The leading figure in the establishment of the New Philological historiographical approach was [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] who, in the early 1970s, began learning Nahuatl and studying local level indigenous sources in the [[Nahuatl language]]. His magnum opus was published in 1992, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuas After the Conquest: Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, sixteenth through eighteenth centuries,'' James Lockhart, 1992. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporated and extended his own work and that of others.

An early and important text in this vein was ''Nahuatl in the Middle Years'' (1976), published by Lockhart and University of Texas linguist [[Frances Karttunen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period'', Frances Karttunen &amp; James Lockhart, 1976, University of California Press, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important for the early history of the New Philology was the publication of ''Beyond the Codices'' (1976), alluding to the existence of native language texts other than the formal ones termed codices.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Codices'' [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], Frances Berdan, and James Lockhart, 1976. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], a leading figure in Mesoamerican ethnohistory for his collaboration with [[Charles Dibble]] in publishing an English translation of the [[Florentine Codex]] by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], participated in this early project of publishing local-level colonial documents.

In the mid-1970s Lockhart began mentoring history doctoral students at UCLA, who learned Nahuatl and began research on particular region documentation in Nahuatl. Sarah Cline was the first to complete a dissertation in 1981, based on these types of local-level sources, a set of 60 testaments from the central Mexican Indian polity or ''altepetl'' of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacán]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Testaments of Culhuacan''. S.L. Cline and Miguel Leon-Portilla (Eds.) 1984. UCLA Latin American Center Nahuatl Studies Series, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Culhuacan, 1580-1600: A Social History of an Aztec Town'', S.L. Cline, 1986. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Testaments of Culhuacan, Sarah Cline. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 Cline also published a set of early local-level Nahuatl censuses from the Cuernavaca, as ''The Book of Tributes'', as well as an analysis of all three volumes, adding to the existing published corpus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Tributes: Early Sixteenth-Century Nahuatl Censuses from Morelos''. S. L. Cline, 1993, Museo de Antropología e Historia, Archivo Histórico Collección Antigua, vol. 549. UCLA Latin American Center Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of Tributes", Sarah Cline, ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Azteckischer Zensus, Zur indianischen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Marquesado um 1540: Aus dem "Libro de Tributos" (Col. Ant. Ms. 551) im Archivo Historico,'' Mexico. 2 vols. Eike Hinz, Claudine Hartau, and Marie Luise Heimann-Koenen, eds. 1983. Hanover.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first generation Robert Haskett, who examined Nahuatl texts on colonial Cuernavaca, later also publishing on primordial titles.&lt;ref&gt;''Indigenous Rulers: An Ethnohistory of Indian Town Government in Colonial Cuernavaca'', Robert Haskett, 1991, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Primordial Titles", Robert Haskett. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Schroeder delved into the rich texts produced by seventeenth-century Nahua historian, Chimalpahin, resulting in several publications &lt;ref&gt;''Chimalpahin and the Kingdoms of Chalco'', 1991, Susan Schroeder, Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Chimalpahin: Society and Politics in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco, Texcoco, Culhuacan, and other Nahua Altetpetl in Central Mexico.'' Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuantzin, Arthur J.O. Anderson, Susan Schroeder, Wayne Ruwet. 1997. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of His Time: Don Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Quahtlehuantzin''James Lockhart, Susan Schroeder, and Doris Namala.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Annals of Chimalpahin", Susan Schroeder. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of local-level indigenous documents, such as testaments and bills of sale, are in Nahuatl, resulting in Nahuatl having the largest set of published sets of documents and monographic scholarly analyses. Rebecca Horn's dissertation on Coyoacan and later Stanford University Press monograph showed the multiple connections between Nahuas and Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;''Postconquest Coyoacan: Nahua-Spanish Relations in the Valley of Mexico.'' Rebecca Horn, 1997. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nahuatl and Spanish Sources for Coyoacan", Rebecca Horn. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Horn also served as associate editor of the UCLA Latin American Center's Nahuatl Studies Series.

Some UCLA later doctoral students of Lockhart, particularly [[Matthew Restall]] and Kevin Terraciano, first learned Nahuatl and then other Mesoamerican indigenous languages (Mixtec and Yucatec Maya) that had a significant corpus of documents in the language. Restall's UCLA 1995 dissertation "The World of the Cah: postconquest Yucatec Maya Society" was followed by his 1995 publication of a collection of eighteenth-century wills.&lt;ref&gt;''Life and Death in a Maya Community: The Ixil Testaments of the 1760s.'' Matthew Restall, 1995. Lancaster CA: Labyrinthos&lt;/ref&gt; and culminating in his Stanford University Press monograph, ''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850''. Matthew Restall. 1997, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sources for the Ethnohistory and Afrohistory of Postconquest Yucatan," Matthew Restall.''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Terraciano's 1994 dissertation on the Mixtecs of Oaxaca entitled ''Ñudzahui history: Mixtec writing and culture in colonial Oaxaca'' was followed by his 2001 monograph ''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Ñudzahui History''.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Terraciano,''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Nudzahui History, sixteen through eighteenth centuries''. 2001, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Terraciano and Restall revised the titles of their dissertations in the published monographs to allow better recognition by readers of the publication's subject; Cline used "Aztec" in the title of her monograph on Culhuacan, rather than "Nahua", which in the 1980s had little recognition value even among specialists on Latin American cultures.

Lauren Lambert Jennings explicitly applied techniques from New Philology to the study of European Song texts quoting their "central premise [as] the idea that [[codex]] is not merely a neutral container for its texts." She continued by saying that the New Philologists and scholars of "textual cultures" "posit that a work's meaning (literary and cultural) is determined by the entire manuscript matrix — its physical form, contents, scribe(s), readers, and history."&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Lambert Jennings, "Tracing Voices: Song as Literature in Late Medieval Italy" (Ph.D. dissertation: University of Pennsylvania, 2012), p. 42, online at [https://usc.academia.edu/LaurenJennings/Books/1591293/Tracing_Voices_Song_as_Literature_in_Late_Medieval_Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pennington Biomedical Research Center''', located in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], is a campus of the [[Louisiana State University System]] and conducts clinical, basic, and population science research. The mission is to discover the triggers of chronic diseases through innovative research that improves human health across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; It is the largest academically based nutrition research center in the world, with the greatest number of obesity researchers on faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Reasons to Work at Pennington Biomedical|url=http://www.pbrc.edu/human-resources/reasons/|website=Pennington Biomedical Research Center|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center's over 500 employees occupy several buildings on the {{convert|222|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; The center was designed by the Baton Rouge [[architect]] [[John Desmond]].

== History ==
In 1980, [[Baton Rouge]] oilman and philanthropist C. B. "Doc" Pennington and his wife, Irene, provided $125 million to fund construction of the nutritional research center. With a [[U.S. Department of Defense]] contract and funding from the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority, [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Buddy Roemer]] proclaimed the official opening of the Center in 1988. Dr [[George A. Bray]], a renowned obesity researcher, was recruited to be the first executive director of the center and under his leadership the center reached its present status in the scientific world.

Today, the Pennington Biomedical Research Center houses almost 600 employees, 14 research laboratories, 17 core service laboratories, an inpatient and outpatient clinic, two metabolic chambers, a research kitchen, an administrative area, more than $20 million in technologically advanced equipment, and a team of over 80 scientists and physicians with specialties such as molecular biology, genomics and proteomics, neuroanatomy, exercise physiology, biochemistry, psychology, endocrinology, biostatistics and electrophysiology.

One of the former employees was the late state legislator [[Leonard J. Chabert]] from [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]], the namesake of the Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center in [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelius.com/results.php?ReportType=1&amp;formname=name&amp;qf=Leonard&amp;qmi=J&amp;qn=Chabert&amp;qcs=Houma%2C+LA&amp;focusfirst=1|title=Leonard J. Chabert|publisher=intelius.com|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research programs and labs ==
The comprehensive research program at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center focuses on ten specific research program areas as outlined below. Researchers in these divisions rely on the latest molecular, physiological, clinical, behavioral, and bioinformatics technologies with the ultimate goal of preventing common diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.&lt;ref name=programs&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Programs|url=http://www.pbrc.edu/research-and-faculty/research-programs/|website=Pennington Biomedical Research Center|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[vascular plant]]s, '''phloem''' (''pronunciation'': /ˈfləʊ.əm/) is the living [[biological tissue|tissue]] that transports the soluble organic compounds made during [[photosynthesis]] and known as ''photosynthates'', in particular the sugar [[sucrose]],&lt;ref&gt;

== Structure ==
{{plain image with caption|Phloem cells.svg|Cross section of some phloem cells|440px}}
Phloem tissue consists of conducting cells, generally called sieve elements, [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells, including both specialized companion cells or albuminous cells and unspecialized cells and supportive cells, such as [[fibres]] and [[sclereid]]s.

===Conducting cells (Sieve elements)===
{{main|Sieve tube element}}
[[File:Phloem and Xylem in stem.svg|thumb|simplified phloem and companion cells: {{ordered list |[[Xylem]] |Phloem |[[Cambium]] |Pith |Companion Cells}}]]
Sieve elements are the type of cell that are responsible for transporting sugars throughout the plant.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;   At maturity they lack a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and have very few organelles, so they rely on companion cells or albuminous cells for most of their metabolic needs. Sieve tube cells do contain [[vacuole]]s and other organelles, such as [[ribosome]]s, before they mature, but these generally migrate to the cell wall and dissolve at maturity; this ensures there is little to impede the movement of fluids. One of the few organelles they do contain at maturity is the smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], which can be found at the plasma membrane, often nearby the [[plasmodesmata]] that connect them to their companion or albuminous cells. All sieve cells have groups of pores at their ends that grow from modified and enlarged [[plasmodesmata]], called '''sieve areas'''. The pores are reinforced by platelets of a [[polysaccharide]] called [[callose]].&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;

===Parenchyma cells===
They are of  two types, aerenchyma and chlorenchyma.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Other [[parenchyma]] cells within the phloem are generally undifferentiated and used for food storage.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;

====Companion cells====
The metabolic functioning of sieve-tube members depends on a close association with the ''companion cells'', a specialized form of [[parenchyma]] cell. All of the cellular functions of a sieve-tube element are carried out by the (much smaller) companion cell, a typical nucleate [[plant cell]] except the companion cell usually has a larger number of [[ribosomes]] and [[mitochondria]]. The dense cytoplasm of a companion cell is connected to the sieve-tube element by plasmodesmata.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raven |first=Peter H. |author2=Evert, R.F. |author3=Eichhorn, S.E. |title=Biology of Plants |year=1992 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York, NY, U.S.A. |page=791 |isbn=1-4292-3995-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common sidewall shared by a sieve tube element and a companion cell has large numbers of plasmodesmata.

There are two types of companion cells.
#'''Ordinary companion cells''', which have smooth walls and few or no plasmodesmatal connections to cells other than the sieve tube.
#'''[[Transfer cells]]''', which have much-folded walls that are adjacent to non-sieve cells, allowing for larger areas of transfer. They are specialized in scavenging solutes from those in the cell walls that are actively pumped requiring energy.

====Albuminous cells====
Albuminous cells have a similar role to companion cells, but are associated with  sieve cells only and are hence found only in seedless vascular plants and gymnosperms.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992"/&gt;

===Supportive cells===
Although its primary function is transport of sugars, phloem may also contain cells that have a mechanical support function.  These generally fall into two categories: [[fibres]] and [[sclereid]]s.  Both cell types have a [[secondary cell wall]] and are therefore dead at maturity.  The secondary cell wall increases their rigidity and tensile strength.

====Fibres====
[[Bast fibre]]s are the long, narrow supportive cells that provide [[Tension (physics)|tension]] strength without limiting flexibility.  They are also found in xylem, and are the main component of many textiles such as paper, linen, and cotton.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;

====Sclereids====
[[Sclereid]]s are irregularly shaped cells that add compression strength&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;  but may reduce flexibility to some extent.  They also serve as anti-herbivory structures, as their irregular shape and hardness will increase wear on teeth as the herbivores chews. For example, they are responsible for the gritty texture in pears,and in winter bears

==Function==
Unlike [[xylem]] (which is composed primarily of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport [[Sap (plant)|sap]].  The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in [[sugar]]s made by photosynthesis. These sugars are transported to non-photosynthetic parts of the plant, such as the roots, or into storage structures, such as [[tuber]]s or bulbs.

During the plant's growth period, usually during the spring, storage organs such as the [[root]]s are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks. The movement in phloem is multidirectional, whereas, in xylem cells, it is unidirectional (upward).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

After the growth period, when the [[meristem]]s are dormant, the [[leaf|leaves]] are sources, and storage organs are sinks. Developing [[seed]]-bearing organs (such as [[fruit]]) are always sinks. Because of this multi-directional flow, coupled with the fact that sap cannot move with ease between adjacent sieve-tubes, it is not unusual for sap in adjacent sieve-tubes to be flowing in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canny|first1=MJ|title=Phloem Translocation|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While movement of water and minerals through the xylem is driven by negative pressures (tension) most of the time, movement through the phloem is driven by positive [[hydrostatic pressure]]s. This process is termed ''translocation'', and is accomplished by a process called [[phloem loading]] and ''unloading''.

Phloem sap is also thought to play a role in sending informational signals throughout vascular plants. "Loading and unloading patterns are largely determined by the [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] and number of [[plasmodesmata]] and the position-dependent function of [[Solution|solute]]-specific, [[plasma membrane]] [[transport proteins]]. Recent evidence indicates that mobile proteins and [[RNA]] are part of the plant's long-distance communication signaling system. Evidence also exists for the directed transport and sorting of [[macromolecules]] as they pass through plasmodesmata."&lt;ref name="turgeon2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turgeon|first=Robert |author2=Wolf, Shmuel |title=Phloem Transport: Cellular Pathways and Molecular Trafficking |journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology |year=2009 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092045 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092045?journalCode=arplant |volume=60 |pages=207–21 |pmid=19025382 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic [[molecule]]s such as sugars, [[amino acid]]s, certain [[hormone]]s, and even [[messenger RNA]]s are transported in the phloem through [[sieve tube element]]s.&lt;ref name="turgeon2009" /&gt;

=== Girdling ===
{{main|Girdling}}
Because phloem tubes are located outside the [[xylem]] in most plants, a tree or other plant can be killed by stripping away the bark in a ring on the trunk or stem.  With the phloem destroyed, nutrients cannot reach the roots, and the tree/plant will die.  Trees located in areas with animals such as beavers are vulnerable since beavers chew off the bark at a fairly precise height.  This process is known as girdling, and can be used for agricultural purposes.  For example, enormous fruits and vegetables seen at fairs and carnivals are produced via girdling.  A farmer would place a girdle at the base of a large branch, and remove all but one fruit/vegetable from that branch.  Thus, all the sugars manufactured by leaves on that branch have no [[Carbon dioxide sink|sinks]] to go to but the one fruit/vegetable, which thus expands to many times normal size.

===Origin===
When the plant is an embryo, vascular tissue emerges from procambium tissue, which is at the center of the embryo. Protophloem itself appears in the mid-vein extending into the cotyledonary node, which constitutes the first appearance of a leaf in angiosperms, where it forms continuous strands. The hormone [[auxin]], transported by the protein PIN1 is responsible for the growth of those protophloem strands, signaling the final identity of those tissues. [[SHORTROOT]](SHR), and [[microRNA165]]/[[mir-166 microRNA precursor|166]] also participate in that process, while Callose Synthase 3([[CALS3]]), inhibits the locations where SHORTROOT(SHR), and microRNA165 can go.

In the embryo, root phloem develops independently in the upper hypocotyl, which lies between the embryonic root, and the cotyledon.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, William, et al. The Plant Vascular System: Evolution, Development and Functions. Journal of Integrative Plant Biology. 55, 294-388 (2013) {{PMID|23462277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an adult, the phloem originates, and grows outwards from, [[meristem]]atic cells in the [[vascular cambium]]. Phloem is produced in phases. ''Primary'' phloem is laid down by the [[apical meristem]] and develops from the [[procambium]]. ''Secondary'' phloem is laid down by the vascular cambium to the inside of the established layer(s) of phloem.

In some eudicot families ([[Apocynaceae]], [[Convolvulaceae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], [[Solanaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Thymelaeaceae]]), phloem also develops on the inner side of the vascular cambium; in this case, a distinction between '''external phloem''' and '''internal phloem''' or '''intraxylary phloem''' is made. Internal phloem is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external phloem and protoxylem, though it is not without exceptions. In some other families ([[Amaranthaceae]], [[Nyctaginaceae]], [[Salvadoraceae]]), the cambium also periodically forms inward strands or layers of phloem, embedded in the xylem: Such phloem strands are called '''included phloem''' or '''interxylary phloem'''.&lt;ref&gt;Evert, Ray F. ''Esau's Plant Anatomy''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 2006, pp. 357–358, {{ISBN|0-470-04737-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutritional use==
[[File:Detaching inner bark of pine.jpg|thumb|Stripping the inner bark from a pine branch.]]
Phloem of [[pine]] trees has been used in [[Finland]] as a substitute food in times of [[famine]] and even in good years in the northeast. Supplies of phloem from previous years helped stave off starvation in the [[Finnish famine of 1866-1868|great famine of the 1860s]]. Phloem is dried and milled to flour (''pettu'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and mixed with [[rye]] to form a hard dark bread, [[bark bread]]. The least appreciated was ''silkko'', a bread made only from [[buttermilk]] and ''pettu'' without any real rye or cereal flour. Recently, ''pettu'' has again become available as a curiosity, and some have made claims of health benefits. However, its food energy content is low relative to rye or other cereals.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Phloem from [[silver birch]] has been also used to make flour in the past.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==History==
{{Main|History of printing}}

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[Woodblock printing]] is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a method of printing on [[textiles]] and later on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 A.D.

====In East Asia====
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|left|The intricate frontispiece of the [[Diamond Sutra]] from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China, 868 A.D. ([[British Library]])]]
{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China. They are of silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before 220 A.D.). They are the earliest example of woodblock printing on paper appeared in the mid-seventh century in China.

By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first extant complete printed book containing its date is the [[Diamond Sutra]] ([[British Library]]) of 868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |title=Oneline Gallery: Sacred Texts |publisher=British Library |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110093610/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Tsuen-Hsuin |first1=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Needham |first2=Joseph |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |title=Paper and Printing |series=Science and Civilisation in China |volume=5 part 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=158, 201 |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing spread early to [[Korea]] and Japan, which also used Chinese [[logogram]]s, but the technique was also used in [[Turpan]] and [[Vietnam]] using a number of other scripts. This technique then spread to Persia and Russia.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;[[Thomas Franklin Carter]], ''The Invention of Printing in China and its Spread Westward'', The Ronald Press, NY 2nd ed. 1955, pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was transmitted to Europe via the Islamic world, and by around 1400 was being used on paper for [[old master print]]s and [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayor |first=A Hyatt |title=Prints and People |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=Princeton |volume=5-18 |isbn=0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Arabs never used this to print the [[Quran]] because of the limits imposed by Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

====In the Middle East====
Block printing, called ''tarsh'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], developed in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]] during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and [[amulet]]s. There is some evidence to suggest that these print blocks made from non-wood materials, possibly [[tin]], lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the [[Muslim world]]. Though Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Muslim world, initially for fabric, the technique of metal block printing remained unknown in Europe. Block printing later went out of use in Islamic Central Asia after movable type printing was introduced from China.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), "[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]". ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), p. 427-438.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Europe====
[[File:Saint Christopher 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The earliest known [[woodcut]], 1423, [[Buxheim]], with hand-colouring]]
Block printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing card]]s printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.&lt;!-- This may be supported by the reference - An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}} (recovered from a previous version of this article) --&gt;

Around the mid-fifteenth-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common.  There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of [[movable type]], with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440 and 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movable-type printing===

{{Main|Movable type}}
{{See also|History of Western typography}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of printing and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]]. [[Movable type]] allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.

Around 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by [[Bi Sheng]] out of [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name="Great Chinese Inventions"/&gt; Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing (xylography), which "proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I., ''Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used in large-scale printing of paper money
issued by the Northern Song dynasty. Movable type spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty.

Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing using bronze. The [[Jikji]], published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould, and bronze poured into the mould, and finally the type was polished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean form of metal movable type was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp. 15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;{{cite book |last=Polenz |first=Peter von. |title=Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

===The printing press===
{{main|Printing press}}
Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]], adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer and more absorbent paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinberg |first=S. H. |authorlink=S. H. Steinberg |title=Five Hundred Years of Printing |edition=3rd |year=1974 |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex |isbn=0140203435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, [[tin]], [[antimony]], copper and bismuth – the same components still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 27, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] – entry "printing"&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Gutenberg started work on his [[printing press]] around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69" /&gt;

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page setting and printing using a press was faster and more durable. Also, the metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to [[typography]] and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type for Western languages. The printing press rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[Spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. 
[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Page-setting room - c. 1920]]
Gutenberg's innovations in movable type printing have been called the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg "Man of the Millennium". See also [http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221307/http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html |date=October 12, 2007 }} which was composed by four prominent US journalists in 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotary printing press===
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
The '''rotary printing press''' was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843. It uses impressions curved around a cylinder to print on long continuous rolls of paper or other substrates. Rotary drum printing was later significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]].

==Conventional printing technology==
All printing process are concerned with two kinds of areas on the final output:
# Image Area (printing areas)
# Non-image Area (non-printing areas)

After the information has been prepared for production (the prepress step), each printing process has definitive means of separating the image from the non-image areas.

Conventional printing has four types of process:
# Planographics, in which the printing and non-printing areas are on the same plane surface and the difference between them is maintained chemically or by physical properties, the examples are: offset lithography, collotype, and screenless printing.
# Relief, in which the printing areas are on a plane surface and the non printing areas are below the surface, examples: flexography and letterpress.
# Intaglio, in which the non-printing areas are on a plane surface and the printing area are etched or engraved below the surface, examples: steel die engraving, gravure
# Porous, in which the printing areas are on fine mesh screens through which ink can penetrate, and the non-printing areas are a stencil over the screen to block the flow of ink in those areas, examples: screen printing, stencil duplicator.

===Letterpress===
[[File:Commercial. Le Samedi BAnQ P48S1P03551.jpg|thumb|Miehle press printing Le Samedi journal. [[Montreal]], 1939.]]
{{Main|Letterpress printing}}
'''Letterpress printing''' is a technique of [[relief printing]]. A worker composes and locks [[movable type]] into the bed of a press, [[ink]]s it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper.

Letterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century and [[Global spread of the printing press|remained in wide use for books and other uses]] until the second half of the 20th century, when [[offset printing]] was developed. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.

===Offset===
{{Main|Offset press}}
'''Offset printing''' is a widely used printing technique. Offset printing is where the inked image is transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket. An offset transfer moves the image to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, a process based on the repulsion of oil and water; the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier. So, the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.

Currently, most books and newspapers are printed using the technique of offset lithography.

===Gravure===
{{Main|Rotogravure}}
'''Gravure printing''' is an [[intaglio printing]] technique, where the image being printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or [[laser]] ablation.

Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.

===Other printing techniques===
The other significant printing techniques include:

* [[Flexography]], used for packaging, labels, newspapers
* [[Dye-sublimation printer]]
* [[Inkjet]], used typically to print a small number of books or packaging, and also to print a variety of materials: from high quality papers simulating offset printing, to floor tiles. Inkjet is also used to apply mailing addresses to direct mail pieces
* [[Laser printing]] (toner printing) mainly used in offices and for transactional printing (bills, bank documents). Laser printing is commonly used by direct mail companies to create variable data letters or coupons.
*[[Pad printing]], popular for its unusual ability to print on complex three-dimensional surfaces
*[[Relief print]], mainly used for [[Mail-order catalog|catalogue]]s
*[[Screen-printing]] for a variety of applications ranging from T-shirts to floor tiles, and on uneven surfaces
*[[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], used mainly for high value documents such as currencies.
*[[Thermal printing]], popular in the 1990s for fax printing. Used today for printing labels such as airline baggage tags and individual price labels in supermarket deli counters.

==Impact of German movable type printing press==
===Quantitative aspects===
[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450–1800.png|thumb|European output of books printed by movable type from ca. 1450 to 1800&lt;ref name="Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009"/&gt;]]
{{Main|History of printing}}

It is estimated that following the innovation of Gutenberg's printing press, the European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref name="Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009"&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: "Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–445 (417, table 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious impact===
[[Samuel Hartlib]], who was exiled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that "the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppression".&lt;ref name="Briggs-Burke"&gt;Ref: Briggs, Asa and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Burke, Peter]] (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PrintMus 038.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the Gutenberg press at the [[International Printing Museum]] in Carson, California]]

In the Muslim world, printing, especially in Arabic scripts, was strongly opposed throughout the [[early modern period]], though sometimes printing in [[Hebrew]] or [[Armenian script]] was permitted.  Thus the first movable type printing in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was in Hebrew in 1493.&lt;ref&gt;or soon after; Naim A. Güleryüz, ''Bizans'tan 20. Yüzyıla - Türk Yahudileri'', Gözlem Gazetecilik Basın ve Yayın A.Ş., İstanbul, January 2012, p.90 {{ISBN|978-9944-994-54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an imperial ambassador to [[Istanbul]] in the middle of the sixteenth century, it was a sin for the [[Turkish people|Turks]] to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan [[Selim I]] issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death. At the end of the sixteenth century, Sultan [[Murad III]] permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in [[Arabic]] characters, yet the majority were imported from [[Italy]].  [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]]
established the first press for printing in Arabic in the Ottoman Empire, against opposition from the calligraphers and parts of the [[Ulama]]. It operated until 1742, producing altogether seventeen works, all of which were concerned with non-religious, utilitarian matters.  Printing did not become common in the Islamic world until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, William J., "İbrāhīm Müteferriḳa and Turkish Incunabula", ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'', 1968, volume 88, issue 3, page 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews were banned from German printing [[guild]]s; as a result Hebrew printing sprang up in [[Italy]], beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua. Local rulers had the authority to grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/books/12hebr.html?_r=1 A Lifetime's Collection of Texts in Hebrew, at Sotheby's]", [[Edward Rothstein]], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and many of those printed during this period carry the words 'con licenza de superiori' (indicating their printing having been licensed by the censor) on their title pages.

It was thought that the introduction of the printing medium 'would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.'&lt;ref name="Meyrowitz41"&gt;Meyrowitz: "Mediating Communication: What Happens?" in "Questioning the Media", p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The consequences of printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz&lt;ref name="Meyrowitz41" /&gt; used the example of [[William Carter (martyr)|William Carter]] who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was [[hanging]].

===Social impact===
Print gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print, according to [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] in his lecture ''On the Study of History'' (1895), gave "assurance that the work of the [[Renaissance]] would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the [[Middle Ages]] would never recur, that not an idea would be lost".&lt;ref name="Briggs-Burke" /&gt;
[[File:Press1520.png|thumb|upright|Bookprinting in the 16th century]]
Print was instrumental in changing the nature of reading within society.

[[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] identifies two long-term effects of the invention of printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for knowledge as well as allowing for comparison between incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein in Briggs and Burke, 2002: p21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asa Briggs]] and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] identify five kinds of reading that developed in relation to the introduction of print:
# Critical reading: due to the fact that texts finally became accessible to the general population, critical reading emerged because people were given the option to form their own opinions on texts
# Dangerous Reading: reading was seen as a dangerous pursuit because it was considered rebellious and unsociable especially in the case of women, because reading could stir up dangerous emotions such as love and that if women could read, they could read love notes
# Creative reading: printing allowed people to read texts and interpret them creatively, often in very different ways than the author intended
# Extensive Reading: print allowed for a wide range of texts to become available, thus, previous methods of intensive reading of texts from start to finish, began to change and with texts being readily available, people began reading on particular topics or chapters, allowing for much more extensive reading on a wider range of topics
# Private reading: became linked to the rise of individualism because before print, reading was often a group event, where one person would read to a group of people and with print, literacy rose as did availability of texts, thus reading became a solitary pursuit

The invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. [[Printer (publisher)|Printers]] emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, although the much more labour-intensive occupation of the [[scribe]] naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the amount of [[bookselling|booksellers]] and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.

=== Educational Impact ===
Gutenberg's printing press had profound impacts on universities as well. Universities were influenced in their "language of scholarship, libraries, curriculum, [and] pedagogy" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modie|first=G|date=2014|title=Gutenberg’s Effects on Universities|url=|journal=History of Education|volume=43 |issue=4|pages=17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The language of Scholarship ====
Before the invention of the printing press, most written material was in Latin. However, after the invention of printing the number of books printed expanded as well as the vernacular. Latin was not replaced completely, but remained an international language until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== University Libraries ====
At this time, universities began establishing accompanying libraries. "Cambridge made the chaplain responsible for the library in the fifteenth century but this position was abolished in 1570 and in 1577 Cambridge established the new office of university librarian. Although, the University of Leuven did not see a need for a university library based on the idea that professor were the library. Libraries also began receiving so many books from gifts and purchases that they began to run out of room. This issue was solved, however, by a man named Merton (1589) who decided books should be stacked horizontally on shelves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Curriculum ====
The printed press changed university libraries in many ways. Professors were finally able to compare the opinions of different authors rather than being forced to look at only one or two specific authors. Textbooks themselves were also being printed in different levels of difficulty, rather than just one introductory text being made available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Digital printing==
By 2005, [[Digital printing]] accounts for approximately 9% of the 45 trillion pages printed annually around the world.&lt;ref name="vj_ipg2-0_keynote"&gt;"[http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html When 2% Leads to a Major Industry Shift] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032849/http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html |date=February 16, 2008 }}" Patrick Scaglia, August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing at home, an office, or an engineering environment is subdivided into:
*small format (up to ledger size paper sheets), as used in business offices and libraries
*wide format (up to 3' or 914mm wide rolls of paper), as used in drafting and design establishments.

Some of the more common printing technologies are:

*[[blueprint]] – and related chemical technologies
*[[daisy wheel]] – where pre-formed characters are applied individually
*[[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix]] – which produces arbitrary patterns of dots with an array of printing studs
*[[line printer|line printing]] – where formed characters are applied to the paper by lines
*[[thermal printer|heat transfer]] – such as early fax machines or modern receipt printers that apply heat to special paper, which turns black to form the printed image
*[[inkjet]] – including bubble-jet, where ink is sprayed onto the paper to create the desired image
*[[electrophotography]] – where [[toner]] is attracted to a charged image and then developed
*[[laser printing|laser]] – a type of [[xerography]] where the charged image is written pixel by pixel using a laser
*[[solid ink]] printer – where [[cube]]s of ink are melted to make ink or liquid toner

Vendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems are more economical than inkjet in the long run, even though inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.

Professional [[digital printing]] (using [[toner]]) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto which it is printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP [[Indigo Digital Press]] series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.

Small press and fanzines generally use [[digital printing]]. Prior to the introduction of cheap photocopying the use of machines such as the [[spirit duplicator]], [[hectograph]], and [[mimeograph]] was common.

==3D printing==
[[3D printing]] is a form of manufacturing technology where physical objects are created from [[3D modeling|three-dimensional digital models]] using 3D printers. The objects are created by laying down or building up many thin layers of material in succession.  The technique is also known as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, or fabricating.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Gang run printing==
[[Gang run printing]] is a method in which multiple printing projects are placed on a common paper sheet in an effort to reduce printing costs and paper waste. Gang runs are generally used with sheet-fed printing presses and CMYK process color jobs, which require four separate plates that are hung on the plate cylinder of the press.  Printers use the term "gang run" or "gang" to describe the practice of placing many print projects on the same oversized sheet. Basically, instead of running one postcard that is 4 x 6 as an individual job the printer would place 15 different postcards on 20 x 18 sheet therefore using the same amount of press time the printer will get 15 jobs done in the roughly the same amount of time as one job.

==Printed electronics==
[[Printed electronics]] is the manufacturing of electronic devices using standard printing processes. Printed electronics technology can be produced on cheap materials such as paper or flexible film, which makes it an extremely cost-effective method of production. Since early 2010, the printable electronics industry has been gaining momentum and several large companies, including [[Bemis Company]] and [[Illinois Tool Works]] have made investments in printed electronics and industry associations including OE-A and FlexTech Alliance are contributing heavily to the advancement of the printed electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Announcements Show Gains Being Made by PE Industry|url=http://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/articles/2012/07/recent-announcements-show-gains-being-made-by-pe-i|publisher=Printed Electronics Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Printable transistors usher in 'internet of things'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/21/thinfilm/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Cost Management (PCM)''' is a method that uses technology to measure cost and productivity through the full life cycle of enterprise level projects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

PCM encompasses several specific functions of [[project management]] including [[Estimation (project management)|estimating]], job controls, field data collection, [[Schedule (project management)|scheduling]], accounting and design.
PCM main goal is to complete a project within an approved budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=College|first1=Kathy Schwalbe, Ph.D., PMP, Augsburg|title=Information technology project management|date=2012|publisher=Course Technology|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781133526858|edition=Seventh edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with estimating, a vital tool in PCM, actual historical data is used to accurately plan all aspects of the project.
As the project continues, job control uses data from the estimate with the information reported from the field to measure the cost and production in the project. From project initiation to completion, project cost management has an objective to simplify and cheapen the project experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12643">'''Pyknon''', {{lang-el|πυκνόν}}, sometimes also transliterated as '''pycnon''' (from {{lang-el|πυκνός}} close, close-packed, crowded, condensed; {{lang-lat|spissus}}) in the music theory of Antiquity is a structural property of any [[tetrachord]] in which a composite of two smaller intervals is less than the remaining ([[incomposite interval|incomposite]]) interval. The makeup of the ''pyknon'' serves to identify the [[Genus (music)|melodic genus]] (also called "genus of a tetrachord") and the [[octave species]] made by compounding two such tetrachords, and the rules governing the ways in which such compounds may be made centre on the relationships of the two ''pykna'' involved.

==Definition==
The ''pyknon'' was an important criterion in the classification of melodic genera ({{lang-el|γένη τῶν μελῳδουμένων}}). The Greek word πυκνόν is an adjective meaning "close", "compact", "close-packed", or "crowded" {{harv|Liddell and Scott|1996}}. In Ancient Greek music theory, this term is used to describe a pair of intervals within a [[tetrachord]], the sum of which is less than the remainder of the tetrachord {{harv|Levin|2007|loc=413}}. Although in modern usage, a tetrachord may be ''any'' four-note segment of a [[musical scale|scale]], or indeed any (unordered) collection of four [[pitch class]]es, in ancient Greek music theory a tetrachord consists of a four-note segment of the [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Syst.C3.AAma Ametabolon.2C an overview of the tone system|Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems]] bounded by the interval of a perfect fourth, the outer notes of which remain fixed in all genera and therefore are called "standing notes" ({{lang-el|ἑστῶτες φθόγγοι}}). The positions of the inner notes vary from one genus to another, for which reason they are called "movable notes" ({{harvnb|Mathiesen|1999|loc=301, 312, 322, 344, 350, et passim}}; from {{lang-el|κινούμενοι φθόγγοι}}). In its basic theoretical form, the largest interval of a tetrachord is at the top, and the smallest at the bottom. The existence of a ''pyknon'' therefore depends on the uppermost interval being larger than half of a perfect fourth, which occurs only in the [[Chromatic genus|chromatic]] and [[Enharmonic genus|enharmonic genera]]. Because the [[diatonic genus]] consists of two whole tones and one semitone, no single interval is larger than the other two combined, and so there is no ''pyknon'' {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. For this reason, the enharmonic and chromatic genera are sometimes called the "pyknic genera", in order to distinguish them from the diatonic {{harv|Solomon|1984|loc=246}}.

==Theoretical applications==
The notes of the central tetrachord of the system in ascending order are ''hypate'', ''parhypate'', ''lichanos'' (or ''hypermese''), and ''mese''. A second tetrachord is added above, after a disjunctive tone, and the corresponding names (together with the interval ratios of the standing tones) are ({{harvnb|Chalmers|1990|loc=4}}; {{harvnb|Mathiesen|1999|loc=245}}):
*''mese'' (4:3) – ''nete'' (2:1) (standing)
*''lichanos'' – ''paranete'' (movable)
*''parhypate'' – ''trite'' (movable)
*''hypate'' (1:1) – ''paramese'' (3:2) (standing)
Although movable, the ''lichanos'' must remain above the ''parhypate'', and the ''paranete'' above the ''trite'' {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=312}}.

A "composite interval" is one made up of two or more smaller intervals; an "incomposite interval" has no smaller components In these terms, if the composite interval between the ''hypate'' and the ''lichanos'' (or ''paramese'' and ''paranete'') is smaller than the incomposite interval from the ''lichanos'' to the ''mese'' (or ''paranete'' to ''nete''), the three notes in that composite interval are together called a ''pyknon'' {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=312}}. In the diatonic genus, because the composite interval from ''hypate'' to ''lichanos'' (a minor third) is larger than the remaining incomposite interval from ''lichanos'' to ''mese'' (a whole tone), the lowest three notes of the diatonic tetrachord are designated ''apyknon'': "not close-packed" {{harv|Barbera|1977|loc=321n11}}.

==Enharmonic==
[[File:Greek Dorian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|right|300px|Two pyknic enharmonic tetrachords, together comprising the Greek [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] [[octave species]] in the enharmonic genus]]
In the enharmonic genus, the large incomposite interval was originally a [[ditone]] (the [[major third]] of [[Pythagorean tuning]]), leaving a ''pyknon'' with a total width of just a [[semitone]]. The Pythagorean ditone is equivalent to two 9:8 ''epogdoa'', or [[major second]]s), together an interval of 81:64, thus leaving a ''pyknon'' of 256:243—a [[Pythagorean limma#Pythagorean tuning|limma]] (minor Pythagorean semitone), but how the ''pyknon'' was exactly (that is by exact mathematic calculation) divided into its two component intervals is not known {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=9}}. The tuning of [[Eratosthenes]], as reported by [[Aristoxenus]], uses a major third of 19:15 with the two unequal intervals of the ''pyknon'' in the ratios of 40:39 and 39:38 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=8}}. Although Aristoxenus also implies that the two intervals of the ''pyknon'' in the enharmonic genus may be equal {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=333}}, the anonymous author of the Euclidean ''Sectio Canonis'' (P18) is unequivocal: "The ''parhypatai'' and ''tritai'' do not divide the ''pyknon'' into equal intervals" {{harv|Barker|1981|loc=6}}.

[[Ptolemy]] reports in his ''Harmonics'' (2. 14) that two other theorists, [[Archytas]] and [[Didymus the musician|Didymus]], replaced the ditone with the smaller, [[Just tuning|just]] major third with the number ratio of 5:4, making the ''pyknon'' correspondingly larger {{harv|West|1992|loc=170}}. This ''pyknon'' was divided differently by these two theorists, but in both cases the two intervals were not equal to one another. Archytas, who was the first theorist to give ratios for all of the genera, chose 28:27 and 36:35, and Didymus, some four centuries later, gave 32:31 and 31:30 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=7–8}}.

==Chromatic==
[[File:Greek Dorian chromatic genus.png|thumb|right|300px|Two pyknic chromatic tetrachords, together comprising the Greek [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] [[octave species]] in the chromatic genus]]
In the chromatic genus, the largest interval was called a {{lang-el|τριημιτόνιόν ἀσύνθετον}}, {{lang-lat|triemitonium incompositum}}—translated as "incomposite" (or "noncomposite") "trihemitone" ({{harvnb|Bower|1989|loc=43}}; {{harvnb|Hagel|2009|loc=105, 266, 267}}; {{harvnb|Levin|1994|loc=125, 174}}; {{harvnb|Barker|1989|loc=261, 267}}, prefers a descriptive translation, "an individed interval of three semitones"; {{harvnb|Strunk|1998|loc=36, 37}} uses "trisemitone"), the modern term being "[[minor third]]"—leaving a ''pyknon'' of some type of whole tone to be divided into two semitones. There is a larger number of variations in the tuning of the chromatic than in the enharmonic. Up to the beginning of the 4th century BC the chromatic ''pyknon'' spanned a major whole tone with a 9:8 ratio, and this was divided by Gaudentius into ascending semitone intervals of 256:243 and  2187:2048 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=8}}. Ptolemy defined two different tunings of the chromatic genus: the "soft" chromatic with a smaller ''pyknon'' and the "intense" chromatic with a larger one. The unequal semitones dividing the ''pykna'' were in ratios of 28:27 and 15:14 for the soft chromatic and 22:21 and 12:11 for the intense. The larger remaining interval was 6:5 in the soft chromatic and 7:6 in the intense {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=9}}.

==Scale structure==
[[File:Mixolydian chromatic.png|thumb|right|300px|Greek [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] octave species on E in the chromatic genus: conjunct tetrachords ''a'' and ''b'', with note of conjunction ''c'', and interval of disjunction ''d''; the two ''pykna'' are separated by the larger interval between steps 3 and 4 {{audio|Greek Mixolydian mode on E, chromatic genus.mid|Play}}]]
A further refinement of tetrachordal construction, according to Aristoxenus, is that the lower interval of the ''pyknon'' must be smaller than or equal to the upper one {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229–30}}. Didymus in the chromatic genus and Archytas in the enharmonic broke this rule, however, and in the ''Harmonics'' (2. 13) Ptolemy criticized this feature in Didymus, holding that it is unmelodic and out of agreement with the evidence of our ears {{harv|West|1992|loc=170}}.

According to Aristoxenus (''Elements of Harmony'', book 2), whenever tetrachords are combined to form a scale filling an octave, "Two consecutive pycna may not occur in ascent or descent. A ditone may precede or follow [a pycnon] in ascent or descent. A tone may follow [a pycnon] only in descent" {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=331}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">The '''QED manifesto''' was a proposal for a computer-based database of all [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge, strictly formalized and with all proofs having been [[automated proof checking|checked automatically]]. ([[Q.E.D.]] means {{lang|la|quod erat demonstrandum}} in [[Latin]], meaning "which was to be demonstrated.") 

==Overview==
The idea for the project arose in 1993, mainly under the impetus of [[Robert S. Boyer|Robert Boyer]]. The goals of the project, tentatively named ''QED project'' or ''project QED'', were outlined in the QED manifesto, a document first published in 1994, with input from several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/Extra/wiedijk_2.pdf The QED Manifesto] in ''Automated Deduction - CADE 12'', Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 814, pp. 238-251, 1994. [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/qed/qed.html HTML version]&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit authorship was deliberately avoided. A dedicated mailing list was created, and two scientific conferences on QED took place, the first one in 1994 at [[Argonne National Laboratories]] and the second in 1995 in [[Warsaw]] organized by the [[Mizar system|Mizar]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mizar.org/people/romat/qed95rep.pdf The QED Workshop II report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project seems to have died in 1996, never having produced more than discussions and plans. In a 2007 paper, Freek Wiedijk identifies two reasons for the failure of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Freek Wiedijk, [http://mizar.org/trybulec65/8.pdf The QED Manifesto Revisited], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In order of importance:
* Very few people are working on formalization of mathematics. There is no compelling application for fully mechanized mathematics.
* [[Formalized mathematics]] does not yet resemble real, traditional mathematics. This is partly due to the complexity of mathematical notation, and partly to the limitations of existing [[Automated theorem prover|theorem provers]] and [[proof assistant]]s; the paper finds that the major contenders, [[Mizar system|Mizar]], [[HOL theorem prover family|HOL]], and [[Coq]], have serious shortcomings in their abilities to express mathematics.

Nonetheless, QED-style projects are regularly proposed, and the [[Mizar system|Mizar]] library has successfully formalized a large portion of undergraduate mathematics. {{As of|2007}} it is the largest such library.&lt;ref&gt;Fairouz Kamareddine, Manuel Maarek, Krzysztof Retel, and J. B. Wells, ''[http://mizar.org/trybulec65/7.pdf Gradual Computerisation/Formalisation of Mathematical Texts into Mizar]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another such project is the [[Metamath]] proof database.

In 2014 the Twenty years of the QED Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ru.nl/qed20/QED-index.html Twenty years of the QED Manifesto workshop]&lt;/ref&gt; workshop was organized as part of the [[Vienna Summer of Logic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">'''Rational Choice Institutionalism''' ('''RCI''') is a theoretical approach to the study of institutions arguing that actors use [[institutions]] to maximize their utility. However, actors face rule-based constraints provided by the institutional environment which influence their behaviour. Rational Choice Institutionalism arose initially from the study of congressional behaviour in the U.S. in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, P. A., &amp; Taylor, R. (1996). Political Science and the Three Institutionalisms. Political Studies, 44, 936-957&lt;/ref&gt; It employs analytical tools borrowed from [[neo-classical economics]] to explain how institutions are created, the behaviour of political actors within it, and the outcome of strategic [[interaction]].

RCI explains the creation of institutions as an attempt to reduce [[transaction costs]] of collective activity which would be significantly higher without such institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver (1985) The Economic Institutions of Capitalism, New York, Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions persist after their creation because they reduce uncertainty and allow gains from exchange. Rational Choice Institutionalism assumes that political actors within the institutional setting have a fixed set of [[preferences]]. To maximize those preferences actors behave highly instrumental through systematic foresight and strategic cost-benefit calculation.&lt;ref&gt;Shepsle, K. (2005). Rational Choice Instituionalism. Havard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions lay down the 'rules of the game', define the range of available strategies and the sequence of alternatives. The actors' behaviour will be highly influenced by the expectation how other players will bargain. The institutional environment provides information and enforcement mechanism that reduce [[uncertainty]] for each actor about the corresponding behaviour of others.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, P. A., &amp; Taylor, R. (1996). Political Science and the Three Institutionalisms. Political Studies, 44, 936-957&lt;/ref&gt; This 'calculus approach' explains how the institutional setting influences individual behaviour and stresses how strategic interaction determines policy outcomes.

==The Principal-Agent Model==
A key concept of Rational Choice Institutionalism is the [[principal-agent]] model borrowed from Neo-classical economics. The concept assumes that the principal enters into a contractual relation with a second party, the agent, and delegates responsibility to the latter to fulfil certain responsibilities or a set of tasks on behalf of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iim.uni-flensburg.de/vwl/upload/lehre/wise0607/eus/institutions_and_culture/Kassim_on_P-A_in_EU.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103411/http://www.iim.uni-flensburg.de/vwl/upload/lehre/wise0607/eus/institutions_and_culture/Kassim_on_P-A_in_EU.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems occur due to an asymmetric distribution of information which favours the agent. The latter enables the agent to pursue its own interest and engage in opportunistic behaviour – shirking - at the cost of the principal’s interest.&lt;ref&gt;Kiewiet, D.R. and McCubbins, M.D. (1991) The Logic of Delegation: Congressional Parties and the Appropriations Process, Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal’s problem is how to control and limit shirking by the agent.

==Limitations==
Rational Choice Institutionalism is a [[deductive]] approach which relies on theoretical model building to explain real world policy outcomes. Therefore, due to its foundation on abstraction and clear lines of reasoning, it oversimplifies human motivation and interaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47754">'''Selective exposure''' is a theory within the practice of [[psychology]], often used in media and [[communication]] research, that historically refers to individuals' tendency to favor information which reinforces their pre-existing views while avoiding [[contradictory]] information. Selective exposure has also been known and defined as "congeniality bias" or "[[confirmation bias]]" in various texts throughout the years.&lt;ref name="Hart2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=William|last2=Albarracín|first2=Dolores|last3=Eagly|first3=Alice H.|last4=Brechan|first4=Inge|last5=Lindberg|first5=Matthew J.|last6=Merrill|first6=Lisa|title=Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2009|volume=135|issue=4|pages=555–588|doi=10.1037/a0015701|pmid=19586162|pmc=4797953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historical use of the term, people tend to select specific aspects of exposed information which they incorporate into their mindset. These selections are made based on their perspectives, beliefs, attitudes and decisions.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2009"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Sullivan|editor-first=Larry E.|title=The SAGE Glossary of the Social and Behavioral Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0YE3C4HMnsoC|year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-5143-2|page=465|chapter=Selective Exposure}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can mentally dissect the information they are exposed to and select favorable evidence, while ignoring the unfavorable. The foundation of this theory is rooted in the [[cognitive dissonance theory]], which asserts that when individuals are confronted with contrasting ideas, certain mental [[defense mechanism]]s are activated to produce harmony between new ideas and pre-existing beliefs, which results in cognitive equilibrium. Cognitive equilibrium, which is defined as a state of balance between a person's mental representation of the world and his or her environment, is crucial to understanding selective exposure theory. According to [[Jean Piaget]], when a mismatch occurs, people find it to be  "inherently dissatisfying".&lt;ref name="Beauchamp2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=Anne S.|chapter=Cognitive equilibrium|editor-last=Salkind|editor-first=Neil J.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPxyAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT323|year=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6539-1|pages=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective exposure relies on the assumption that one will continue to seek out information on an issue even after an individual has taken a stance on it. The position that a person has taken will be colored by various factors of that issue that are reinforced during the [[decision-making process]].

Selective exposure has been displayed in various contexts such as self-serving situations and situations in which people hold [[prejudice]]s regarding [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]], particular opinions, and personal and group-related issues.&lt;ref name="KastenmullerGreitemeyer2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kastenmüller|first1=Andreas|last2=Greitemeyer|first2=Tobias|last3=Jonas|first3=Eva|last4=Fischer|first4=Peter|last5=Frey|first5=Dieter|title=Selective exposure: The impact of collectivism and individualism|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=49|issue=4|year=2010|pages=745–763|doi=10.1348/014466609X478988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived usefulness of information, perceived norm of fairness, and curiosity of valuable information are three factors that can counteract selective exposure.

== Effect on decision-making ==

=== Individual versus group decision-making ===
[[File:My Wife and My Mother-in-Law.jpg|thumbnail|left|This image, which can be seen as a young woman or an older woman, serves as an example of how individuals can choose to perceive the same image differently. According to Selective Exposure Theory, people tend to seek out the version of a stimulant that they want to be exposed to, such as a form of the stimulant that they are already familiar with.]]
Selective exposure can affect the decisions people make as individuals or as groups because they may be unwilling to change their views and beliefs either collectively or on their own. A historical example of the disastrous effects of selective exposure and its effects on group dynamics is the series of events leading up to the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961. [[President John F. Kennedy]] was given the go ahead by his advisers to authorize the invasion of Cuba by poorly trained expatriates despite overwhelming evidence that it was a foolish and ill-conceived tactical maneuver. The advisers were so eager to please the President that they confirmed their cognitive bias for the invasion rather than challenging the faulty plan.&lt;ref name="Kastenmuller2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kastenmüller|first1=Andreas|last2=Greitemeyer|first2=Tobias|last3=Zehl|first3=Stefanie|last4=Tattersall|first4=Andrew J.|last5=George|first5=Helen|last6=Frey|first6=Dieter|last7=Fischer|first7=Peter|title=Leadership and Information Processing: The influence of transformational and transactional leadership on selective information search, evaluation, and conveying.|journal=Social Psychology|date=2014|volume=45|issue=5|pages=357–370|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing beliefs about one's self, other people, and the world are three variables as to why people fear new information.&lt;ref name=Sweeny2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweeny|first1=Kate|last2=Melnyk|first2=Darya|last3=Miller|first3=Wendi|last4=Shepperd|first4=James A.|title=Information avoidance: Who, what, when, and why.|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=14|issue=4|year=2010|pages=340–353|doi=10.1037/a0021288}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of studies has shown that selective exposure effects can occur in the context of both individual and group decision making.&lt;ref name=Jonas2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonas|first1=Eva|last2=Schulz-Hardt|first2=Stefan|last3=Frey|first3=Dieter|last4=Thelen|first4=Norman|title=Confirmation bias in sequential information search after preliminary decisions: An expansion of dissonance theoretical research on selective exposure to information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=80|issue=4|year=2001|pages=557–571|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.4.557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous situational variables have been identified that increase the tendency toward selective exposure.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Fischer|first2=Julia K.|last3=Aydin|first3=Nilüfer|last4=Frey|first4=Dieter|title=Physically Attractive Social Information Sources Lead to Increased Selective Exposure to Information|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=32|issue=4|year=2010|pages=340–347|doi=10.1080/01973533.2010.519208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]], specifically, includes research with a variety of situational factors and related psychological processes that eventually persuade a person to make a quality decision. Additionally, from a psychological perspective, the effects of selective exposure can both stem from motivational and cognitive accounts.

=== Effect of information quantity===

According to research study by Fischer, Schulz-Hardt, et al. (2008), the quantity of decision-relevant information that the participants were exposed to had a significant effect on their levels of selective exposure. A group for which only two pieces of decision-relevant information were given had experienced lower levels of selective exposure than the other group who had ten pieces of information to evaluate. This research brought more attention to the cognitive processes of individuals when they are presented with a very small amount of decision-consistent and decision-inconsistent information. The study showed that in situations such as this, an individual becomes more doubtful of their initial decision due to the unavailability of resources. They begin to think that there is not enough data or evidence in this particular field in which they are told to make a decision about. Because of this, the subject becomes more critical of their initial thought process and focuses on both decision-consistent and inconsistent sources, thus decreasing his level of selective exposure. For the group who had plentiful pieces of information, this factor made them confident in their initial decision because they felt comfort from the fact that their decision topic was well-supported by a large number of resources.&lt;ref name="Krueger, J. I. 2012"&gt;Krueger, J. I. (Ed.). (2012). ''Social judgment and decision making.'' New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the availability of decision-relevant and irrelevant information surrounding individuals can influence the level of selective exposure experienced during the process of decision-making.

Selective exposure is prevalent within singular individuals and groups of people and can influence either to reject new ideas or information that is not commensurate with the original ideal.  In Jonas et al. (2001) empirical studies were done on four different experiments investigating individuals' and groups' decision making. This article suggests that [[confirmation bias]] is prevalent in decision making. Those who find new information often draw their attention towards areas where they hold personal attachment. Thus, people are driven toward pieces of information that are coherent with their own expectations or beliefs as a result of this selective exposure theory occurring in action. Throughout the process of the four experiments, generalization is always considered valid and confirmation bias is always present when seeking new information and making decisions.&lt;ref name=Jonas2001 /&gt;

=== Accuracy motivation and defense motivation ===

Fischer and Greitemeyer (2010) explored individuals' decision making in terms of selective exposure to confirmatory information.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Kastenmüller|first2=Andreas| last3=Greitemeyer|first3=Tobias|last4=Fischer|first4=Julia|last5=Frey|first5=Dieter|last6=Crelley|first6=David|title=Threat and selective exposure: The moderating role of threat and decision context on confirmatory information search after decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=140|issue=1|year=2011|pages=51–62|doi=10.1037/a0021595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selective exposure posed that individuals make their decisions based on information that is consistent with their decision rather than information that is inconsistent.  Recent research has shown that "Confirmatory Information Search" was responsible for the 2008 bankruptcy of the [[Lehman Brothers]] Investment Bank which then triggered the [[Global Financial Crisis]].  In the zeal for profit and economic gain, politicians, investors and financial advisors ignored the mathematical evidence that foretold the housing market crash in favor of flimsy justifications for upholding the status quo.&lt;ref name="FischerKastenmuller2011" /&gt; Researchers explain that subjects have the tendency to seek and select information using their integrative model. There are two primary motivations for selective exposure: Accuracy Motivation and Defense Motivation. Accuracy Motivation explains that an individual is motivated to be accurate in their decision making and Defense Motivation explains that one seeks confirmatory information to support their beliefs and justify their decisions. Accuracy motivation is not always beneficial within the context of selective exposure and can instead be counterintuitive, increasing the amount of selective exposure. Defense motivation can lead to reduced levels of selective exposure.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011 /&gt;

=== Personal attributes ===
Selective exposure avoids information inconsistent with one's beliefs and attitudes. For example, former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] would only enter a hotel room after the television was turned on and tuned to a conservative television channel.&lt;ref name="Hart2009"/&gt; When analyzing a person's [[decision-making]] skills, his or her unique process of gathering relevant information is not the only factor taken into account. Fischer et al. (2010) found it important to consider the information source itself, otherwise explained as the physical being that provided the source of information.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; Selective exposure research generally neglects the influence of indirect decision-related attributes, such as physical appearance. In Fischer et al. (2010) two studies hypothesized that physically attractive information sources resulted in decision makers to be more selective in searching and reviewing decision-relevant information. Researchers explored the impact of social information and its level of physical attractiveness. The data was then analyzed and used to support the idea that selective exposure existed for those who needed to make a decision.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; Therefore, the more attractive an information source was, the more positive and detailed the subject was with making the decision. Physical attractiveness affects an individual's decision because the [[perception]] of quality improves. Physically attractive information sources increased the quality of consistent information needed to make decisions and further increased the selective exposure in decision-relevant information, supporting the researchers' hypothesis.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011 /&gt; Both studies concluded that attractiveness is driven by a different selection and evaluation of decision-consistent information. Decision makers allow factors such as physical attractiveness to affect everyday decisions due to the works of selective exposure.
In another study, selective exposure was defined by the amount of individual confidence. Individuals can control the amount of selective exposure depending on whether they have a low self-esteem or high self-esteem. Individuals who maintain higher confidence levels reduce the amount of selective exposure.&lt;ref name=Albarracin2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albarracin|first1=D.|title=The Role of Defensive Confidence in Preference for Proattitudinal Information: How Believing That One Is Strong Can Sometimes Be a Defensive Weakness|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=30|issue=12|year=2004|pages=1565–1584|doi=10.1177/0146167204271180|pmc=4803283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albarracín and Mitchell (2004) hypothesized that those who displayed higher confidence levels were more willing to seek out information both consistent and inconsistent with their views. The phrase "decision-consistent information" explains the tendency to actively seek decision-relevant information. Selective exposure occurs when individuals search for information and show systematic preferences towards ideas that are consistent, rather than inconsistent, with their beliefs.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; On the contrary, those who exhibited low levels of confidence were more inclined to examine information that did not agree with their views. The researchers found that in three out of five studies participants showed more confidence and scored higher on the ''Defensive Confidence Scale'',&lt;ref name=Albarracin2004 /&gt; which serves as evidence that their hypothesis was correct.

Bozo et al. (2009) investigated the anxiety of fearing death and compared it to various age groups in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Researchers analyzed the data by using the [[terror management theory]] and found that age had no direct effect on specific behaviors. The researchers thought that a fear of death would yield health-promoting behaviors in young adults. When individuals are reminded of their own death, it causes stress and anxiety, but eventually leads to positive changes in their health behaviors. Their conclusions showed that older adults were consistently better at promoting and practicing good health behaviors, without thinking about death, compared to young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bozo|first1=Özlem|last2=Tunca| first2=Ayča|last3=Šimšek|first3=Yeliz|title=The Effect of Death Anxiety and Age on Health-Promoting Behaviors: A Terror-Management Theory Perspective|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=143|issue=4|year=2009|pages=377–389|doi=10.3200/JRLP.143.4.377-389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young adults were less motivated to change and practice health-promoting behaviors because they used the selective exposure to confirm their prior beliefs. Selective exposure thus creates barriers between the behaviors in different ages, but there is no specific age at which people change their behaviors.

Though physical appearance will impact one's personal decision regarding an idea presented, a study conducted by Van Dillen, Papies, and Hofmann (2013) suggests a way to decrease the influence of personal attributes and selective exposure on [[decision-making]]. The results from this study showed that people do pay more attention to physically attractive or tempting stimuli; however, this phenomenon can be decreased through increasing the "cognitive load." In this study, increasing cognitive activity led to a decreased impact of physical appearance and selective exposure on the individual's impression of the idea presented. This is explained by acknowledging that we are instinctively drawn to certain physical attributes, but if the required resources for this attraction are otherwise engaged at the time, then we might not notice these attributes to an equal extent. For example, if a person is simultaneously engaging in a mentally challenging activity during the time of exposure, then it is likely that less attention will be paid to appearance, which leads to a decreased impact of selective exposure on [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name="VanDillen2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Dillen|first1=Lotte F.|last2=Papies|first2=Esther K.|last3=Hofmann|first3=Wilhelm|title=Turning a blind eye to temptation: How cognitive load can facilitate self-regulation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2013|volume=104|issue=3|pages=427–443|doi=10.1037/a0031262|url=http://www.goallab.nl/publications/documents/van%20Dillen,%20Papies,%20Hofmann,%202013,%20JPSP.pdf|pmid=23276276|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150238/http://www.goallab.nl/publications/documents/van%20Dillen,%20Papies,%20Hofmann,%202013,%20JPSP.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive dissonance theory ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Festinger.jpg|thumbnail|left|Eminent 1960s psychological theorist Leon Festinger]] --&gt;
[[Leon Festinger]] is widely considered as the father of modern social psychology and as an important figure to that field of practice as Freud was to clinical psychology and Piaget was to developmental psychology.&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zajonc|first1=R. B.|title=Obituary: Leon Festinger (1919–1989)|journal=American Psychologist|date=1990|volume=45|issue=5|pages=661–662|doi=10.1037/h0091620}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered to be one of the most significant social psychologists of the 20th century. His work demonstrated that it is possible to use the scientific method to investigate complex and significant social phenomena without reducing them to the mechanistic connections between stimulus and response that were the basis of [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990" /&gt; Festinger proposed the groundbreaking theory of [[cognitive dissonance]] that has become the foundation of  selective exposure theory today despite the fact that Festinger was considered as an "avant-garde" psychologist when he had first proposed it in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ironic twist, Festinger realized that he himself was a victim of the effects of selective exposure.  He was a heavy smoker his entire life and when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1989, he was said to have joked, "Make sure that everyone knows that it wasn't lung cancer!"&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990"/&gt; Cognitive dissonance theory explains that when a person either consciously or unconsciously realizes conflicting attitudes, thoughts, or beliefs, they experience mental discomfort. Because of this, an individual will avoid such conflicting information in the future since it produces this discomfort, and they will gravitate towards messages sympathetic to their own previously held conceptions.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision makers are unable to evaluate information quality independently on their own (Fischer, Jonas, Dieter &amp; Kastenmüller, 2008).&lt;ref name="FischerJonas2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Jonas|first2=Eva|last3=Frey |first3=Dieter|last4=Kastenmüller|first4=Andreas|title=Selective exposure and decision framing: The impact of gain and loss framing on confirmatory information search after decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=2|year=2008|pages=312–320|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2007.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is a conflict between pre-existing views and information encountered, individuals will experience an unpleasant and self-threatening state of aversive-arousal which will motivate them to reduce it through selective exposure. They will begin to prefer information that supports their original decision and neglect conflicting information. Individuals will then exhibit confirmatory information to defend their positions and reach the goal of dissonance reduction.&lt;ref name="FischerLea2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Lea|first2=Stephen|last3=Kastenmüller|first3=Andreas|last4=Greitemeyer|first4=Tobias|last5=Fischer|first5=Julia|last6=Frey|first6=Dieter|title=The process of selective exposure: Why confirmatory information search weakens over time|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=114|issue=1|year=2011|pages=37–48|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive dissonance theory insists that dissonance is a psychological state of tension that people are motivated to reduce {{harv|Festinger|1957}}. Dissonance causes feelings of unhappiness, discomfort, or distress. {{harvtxt|Festinger|1957|p=13}} asserted the following: "These two elements are in a dissonant relation if, considering these two alone, the obverse of one element would follow from the other." To reduce dissonance, people add consonant cognition or change evaluations for one or both conditions in order to make them more consistent mentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matsumoto|first1=Takao|title=Connectionist interpretation of the association between cognitive dissonance and attention switching|journal=Neural Networks|date=2014|volume=60|pages=119–132|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2014.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Festinger's theory, there are two basic hypotheses:

1) The existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance.

2) When dissonance is present, in addition to trying to reduce it, the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|p=3}}.

The theory of [[cognitive dissonance]] was developed in the mid-1950s to explain why people of strong convictions are so resistant in changing their beliefs even in the face of undeniable contradictory evidence. It occurs when people feel an attachment to and responsibility for a decision, position or behavior. It increases the motivation to justify their positions through selective exposure to confirmatory information (Fischer, 2011). Fischer suggested that people have an inner need to ensure that their beliefs and behaviors are consistent. In an experiment that employed commitment manipulations, it impacts perceived decision certainty. Participants were free to choose attitude-consistent and inconsistent information to write an essay. Those who wrote an attitude-consistent essay showed higher levels of confirmatory information search (Fischer, 2011).&lt;ref name="Fischer2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|title=Selective Exposure, Decision Uncertainty, and Cognitive Economy: A New Theoretical Perspective on Confirmatory Information Search|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=5|issue=10|year=2011|pages=751–762|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels and magnitude of dissonance also play a role. Selective exposure to consistent information is likely under certain levels of dissonance. At high levels, a person is expected to seek out information that increases dissonance because the best strategy to reduce dissonance would be to alter one's attitude or decision (Smith et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="SmithFabrigar2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Steven M.|last2=Fabrigar|first2=Leandre R.|last3=Norris|first3=Meghan E.|title=Reflecting on Six Decades of Selective Exposure Research: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=2|issue=1|year=2008|pages=464–493|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00060.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research on selective exposure within the dissonance theory produced weak empirical support until the dissonance theory was revised and new methods, more conducive to measuring selective exposure, were implemented.&lt;ref name="Frey1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=D|title=Recent research on selective exposure to information|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|year=1986|volume=19|pages=41–80|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, scholars still argue that empirical results supporting the selective exposure hypothesis are still mixed. This is possibly due to the problems with the methods of the experimental studies conducted.&lt;ref name="TaberLodge2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taber|first1=Charles S.|last2=Lodge|first2=Milton|title=Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=50|issue=3|year=2006|pages=755–769|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason for the mixed results may be the failure to simulate an authentic media environment in the experiments.&lt;ref name=Knobloch-Westerwick2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knobloch-Westerwick|first1=S.|first2=Jingbo|last2= Meng|title=Looking the Other Way: Selective Exposure to Attitude-Consistent and Counterattitudinal Political Information|journal=Communication Research|date=16 March 2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=426–448|doi=10.1177/0093650209333030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Festinger, the motivation to seek or avoid information depends on the magnitude of dissonance experienced (Smith et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="SmithFabrigar2008" /&gt; It is observed that there is a tendency for people to seek new information or select information that supports their beliefs in order to reduce dissonance.
There exist three possibilities which will affect extent of dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|pp=127–131}}:

* Relative absence of dissonance.

When little or no dissonance exists, there is little or no motivation to seek new information. For example, when there is an absence of dissonance, the lack of motivation to attend or avoid a lecture on 'The Advantages of Automobiles with Very High Horsepower Engines' will be independent of whether the car a new owner has recently purchased has a high or low horsepower engine. However, it is important to note the difference between a situation when there is no dissonance and when the information has no relevance to the present or future behavior. For the latter, accidental exposure, which the new car owner does not avoid, will not introduce any dissonance; while for the former individual, who also does not avoid information, dissonance may be accidentally introduced.

* The presence of moderate amounts of dissonance.

The existence of dissonance and consequent pressure to reduce it will lead to an active search of information, which will then lead people to avoid information that will increase dissonance. However, when faced with a potential source of information, there will be an ambiguous cognition to which a subject will react in terms of individual expectations about it. If the subject expects the cognition to increase dissonance, they will avoid it. In the event that one's expectations are proven wrong, the attempt at dissonance reduction may result in increasing it instead. It may in turn lead to a situation of active avoidance.

* The presence of extremely large amounts of dissonance.

If two cognitive elements exist in a dissonant relationship, the magnitude of dissonance matches the resistance to change. If the dissonance becomes greater than the resistance to change, then the least resistant elements of cognition will be changed, reducing dissonance. When dissonance is close to the maximum limit, one may actively seek out and expose oneself to dissonance-increasing information. If an individual can increase dissonance to the point where it is greater than the resistance to change, he will change the cognitive elements involved, reducing or even eliminating dissonance. Once dissonance is increased sufficiently, an individual may bring himself to change, hence eliminating all dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|pp=127–131}}.

The reduction in [[cognitive dissonance]] following a decision can be achieved by selectively looking for decision-consonant information and avoiding contradictory information. The objective is to reduce the discrepancy between the cognitions, but the specification of which strategy will be chosen is not explicitly addressed by the dissonance theory. It will be dependent on the quantity and quality of the information available inside and outside the cognitive system.&lt;ref name=Frey1986 /&gt;

=== Klapper's selective exposure ===
In the early 1960s, Columbia University researcher Joseph T. Klapper asserted in his book ''The Effects Of Mass Communication'' that audiences were not passive targets of political and commercial propaganda from mass media but that mass media reinforces previously held convictions. Throughout the book, he argued that the media has a small amount of power to influence people and, most of the time, it just reinforces our preexisting attitudes and beliefs. He argued that the media effects of relaying or spreading new public messages or ideas were minimal because there is a wide variety of ways in which individuals filter such content. Due to this tendency, Klapper argued that media content must be able to ignite some type of cognitive activity in an individual in order to communicate its message.&lt;ref name="Heath2004" /&gt; Prior to Klapper's research, the prevailing opinion was that mass media had a substantial power to sway individual opinion and that audiences were passive consumers of prevailing media [[propaganda]].  However, by the time of the release of ''The Effects of Mass Communication'', many studies led to a conclusion that many specifically targeted messages were completely ineffective.  Klapper's research showed that individuals gravitated towards media messages that bolstered previously held convictions that were set by peer groups, societal influences, and family structures and that the accession of these messages over time did not change when presented with more recent media influence.  Klapper noted from the review of research in the social science that given the abundance of content within the mass media, audiences were selective to the types of programming that they consumed.  Adults would patronize media that was appropriate for their demographics and children would eschew media that was boring to them.  So individuals would either accept or reject a mass media message based upon internal filters that were innate to that person.&lt;ref name="Heath2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Robert L.|title=Encyclopedia of Public Relations|editor-last=Heath|editor-first=Robert L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVF2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT798|volume=2|year=2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6545-2|pages=738–740|chapter=Reinforcement Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are Klapper's five mediating factors and conditions to affect people:&lt;ref name="Klapper1960"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klapper|first=Joseph T.|title=The effects of mass communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzcGAQAAIAAJ|year=1960|publisher=Free Press|page=19|lccn=60014402}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Predispositions and the related processes of selective exposure, [[selective perception]], and [[selective retention]].
*The groups, and the norms of groups, to which the audience members belong.
*Interpersonal dissemination of the content of communication
*The exercise of [[opinion leadership]]
*The nature of mass media in a free enterprise society.
Three basic concepts:
*Selective exposure – people keep away from communication of opposite hue.
*[[Selective perception]] – If people are confronting unsympathetic material, they do not perceive it, or make it fit for their existing opinion.
*[[Selective retention]] –  refers to the process of categorizing and interpreting information in a way that favors one category or interpretation over another. Furthermore, they just simply forget the unsympathetic material.

Groups and group norms work as mediators. For example, one can be strongly disinclined to change to the Democratic Party if their family has voted Republican for a long time. In this case, the person's predisposition to the political party is already set, so they don't perceive information about Democratic Party or change voting behavior because of [[mass communication]]. Klapper's third assumption is inter-personal dissemination of mass communication. If someone is already exposed by close friends, which creates predisposition toward something, it will lead to an increase in exposure to mass communication and eventually reinforce the existing opinion. An [[opinion leader]] is also a crucial factor to form one's predisposition and can lead someone to be exposed by mass communication. The nature of commercial mass media also leads people to select certain types of media contents.

=== Cognitive economy model ===

This new model combines the motivational and cognitive processes of selective exposure. In the past, selective exposure had been studied from a motivational standpoint. For instance, the reason behind the existence of selective exposure was that people felt motivated to decrease the level of dissonance they felt while encountering inconsistent information. They also felt motivated to defend their decisions and positions, so they achieved this goal by exposing themselves to consistent information only. However, the new cognitive economy model not only takes into account the motivational aspects, but it also focuses on the cognitive processes of each individual. For instance, this model proposes that people cannot evaluate the quality of inconsistent information objectively and fairly because they tend to store more of the consistent information and use this as their reference point. Thus, inconsistent information is often observed with a more critical eye in comparison to consistent information. According to this model, the levels of selective exposure experienced during the decision-making process are also dependent on how much cognitive energy people are willing to invest. Just as people tend to be careful with their finances, cognitive energy or how much time they are willing to spend evaluating all the evidence for their decisions works the same way. People are hesitant to use this energy; they tend to be careful so they don't waste it. Thus, this model suggests that selective exposure does not happen in separate stages. Rather, it is a combined process of the individuals' certain acts of motivations and their management of the cognitive energy.&lt;ref name="Krueger, J. I. 2012"/&gt;

=== Media ===
[[File:ThreeWiseCryptoPartyMonkeys.jpg|thumb|Individuals tailor their media choices to avoid cognitive dissonance and avoid mental incongruity.]]
Recent studies have shown relevant empirical evidence for the pervasive influence of selective exposure on the greater population at large due to [[mass media]]. Researchers have found that individual media consumers will seek out programs to suit their individual emotional and cognitive needs. Individuals will seek out palliative forms of media during the recent times of economic crisis to fulfill a "strong surveillance need" and to decrease chronic dissatisfaction with life circumstances as well as fulfill needs for companionship.&lt;ref name="Kim2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jinhee|last2=Kim|first2=Jung-Hyun|last3=Seo|first3=Mihye|title=Toward a Person × Situation Model of Selective Exposure: Repressors, Sensitizers, and Choice of Online News on Financial Crisis|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|date=2014|volume=26|issue=2|pages=59–69|doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers tend to select media content that exposes and confirms their own ideas while avoiding information that argues against their opinion. A study conducted in 2012 has shown that this type of selective exposure affects pornography consumption as well. Individuals with low levels of [[life satisfaction]] are more likely to have casual sex after consumption of pornography that is congruent with their attitudes while disregarding content that challenges their inherently permissive 'no strings attached' attitudes.&lt;ref name="Wright2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Paul J.|title=A Longitudinal Analysis of US Adults' Pornography Exposure|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|date=2012|volume=24|issue=2|pages=67–76|doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music selection is also affected by selective exposure. A 2014 study conducted by Christa L. Taylor and Ronald S. Friedman at the SUNY University at Albany, found that mood congruence was effected by self-regulation of music mood choices.  Subjects in the study chose happy music when feeling angry or neutral but listened to sad music when they themselves were sad. The choice of sad music given a sad mood was due less to mood-mirroring but as a result of subjects having an aversion to listening to happy music that was cognitively dissonant with their mood.&lt;ref name="Taylor2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Christa L.|last2=Friedman|first2=Ronald S.|title=Differential influence of sadness and disgust on music preference.|journal=Psychology of Popular Media Culture|date=2014|volume=3|issue=4|pages=195–205|doi=10.1037/ppm0000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics are more likely to inspire selective exposure among consumers as opposed to single exposure decisions. For example, in their 2009 meta-analysis of Selective Exposure Theory, Hart et al. reported that "A 2004 survey by The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press (2006) found that Republicans are about 1.5 times more likely to report watching [[Fox News]] regularly than are Democrats (34% for Republicans and 20% of Democrats). In contrast, Democrats are 1.5 times more likely to report watching [[CNN]] regularly than Republicans (28% of Democrats vs. 19% of Republicans). Even more striking, Republicans are approximately five times more likely than Democrats to report watching "[[The O'Reilly Factor]]" regularly and are seven times more likely to report listening to "[[Rush Limbaugh]]" regularly."&lt;ref name="HartAlbarracin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=William|last2=Albarracín|first2=Dolores|last3=Eagly|first3=Alice H.|last4=Brechan|first4=Inge|last5=Lindberg|first5=Matthew J.|last6=Merrill|first6=Lisa|title=Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=135|issue=4|year=2009|pages=555–588|doi=10.1037/a0015701|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/chwe/austen/hart2009.pdf|pmid=19586162|pmc=4797953}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when the opinions of Republicans who only tune into conservative media outlets were compared to those of their fellow conservatives in a study by Stroud (2010), their beliefs were considered to be more polarized. The same result was retrieved from the study of liberals as well.&lt;ref name="Perloff, R. M. 2013"&gt;Perloff, R. M. (2013). Political persuasion. In James Price Dillard and Lijiang Shen (Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice.'' Retrieved from the Gale Virtual Reference Library database.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to our greater tendency toward selective exposure, current political campaigns have been characterized as being extremely partisan and polarized. As Bennett and Iyengar (2008) commented, "The new, more diversified information environment makes it not only more feasible for consumers to seek out news they might find agreeable but also provides a strong economic incentive for news organizations to cater to their viewers' political preferences."&lt;ref name="Perloff, R. M. 2013"/&gt; Selective exposure thus plays a role in shaping and reinforcing individuals' political attitudes. 
[[File:Televison Hungarian ORION 1957.jpg|thumb|210px|Television is the most pervasive conduit of selective exposure in modern society.]]
In early research, selective exposure originally provided an explanation for limited media effects. The "limited effects" model of communication emerged in the 1940s with a shift in the media effects paradigm. This shift suggested that while the media has effects on consumers' behavior such as their voting behavior, these effects are limited and influenced indirectly by interpersonal discussions and the influence of [[opinion leaders]]. Selective exposure was considered one necessary function in the early studies of media's limited power over citizens' attitudes and behaviors.&lt;ref name="LazarsfeldBerelson1948"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lazarsfeld|first1=Paul Felix|last2=Berelson|first2=Bernard|last3=Gaudet|first3=Hazel|title=The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-lnIFR02FIC&amp;q=selective+exposure|edition=2nd|year=1948|publisher=Columbia University Press|lccn=48008605|oclc=2168461|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political ads deal with selective exposure as well because people are more likely to favor a politician that agrees with their own beliefs. Another significant effect of selective exposure comes from Stroud (2010) who analyzed the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization. Using data from the 2004 [[National Annenberg Election Survey]], analysts found that over time partisan selective exposure leads to polarization.&lt;ref name="Stroud2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stroud|first1=Natalie Jomini|title=Polarization and Partisan Selective Exposure|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=60|issue=3|year=2010|pages=556–576|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01497.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is plausible because people can easily create or have access to blogs, websites, chats, and online forums where those with similar views and political ideologies can congregate. Much of the research has also shown that political interaction online tends to be polarized. Further evidence for this polarization in the political blogosphere can be found in the Lawrence et al. (2010)'s&lt;ref name="Lawrence2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Eric|last2=Sides|first2=John|last3=Farrell|first3=Henry|title=Self-Segregation or Deliberation?

According to Cass Sunstein's book, ''Republic.com'', the presence of selective exposure on the web creates an environment that breeds political polarization and extremism. Due to easy access to social media and other online resources, people are " likely to hold even stronger views than the ones they started with, and when these views are problematic, they are likely to manifest increasing hatred toward those espousing contrary beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Stavrositu, Carmen (2014). "Selective Exposure". In Harvey, Kerric (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics''. SAGE Publications. pp. 1117–1119. {{ISBN|978-1-4522-9026-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates how selective exposure can influence an individual's political beliefs and subsequently his participation in the political system.

One of the major academic debates on the concept of selective exposure is whether selective exposure contributes to people's exposure to diverse viewpoints or polarization. Scheufele and Nisbet (2012)&lt;ref name=Scheufele2012&gt;{{cite book

Ideally, true civil deliberation among citizens would be the rational exchange of non-like-minded views (or disagreement). However, many of us tend to avoid disagreement on a regular basis because we do not like to confront with others who hold views that are strongly opposed to our own. In this sense, the authors question about whether exposure to non-like-minded information brings either positive or negative effects on democratic citizenship. While there are mixed findings of peoples' willingness to participate in the political processes when they encounter disagreement, the authors argue that the issue of selectivity needs to be further examined in order to understand whether there is a truly deliberative discourse in online media environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9561">'''''Surnaturel''''' is a book written by the [[Roman-Catholic]] theologian [[Henri de Lubac]]. It stands among his most famous and controversial works.

In this book he traces the historical meaning of the word 'supernatural' and notes a shift in implication. Up to the High Middle Ages, the essential contrast was drawn between 'natural' and 'moral'. After that, the contrast was seen between 'natural and supernatural'. De Lubac is trying here to establish the correct understanding of [[Aquinas]] on this subject.

==Context==
De Lubac began work on the ideas which would eventually appear as ''Surnaturel'' in his days as a student in Hastings.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth Century Catholic Theologians: From Neoscholasticism to Nuptial Mystery'', (Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), p72&lt;/ref&gt; De Lubac published several articles in the 1930s which were to make up much of ''Surnaturel''. The development of the book itself, though, was greatly hindered by the war. In June 1940, fleeing the advancing Nazis, de Lubac left Lyon with a bag which included the notebook for ''Surnaturel'', on which he worked for several days. De Lubac stated in later years that the book had taken sufficient shape by 1941 to be ready for review; the ''nihil obstat'' was granted in February 1942. However, paper shortages prevented publication. In 1943, while being hunted by the Gestapo, de Lubac fled, again carrying his notebook, this time to Vals. He used the resources in the Vals library to continue his work on the book. Eventually, in October 1945 the ''Imprimatur'' was issued, and in 1946, the book was published (though only as an edition of 700 copies, due to ongoing paper shortages).&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
De Lubac's overall question in ''Surnaturel'' is therefore how human persons in the natural order can be interiorly directed to the order of grace that fulfils them, without in the least possessing this grace in anticipation, and without being able at all to claim it for themselves. In the book, de Lubac attempts to show how, in an attempt to answer this question, what he calls "the system of pure nature" had come to prevail in Catholic theology.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that in the Fathers and the great scholastics there was only one concrete order of history, that in which God had made humanity for himself, and in which human nature had thus been created only for a single destiny, which was supernatural. Neither the Fathers nor the scholastics, therefore, ever envisioned the possibility of a purely natural end for human persons attainable by their own intrinsic powers of cognition and volition.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lubac argues that this unified vision began to unravel in the thought of theologians such as [[Denys the Carthusian]] and, more pertinently, [[Thomas Cajetan|Cajetan]]. While Denys had argued for a natural end of the human person to which a supernatural end must be 'superadded', he did so consciously in opposition to the teaching of Thomas Aquinas. Cajetan, however, while making a similar argument to Denys, did so while claiming simply to be ''commenting on'' Thomas: he therefore introduced the idea of human nature as "a closed and sufficient whole" into Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a 'pure nature', argues de Lubac, intensified in the wake of the naturalism of Baius and Jansenius: a state of pure nature - a hypothesis according to which human persons might have been created with an end proportionate to their natural powers - was seen as necessary to protect the gratuity of the supernatural. Affirmation of such a state, argued de Lubac, overlooked the decisive difference between the created human spirit and other natures. Moreover, while allowing Catholic theologians to defend the essential integrity of fallen human nature against the Protestantism that denied it, the system effected a separation between nature and the supernatural that would prove pernicious - by rendering the latter (seemingly) superfluous. Although, de Lubac argues, the system of 'pure nature' was perceived to be a novelty when it first developed, it eventually came to be taken for granted, such that, by the twentieth century, rejecting it became synonymous with denying the gratuity of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

''Surnaturel ''is broken into four parts, which are pieced together from a number of earlier preparatory studies. 
* The first part, entitled 'Augustinianism and Baianism', examines the interpretation of Augustine by [[Michael Baius|Baius]] and [[Cornelius Jansen|Jansenius]], showing how these two early modern thinkers misconstrue Augustine's true intention. That is, de Lubac argued that, influenced by a juridical-naturalistic way of thinking foreign to Augustine (and to his disciples, including Thomas Aquinas), Baius and Jansenius in their different ways denied the gratuity of the gifts made by God to Adam. De Lubac shows how the hypothesis of 'purely natural finality' attributed to a 'purely spiritual nature' was developed to insure this gratuity.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second part, 'Spirit and Freedom in the Theological Tradition', examines one of the essential aspects of the spiritual 'nature' (both human and angelic), namely, its freedom of choice with respect to its end. De Lubac considers the tradition from the Fathers up to the seventeenth century, and provides further evidence for the claim that Aquinas, for example, never envisioned any finality for the created spirit but a supernatural one.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The third part examines the origins of the word 'supernatural', including the problematic epithet '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''superadditum''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' ('something superadded'), and the confusion of the 'supernatural' with the 'miraculous' (in the sense of a completely arbitrary addition). De Lubac shows in this section that the term 'supernatural' was first used systematically by St Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fourth part offers six 'Historical Notes' on St Thomas and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the conclusion, 'Divine Exigence and Natural Desire', de Lubac indicates why it is unnecessary to have recourse to the hypothetical system of pure nature to protect the gratuity of the beatific vision.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The publication of the work caused immediate controversy in Catholic thought. De Lubac's thought came to be associated as representing a ''[[Nouvelle Théologie]]'', a name applied to de Lubac's thought by his critics. In 1950, de Lubac was asked by the General of the Jesuits to stop teaching, and to give up working at the journal ''Recherches de Science Religieuse. ''An order was issued to withdraw from Jesuit libraries and from the trade three of his books - ''Surnaturel, Corpus Mysticum'' and ''De la Connaissance de Dieu'', as well as a 1949 article in ''Recherches'' in which de Lubac addressed some criticisms of ''Surnaturel''.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, it was widely suspected that it was his views which were attacked in the papal encyclical ''[[Humani generis|Humani Generis]]''. De Lubac was ostracised for a decade.

In the early 1960s, however, his ideas became more accepted in the Catholic hierarchy, and he was among the first summoned by [[Pope John XXIII]] to help draft the texts for Vatican II.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth Century Catholic Theologians: From Neoscholasticism to Nuptial Mystery'', (Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), p76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 de Lubac published two works:'' Le Mystere du surnaturel'', and ''Augustinisme et théologie moderne, ''which served primarily to clarify numerous objections to ''Surnaturel. Mystere ''largely followed the structure of the 1949 article with the same title in which de Lubac had responded to some criticisms of ''Surnaturel''. ''Augustinisme ''was a reprint of the first part of ''Surnaturel'', enlarged with some new texts.

==Editions==
* ''Surnaturel: études historiques'', (Paris:Aubier, 1946).
* A new French edition issued by (Paris: Desclée de Brouwer, 1991) contains a complete translation into French of all Greek and Latin citations. 
* There is not yet (2018) an English translation

The '''Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST)''' was a 15-metre diameter [[radio telescope]] located at the [[La Silla Observatory]] in [[Chile]]. The telescope was built in 1987 as a combined project between [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] and [[Onsala Space Observatory]], with contributions from Finland and Australia.&lt;ref name="oso"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chalmers.se/rss/oso-en/observations/sest

'''Topophysis''' occurs when [[Scion (grafting)|scions]] (young shoots and twigs), buddings, or root cuttings continue to grow in the same way after [[grafting]] as they had while growing on the [[ortet]].&lt;ref name=olese1978&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olese|first1=P. O.|title=On cyclophysis and topophysis.|journal=Silvae Genetica|date=1978|volume=27|issue=5|pages=173–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bredmose1996&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bredmose|first1=N.|last2=Hansen|first2=J.|title=Topophysis affects the potential of axillary bud growth, fresh biomass accumulation and specific fresh weight in single-stem roses (Rosa hybrida L.).|journal=Annals of Botany|date=1996|volume=78|issue=2|pages=215–222|doi=10.1006/anbo.1996.0115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the scion or propagule grows in the same branchlike way, it is called [[Glossary_of_plant_morphology#Stems|plagiotropic]] growth.&lt;ref name=bredmose1996/&gt; [[Glossary_of_plant_morphology#Stems|Orthotropic]] growth is when the scion begins to grow in the same upward manner as the ortet.&lt;ref name=bredmose1996/&gt; The duration of plagiotropic growth habit depends on the tree species and developmental stage (whether bud or scion) when cut, before the [[ramet]] changes to orthotropic growth and matures.&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt; This maturation is dependent on the position of the scion growth in relation to the axillary buds.&lt;ref name=fd2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Vegetative Propagation, Definitions and Terminology|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad224e/ad224e02.htm|website=FAO Corporate Document Repository|publisher=Forestry Department|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt; The rate of maturation is decreased in lateral shoots for every order they are removed from the apical meristem and the total distance grown from the apical meristem.&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt;

[[Hans Molisch]] first introduced the term topohysis in 1915 in response to [[Hermann Vöchting|Hermann Vöchting’s]] 1904 ''[[Araucaria excelsa]]'' cutting propagation experiment.&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt; Vöchting recorded that cuttings from the terminal shoots immediately developed into normal plants with orthotropic growth. Cuttings from the first order lateral branches first developed into plants resembling side branches (plagiotropic  growth) before growing orthotropically. Cuttings from the second order lateral branches grew into horizontal shoots with no side branches for the longest time before growing orthotropically.&lt;ref name=olese1978/&gt; He concluded that the onset of axillary bud growth is mainly affected by the position relative to the ortets axillary bud.

William J. Robbins addressed the nature of topophysis in a 1964 paper in which he considered it to be a matter of somatic inheritance. See "Topophysis, a problem in somatic inheritance". Proc. Am. Philos. Soc. 108: 395-403.

Founded by what is now the [[United Methodist Church]], Puget Sound is governed today by an independent board of trustees. The college maintains a relationship and affiliation with the United Methodist Church based on shared history and values held in common, including the importance of access to a high-quality education, academic freedom, social justice, environmental stewardship, and global focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/united-methodist-church-affiliation/ |title=United Methodist Church Affiliation |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date=2017 |accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University of Puget Sound was founded by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1888 in downtown Tacoma. The idea for a college in Tacoma originated with [[Charles Henry Fowler]], who had previously been the president of [[Northwestern University]]. Fowler was in Tacoma for a Methodist conference when he spoke of his vision of a Christian institution of learning in the area. The conference released a report:

{{quote|We commit ourselves...heartily to the building up within the bounds of the conference of an institution of learning which shall by its ample facilities...command the respect and patronage of Methodist people within the bounds of the territory...and so by united and prayerful efforts advance to the establishment of a school of learning which shall be a praise in all the land.}}

Two cities vied for the location of the school: [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]] and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. The committee eventually decided on Tacoma. A charter was drawn up and filed in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] on March 17, 1888. This date marks the legal beginning of the school. At this time, the school's legal title was "The [[Puget Sound]] University".&lt;ref&gt;Klahowya 1913 - University of Puget Sound Yearbook - Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1890, UPS opened its doors, taking in 88 students.

The beginnings of the school were marked by moral conviction: students were warned against intoxicating liquors, visits to saloons, gambling, tobacco use, and obscene drawings or writings on the college grounds. The university also had a financially tumultuous beginning. There was no endowment and the school often struggled for funds to pay the professors. It moved locations three times in 13 years and, at one time, the school was merged with [[Portland University]] (former campus is now the [[University of Portland]]). It opened up a year later (1899) back in Tacoma on the 9th and G Street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=342805050&amp;size=o Walter Davis, "University of Puget Sound," in ''Told By the Pioneers'', Works Progress Administration, 3 vols. 1937-38; scanned copy archived at the Flickr page of the University of Puget Sound Department of Politics and Government]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, the school was "reborn" and re-incorporated as a different entity, different trustees, and a different name: the "University of Puget Sound".

[[File:UPS - Warner Gym 01.jpg|thumb|right|Warner Gym, one of the original 1924 buildings]]
The character of the school changed dramatically during the presidency of Edward H. Todd (1913–1942), who worked tirelessly to bring financial and academic stability. During his tenure, the "Million Dollar Campaign" was started, raising $1,022,723 for buildings, equipment, and endowment. With this money, the campus moved in 1924&lt;ref&gt;1924 Tamanawas&lt;/ref&gt; to its current location in the residential [[North Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington|North End of Tacoma]], with five buildings, setting a stylistic tone for the institution. In 1914 the university was renamed the "College of Puget Sound".

President R. Franklin Thompson (1942–1973) led a massive physical and institutional expansion: During this era almost all of the university's buildings were constructed. In 1960, the university's name changed from the "College of Puget Sound" back to the "University of Puget Sound", as it is known today.

Phillip M. Phibbs presided from 1973 to 1992 and endeavored to change the tone of Puget Sound. In 1980, the university divested its attachment with the Methodist Church, and an independent board of trustees assumed full fiscal responsibility of the university. Also during this time, the university began to focus on undergraduate education excellence, phasing out all off-campus programs except the law school and most graduate programs. During this time the library collections were broadened and the faculty greatly expanded.

With the advent of President Susan Resneck Pierce (1992–2003), the law school was promptly sold to [[Seattle University]], in a move that was calculated to focus the university's resources on its undergraduate campus. During her tenure, the university completed almost $100 million of new construction and renovation. [[Collins Memorial Library]] and four academic buildings were renovated, and Wyatt Hall was constructed to house the growing class and office space needs of the Humanities Department. Trimble Residence Hall was constructed, bringing on-campus student residency to 65%. SAT scores rose from 1067 to 1253 and the endowment more than tripled.

Puget Sound's president from 2003 to early 2016 was Ronald R. Thomas, affectionately called "Ron Thom" by many students, a scholar of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[literature]], and the former vice-President of [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]].

In February 2016, the university announced the selection of Dr. Isiaah Crawford to be its next president, upon Thomas' retirement. President Crawford assumed office on July 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/office-of-the-president/biography/|title=About the President|last=|first=|date=2016-02-26|website=|publisher=University of Puget Sound|accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UPS - Harned &amp; Thompson Halls along Union Avenue 01.jpg|thumb|right|Harned and Thompson Halls, along Union Avenue. Harned Hall is at center, with wings of Thompson Hall on either side.]]

Thompson Hall, home of the sciences at the university, underwent a major renovation, including the construction of a new wing (Harned Hall, completed 2006) on the building's western side against Union Avenue and extensive renovations to the current wings and courtyard to allow for upgraded labs and facilities. The entire project was completed in mid 2008. The entire complex is now known locally as "The Science Center at Puget Sound." The now completely enclosed courtyard contains a striking [[Plexiglas]] structure where a coffee shop, Oppenheimer Cafe, is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/news-and-events/campus-news/details/344/ |title=University of Puget Sound Announces Dedication of Harned Hall |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2013 Puget Sound opened Thomas Hall, a residence hall for upper-division students featuring 11 "houses" organized around five academic-residential programs: the Humanities Program, environmental outdoor leadership, international experiential learning, entrepreneurship, and the Honors Program. The hall is home for 135 students, and includes a seminar room, four studies, and an event/meeting space for approximately 150 people, accommodating special events, guest lectures, performances and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/strategic-planning/the-master-plan/projects/new-residence-hall/ |title=Commencement Hall |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

The campus is located in [[North Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington|North Tacoma, Washington]] in a primarily residential setting a few minutes' walk from downtown Proctor and the [[Sixth Avenue (Tacoma)|Sixth Avenue]] district.

The campus is made up of mainly brick buildings in the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]]- [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] architectural style. Buildings are mostly arranged into quads. The three main quads are the North Quad and South Quad, which contain residence halls, and Karlen Quad, which contains Jones Hall, Collins Memorial Library and the Music Building. The library was designed by Tacoma architect [[Silas E. Nelsen]] in 1954. It was later renovated.

President Thomas recently wrote a piece explaining his opinion that new buildings should maintain the gothic style that the university is known for.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Ronald R. [http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/strategic-planning/the-master-plan/mission--goals/sacred-spaces/ UPS Master Plan: Sacred Spaces]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic buildings===
Harned Hall, named for alumnus and local real estate developer H.C. "Joe" Harned, was dedicated on September 29, 2006. The building is {{convert|51000|sqft|m2}} and cost $25 million to construct. It was designed and built to meet the [[Green building#US Green Building Council|US Green Building Council]]'s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver Standard. The building features labs for [[biology]], [[geology]], [[chemistry]], [[environmental science]], and [[physics]], a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} courtyard with a crystalline glass gazebo in the center, a [[Foucault pendulum]] designed by Alan Thorndike, as well as [[Gray whale]] skeleton named Willy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/strategic-planning/the-master-plan/projects/science-center/science-on-display/ |title=Science on Display |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UPS - Wyatt Hall 03.jpg|thumb|right|Wyatt Hall]]
After Harned Hall was completed, the university began a $38 million renovation of Thompson Hall, the "old" science building. Harned and Thompson Halls form a square with a courtyard in the middle, and are collectively named the Science Center. Thompson Hall has an area of {{convert|121000|sqft|m2}} and was originally constructed in 1968. The renovation was completed in spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Office of University Relations. [http://www.ups.edu/documents/CaseforThompsonHall.pdf The Science Center at Puget Sound]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyatt Hall is the second newest academic building on campus, dedicated in 2003. It houses the English, History,  Foreign Languages &amp; Literature, Politics &amp; Government, Philosophy, Honors, Science Technology &amp; Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/x3013.xml Department of Science Technology &amp; Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219234159/http://www.ups.edu/x3013.xml |date=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classics, and Religion departments. Many of the classrooms in the building are seminar style, meaning a circle of tables that students sit at to encourage discussion between students and the professor, rather than a lecture. The building features glass art by [[Dale Chihuly]] that represents the ivy leaves covering the campus buildings.

The Wheelock Student Center, known as the "SUB" (Student Union Building) is the main hub of life on campus. It features a rotunda used for lectures and catered events, KUPS (the campus radio station), the cafeteria and dining area, Diversions Cafe (a student-run coffee shop), and The Cellar (a student-run pizza parlor).

[[File:UPS - McIntyre Hall 01.jpg|thumb|left|McIntyre Hall]]
Other buildings include McIntyre Hall, home of the School of Business and Leadership, the Departments of Economics, Sociology and Anthropology, and [[International Political Economy]]; Howarth Hall, home of the School of Education, Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Career and Employment Services, and more; Jones Hall, home of theatre arts, communication studies, and several administrative offices, including the Office of the President; and the Music Building (which is the only building on campus without a name). Kittredge Hall, the original student union building, now houses the art department and Kittredge Gallery. The Gallery is now affiliated with Tacoma Art Museum.

Collins Memorial Library&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/library Collins Memorial Library]&lt;/ref&gt; houses over 400,000 books and over 130,000 periodicals, is a partial federal government repository, and has substantial microform holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/x19192.xml Collins Library Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928084124/http://www.ups.edu/x19192.xml |date=2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library was named after former trustee Everill S. Collins. The current Library building was built in 1954. A larger addition was completed in 1974. In 2000, a major renovation brought new technology and media resources into the Library's spaces, making it one of the most popular campus gathering places for students.

Construction for the William T. and Gail T. Weyerhaeuser Center for Health Sciences began in spring 2010. At {{convert|42500|sqft|m2}}, the center provides the resources and flexibility needed to support new areas of study in the fields of health and behavioral sciences. Specially designed to encourage cross-disciplinary interaction, the center houses Puget Sound's undergraduate departments in exercise science and psychology, graduate programs in occupational and physical therapy, and interdisciplinary program in neuroscience. Designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson/Seattle, Weyerhaeuser Hall conforms to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/about/strategic-planning/the-master-plan/projects/weyerhaeuser-hall/ |title=The William T. and Gail T.

===Residential buildings===

[[File:UPS - Schiff Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Schiff Residence Hall]]Harrington, Schiff, Anderson/Langdon, Smith, and Oppenheimer halls make up what is called the "North Quad", and Todd/Phibbs, Regester, Seward, Trimble, and Thomas Hall make up the "South Quad." Theme Row, which runs to the south end of campus, contains around 20 different theme houses that students may apply to live in.  The Music House is the longest standing house, originating in 1989. After the Music House, the Outhaus and the Track and Cross Country Theme House are the two longest standing houses. There are also about 55 non-theme university-owned houses available.

Currently around 65% of students live on campus. Students are required to live on campus for their first two years of enrollment at the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pugetsound.edu/admission/faq/faq-student-life/ FAQ - Student Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the university upgraded residential Internet bandwidth by more than two-fold, to 100 [[Mbit/s]]. During that year, a new connection to the Washington State K-20 Educational Network was also installed, bringing the university's aggregate [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to 150 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.pugetsound.edu/TSmaintenance/?p=872 Puget Sound Technology Services Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; Further bandwidth upgrades have brought student bandwidth to 250 Mbit/s for the 2012-13 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ups.edu/technologyservices/2012/04/11/residential-bandwidth-increases-to-250-mbps/ Puget Sound Technology Services Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
[[File:UPS - Peyton Field scoreboard 01.jpg|thumb|Scoreboard, Peyton Field]]

The Puget Sound athletics teams are known as the "Loggers" with "Grizz the Logger" as their mascot. The Loggers participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] [[Northwest Conference]], competing with [[George Fox University]], [[Lewis and Clark College]], [[Linfield College]], [[Pacific University]], [[Pacific Lutheran University]], [[Whitman College]], [[Whitworth University]], and [[Willamette University]].

===Varsity sports===
The University offers 23 different varsity sports teams: Men's [[Baseball]], Men's and Women's [[Basketball]], Men's and Women's [[Sport rowing|Crew]], Men's and Women's [[Cross country running|Cross Country]], Men's [[American football|Football]], Men's and Women's [[Golf]], Women's [[Lacrosse]], Men's and Women's [[Soccer]], Women's [[Softball]], Men's and Women's [[swimming (sport)|Swimming]], Men's and Women's [[Tennis]], Men's and Women's Indoor and Outdoor [[Track &amp; Field]], and Women's [[Volleyball]].  On a minor note, former national soccer team coach [[Bruce Arena]] got his coaching start at Puget Sound in 1976 as head of the men's soccer team.

===Club sports===

There are both men's and women's club soccer teams, as well as men's club lacrosse (which competes in the [[Pacific Northwest Collegiate Lacrosse League]]). The university also has a men's club [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]] team known as the "Postmen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/a/upsultimate.com/www/ |title=UPS Ultimate |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a women's club Ultimate team known as "Clear Cut".

The university is well known for its successful men's rugby club. The club has achieved regional and national success over the past three seasons under coach Mark Sullivan. In 2012 the club was ranked 10th in the nation for small college rugby and traveled to Cal Maritime University in Vallejo, California for the regional tournament. The success of the men's rugby club is attributed to the hard work of the players and continual dedication of their coaches. Also, an intense rivalry has developed between the UPS rugby club and the Seattle University rugby club. Known as the Seatac Cup, UPS has achieved eight straight victories over their rivals. In 2012, the victory over Seattle University clinched the Loggers' playoff spot.

The UPS Loggers hockey team was founded in 2005 and is currently an [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] division II team.  The team's most prominent victories include defeating the University of Washington Huskies in a 3-game series in the 2006-2007 season, and the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the 2007-2008 season.  Loggers hockey is subsidized by ASUPS (the Associated Students of UPS) student body and ticket sales for home games.  Home games are currently played at the Sprinker Ice Arena in south Tacoma.  Players come from the student body, and mostly consist of students hailing from Canada, Washington, Colorado, Minnesota, and states on the East Coast.

===Achievements===

Several sports teams have achieved some degree of success in recent years:
*The men's basketball team won three straight Northwest Conference championships beginning in 2004, with an average .826 winning percentage over the 2004, 2005, and 2006 seasons. In 2005, the [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] Loggers defeated the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] Highlanders of the [[University of California, Riverside]], making it their first Division I defeat since the 1970s. In the 2009 regular season, the Loggers went an undefeated 16-0 in Northwest Conference play, becoming the first team in conference history to do so, capturing the conference title in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/mbasketball.xml University of Puget Sound :: Basketball (M)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502170129/http://www.ups.edu/mbasketball.xml |date=2006-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*From 1992 to 1995 the UPS women's Cross-Country team were national champions. This tremendous 4-year run earned coach Sam Ring coach of the year honors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[NAIA national women's cross country championship|NAIA Women's Cross-Country Records Page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

===Traditions and events===
In 2013 Puget Sound celebrated its 125th anniversary with a series of special events, anniversary programs, and shared memories by Loggers past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/125 |title=125th Anniversary: Celebrating University of Puget Sound |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801043114/http://www.pugetsound.edu/125/ |archive-date=2014-08-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrating the milestone of 125 years in the community, Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland declared March 17, 2013, to be "University of Puget Sound Day." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/news-and-events/campus-news/details/1140/ |title=City of Tacoma Declares March 17, 2013 "University of Puget Sound Day" |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LogJam! is a campuswide celebration that ends the first week of fall classes. Tables are set around the perimeter of Todd Field and the Event Lawn, and clubs and teams set up to recruit potential members.

Foolish Pleasures is an annual student film festival showing films written, directed, acted, and produced by students.

[[Midnight breakfast]] is a celebration in the student union building, which occurs each semester on the last day of classes.

====The Hatchet====
The [[Hatchet]] is the official symbol of sports teams at the University of Puget Sound. It was first discovered in 1906 when students were digging up a barn at the old campus. They decided to carve their class year into it. This became a tradition of sorts, as the seniors would hand the hatchet to the juniors on senior recognition day. This turned into a competition where each class would try to possess the hatchet for as long as possible. It disappeared for 15 years until it was anonymously mailed to former President R. Franklin Thompson. Thompson displayed it in a trophy case in Jones Hall, where it mysteriously disappeared again, only to resurface at a [[homecoming]] game in 1988. In 1998, the hatchet's return was negotiated through an intermediary, and it was permanently displayed in a display case in the Wheelock Student Center. It was stolen in 1999 during a false fire alarm in one of the dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;ASUPS, [http://asups.ups.edu/welcome/history/default.aspx The Tradition of the UPS Hatchet]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2006 (homecoming) a student rappelled into the football field at halftime, brandishing "the hatchet". It was later revealed by the student newspaper ''The Trail'' that this hatchet is a replica of the actual hatchet, commissioned by the former student government administration without the knowledge of the student senate. The replica hatchet was painstakingly carved to look exactly like the original, using over 150 photos as a guide.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The original hatchet was finally returned to President Ronald Thomas in 2008 by two anonymous alumni and was displayed at Homecoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/offices-services/office-of-communications/arches/archive/back-issues/arches-archive/winter-2009/the-hatchet-men/ |title=The hatchet men |author=Ron Thomas |publisher=University of Puget Sound |date=Winter 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sustainability====
The campus has a notable recent history of [[sustainability]]. On February 10, 2005, President Ronald R. Thomas signed the [[Talloires Declaration]], committing the University to certain standards regarding sustainability. The Sustainability Advisory Committee, consisting of one faculty co-chair, one staff co-chair, and a mix of faculty, staff and student volunteers, organizes the majority of sustainability efforts on campus. These efforts have included:

*''[[Fair trade coffee]]'': The student-run Diversions Café serves only organically-grown, [[fair trade]] coffee. In 2005, {{convert|8975|lb}} of coffee was consumed by students, faculty, and the campus community. University of Puget Sound was the first college in the [[Northwest United States|Northwest]] to offer fair trade coffee exclusively.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;[http://www.ups.edu/facts.xml P.S. Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911180522/https://www.ups.edu/facts.xml |date=2006-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Sustainable Move-Out'': Starting in 2005, the University organized a sustainable move-out program during finals week. Mixed-material [[recycling]] dumpsters were placed near all [[residence hall]]s, allowing students to recycle rather than simply throwing all unwanted items away.
*''Sustainability Mugs'': Upon entering the college in 2005, all students were presented with a "sustainability mug" imprinted with the UPS logo. Students were encouraged to re-use the mug to get coffee instead of using paper cups.
*''No-Waste Picnic'': A 2005 picnic welcoming incoming freshmen and their families to the campus produced a surprising ONE bag of trash for over 1700 people. This was accomplished by using recyclable paper and plastic products.

In 2007, President Thomas signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment on behalf of the university.

===Fraternities and sororities===
[[File:UPS - Sigma Chi 01.jpg|thumb|right|Sigma Chi house, University of Puget Sound]]
UPS is home to four [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]] and five sororities. 20% of male students and 29% of female students are involved in Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske Guide to Colleges 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Represented fraternities include, [[Phi Delta Theta]] (1848/1952), [[Sigma Chi]] (1855/1950), and recently reinstated [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] (1856/2010) and [[Beta Theta Pi]] (1839/2013). Represented sororities and women's fraternities include [[Pi Beta Phi]] (1867), [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] (1870), [[Alpha Phi]] (1872), [[Gamma Phi Beta]] (1874), and [[Delta Delta Delta]] (1888).
Puget Sound has a "deferred recruitment", which means that fraternities, sororities, and their members are not allowed to have any official contact with freshmen outside of class, athletics or club activities until the organized recruitment events in the first two weeks of the spring semester. Freshmen may not join a chapter until January. In the fall, chapters are permitted to give "snap bids" to upperclassmen, as well as participate in an organized fall recruitment open only to upperclassmen. A ceremony called "Crossover" took place annually on the third weekend of spring semester. Members of the Greek community partake in an entire day of celebration to honor the new members as they run across the field to their selected fraternity.

The university is one of just five independent colleges in the Northwest granted a charter by [[Phi Beta Kappa]], which claims to be the nation's most prestigious academic honor society.

Previously, several other organizations, including [[Sigma Nu]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[ Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] were represented on campus, however those chapters have all closed for a variety of reasons.

===Media===
[[KUPS]] 90.1FM (The Sound) is a student-run, non-commercial, educational college radio station that began in 1968. In 2002, KUPS began streaming its standard live programming online to the world. The radio station broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and serves the greater Tacoma area with programming in a variety of genres. KUPS has earned various awards while broadcasting over the years. In 2005, KUPS was named by [[The Princeton Review]] as one of the best college radio stations in the country (#12). In 2007, KUPS was ranked #9 by the Princeton Review in the Top Ten Best College Radio Stations in the Country. Most recently, in the spring of 2010, [[MTV]] honored KUPS with the national title of Best College Radio Station at the MTVu Woodie Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kups.ups.edu/?p=374 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604164633/http://kups.ups.edu/?p=374 |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2011, KUPS was ranked third in a list of "10 great college radio stations" in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/college-inc/post/10-great-college-radio-stations/2011/10/13/gIQAvRM2hL_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Daniel | last=de Vise | title=10 Great College Radio Stations | date=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Trail'' is an independent student-run organization that provides Puget Sound students, faculty, staff, and the local community with a credible weekly newspaper that serves as a comprehensive source of information, entertainment and discourse relevant to its readership. ''The Trail'' provides opportunities for students interested in journalism and acts as an archival record for the university. In addition, The Trail serves as a link between Puget Sound and the greater Tacoma community and provides an open forum for student opinion and discourse within the university.

"Crosscurrents" is the school's literary and arts magazine and was established in 1957. Crosscurrents is published two times during the academic year, once during the Fall semester and once during the Spring semester. Magazines are free to the campus community. It is staffed by students and publishes student artwork, photography, prose, poetry, and the occasional miscellaneous piece.  Crosscurrents also features a guest artist or writer in each issue- usually a notable person from the pacific northwest who is interviewed about their work.

"Wetlands" is a recent student-organized magazine focusing on sexual exploration and gender expression to encourage inclusive and open-minded conversations across the campus community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetlandsmagazine.wordpress.com/about/ Wetlands Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/wetlandsmag/docs/wetlandsfall12 |title=Volume 1 Issue 2 by Anya Callahan |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine features community-submitted photography, poetry, and prose.

"Elements" is the school's student-run science magazine. Published twice during the academic year, Elements primarily contains student articles about science, research, math, the environment, and technology, as well as student artwork. Copies of Elements are free and are distributed at the end of Fall semester and Spring semester.

"Black Ice" (or the Black Student Union Zine) is a student magazine by the focused on issues for the betterment of all students of color. The magazine is published by The Black Student Union, which was founded in 1968 making it one of the university's oldest clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/black_ice/ Black Ice]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3253">A '''vector addition system (VAS)'''  is one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems. Vector addition systems were introduced by [[Richard M. Karp]] and Raymond E. Miller in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karp|first1=Richard M.|last2=Miller|first2=Raymond E.|title=Parallel program schemata|journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences|date=May 1969|volume=3|issue=2|pages=147–195|doi=10.1016/S0022-0000(69)80011-5|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0000(69)80011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generalized to '''vector addition systems with states (VASS)''' by [[John Hopcroft|John E. Hopcroft]] and Jean-Jacques Pansiot in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopcroft|first1=John E.|last2=Pansiot|first2=Jean-Jacques|title=On the reachability problem for 5-dimensional vector addition systems|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|date=1979|volume=8|issue=2|pages=135–159|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both VAS and VASS are equivalent in many ways to [[Petri net]]s introduced earlier by [[Carl Adam Petri]]. [[File:Vector addition with states.svg|thumb|Example of a vector addition with states. In this VASS, e.g., q(1,2) can be reached from p(0,0), but q(0,0) cannot be reached from p(0,0).]]

== Informal definition ==

A ''vector addition system'' consists of a finite set of [[integer]] [[row vector|vectors]]. An initial vector is seen as the initial values of multiple counters, and the vectors of the VAS are seen as updates. These counters may never drop below zero. More precisely, given an initial vector with non negative values, the vectors of the VAS can be added componentwise, given that every intermediate vector has non negative values. A ''vector addition system with states'' is a VAS equipped with control states. More precisely, it  is a finite [[directed graph]] with [[Directed graph#Basic terminology|arcs]] labelled by [[integer]] vectors. VASS have the same restriction that the counter values should never drop below zero.

== Formal definitions and basic terminology ==

* A ''VAS'' is a finite set &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* A ''VASS'' is a finite [[directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;(Q, T)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq Q \times \mathbb{Z}^d \times Q&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Transitions ===

* Let &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt; be a VAS. Given a vector &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;, the vector &lt;math&gt;u + v&lt;/math&gt; can be ''reached'', in one transition, if &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u + v \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;(Q, T)&lt;/math&gt; be a VASS. Given a ''configuration'' &lt;math&gt;(p, u) \in Q \times \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;, the configuration &lt;math&gt;(q, u + v)&lt;/math&gt; can be ''reached'', in one transition, if &lt;math&gt;(p, v, q) \in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u + v \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;.
