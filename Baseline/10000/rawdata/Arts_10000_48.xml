An '''addendum''', in general, is an addition required to be made to a document by its author subsequent to its printing or publication. It comes from the [[Latin]] verbal phrase {{lang|la|addendum est}}, being the [[gerundive]] form of the verb {{lang|la|addere}}&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary ed. Marchant &amp; Charles&lt;/ref&gt; ({{literal translation|'give toward'|lk=on}}) meaning "(that which) must be added." {{lang|la|Addenda}} is from the plural form {{lang|la|addenda sunt}}, "(those things) which must be added" (see also [[memorandum]], [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]], [[corrigenda]]).

==Specific uses==

===In books===
An addendum may explain inconsistencies or expand the existing work or otherwise explain or update the information found in the main work, especially if any such problems were detected too late to correct the main work. For example, the main work could have had already been printed and the cost of destroying the batch and reprinting it deemed too high.  As such, addenda may come in many forms — a separate letter included with the work, [[text file]]s on a digital medium, or any similar carrier. It may serve to notify the reader of errors present, as an [[errata]].

===In contracts and other legal documents===
In other documents, most importantly in legal [[contract]]s, an addendum is an additional document not included in the main part of the contract.  It is an ad hoc item, usually compiled and executed after the main document, which contains additional terms, obligations or information.  An Additional Agreement to a contract is often an addendum to a contract.

It is to be distinguished from other appendices to a contract which may contain additional terms, specifications, provisions, standard forms or other information which have been separated out from the main body of the contract.  These are called:
an '''appendix''' (general term),
an '''annex''' (which includes information, usually large texts or tables, which are independent stand-alone works which have been included in the contract, such as a tax table, or a large excerpt from a book), or an '''exhibit''' (often used in court cases),

Similarly an '''attachment''' is used usually for e-mails, while an '''enclosure''' is used with a paper letter.

Addenda are often used in standard form contracts to make changes or add specific detail.  For example, an addendum might be added to a contract to change a date or add details as to delivery of goods or pricing.  The addendum should be referenced in the contract, or the contract should be referenced in the addendum, so that it is clear  which contract the addendum is modifying.

A '''rider''' is often used to add specific detail and especially specific conditions to a ''standard'' contract such as an insurance contract.  A rider may also be added to [[rider (law)|a piece of legislation]].

'''Schedules''' and '''exhibits''' are sub-categories of addenda, with schedules being related to numerical and time information, such as pricing and time-schedules, and exhibits used for examples of standard forms or additional information necessary for the parties to understand and/or comply with their contractual obligations.  Outside of contract law, exhibits are often used in legal documents filed with a court as part of judicial proceedings such as motions, briefs and the submission of different types of evidence for inclusion in the record of trial of a particular case.

===In legal judgments===
Juries in inquests or trials may amplify or explain their decisions by issuing a commentary known as a '''rider''', as in the prosecution of [[Harold Greenwood (solicitor)|Harold Greenwood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = Colin | authorlink = Colin Wilson| title = Encyclopedia of Murder| year = 1984| isbn = 0-330-28300-6 | publisher = [[Pan Books]]| page = 277}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the inquest of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/3708063/Jean-Charles-de-Menezes-inquest-Jury-reaches-open-verdict.html |title=Jean Charles de Menezes inquest: Jury reaches open verdict - Telegraph |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-22 |location=London |first1=Richard |last1=Edwards |first2=Gordon |last2=Rayner |date=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In medical transcription===
Addendum is also used if the medical care staff is inserting additional information about the patient.

===In engineering===
{{also|List of gear nomenclature#Addendum{{!}}Addendum in list of gear nomenclature}}
The addendum is the [[radial distance]] from the [[pitch circle]] of a cogwheel, worm wheel, etc., to the crests of the teeth or ridges. This is also the radial height of a tooth above the pitch circle.

'''American Abstract Artists''' ('''AAA''') was formed in 1936 in [[New York City]], to promote and foster public understanding of [[abstract art]]. American Abstract Artists exhibitions, publications, and lectures helped to establish the organization as a major forum for the exchange and discussion of ideas, and for presenting abstract art to a broader public. The American Abstract Artists group contributed to the development and acceptance of abstract art in the [[United States]] and has a historic role in its [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', exhibition catalog. Sidney Mishkin Gallery, Baruch College, 1996. Text by Sandra Kraskin. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few artists’ organizations to survive from the [[Great Depression]] and continue into the 21st century.

==History==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Painting No. 48 - Marsden Hartley - overall.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Marsden Hartley]] (American, 1877–1943). ''Painting No. 48'', 1913. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
During the 1930s, abstract art was viewed with critical opposition and there was little support from [[art galleries]] and [[museums]]. The American Abstract Artists group was established in 1936 as a forum for discussion and debate of abstract art and to provide exhibition opportunities when few other possibilities existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', Sandra Kraskin. p 5, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 AAA issued a “General Prospectus.” It outlined the purpose of the organization and the importance of exhibitions in promoting the growth and acceptance of abstract art in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, ''Archives of American Art Journal'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (1974), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

AAA held its first exhibition in 1937 at the Squibb Gallery in New York City. This was the most extensive and widely attended exhibition of American [[abstract painting]] and [[sculpture]] outside of a museum during the 1930s.For the 1937 exhibition AAA produced its first print portfolio of original zinc plate [[lithographs]], instead of documenting the exhibit with a catalog.&lt;ref name="Larsen, Susan C. p 3"&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Future exhibitions and publications would establish AAA as a major forum for the discussion and presentation of new abstract and [[non-objective art]].&lt;ref&gt;''American Abstract Artists, The Language of Abstraction'', exhibition catalog. Betty Parsons Gallery, Marilyn Pearl Gallery, 1979. Text by Susan Larson. p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential critics dismissed American abstract art as too [[European culture|European]] and therefore “un-American”. There was extensive hostile criticism of AAA exhibits in New York City newspapers and art magazines of the time.&lt;ref name="Abstract Art p 5"&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', Sandra Kraskin. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  American abstract art was struggling to win acceptance and AAA personified this. The 1938 Yearbook addressed criticisms levied against abstract art by the press and public. It also featured essays related to principles behind and the practice of making abstract art. In 1940, AAA printed a [[broadside (printing)|broadside]] titled “How Modern is the [[Museum of Modern Art]]?” which was handed out at a protest in front of MOMA.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, p 4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the Museum of Modern Art had a policy of featuring European abstraction while endorsing American [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]] and [[American scene painting|scene painting]]. This policy helped entrench the notion that abstraction was foreign to the American experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', Sandra Kraskin. p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year AAA produced a 12-page pamphlet: “The Art Critics – ! How Do They Serve the Public? What Do They Say? How Much Do They Know? Let’s Look at the Record.” The AAA publication quoted critics, highlighting misstatements and contradictions in the press.  The pamphlet excoriated notable ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' critic [[Royal Cortissoz]] for his rigid loyalty to traditionalism, his patent distaste for abstract and modern art, and generally for what the pamphlet regarded as his "resistance to knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanabstractartists.org/history/artcritics/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620045921/http://www.americanabstractartists.org/history/artcritics/ |archive-date=June 20, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also characterized the aesthetic vacillations of Thomas Craven, critic of the ''[[New York American]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://arthistorians.info/cravent&lt;/ref&gt; as opportunistic.  In 1936, Craven labeled Picasso's work "Bohemian infantilism".  The ensuing years would see a growing public appreciation for abstract art until, in 1939, the critic made an about-face and lauded Picasso for his "unrivaled inventiveness".  The pamphlet applauded [[Henry McBride (art critic)|Henry McBride]] of the ''New York Sun'' and [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]] of the ''New Yorker'' for their critical efforts regarding abstract art.  "The Art Critics" showed the lack of knowledge the critics from New York City newspapers and art publications had about developments in 20th-century art.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, p 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

AAA combated prevailing hostile attitudes toward abstraction and prepared the way for its acceptance after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Abstract Art p 5" /&gt; AAA was a precursor to [[abstract expressionism]] by helping abstract art discover its identity in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, p 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1940s the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] gained momentum and throughout the mid-1940s and 1950s Abstract Expressionism dominated the American avant-garde. American Abstract Artists continued its mandate as an advocate for abstract art.&lt;ref name="Abstract Art p 25"&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', Sandra Kraskin. p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

American Abstract Artists is active today. To date the organization has produced over 75 exhibitions of its membership in museums and galleries across the United States.  AAA has published 5 Journals, in addition to brochures, books, catalogs, and has hosted critical panels and symposia.  AAA distributes its published materials internationally to cultural organizations.&lt;ref&gt;''Continuum: In Celebration of the 70th Anniversary of AAA'', exhibition press release. St. Peter's College Art Gallery, O'Toole Library, Jersey City, NJ (March 21 – April 25, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; American Abstract Artist produces print portfolios by its membership. AAA print portfolios are in the collections of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], Museum of Modern Art, [[Tate]] in [[London]],&lt;ref name="Abstract Art p 25" /&gt; and the [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="Larsen, Susan C. p 3" /&gt;

In 2014  [[Harry Holtzman]] and [[George L.K. Morris]],  founding members of the American Abstract Artists were paired  in an intimate 2-man exhibit, curated by Kinney Frelinghuysen  and Madalena Holtzman, and designed to evoke an informal conversation between the two artists. [[George L.K. Morris Harry Holtzman Pioneers of American Modernism: Points of Contact]]. Essays by T. Kinney Frelinghuysen, Madalena Holtzman, Wietse Coppes. Catalogue published on the occasion of the exhibition from June 26 to October 12, 2014 at the [[Frelinghuysen Morris House and Studio]] Lenox MA. This exhibition marked also the beginning of a collaboration between the Estates of [[George L.K. Morris]] and Harry Holtzman, with support of the [[RKD - Netherlands Institute for Art History]]. The collaboration aims at sharing, editing and exhibiting new historical materials related and connected to the world of abstract art of the seminal period of the 1930s and 1940s in Europe and in the USA. For this reason in this first show will be present also the works of other European protagonists of the time like [[Jean Hélion]], [[Cesar Domela]], and [[Ben Nicholson]].
A project, that duly enlarged and in the details curated will be evolving into a wider exhibition initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mondriaan.nl/news/view/tentoonstelling_morris_holtzman |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140726185501/http://www.mondriaan.nl/news/view/tentoonstelling_morris_holtzman |archive-date=July 26, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frelinghuysen.org/news/38-season-opens-june-26-with-pioneers-of-american-modernism.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809064744/http://www.frelinghuysen.org/news/38-season-opens-june-26-with-pioneers-of-american-modernism.html |archive-date=August 9, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An Antology of Chance Operations.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover.]]

'''''An Anthology of Chance Operations''''' (An Anthology) was an [[artist's book]] publication from the early 1960s of experimental [[neodada]] art and music composition that used [[John Cage]] inspired [[Aleatoric music|indeterminacy]]. It was edited by [[La Monte Young]] and [[DIY]] co-published in 1963 by Young and [[Jackson Mac Low]] in [[New York City]]. Its full title is: '''''An Anthology''''' of chance operations concept art anti-art indeterminacy improvisation meaningless work natural disasters plans of action stories diagrams Music poetry essays dance constructions mathematics compositions''. 

==Legacy==
The project became the manifestation of the original impetus for establishing [[Fluxus]].   

In autumn 1960 the editor of the magazine ''Beatitude'' magazine approached Young and Mac Low after a reading and asked them if they would guest-edit an issue of the East Coast edition of his magazine, ''Beatitude East''. Given free rein to include whoever and whatever he wanted, Young collected a large body of new and experimental music, [[anti art]], [[poetry]], essays and performance scores from America, Europe and Japan. The magazine, however, folded after only one issue, and the materials that Young had collected were never published until An Anthology of Chance Operations.

In June 1961 [[George Maciunas]], who had already begun plans to publish a magazine in the autumn of the same year, designed the book's layout and title pages, while others, including Mac Low, produced the typescript for the works themselves.

Although it can be argued&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon-noir.com/BOOKS/6_%20The_Fluxus_Reader_Ken_Friedman.pdf Fluxus Reader by [[Ken Friedman]]]&lt;/ref&gt; that An Anthology is not strictly a [[Fluxus]] publication, its development and production was a central event in the formation of Fluxus. It was the first collaborative publication project between people who were to become part of Fluxus: Young (editor and co-publisher), Mac Low (co-publisher) and Maciunas (designer).

The art dealer [[Heiner Friedrich]] issued a second edition in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubu.com/historical/young/ An Anthology of Chance Operations]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4954">[[Image:ABOVE 2.jpg|thumb|''Giving to the Poor'', a stencil by American street artist [[Above (artist)|Above]] addressing the issue of homelessness. Lisbon, Portugal, 2008.]] '''Artivism''' is a [[portmanteau|portmanteau word]] combining '''''art''''' and '''''activism'''''.

Artivism takes roots or branches off of a 1997 gathering between Chicano artists from East Los Angeles and the Zapatistas in Chiapas, Mexico. The words "Artivist" and "Artivism" were popularized through a variety of events, actions and artworks via artists and musicians such as Quetzal, Ozomatli, Mujeres de Maiz among other East LA artists and at spaces such as Self Help Graphics &amp; Art.

Artivism developed in recent years as [[antiwar]] and [[anti-globalization]] protests emerged and proliferated. In many cases artivists attempt to push political agendas by the means of art, but a focus on raising social, environmental, and technical awareness is also common. Besides using traditional mediums like film and music to raise awareness or push for change, an artivist can also be involved in [[culture jamming]], [[subvertising]], [[street art]], [[spoken word]], [[protesting]], and [[activism]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/12/02/opinion/magazine-global-agenda-big-question.html Politics, Power and Passion], [[The New York Times]], December 2, 2011. Please see the fifth segment by [[Eve Ensler]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dylan-brody/jeanmarie-simpson_b_985669.html Jeanmarie Simpson -- Artivist in the Modern Landscape (Part 1)], [[Dylan Brody]], [[The Huffington Post]], 2011.10.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dylan-brody/jeanmarie-simpson_b_994437.html Jeanmarie Simpson -- Artivist in the Modern Landscape (Part 2)], [[Dylan Brody]], [[The Huffington Post]], 2011.10.05&lt;/ref&gt;

Artivist [[Eve Ensler]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... This passion has all the ingredients of activism, but is charged with the wild creations of art. Artivism—where edges are pushed, imagination is freed, and a new language emerges altogether." Bruce Lyons has written: "... artivism ... promotes the essential understanding that ... [humans] ... can, through courageous creative expression, experience the unifying power of love when courage harnesses itself to the task of art + social responsibility.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 2008, the term had made its way into academic writing, with [[Chela Sandoval]] and Guisela Latorre published a piece on Chicano/a artivism and [[M. K. Asante]] used the term in reference to Black artists.&lt;ref&gt;Chela Sandoval and Guisela Latorre, ""Chicana/o Artivism: Judy Baca's Digital Work with Youth of Color," in ''Learning Race and Ethnicity'', MIT Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Asante, Jr. ''[[It's Bigger Than Hip Hop]]'', St. Martin's Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a chapter on artivism in the book ''[[It's Bigger Than Hip Hop]]'' by [[M. K. Asante]]. Asante writes of the artivist: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The artivist (artist + activist) uses her artistic talents to fight and struggle against injustice and oppression—by any medium necessary. The artivist merges commitment to freedom and justice with the pen, the lens, the brush, the voice, the body, and the imagination. The artivist knows that to make an observation is to have an obligation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Bruno Andreas Liljefors''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈbrʉːnʊ ²lɪlːjɛˌfɔʂ|-|Sv-Bruno_Liljefors.ogg}}; 14 May 1860 – 18 December 1939) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist, the most important and probably most influential Swedish wildlife painter of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;Hammond, Nicholas, ''Modern Wildlife Painting'', Pica Press, 1998, {{ISBN|1-873403-55-0}}, pp.{{nbsp}}31–40.&lt;/ref&gt; He also drew some sequential picture stories, making him one of the early Swedish [[list of comic creators|comic creators]]. He was brother of the composer and conductor [[Ruben Liljefors]].

==Life and work==
[[File:Bruno Liljefors - Hawk and Black-Game - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''Hawk and Black-Game'', depicting a [[Northern goshawk]] hunting [[Black grouse]] ]]
[[File:Bruno Liljefors - Peregrine Falcon in treetop.jpg|thumb|''Peregrine falcon in treetop'']]
Liljefors is held in high esteem by painters of wildlife and is acknowledged as an influence by, for example, American wildlife artist Michael Coleman. All his life Liljefors was a hunter, and he often painted predator-prey action, the hunts engaged between fox and hare, sea eagle and eider, and goshawk and black grouse serving as prime examples.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt; However, he never exaggerated the ferocity of the predator or the pathos of the prey, and his pictures are devoid of sentimentality.

The influence of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] can be seen in his attention to the effects of environment and light, and later that of [[Art Nouveau]] in
his ''Mallards, Evening'' of 1901, in which the pattern of the low sunlight on the water looks like leopardskin, hence the Swedish nickname ''Panterfällen''.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt; Bruno was fascinated by the patterns to be found in nature, and he often made art out of the camouflage patterns of animals and birds. He particularly loved painting [[capercaillie]]s against woodland, and his most successful painting of this subject is the large-scale ''Capercaillie Lek'', 1888, in which he captures the atmosphere of the forest at dawn. He was also influenced by Japanese art, for example in his ''Goldfinches'', painted in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;


During the last years of the nineteenth century, a brooding element entered his work, perhaps the result of turmoil in his private life, as he left his wife, Anna, and took up with her younger sister, Signe, and was often short of money.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt; This darker quality in his paintings gradually began to attract interest, and he had paintings exhibited at the Paris Salon.

==Style==
[[File:Bruno Liljefors-Anna.jpg|thumb|''Anna'', 1885]] 
He amassed a collection of animals to act as his living models. Ernst Malmberg recalled:
{{Quote|The animals seemed to have an instinctive trust and actual attraction to him...There in his animal enclosure, we saw his inevitable power over its many residents—foxes, badgers, hares, squirrels, weasels, an eagle, eagle owl, hawk, capercaillie and black game.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;}}

The greatness of Liljefors lay in his ability to show animals in their environment.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt; Sometimes he achieved this through hunting and observation of the living animal, and sometimes he used dead animals; for example, his ''Hawk and Black Game'', painted in the winter of 1883–84, was based on dead specimens, but he also used his memory of the flocks of black grouse in the meadows around a cottage he once lived in at Ehrentuna, near Uppsala. He wrote:

{{Quote|The hawk model—a young one—I killed myself. Everything was painted out of doors as was usually done in those days. It was a great deal of work trying to position the dead hawk and the grouse among the bushes that I bent in such a way as to make it seem lively, although the whole thing was in actuality a still life.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Assessment==
Such practices have sometimes led to criticism of Liljefors' work; Lars Jonsson has noted a "heraldisation" of the drama in ''Golden Eagle Chasing a Hare'', 1904, which causes a departure from pure naturalism, and he deduces from the position of the eagle's wing feathers that it would have been gliding rather than turning in reaction to the hare as painted.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;

Nevertheless, Liljefors was a pioneer at a time when wildlife art was still emerging from its association with scientific depiction and taxidermy. He also set a standard of identification with the landscape that substantially influenced the development of wildlife art in the twentieth century.

"'''Christmas Bells'''" is an American television commercial produced by [[the Hershey Company]] promoting [[Hershey's Kisses]]. The advertisement, produced with [[stop-motion animation]], features Hershey's Kisses, fashioned as a [[handbell choir]], playing the Christmas [[Carol (music)|carol]] "[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]". It debuted in 1989 and is shown in the United States each holiday season; as such, it is the longest-running television commercial for the Hershey brand.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Background==
In 1989, the Hershey Company began an advertising campaign for their product Hershey's Kisses, which was referred to as the "whimsy" campaign. [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] was the advertising agency behind the spot and David Apicella served as Creative Director. Television advertisements would utilize "tabletop stop-motion animation and CG product photography." [[Colossal Pictures]] was the animation studio, located in [[San Francisco]], who produced the commercial. Carl Willat directed the spots and performed the stop-motion animation with Gordon Clark. John Dunn, Hershey's brands manager, oversaw the production and helped develop the last-minute idea to create the "Christmas Bells" advertisement.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ringing in the Holidays: Hershey’s Kisses Chocolates

The '''''Codex coemeterium''''' (sb423 National Library, [[Clementinum]], [[Prague]]) is a 16th-century [[grimoire]] manuscript. The text, composed in [[Latin]], is largely concerned with [[demonology]] and [[necromancy]]. The book falls into [[A.E. Waite]]'s category of 'Unprinted literature of ceremonial magic' though extracted elements have been reproduced in later treatises.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Arthur Edward (1898). ''[[The Book of Ceremonial Magic]]''. [[Routledge]], 2006. {{ISBN|0710311532}} p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; It is heavily based on the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'', which was listed in the [[Catholic Church]]'s index of prohibited books.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8612">Under [[Canadian trade-mark law]], "confusion" is where a [[Trademark|trade-mark]] is similar enough to another trade-mark to cause consumers to equate them. Likelihood of confusion plays a central role in trade-mark registration, infringement and [[Passing off; trademark registration in Canadian law|passing-off]].{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=530}} Whether a trade-mark or [[Trade name|trade-name]] is confusing is a [[question of fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Benson &amp; Hedges (Canada) Limited v. St. Regis Tobacco Corporation|link=|year=1968|court=scc|num=1|format=canlii|pinpoint= p. 199|parallelcite=[1969] SCR 192|date=1968-11-18|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of confusion in trade-mark law is analogous to the role of [[Patent infringement in Canadian law|substantial infringement]] in [[Canadian patent law|patent law]].{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=530}}

==Definition==

Section 6 of the ''Trademarks Act'' sets out the situations where a trade-mark is confusing:

{{quote|6.(2) The use of a trade-mark causes confusion with another trade-mark if the use of both trade-marks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with those trade-marks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class.&lt;ref name = "TMA62"&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-6.html}}, s. 6(2)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The essence of confusion is the inference of common source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Visa International Service Association v. Visa Motel Corporation|link=|year=1984|court=bcca|num=517|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 15|parallelcite=1 CPR (3d) 109 |date=1984-06-21|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Trade-mark A will be confusing with Trade-mark B if the use of both trade-marks in the same area will lead consumers to believe that the goods or services sold under either trade-mark originate from the same source.

==Statutory Factors==

Section 6(5) of the ''Trademarks Act'' provides that in determining whether there is confusion, a court must examine "all of the surrounding circumstances" including:

{{quote|
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks or trade-names and the extent to which they have become known;

(b) the length of time the trade-marks or trade-names have been in use;

(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;

(d) the nature of the trade; and

(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks or trade-names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-6.html}}, s. 6(5)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The factors under section 6(5) are not exhaustive.&lt;ref&gt;''Gainers Inc. v. Marchildon'' (1996), 66 C.P.R. (3d) 308 (F.C.T.D.)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given the factual nature of confusion, the particular factors considered and the weighing of the factors varies from case-to-case.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=531}}

===Degree of Resemblance===

Determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks is the starting point of a confusion analysis.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=532}} The assessment of resemblance under s. 6(5)(e) is not limited to similarities in the appearance of the trade-marks. Similar sounding word marks can be confusing, even if they appear to be different.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=532}} Word marks representing similar ideas can be confusing (e.g. "Smoothies" and "Smarties" in the context of candies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Rowntree Company Limited v. Paulin Chambers Company Limited et al.|link=|year=1967|court=scc|num=100|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1968] SCR 134|date=1967-11-28|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard of Comparison===

In determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks, a court will examine each trade-mark as a whole, rather than breaking it up into its individual elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ultravite Laboratories Ltd. v. Whitehall Laboratories Ltd.|link=|year=1965|court=scc|num=43|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 192|parallelcite=[1965] SCR 734|date=1965-06-24|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.'', the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] compared the trade-marks "Molson Golden" and "Winchester Gold" in their entirety.&lt;ref name = "MolsonLabatt"&gt;''Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.'' (1994), 58 C.P.R. (3d) 527&lt;/ref&gt; Although both trade-marks used the descriptive "Gold" or "Golden", when viewed as a whole, the trade-marks were sufficiently distinguishable that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion.&lt;ref name = "MolsonLabatt"/&gt;

==="Ordinary Casual Consumer Somewhat in a Hurry"===

In a leading case on confusion, ''[[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] stated that the appropriate standard of comparison is that of the "ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|link=Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|year=2006|court=scc|num=22|format=|pinpoint=par. 56|parallelcite=[2006] 1 SCR 772|date=2006-06-02|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In applying this standard, a court will ask whether a consumer of average intelligence and caution casually encountering both trade-marks in the marketplace would be likely to confuse them.

===Actual Evidence of Confusion===

In addition to predicting whether an "ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry" would perceive confusion, a court may also consider evidence of actual confusion of the trade-marks in the marketplace.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=534}} Although evidence of actual confusion is not necessary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Christian Dior, S.A. v. Dion Neckwear Ltd.|link=|year=2002|court=fca|num=29|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2002] 3 FC 405|date=2002-01-23|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presence or absence of actual confusion in the marketplace may be a relevant "surrounding circumstance" under s. 6(5) of the ''Trade-marks Act''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinctiveness===

Marks consisting of everyday words or expressions are inherently less distinctive than ones based on invented or coined words or expressions.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=535}} However, a mark based on an everyday word may nonetheless acquire distinctiveness if it is employed extensively.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=534}} In [[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|''Mattel'']], the Court found that although [[Mattel]]’s "Barbie" trade-mark was based on an [[Barbara (name)|every day word]], it had acquired substantial distinctiveness through its strong association with the company's [[Barbie doll|doll products]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade-marks in Different Businesses===

Although section 6(2) of the ''Trade-marks Act'' provides that there can be confusion "whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class",&lt;ref name = "TMA62"/&gt; differences in the types of goods or services associated with each trade-mark are a relevant consideration in determining confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In  [[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|''Mattel'']], the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] found it unlikely that consumers would confuse "Barbie" for dolls with "Barbie" for restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée'', the Supreme Court of Canada found that the use of  "Cliquot" for mid-market women’s clothing stores was not confusing with "Veuve Clicquot" as a mark for a [[Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin|famous brand of champagne]].&lt;ref name = "VeuveClicquot"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée|link=|year=2006|court=scc|num=23|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2006] 1 SCR 824|date=2006-06-02|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible for a famous trade-mark holder to argue that its trade-mark will expand into new lines of business, there must a reasonable basis for this prediction.&lt;ref name = "VeuveClicquot"/&gt;

'''Hans Conrad Schumann''' (March 28, 1942 – June 20, 1998) was an [[East Germany|East German]] soldier who defected to [[West Germany]] during the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961.

==Early life==
Born in Zschochau, Saxony during the middle of [[World War II]], Schumann enlisted in the East German [[Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft|Bereitschaftspolizei]] (state police) following his 18th birthday. After three months' training in [[Dresden]], he was posted to a non-commissioned officers' college in [[Potsdam]], after which he volunteered for service in [[Berlin]].

==Defection to West Germany==
On 15 August 1961, the 19-year-old Schumann was sent to the corner of Ruppiner Straße and [[Bernauer Straße]] to guard the Berlin Wall on its third day of construction. At that time and place, the wall was only a single coil of [[concertina wire]]. From the other side, West Germans shouted to him, "''Komm' rüber!''" ("Come over!"), and a police car pulled up to wait for him. Schumann jumped over the barbed wire while dropping his [[PPSh-41]] submachine gun and was promptly driven away from the scene by the West Berlin police. West German photographer [[Peter Leibing]] photographed Schumann's escape. His picture has since become an iconic image of the [[Cold War]] era and featured at the beginning of the 1982 Disney film ''[[Night Crossing]]''. The scene, including Schumann's preparations, has also been filmed on 16-mm film from the same perspective.

Schumann was later permitted to travel from West Berlin to the main territory of [[West Germany]], where he settled in [[Bavaria]].

After the fall of the Berlin Wall he said, "Only since 9 November 1989 [the date of the fall] have I felt truly free." Even so, he continued to feel more at home in Bavaria than in his birthplace, citing old frictions with his former colleagues, and was even hesitant to visit his parents and siblings in [[Saxony]]. On 20 June 1998, suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], he committed [[suicide]], [[hanging]] himself in his orchard near the town of [[Kipfenberg]] in [[Upper Bavaria]]. His body was found by his wife a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;"Escaped soldier found hanged"

In May 2011, the photograph of Schumann's "leap into freedom" was inducted into the [[UNESCO]] Memory of the World programme as part of a collection of documents on the fall of the Berlin Wall.&lt;ref&gt;Diekmann, Kai.

Downes]] (1908–2000) and of former Democrat State Senator from Maryland, [[J. Frank Raley]] (1926–2012).  She became interested in flowers when hiking in woodlands near her home, whilst young;&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt; she was taught to draw by her father,&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; who was an artist and encouraged her to see nature from an artistic viewpoint.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;Spiegel, Olga.

Retrieved February 4, 2008. Quotes by Spiegel are translated from the Spanish. [a] "trabajados con una sensibilidad moderna que arranca los valores expresivos y táctiles del papel. [b] "Downes se complace en mostrar las particularidades de la flor, su naturaleza, su plenitud o cierta decadencia; la curva o el arabesco de unos tallos y pétalos al albur del viento, siempre con un gran dominio del dibujo y de las posibilidades de la acuarela para extraer la luz, matizar los colores o limitarlos al gris como en el tríptico ''Chinese hibiscus''"&lt;/ref&gt;

She earned a joint degree in arts and sciences from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=circulo/&gt; Her career started as an [[art director]] in New York City&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt; in publication design and interactive design including ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[Condé Nast Publications]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name=circulo/&gt; She was awarded a Silver award from SPD (The Society of Publication Designers)&lt;ref&gt;"Your Biggest Investment", ''Smart Money'', December 1996, Vol. V – Number XII&lt;/ref&gt; and a Gold Ozzie Award for Design Excellence.

The reference is based on the original in Spanish: [c] "Pintar flores no tiene por qué ser un anacronismo o un divertimento puramente decorativista. Es perfectamente posible proseguir esa línea plástica y temática desde una sensibilidad contemporánea." [d] "La formación de la artista – en Ciencias y Artes – hace que su obra surja de un doble influjo de curiosidad científica y estética."&lt;/ref&gt; showing [[watercolour]]s of orchids, hibiscos, irises and tulips, painted from life.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Olga Spiegel described them as "worked with a modern sensitivity that makes use of the expressive and tactile values of the paper"&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[a]&lt;/sup&gt; and said:

{{quote|Downes shows the particularities of the flower, its nature, its fullness or destined decay, the curve or arabesque of stems and petals subject to the whim of the wind, always with a great mastery of drawing and the possibilities of watercolour to show the light, to heighten the colours or to reduce them to grey, as in the triptych ''Chinese hibiscus''.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[b]&lt;/sup&gt;}}

J. J.

}}'''Enrique Peña Nieto''' ({{IPA-es|enˈrike ˈpeɲa ˈnjeto|-|Penanieto.ogg}}; born 20 July 1966), commonly referred to by his initials '''EPN''', is a Mexican politician who served as the 57th [[President of Mexico]], from 2012 to 2018. He previously served in the [[State of Mexico]] as Secretary of Administration (2000–2002), Representative (2003–2004), and [[Governor of the State of Mexico|State Governor]] (2005–2011).&lt;!--There is a purposeful lack of citations in the lede of this article as per WP:WHENNOTCITE. The standard allows the lead to remain relatively cite-less if all the information is sourced in the main body. If there is something not cited in the lead AND not cited in the body, please a {{citation needed}} next to it so it can be addressed.--&gt;&lt;!--Do not add any information that violates Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, edits that do will be promptly reverted.--&gt;

Born in [[Atlacomulco]] and raised in [[Toluca]], Peña Nieto attended [[Panamerican University]] graduating with a B.A. in [[Jurisprudence|legal studies]]. He began his political career after attaining a M.B.A. from [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education|ITESM]], by joining the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) in 1984. After serving as a [[public notary]] in [[Mexico City]], he began an ascension through local political ranks in the late 1990s culminating in his 2005 campaign for Governor of the State of Mexico. As governor, &lt;!--Do not change without editor consensus. --&gt;he pledged to deliver 608 ''compromisos'' (promises) to his constituency to [[Enrique Peña Nieto#Governor of the State of Mexico: 2005–2011|varying levels of success]]. His tenure &lt;!--Do not change without editor consensus. --&gt; was marked by low-to-moderate approval of his handling of [[Crime in Mexico|a rising murder rate]] and various public health issues. He launched his [[Enrique Peña Nieto#Presidential campaign: 2011-12|2011 presidential campaign]] on a platform of economic competitiveness and [[open government]]. After performing well in polls and a series of high-profile candidate withdrawals, Peña Nieto was elected president with 38.14% of the vote.

During his first four years, &lt;!--Do not remove sentence and citation without editor consensus. --&gt; Peña Nieto led an expansive breakup of [[Monopoly|monopolies]], liberalized [[Energy in Mexico|Mexico's energy sector]], reformed public education, and modernized the [[Economy of Mexico|country's financial regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-mexicos-president-may-have-rescued-his-country/2016/10/14/5154235a-8ff1-11e6-9c52-0b10449e33c4_story.html|title=How Mexico’s president may have rescued his country|last=Tepperman|first=Jonathan|date=October 14, 2016|work=Washington Post|access-date=April 28, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, political gridlock and [[Enrique Peña Nieto#Domestic policy|allegations of media bias]], gradually worsened corruption, crime, and [[Mexican Drug War|drug trade in Mexico]]. He instated the multi-lateral [[Pact for Mexico]] which soothed inter-party fighting and led to increased legislation across the political spectrum. Global [[2010s oil glut|drops in oil prices]] and [[Great Recession|economic slowdown of the 2010s]], rendered his economic reforms moderately successful which lowered political support for Peña Nieto. His handling of the [[2014 Iguala mass kidnapping|Iguala mass kidnapping]] in 2014&lt;!--Do not remove sentence without editor consensus. --&gt; and escaped drug lord [[Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán]] from [[Altiplano prison]] in 2015 sparked international acclaim and criticism.

[[Enrique Peña Nieto#Evaluations as president and legacy|Historical evaluations]] and approval rates of his presidency have been mixed.&lt;!--Do not remove sentence without editor consensus. --&gt; Detractors highlight a series of failed policies and a strained public presence while supporters note increased economic competitiveness and loosening of gridlock.

Enrique Peña Nieto was born on 20 July 1966 in [[Atlacomulco]], [[State of Mexico]], a city {{convert|55|mi|km}} northwest of [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=earlylifenyt/&gt; He is the oldest of four siblings; his father, Gilberto Enrique Peña del Mazo, was an electrical engineer; his mother, María del Perpetuo Socorro Ofelia Nieto Sánchez, a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name=earlylifenyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Enrique Peña Nieto|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/enrique_pena_nieto/index.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 July 2012|first1=Randal C.|last1=Archibold|first2=Karla|last2=Zabludovsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the nephew of two former governors of the State of México: on his mother's side, [[Arturo Montiel]]; on his father's, [[Alfredo del Mazo González]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/12/28/the-pri-and-loathing-in-mexico-city/|title=The PRI and Loathing in Mexico City|date=28 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2013/12/16/the-10-most-corrupt-mexicans-of-2013/|title=The 10 Most Corrupt Mexicans of 2013|first=Dolia|last=Estevez|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelsedano.com/blog/2012/05/18/lo-que-quiza-no-sabes-de-enrique-pena-nieto/comment-page-1/|title=Lo que (quizá) no sabes de Enrique Peña Nieto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Denis Hall School in [[Alfred, Maine|Alfred]], [[Maine]], during one year of junior high school in 1979 to learn English.&lt;ref name=earlylifenyt/&gt; After living in Atlacomulco for the first 11 years of his life, Peña Nieto's family moved to the city of [[Toluca]].&lt;ref name=bebe&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerril|first=Andrés |title=Enrique Peña Nieto, su hoja de vida: pulcro y protegido |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=&amp;cat=443&amp;id_nota=830468 |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Excélsior]] |date=30 April 2012 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914021405/http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, his father would often take him to the campaign rallies of the State of Mexico's governor, [[Jorge Jiménez Cantú]], a close friend of Peña del Mazo The successor of the governor was [[Alfredo del Mazo González]], a cousin of Peña Nieto's father. During Del Mazo González's campaign in 1981, the fifteen-year-old Peña Nieto had his first direct contact with [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican politics]]: he began delivering campaign literature in favor of his relative, a memory Peña Nieto recalls as the turning point and start of his deep interest in politics.

In 1984 at the age of 18, Peña Nieto traveled to [[Mexico City]] and enrolled in the [[Panamerican University]], where he earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerril |first=Andrés |title=Enrique Peña Nieto, su hoja de vida: despertar político |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=seccion-nacional&amp;cat=1&amp;id_nota=830745&amp;photo=0 |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Excélsior]] |date=1 May 2012 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914021405/http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto's academic thesis was found to contain some improper citations and plagiarism which stirred controversy in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-pena-nieto-idUSKCN10X0BE|title=Mexican president Pena Nieto plagiarized law thesis, report says|date=22 August 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thesis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=seccion-nacional&amp;cat=1&amp;id_nota=835373|title=Por sus tesis los conoceréis|last=Reyes|first=Juan Pablo|date=20 May 2012|newspaper=[[Excélsior]]|accessdate=17 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914021405/http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota|archivedate=14 September 2012|deadurl=yes|language=es|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto sought a master's degree in [[Business Administration]] ([[Master of Business Administration|MBA]]) at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico|Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey]] (ITESM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://noticias.terra.com.mx/mexico/politica/elecciones/sucesion-presidencial/enrique-pena-nieto-la-cara-joven-del-viejo-pri,f67eade28f5e6310VgnVCM5000009ccceb0aRCRD.html|title=Enrique Peña Nieto: La cara joven del viejo PRI|date=June 2012|newspaper=[[Terra Networks]]|accessdate=17 July 2012|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.presidencia.gob.mx/presidencia/presidente/ Biography Enrique Peña Nieto] – website of the President of Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; based in the State of Mexico.

==Political beginnings==
Peña Nieto joined the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) in 1984, and with a law degree nearly completed, he began earning his own money.&lt;ref name=homex&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerril |first=Andrés |title=Enrique Peña Nieto, su hoja de vida: echado pa'delante |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=seccion-nacional&amp;cat=1&amp;id_nota=830990 |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Excélsior]] |date=2 May 2012 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914021405/http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his final years in college, Peña Nieto worked for a [[public notary]] in Mexico City, around the same time when his relative, Alfredo del Mazo González, was mentioned as a firm candidate for the [[Mexican general election, 1988|1988 presidential elections]].&lt;ref name=homex/&gt; In his twenties, he worked at the San Luis Industrial Corporation, an auto parts manufacturer, and at the law firm Laffan, Muse and Kaye. While still a student at the [[Universidad Panamericana]], he roomed with Eustaquio de Nicolás, the current president of [[Homex]], a leading Mexican construction and real estate company. He also befriended and roomed with Luis Miranda, who occupied several offices during the 1999–2000 administration in the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=homex/&gt;

Peña Nieto formally started his political career under the mentorship of Montiel Rojas, becoming the Secretary of the Citizen Movement of Zone I of the State Directive Committee of the National Confederation of Popular Organizations (CNOP), one of the three sectors of the PRI. For three consecutive years, Peña Nieto participated as a delegate to the Organization and Citizen Front in [[Municipalities of the State of Mexico|different municipalities]] of the State of Mexico. Then, between 1993 and 1998, during Emilio Chuayfett's term as governor, Peña Nieto was chief of staff and personal secretary to Montiel Rojas, the Secretary of Economic Development of the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=homex/&gt;

After 1999, Peña Nieto went from having low-level secretary positions to higher and more qualified offices.&lt;ref name=despegue&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerril |first=Andrés |title=Enrique Peña Nieto, su hoja de vida: un despegue firme |url=http://www.tvnws.com/2014/08/enrique-pena-nieto-su-hoja-de-vida-un-despegue-firme/ |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Telenews]] |date=3 May 2012 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084156/http://www.tvnws.com/2014/08/enrique-pena-nieto-su-hoja-de-vida-un-despegue-firme/ |archivedate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served from 1999 to 2000 as the Sub-secretary of Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lantigua|first=Isabel F.|title=Enrique Peña Nieto|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/tags/b8/enrique-pena-nieto.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as financial sub-coordinator of the political campaign of Montiel Rojas.&lt;ref name=homex/&gt; In 2001, Montiel Rojas named Peña Nieto Sub-secretary of Interior in the State of Mexico, a position that granted him the opportunity to meet and forge relationships with top PRI politicians and wealthy businessmen. After his term concluded, he served as the administrative secretary, as president of the Directive Council of Social Security, as president of the Internal Council of Health, and as vice president of the [[National System for Integral Family Development]] – all in the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=despegue/&gt; Under the wing of Montiel Rojas, Peña Nieto formed a group known as the "Golden Boys of Atlacomulco" with other members of the PRI.&lt;ref name="cipher"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico-pena-nieto-20120709,0,6191537.story|title=Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto, man of mystery|last=Wilkinson|first=Tracy|date=9 July 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign for Governor===
Peña Nieto was elected to a local [[Deputy (legislator)|deputy]] position in his hometown of [[Atlacomulco]], State of Mexico, in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enrique Peña Nieto: ¿Quién es?

==Governor of the State of Mexico (2005–2011)==
[[File:Enrique Peña Nieto - World Economic Forum on Latin America 2010.jpg|right|thumb|Peña Nieto at the [[World Economic Forum]] (2010)]]On 15 September 2005, Peña Nieto was sworn as [[governor of the State of Mexico]] at the Morelos theater in Toluca. Among the hundreds of attendees were the outgoing governor, [[Arturo Montiel]]; the president of the Superior Court of Justice, José Castillo Ambriz; former governors, members of Peña Nieto's cabinet and party, mayors, businessmen, and church figures.&lt;ref name="rindeprotesta"&gt;{{cite news|title=Seis años atrás: Peña Nieto asumió la gubernatura en el Teatro Morelos|url=http://edomex.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/75d9bcfb7cba54dfc1973e6f4755c588|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Milenio]]|date=12 September 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centerpiece of Peña Nieto's governorship was his claim that he was to deliver his ''compromisos'' – 608 promises he signed in front of a notary to convince voters that he would deliver results and be an effective leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindsay|first=James M.|title=Hola, Enrique Peña Nieto: President-Elect of Mexico|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/lindsay/2012/07/02/hola-enrique-pena-nieto-president-elect-of-mexico/|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'', during Peña Nieto's first year as governor, his administration delivered 10 of the structural promises he had advocated in his campaign – marking the lowest figure in his six-year term.&lt;ref name="islas"&gt;{{cite news|last=Islas|first=Laura|title=Los compromisos de Peña Nieto, año por año|url=http://www.eluniversaledomex.mx/toluca/nota21395.html|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=31 August 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, his administration carried out 141 of the promised projects, making that year the most active in the governor's term. The 608 projects Peña Nieto proposed consisted of creating highways, building hospitals, and creating adequate water systems to provide fresh water throughout the state. The most important of these was highway infrastructure, which tripled under Peña's government. By mid-2011, the official page of the State of Mexico noted that only two projects were left.&lt;ref name="islas" /&gt; The major projects in public transportation were the [[Suburban Railway of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area]] and the "Mexibús", both of which served commuters between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, providing service to more than 300,000 people every day and 100 million a year. Regarding public health services, 196 hospitals and medical centers were built throughout the state and the number of mobile units to attend remote and vulnerable areas doubled.&lt;ref name="mexibus" /&gt; Deaths caused by [[respiratory disease]]s were reduced by 55%, while deaths caused by [[dysentery]] and [[cervical cancer]] were reduced by 68% and 25% respectively. In addition, between 2005 and 2011, the State of Mexico was able to fulfill the requirement of the [[World Health Organization]] of having one doctor for every 1,000 inhabitants. The funds for these and all the other commitments were obtained through restructuring the state's public debt, a strategy designed by his first Secretary of Finance, [[Luis Videgaray Caso]]. The restructuring also managed to keep the debt from increasing during Peña Nieto's term because the tax base was broadened to the point that it doubled in six years.&lt;ref name="mexibus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Islas|first=Laura|title=6to Informe.

Peña Nieto also claimed that he halved the murder rate in the State of Mexico during his time as governor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexto Informe de Gobierno: Enrique Peña Nieto|url=http://igecem.edomex.gob.mx/descargas/informe/6Tomo2.pdf|publisher=[[State of Mexico]]|accessdate=18 July 2012|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106012919/http://igecem.edomex.gob.mx/descargas/informe/6Tomo2.pdf|archivedate=6 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but retracted this claim after ''[[The Economist]]'' showed that the murder rate did not diminish and was being measured in a different way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crime in Mexico: The governor's miraculous achievement|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2011/09/crime-mexico|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yo Soy 132]] student movement criticized Peña Nieto for his stance on the [[San Salvador Atenco|San Salvador Atenco unrest]], which occurred during his term as governor.&lt;ref name="atenco132"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zapata|first=Belén|title=Atenco, el tema que 'encendió' a la Ibero y originó #YoSoy132|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2012/06/04/atenco-el-tema-que-encendio-a-la-ibero-y-origino-yosoy132|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=CNNMéxico|date=4 June 2012|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628223514/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2012/06/04/atenco-el-tema-que-encendio-a-la-ibero-y-origino-yosoy132|archivedate=28 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto stated in an interview that he does not justify the actions of the state and municipal forces, but also mentioned that they were not gladly received by the citizens of San Salvador Atenco upon their arrival.&lt;ref name="esmas"&gt;{{cite news |title=Justifica Peña Nieto uso de la fuerza en Atenco |url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/535173.html |accessdate=18 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Esmas.com]] |date=14 May 2006 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702005439/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/535173.html |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atenco132" /&gt;

==Presidential campaign==
[[File:Enrique Peña Nieto (2013).jpg|thumb|Peña Nieto campaigning in 2012]]
On 23 November 2011, Peña Nieto went to a book fair in [[Casa del Lago Juan José Arreola|Casa del Lago]], Mexico City. There he presented his book ''México, la gran esperanza (Mexico, the great hope)''. He was accompanied by writer [[Héctor Aguilar Camín]], the former governor of Mexico's Central Bank, [[Guillermo Ortiz Martínez]], and the journalist Jaime Sánchez Susarrey. In the book, Peña Nieto argued that Mexico needed to expand its economy to create more jobs, insisting that in the past the country has only created jobs in the [[informal sector]].&lt;ref name="book1" /&gt; Additionally, he argued that promoting [[Pemex]] (Mexico's state-owned oil company) to compete in the private sector would create more jobs, elevate productivity, and balance wealth distribution across Mexico. Nonetheless, Peña Nieto dedicated the book to his wife [[Angélica Rivera]] and to governor [[Eruviel Ávila Villegas]] and his family.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Peña Nieto presenta su libro: México, la gran esperanza |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/4259178fb116421ada4be474aca6b3e9 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128224632/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/4259178fb116421ada4be474aca6b3e9 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Milenio]] |date=23 November 2011 |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto said that the return of the PRI marks a new era in Mexico, and that his book served as a starting point to take Mexico "to better horizons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cárdenas|first=Jesús|title=En la presentación de su libro, Enrique Peña Nieto dijo que México tiene ante sí la oportunidad de entrar a una nueva etapa de progreso|url=http://noticierostelevisa.esmas.com/elecciones-mexico/noticias/369786/enrique-pena-nieto-presenta-libro/|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Televisa]]|date=23 November 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2011, a few days after the book fair, Peña Nieto was the PRI's last standing nominee for the 2012 Mexican presidential elections. The former State of Mexico governor completed his nomination at an event that gathered sympathizers and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallardo|first=Arturo|title=The PRI's unity candidate|url=http://blog.mysanantonio.com/beyondtheborder/2011/11/the-pris-unity-candidate/|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[San Antonio Express-News]]|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days earlier, the senator and preliminary candidate of the PRI, [[Manlio Fabio Beltrones]], withdrew from the race and gave Peña Nieto a clear path towards the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manlio Fabio Beltrones anuncia su declinación a la candidatura del PRI|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/11/21/manlio-fabio-beltrones-anuncia-su-declinacion-a-la-candidatura-del-pri|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=CNNMéxico|date=21 November 2011|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715213454/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/11/21/manlio-fabio-beltrones-anuncia-su-declinacion-a-la-candidatura-del-pri|archivedate=15 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a book fair a month later, Peña Nieto's public image came into question after he struggled to answer a question that asked which three books had marked his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico top presidential contender can't name books |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-mexico-top-presidential-contender-cant-name-books-2011dec05-story.html|work=San Diego Union Tribune|first=Mark|last=Stevenson|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Peña Nieto was interviewed by ''[[El País]]'' and admitted that he did not know the price of [[tortillas]].

On 1 July 2012, Mexico's presidential election took place. In an initial, partial count issued that night, the [[Federal Electoral Institute (Mexico)|Federal Electoral Institute]] (IFE) announced that based on a fast vote counting, Peña Nieto was leading the election with 38% of the votes.&lt;ref name=6points&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Tracy|title=Enrique Peña Nieto wins Mexico's presidency, early results show|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/02/world/la-fg-mexico-presidential-election-20120702|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nearest competitor, [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]], was just 6 points behind him. The figures were meant to be a representative sample of the votes nationwide; but shortly after this announcement, Peña Nieto appeared on national television claiming victory. "This Sunday, Mexico won," he said. He then thanked his voters and promised to run a government "responsible and open to criticism." At the PRI headquarters in Mexico City, the victory party began.&lt;ref name=6points/&gt; With more than 97% of the votes counted on election day, the PRI had won with about 38% of the votes, just 6.4 points above the leftist candidate López Obrador of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD), who refused to concede to the results and had threatened to challenge the outcome.&lt;ref name=lopezobradorvotes&gt;{{cite news|title=Pena Nieto set to become Mexico's president|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/07/2012722615392786.html/|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jorgeramos20121121&gt;{{cite web|title=Jorge Ramos interviews Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador|url=http://jorgeramos.com/en/there-is-no-democracy-in-mexico/|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency (2012–2018)==

Peña Nieto was sworn-in as President of Mexico on 1 December 2012 at the federal congress and later flew to a military parade to formally take control of the [[Mexican Armed Forces|armed forces]]. During his inauguration speech at the National Palace, Peña Nieto proposed his agendas and reforms for the new administration.

The auto manufacturing industry expanded rapidly under Nieto's presidency. In 2014, more than US$10 billion was committed in investment in the sector. In conjunction with Kia Motors in August 2014, the president announced plans for Kia to build a US$1 billion factory in [[Nuevo León]]. At the time, [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Nissan]] were already building a US$1.4 billion plant near [[Puebla City|Puebla]], while [[BMW]] was planning a US$1 billion assembly plant in [[San Luis Potosí]].

According to the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS), between December 2012 and June 2016, more than two million jobs were created in Mexico. Of those jobs, 41% were taken by women and 36% were taken by individuals between 20 and 34 years of age. IMSS also revealed that 86% were long-term jobs and 14% were temporary. These jobs have led to a 26% increase in revenue accumulation for IMSS, an additional MXN$50 billion. More than half a million jobs had salaries worth five minimum wages (about MXN$10,000 per month) and there was a 22% increase in jobs with salaries greater than 20 minimum wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=México crea dos millones de empleos en tresose jobs, años|url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2016/07/08/actualidad/1467994934_768007.html|publisher=El País|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Special economic zones====
[[File:Enrique Peña Nieto and Mariano Rajoy at the 2017 G-20 Hamburg summit (2).jpg|thumb|Peña Nieto with Spanish Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]], 8 July 2017]]At the end of May 2016, Peña Nieto signed a law that will create [[special economic zones]] in economically [[List of Mexican states by Human Development Index|underdeveloped southern states]]. The first three are: [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]], Michoacán; [[Port Chiapas]], Chiapas; and in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] to better join the ports of [[Coatzacoalcos]], Veracruz and [[Salina Cruz]], Oaxaca. Another zone in the petroleum region of Tabasco and Campeche, hit by the [[2010s oil glut|downturn in the oil industry]], is planned for 2017.&lt;ref name="WSJ Harrup"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrup|first1=Anthony|title=Mexican President Signs Law for Special Economic Zones|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special economic zones are meant to alleviate the lack of industry in the South. During the signing, Peña Nieto highlighted the difference between the South and the industrial North and Center of Mexico: two of every three people in [[extreme poverty]] in Mexico live in the southern states. While the three poorest states (Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero) have about 10% of the population, they only receive $1 of every $36 in [[foreign direct investment]] in the country. He went on to say that there are two Mexicos: one "that competes and wins in the [[global economy]], with growing levels of income, development and [[well-being]]", while the other Mexico "has been left behind [and] hasn't been able to take advantage of its potential."&lt;ref name="WSJ Harrup" /&gt;

The special economic zones will offer [[tax incentives]] (exemption from the 16% [[VAT]]),&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's special economic zones: How the bottom half lives|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21701134-free-trade-areas-aim-boost-growth-impoverished-south-how-bottom-half|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; trade and customs benefits and the streamlining of regulatory processes.&lt;ref name="WSJ Harrup" /&gt; There will also be an increase in infrastructure spending in these regions. Private administrators will run the zones on 40-year contracts (managing infrastructure and attracting tenants).&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; According to Peña Nieto, at the latest, each of these zones will have an anchor tenant that will attract suppliers and other industries in the [[supply chain]] by 2018. The [[World Bank]] advised Mexico during the formulation of the special economic zones plan.&lt;ref name="WSJ Harrup" /&gt;

===Domestic policy===
Peña Nieto enacted a massive public education reform that would tame the powerful teachers' union, [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación]] (SNTE), improve standards, centralize the process for hiring, evaluating, promoting and retaining teachers, and crack down on rampant corruption – such as wages for non-existent “ghost teachers”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico's Pena Nieto enacts major education reform|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-21582629|work=BBC|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico’s education reforms flounder as more spent on PR than teacher training|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/mexico-education-reform-controversy-presidential-election|work=The Guardian|first=David|last=Agren|date=15 May 2018|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after its signing, the plan has barely affected standards: Mexico still ranks last in education among the 35 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] countries and the [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Public Education]] spent more money on communications (2,700% more on communications in 2017 than was budgeted) than on teacher training.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

While campaigning, Peña Nieto appointed a former general of the [[National Police of Colombia]] as his external advisor for public security, and promised to reduce the murder rate in Mexico by 50% by the end of his six-year term.&lt;ref name="unclear" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Daniel|title=Mexico candidate Peña Nieto seeks Colombia drug fighter as advisor|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/06/mexico-enrique-pena-nieto-oscar-naranjo-colombia.html|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Peña Nieto's security strategy, however, said that he offered "little sense" in exactly how he will reduce the violence.&lt;ref name="how" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unclear" /&gt; During the three-month campaign, Peña Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wondered whether he was holding back politically sensitive details or simply did not know how he would attempt to squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in [[Mexican Drug War|Mexico's drug war]].&lt;ref name="unclear"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gomez Licon|first=Adriana|title=New Mexican president could target small gangs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/07/05/new-mexican-president-could-target-small-gangs/|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States officials were worried that the election of Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party may mean a return to the old PRI tactics of "corruption [and] backroom deals" with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace.&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Raf|title=Mexican election raises fears in Washington|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/9365421/Mexican-election-raises-fears-in-Washington.html|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 June 2012|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Raf|title=Presidential favorite worries U.S. officials as Mexicans head to polls|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Presidential+favourite+worries+officials+Mexicans+head+polls/6866616/story.html|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|date=30 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hQYVQKF?url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Presidential+favourite+worries+officials+Mexicans+head+polls/6866616/story.html|archivedate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the president-elect emphasized that he did not support the involvement or presence of armed United States agents in Mexico, but considered allowing the United States to instruct Mexico's military training in [[counterinsurgency]] tactics. Beyond that, Peña Nieto promised that no other measures will be taken by the States in Mexico.&lt;ref name="usaid"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's Pena Nieto Will Use US Help in Drug War|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/2012/07/06/mexico-pena-nieto-will-use-us-help-in-drug-war|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security policy of Peña Nieto has prioritized the reduction of violence rather than attacking Mexico's drug-trafficking organizations head-on, marking a departure from the strategy of the previous six years during [[Felipe Calderón]]'s administration. One of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country's [[List of Mexico's 37 most-wanted drug lords|most-wanted drug lords]] and intercepting their drug shipments.&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Patrick|title=What Mexico's Elections Mean for Crime Policy: Part I|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2811-what-mexicos-elections-mean-for-crime-policy-part-i|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=25 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hOifSrP?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2811-what-mexicos-elections-mean-for-crime-policy-part-i|archivedate=5 August 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2012, a law was approved that included far-reaching security reforms. Mexico's [[Secretariat of the Interior (Mexico)|Interior Ministry]], greatly strengthened by the bill, was made solely responsible for public security. Part of Peña Nieto's strategy consists of the creation of a national police of 40,000 members, known as a "[[gendarmerie]]". ''The Economist'' reported that the gendarmerie would have an initial strength of 10,000, but the Washington Office on Latin America reported that it was reduced to 5,000 members and would not be operational until July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Maureen &amp; Clay Boggs. {{cite news|title=One Year into Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's Administration|url=http://www.wola.org/commentary/one_year_into_the_enrique_pena_nieto_administration|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Office on Latin America]]|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interior Ministry announced that 15 specialized police units were being formed to exclusively focus on major crimes that include kidnapping and extortion, along with a new task force dedicated to tracking missing persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's new government coming out swinging| url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21568729-plans-improve-security-and-schools-coming-out-swinging|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto also proposed centralizing the sub-federal police forces under one command.&lt;ref name="how" /&gt;

In December 2017, the [[:es:Ley de Seguridad Interior|Law of Internal Security]] was passed by legislation but was met with criticism, especially from the [[CNDH|National Human Rights Commission]], accusing it gave the President a [[wikt:carte blanche|blank check]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/AristeguiOnline/status/936399552122380292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/3011/mexico/mas-poder-al-presidente-y-a-las-fuerzas-armadas-las-entranas-de-la-ley-de-seguridad-interior/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thewire.in/206138/mexican-national-human-rights-commission-likely-take-legal-action-security-law/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mexico-Human-Rights-Watchdog-to-Challenge-Security-Law-in-Court-20171222-0023.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/mexicos-president-signs-internal-security-law-before-court-review-2017-12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the presidential campaign, Peña Nieto promised to open [[Pemex]], Mexico's state-owned oil company, to the [[private sector]]. He also indicated interest in an economic agreement with [[Petrobras]], Brazil's oil company.&lt;ref name="shanon"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neil|first=Shannon K.|title=Peña Nieto and Energy Reform|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/oneil/2012/07/12/pena-nieto-and-energy-reform/|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By giving more economic freedom to Pemex, investors say Peña Nieto's proposal could allow joint ventures and private investment in the oil company.&lt;ref name="majority"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wheatley|first=Jonathan|title=Thinking of investing in Pemex?

According to the ''Financial Times'' in 2012, Peña Nieto's PRI government, which held just over 38% of the votes in Congress, might have difficulty gaining a majority to pass such reforms, or the [[supermajority#Two-thirds majority|two-thirds majority]] needed to change the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican constitution]].&lt;ref name="majority" /&gt; Pemex was founded through the nationalization of foreign oil interests, and the Mexican constitution bans major outside investments.&lt;ref name="exxon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Eric|title=Pena Nieto Push to Open Mexico Oil Fields Sparks Exxon Interest|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-12/pena-nieto-push-to-open-mexico-oil-fields-sparks-exxon-interest|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=12 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514181702/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-12/pena-nieto-push-to-open-mexico-oil-fields-sparks-exxon-interest|archivedate=14 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing Pemex could transform the psychology of Mexico's business sector and involve cultural and political changes that cannot be rushed.&lt;ref name="majority" /&gt;&lt;ref name="exxon" /&gt; President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] seized foreign oil company assets in 1938 to form Pemex, which has served as a symbol of national identity.&lt;ref name="opec" /&gt;

This directly led Peña Nieto to cancel his visit to the U.S. President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/26/mexico-stunned-by-trump-tweet-on-cancelling-trip.html|title=Mexico stunned by Trump tweet on cancelling trip|date=26 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/mexico-president-donald-trump-enrique-pena-nieto-border-wall/index.html|title=Mexican president cancels meeting with Trump|last=CNN|first=Daniella Diaz|website=CNN|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Aristegui Noticias, Washington periodist Dolia Estévez said she obtained access to part of a one-hour phone conversation between the two presidents the day of the scheduled meeting. She stated, "Trump humiliated Peña Nieto," and said that the conversation only lasted 20 minutes; she also explained that the speech was prolonged to an hour due to translation efforts because Peña Nieto doesn't understand English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.aristeguinoticias.com/0102/mundo/trump-humillo-a-pena-nieto-el-presidente-mexicano-balbuceo-dolia-estevez/|title=Aristegui Noticias|website=m.aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/472688/trump-humillo-a-pena-lo-amago-enviar-sus-tropas-a-mexico-revela-dolia-estevez|title=Trump humilló a Peña y lo amagó con enviar sus tropas a México, revela Dolia Estévez - Proceso|date=1 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-mexican-president-opt-phone-call-visit-article-1.2957415|title=Trump, Mexican president opt for phone call instead of visit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many media outlets praised Peña Nieto for cancelling the visit with Trump, ''[[Forbes|Forbes Mexico]]'' stated that despite showing support towards Peña Nieto for cancelling such event, "that shouldn't translate in forgiveness to what happens within our country [Mexico]" adding that "a state incapable of bringing credibility and stability could not grow", and that more than Trump, the thing keeping Mexico from prosperity was the corruption within the Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com.mx/la-corrupcion-frena-nuestra-prosperidad-no-trump/#gs.EL1BQzc|title=Es la corrupción lo que frena nuestra prosperidad, no Trump|first=Daniela García Santibáñez|last=Godoy|date=31 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
====Social media manipulation and publicity excess====
As of July 2017, [[Oxford University]]’s Computational Propaganda Research Project claimed Mexico's social media manipulation ([[Peñabot]]s) to come directly from the Mexican Government itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/17/spreading-fake-news-becomes-standard-practice-for-governments-across-the-world/|title=Spreading fake news becomes standard practice for governments across the world|last=Timberg|first=Craig|date=17 July 2017|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/495268/gobierno-mexico-manipula-bots-las-redes-sociales-universidad-oxford|title=Gobierno de México manipula con "bots" las redes sociales: Universidad de Oxford - Proceso|date=17 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2017 article of ''[[The New York Times]]'', reported Enrique Peña Nieto spending about 2 billion dollars on publicity, during his first 5 years as president, the largest publicity budget ever spent by a Mexican President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/es/2017/12/25/con-su-enorme-presupuesto-de-publicidad-el-gobierno-mexicano-controla-los-medios-de-comunicacion-pri-pena-nieto/|title=Con su enorme presupuesto de publicidad, el gobierno mexicano controla los medios de comunicación|first=Azam|last=Ahmed|date=25 December 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ayotzinapa====
{{See also|2014 Iguala mass kidnapping}}
In September 2014, 43 male college students were forcibly taken then disappeared in [[Guerrero]]. The forced mass disappearance of the students arguably became the biggest political and public security scandal Peña Nieto had faced during his administration. It led to nationwide protests, particularly in the state of Guerrero and Mexico City, and international condemnation.

====Carmen Aristegui====
In November 2014, an article was published by journalist [[Carmen Aristegui]], indicating that a $7 million "White House" owned by Enrique Peña Nieto and his wife [[Angelica Rivera]], in [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] was registered under the name of a company affiliated with a business group that had received government contracts to build a bullet train.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/luxurious-presidential-house-draws-mexican-press-scrutiny/2014/11/09/33bba1ee-65fd-11e4-ab86-46000e1d0035_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The revelation about the potential [[conflict of interest]] in the acquisition of the house aggravated discontent about the government. Rivera released a video in which she detailed her income as a former soap opera actress, stating that she was selling the house and that the property was not under her name because she had not made the full payment yet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/135880a6-6fc2-11e4-90af-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3KAeQBOPA&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after revealing the Mexican White House incident, Carmen Aristegui was controversially fired from her radio show at [[MVS Comunicaciones|MVS Communications]]. As noted by ''The New York Times'', Aristegui being fired was a perceived as a censorship towards news journalism and the liberty given by the freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/world/americas/in-mexico-firing-of-carmen-aristegui-highlights-rising-pressures-on-news-media.html&lt;/ref&gt; Aristegui took it to trial and by June 2018, three years after MVS fired her, the jury determined that it was indeed unconstitutional and against the law, to fire her and indeed was an act of censorship towards the freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/2106/mexico/ya-hay-sentencia-fue-ilegal-el-despido-de-aristegui-de-mvs-video/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/06/despido-aristegui-mvs-ilegal/&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto's successor in the presidency of Mexico, [[Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador]], promised Aristegui would be free to return to radio if she wanted and that there would be no more unfair censorship towards the freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/1508/mexico/amlo-asegura-que-procurara-el-regreso-de-carmen-aristegui-y-jose-gutierrez-vivo-a-la-radio/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Aristegui revealed in a special report arguing that Enrique Peña Nieto could have committed plagiarism on his law thesis, at least a third of it, with 197 out of 682 paragraphs being  unsourced or wrongly sourced works.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/4461186/mexican-president-plagiarize-law-thesis/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allegations of espionage on journalists====
During his tenure as president, Peña Nieto has been accused of failing to protect news journalists, whose deaths are speculated to be politically triggered, by politicians attempting to prevent them from covering political scandals. ''The New York Times'' published a news report on the matter titled, "''In Mexico it's easy to kill a journalist''", on it mentioning how Mexico became one of the worst countries in which to be a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/world/americas/veracruz-mexico-reporters-killed.html|title=In Mexico, ‘It’s Easy to Kill a Journalist’|first=Azam|last=Ahmed|date=29 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2017, ''The New York Times'' in conjunction with news reporter [[Carmen Aristegui]], and even backed by a ''[[Televisa]]'' news reporter [[Carlos Loret de Mola]], reported that the Mexican Government uses a [[spyware]] [[software]] known as [[Pegasus (spyware)|Pegasus]], to spy on targets such as Mexican News reporters (and their families) and Civil Rights Leaders (and their families) using text messages as lures. Since 2011, the Mexican Government invested $80 million worth of spyware. Pegasus spyware infiltrates a persons cellphone and reports every detail of their messages, e-mails, contacts and calendars.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/world/americas/mexico-spyware-anticrime.html|title=Using Texts as Lures, Government Spyware Targets Mexican Journalists and Their Families|first1=Azam|last1=Ahmed|first2=Nicole|last2=Perlroth|date=19 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/mexico-cellphone-software-spying-journalists-activists|title=Mexico accused of spying on journalists and activists using cellphone malware|first=David|last=Agren|date=19 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allegations of corruption====
''The New York Times'' published an article of December 2017, describing accusations towards Peña Nieto's government blocking its own investigations against corruption in the Mexican government, with a commissioner saying the Mexican government preventing the establishment of an impartial leader in the FEPADE in charge of investigating political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/world/americas/mexico-corruption-commission.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previously mentioned 22 ex-governors all members of the PRI political party are investigated for corruption with only five jailed.

By March 2018 in the dawn of the next presidential election, the PGR made official an investigation regarding PAN's candidate Ricardo Anaya laundering money. Ex-chief of FEPADE (the Mexican government's branch focused on political crimes), Santiago Nieto, whom the previous October had been controversially removed from his job as chief of FEPADE, coincidentally right after starting an investigation regarding illicit campaign money from the 2012 presidential campaign, received by Peña Nieto and would be president of [[Pemex]], [[Emilio Lozoya]] from the Brazilian conglomerate [[Odebrecht]]. The ex-chief of FEPADE, said that the accusations towards Anaya were minor in comparison to Odebretch and Peña Nieto scandal, adding also the same opinion about the money lost by SEDESOL, to corrupt governors from the PRI such as [[Javier Duarte]] and Cesar Duarte, all while PRI's presidential candidate Jose Antonio Meade was the man in charge of SEDESOL (the scandal is known as "La Estafa Maestra (The Master Robbery)" and about $435 million pesos were lost).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/01/robles-meade-estafa-maestra-sedesol/&lt;/ref&gt; The same week the PRI legislators were criticized for voting towards stopping the investigation of Odebretch against the wishes of Mexican people and organizations against corruption such as "Mexicanos contra la corrupcion (Mexicans against Corruption)".&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/internacional/2018/03/07/actualidad/1520390316_791182.html&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation about Odebretch against [[Pemex]] leader at the time Lozoya, was legally stopped after, a judge controversially ordered it days after.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.culturacolectiva.com/noticias/jueza-suspende-investigacion-contra-lozoya-por-tiempo-indefinido/&lt;/ref&gt; Satiago Nieto said that the PGR was being used as tool by Peña Nieto's government to tamper elections and benefit Meade by removing Anaya from the race, complaining that it was not neutral the manner in whom the law enforcing organizations had made more effort to investigate Anaya in a month than towards investigating Peña Nieto's Odebretch money and Meade's SEDESOL lost money in the last six years. Going as far as saying the PGR and FEPADE were only attacking the rivals of the PRI, and saying the organizations were not being neutral.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/0203/mexico/por-menos-que-lo-que-ha-hecho-la-pgr-contra-anaya-me-removieron-a-mi-santiago-nieto/&lt;/ref&gt;

Javier Duarte went to jail in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-corruption/jailed-former-mexican-governor-starts-hunger-strike-over-witch-hunt-idUSKCN1AY0D8&lt;/ref&gt; though, Cesar Duarte despite the overwhelming evidence against him, in March 2018, the PGR found him innocent of any crime. The successor governor Javier Corral from the PAN, who previously fought against the [[Televisa|Televisa law]], gave a similar opinion to Santiago Nieto, saying the PGR was being used to protect the allies of Peña Nieto and the PRI, and attack their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/articulo/default.aspx?id=1346330&amp;md5=2f59936ad96e8f39cfeaa31398842aa7&amp;ta=0dfdbac11765226904c16cb9ad1b2efe&amp;hootPostID=b87bc35a1b1c3e2e80eff9c658ae612b&lt;/ref&gt; AMLO said that not preceding towards Duarte, is one of the main reasons Mexicans lost their faith in the PRI, saying the few ex-governors declared criminals were only to simulate they care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.proceso.com.mx/526180/por-acciones-como-no-proceder-contra-cesar-duarte-la-gente-ya-no-le-cree-al-pri-amlo&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Santiago Nieto would later reveal that Peña Nieto's government tried to bribe him to keep him silent, which he refused saying “Sorry, but I can’t receive any money from Peña Nieto.”, he received menaces through phone messages with the words "Death follows you" and "Words of advice: stay out of Trouble", as a consequence he revealed to fear for the life of himself and his family.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-mexican-prosecutor-says-he-was-fired-to-stymie-corruption-probe-1521062636&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian conglomerate [[Odebrecht]], accused of corruption and bribes throughout Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41109132&lt;/ref&gt; is currently under investigation for allegedly overriding the Peña Nieto's presidential campaign with illegal campaign funds. In exchange oe the campaign money supposedly Peña Nieto gave Odebrecht contracts through state-owned [[Pemex]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/entrada-de-opinion/columna/salvador-garcia-soto/nacion/2017/08/14/odebrecht-pago-campana-de-epn&lt;/ref&gt; An Odebrecht employee told a Brazilian court that he had been asked to pay a bribe to [[Emilio Lozoya Austin]], then head of Pemex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Odebrecht Testimony in Brazil Points to Pemex Bribe in Mexico: Ex-official of Brazilian construction firm testified he was asked to pay $5 million to then-chief of Mexican oil company |publisher=Wall Street Journal |author=Juan Montes |date=5 May 2017 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/odebrecht-testimony-in-brazil-points-to-pemex-bribe-in-mexico-1494025050 |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Amparo" and "Fuero" requests against a possible political trial====
An "amparo" is a Mexican right, it can be used by anyone accused of a crime or multiple crimes, this gives them the right to know which crimes they are being accused of. It is mostly used by people expecting to go to trial, and is used to allow the prosecuted person to build a defense with the help of a lawyer. Peña Nieto is the first president in the history of Mexico to use this right, not only for himself but also for all of his collaborators during his presidency of Mexico. He took the right about an investigation regarding actions concerning the state of Chihuahua, it is feared he may have tampered the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;https://regeneracion.mx/amparo-de-epn-y-su-gabinete-porque-algo-hicieron-y-temen-que-los-alcance-la-justicia-fiscal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another right for prosecuted people is the "fuero", which Peña Nieto is also the first president in the history of Mexico to request. This right is exclusive to political figures, and is the right to be protected against legal trials and acusations of corruption committed during their time in office. Through this, he legally delayed any progress in the investigations against him, until the end of his presidency in December 2018, when the investigation will be allowed to continue.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/2110/mexico/gobierno-de-pena-nieto-busca-anular-investigaciones-del-fuero-comun-contra-funcionarios-federales/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of media bias===
'''Televisa'''

''[[Televisa]]'', the largest conglomerate broadcasting in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, was accused of tilting their coverage towards Peña Nieto ahead of the [[Mexican general election, 2012|July 1 vote]]. Thousands of university students protested of the perceived bias throughout Mexico City and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico students protest alleged media bias|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/05/201252492924104136.html|work=Al Jazeera|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexicans protest against 'media bias'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/10/mexicans-protest-against-media-bias|work=The Guardian|first=Jo|last=Tuckman|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico youth protest media's flattering coverage of Enrique Peña Nieto|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-05-24/mexico-youth-protest-medias-flattering-coverage-enrique-pe-nieto-photos|work=PRI|first=Alex|last=Leff|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2018, ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Jo Tuckman reported about dozens of computer files – forwarded to ''The Guardian'' by a source who worked with ''Televisa'' but hasn't been possible to confirm the authenticity of the documents – suggesting that ''Televisa'' sold favorable coverage to Peña Nieto when he was governor of the state of Mexico and developed a [[smear campaign|dirty tricks campaign]] against López Obrador ahead of his first bid for the presidency in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer files link TV dirty tricks to favourite for Mexico presidency|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/mexico-presidency-tv-dirty-tricks|work=The Guardian|first=Jo|last=Tuckman|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Televisa'' and the PRI suggested that the documents were false.

On the March 24, 2014 weekly [[Time (magazine)|Time]] issue, Peña Nieto was issued on the front cover with the headline, "Saving Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;http://content.time.com/time/covers/pacific/0,16641,20140224,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was credited for having passed social, political, and economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Mexico's New Mission|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2165465-1,00.html|work=Time|first=Michael|last=Crowley|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front cover was met with widespread disapproval of the Mexican public, prompting various spoofs on social media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enrique Pena Nieto’s TIME Cover Sparks Outrage In Mexico (PHOTOS)|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/17/enrique-pena-nieto-time_n_4803677.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Carolina|last=Moreno|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time magazine just made lots of enemies in Mexico|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-02-15/time-magazine-just-made-lots-enemies-mexico|work=PRI|first=Alex|last=Leff|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; even prompting a petition to have him removed from the cover.

===Evaluations as president and legacy===
In August 2016, Peña Nieto's approval ratings dropped to 23 percent (74 percent said they disapproved of his performance), which newspaper ''Reforma'' revealed to be the lowest approval rating for a president since they began polling in 1995.&lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-mexican-president-enrique-pe-nieto-so-unpopular-n640611|title=Why Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is so unpopular|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approval decreased to 12% by January 19, 2017.&lt;ref name="Eric Martin @EMPosts More stories by Eric Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-18/mexico-s-pena-nieto-approval-falls-to-12-after-gasoline-soars|title=Mexican President's Support Plumbs New Low as Gasoline Soars|author=Eric Martin @EMPosts More stories by Eric Martin|date=|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, the lack of popularity and credibity of Peña Nieto's government, is perceived to have caused his political party the PRI, to suffer its most monumental defeat, getting the least percentage of votes in the history of the PRI. The candidate [[Jose Antonio Meade]], and the political party did not win majority of votes within any of the 300 voting locations around the 32 states of Mexico, losing to other political parties. The PRI was also defeated, on each of the nine elections for state governors where MORENA won five, PAN three, and [[Citizens' Movement (Mexico)|Citizens' Movement]] one. The presidency of Mexico went to [[Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador]], from MORENA.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/07/morena-logra-5-de-9-gubernaturas-pri-pierde/&lt;/ref&gt; The PRI also lost to MORENA in [[Atlacomulco]], the hometown of Enrique Peña Nieto.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/el-pri-perdio-en-atlacomulco-cuna-de-enrique-pena-nieto&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://regeneracion.mx/pena-nieto-pierde-hasta-atlacomulco-ante-morena/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[prehistoric art]], '''finger flutings''' are lines that fingers leave on a soft surface. Considered a form of [[cave painting]], they occur in [[cave]]s throughout southern Australia, New Guinea, and southwestern Europe, and were presumably made over a considerable time span including some or all of the [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2006. The study of finger flutings. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:3, 281-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Most are not obvious figures or symbols but, rather, appear to many observers as enigmatic lines. They are also called '''tracés digitaux''' or '''finger tracings''' and (though these terms are also in part interpretative) '''meanders''', '''macaroni''', and '''serpentines'''. The term '''finger fluting''' was coined by [[Robert Bednarik]].

Generally they are made in a substance called [[moonmilk]]. Sometimes they are made through a thin clay film into moonmilk underneath or perhaps just into clay.

As [[Henri Breuil]] has published, finger flutings have been recognized since the early days of the 20th century in Europe as Paleolithic. Their recognition as having a similar antiquity outside of Europe lay chiefly in the hands of Sandor (Alexander) Gallus and then in Koonalda Cave in Australia. Many other sites both in Europe and Australia have been found, some of the more famous being Gargas&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2010. Fluted Animals in the Zone of Crevices, Gargas Cave, France. Proceedings of the Eleventh Congress of the International Federation of Rock Art Organizations, Lisbon, Portugal, 4–9 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and Baume Latronne caves in France and the [[cave of Altamira]] in Spain.

==Study methods==
Bednarik continues to publish sites that contain flutings, but current forward research into finger flutings is mainly being carried out by [[Kevin J. Sharpe]] and [[Leslie Van Gelder]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, K. &amp; Van Gelder, L. 2006b. The study of finger flutings. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:3, 281-295.&lt;/ref&gt; They have developed the following methods for this purpose. Their cornerstones include multiple examinations of the flutings under investigation, experimentation, and the initial and primarily setting aside of questions of meaning (as such assumptions can determine what investigators then see in the flutings). The physical data in the flutings themselves comprise what they seek: how the fluters constructed their flutings, how the flutings functioned with respect to one other and, if possible, how the flutings functioned for the fluters. Sharpe and Van Gelder use a specific terminology for their studies and call upon three analyses.

===Terminology===

A ''fluter'' makes a fluting by sweeping their fingers across a soft surface; a ''unit'' comprises flutings drawn with one sweep of one hand or finger; the ''profile'' of a unit or a fluter comprises the silhouette of the finger tops left in the medium from the fluting; a ''cluster'' comprises an isolatable group of units that exhibit a unity, for instance because they overlay each other; and a ''panel'' comprises a collection of clusters that appears geographically or otherwise distant from other clusters or on a surface of reasonably uniform orientation.

===Internal analysis===

In terms of the field methodology, having become familiar with a cluster, an Internal Analysis of it is carried out, specially noting the directions of the flutings and their overlays. This provides the differentiation of clusters and units, and the temporal sequence of the flutings. The analysis relates to [[Alexander Marshack]]’s question, asked especially for engraved line markings: What do the order, direction of and (especially for engravings) the tools for creation of the lines tell about the mind of the artifact creator when creating? Though Marshack pioneered this technique, it has been modified in its application by others such as Bednarik, Francesco d’Errico, and Michel Lorblanchet. It forms the backbone of research into line markings such as flutings.

===Forensic analysis===

One of their additions to this methodological base, Sharpe and Van Gelder call a ‘Forensic Analysis.’ In this, they record where possible whether the left or right hand made the unit under examination, as indicated by the presence of marks that the first or fifth finger – written F1 or F5 – would make. These appear distinctively different from one another and from the marks of the other fingers. They measure the width of the F2-F4 set of marks at their narrowest, calling this the 3-fingered width of the unit. The width data for the three fingers suggest the age category of the fluter, namely whether a young child or older.
A Forensic Analysis also examines the profile of a 4- or 5-fingered unit, for frequently units start with the tops of fingers and the investigator needs at least four fingers to tell whether the hand is left or right. Then the investigator records the relative height of F2 to F4 against F3. This would suggest the [[gender]] of the fluter painter. Further, consistency of widths and profiles, and perhaps some other features among units suggest the same person painted them with the finger-fluting technique.

==Results of studies==

Sharpe and Van Gelder’s work has focused on flutings found in the French caves of Rouffignac, in the Dordogne, and Gargas in the Hautes Pyrenees. Using the above methods, they have shown:&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelder, L. and Sharpe, K. 2009.

* indications as to the fluter’s identity (in particular, distinguishing the flutings made by an individual fluter).

==Interpretations==

The lack of thorough studies, let alone methods for doing them, means speculation as to the meaning of flutings runs unchecked, even by the most well-known experts on prehistoric art. They are seen, for example, as representing such things as the first scribbles by humans, though intuitive and random but serpentines (Breuil); water related (Marshack); entopic shapes or phosphenes (Bednarik); huts, comets, or rivers, or linear-phallic and male symbols in the statistical placement of signs within a cave (Leroi-Gourhan); snakes (and thereby associated with death) (Barrière); psycho-neurological archetypes (Gallus); hunting marks (Barrière); shamanic ritual (Lewis-Williams). The corpus of Paleolithic flutings is too complex to fit into a single meaning paradigm. Too much in prehistoric ‘art’ does not conform to what modern people might see as figures and symbols, flutings offering an example. Investigators bring to their study and tie their methods to preconceived notions as to what is meaningful, what constitutes a pattern, and what they think is the origin of fluting making. No one now may ever know the meaning of the flutings and no one now should expect to know it.

That need not stop people responsibly offering meaning or intentionality hypotheses, Sharpe and Van Gelder state. But all such hypotheses must subject themselves to the data uncovered by investigations using methods such as those above.

'''Francis Oliver Finch''' (1802–1862), was an English [[watercolour]] painter, and a member of [[Ancients (art group)|The Ancients]], the group of young artists formed around [[Samuel Palmer]] and the elderly 
[[William Blake]] in the 1820s.

==Life==
Finch was the son of Francis Finch, a merchant in Friday Street, [[Cheapside]], London, was born on 22 November 1802, and spent his boyhood at Stone, near [[Aylesbury]]. When twelve years of age, at that time 
fatherless, he was placed under [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], with whom he worked altogether five years, a friend having paid a premium of £200. Among his earliest patrons was [[John Rushout, 2nd 
Baron Northwick|Lord Northwick]], a patron of the fine arts, who employed FInch in making views of his mansion and grounds. Some time after leaving his master's studio the same friend who had assisted in 
placing him there afforded him the benefit of a tour through Scotland.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

After his return he doubted for some time whether he should continue the  practice of landscape or enter as a student at the [[Royal Academy]]. He joined [[Henry Sass|Sass's life academy]] and produced several 
portraits, but circumstances drawing him back to landscape-painting he became a candidate for admission into the then newly formed [[Society of Painters in Water Colours]]. On 11 February 1822 he was elected an 
associate, and on 4 June 1827 a member of that society. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, at that period living at 44 Conduit Street, Bond Street. He married in the spring of 1837, and lived in Charlotte Street for some time, and later in Argyle Square, [[Euston Road]]. 

He possessed a fine voice, and was a talented musician, and  a poet. He printed a collection of sonnets entitled ''An Artist's Dream''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; 

==Works==
Among his best works may be counted ''Garmallon's Tomb'', (oil 1820); ''View of Loch Lomond'' (1822); ''View on the River Tay'' (1827); ''View of Windsor Castle'' (1829); ''View of the College of Aberdeen'' (1832); ''The Dell of [[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (1835); ''Alpine Scene, Evening'' (1838); ''A Watch Tower'' (1840); ''The Thames near Cookham, Berkshire'' (1845); ''Ruined Temple, Evening'' (1852); ''Rocky Glen, Evening'' (1855); ''The Curfew - Gray's Elegy'' (1860); ''Pastoral Retreat'' (1861); and ''Moonlight over the Sea'' (1862). His portrait was engraved by A. Roffe.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{DNB|wstitle=Finch, Francis Oliver|last=Fagan|first=Louis Alexander|volume=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 10 October 1861 Finch lost the use of his limbs, and died 27 August 1862.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2492">'''George Dickie''' (born 12 August 1926 in [[Palmetto, Florida]]) is a Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].&lt;ref name="faculty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigger.uic.edu/~gdickie/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212134133/http://tigger.uic.edu/~gdickie/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 December 2012 |title=George Dickie faculty page |website=University of Illinois at Chicago |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His specialities include aesthetics, philosophy of art and Eighteenth Century theories of taste.

==Education and career==
He received a BA from [[Florida State University]] in 1949 and a PhD from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1959.&lt;ref name = "faculty" /&gt; He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/78fellow.html |title=1978 U.S. and Canadian Fellows |website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |accessdate=5 May 2014 via Wayback Machine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312160335/http://www.gf.org/78fellow.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as President of the Illinois Philosophy Association (1990–91) and President of the [[American Society for Aesthetics]] (1993–94).

==Work==
He is an influential philosopher of art working in the analytical tradition. His [[institutional theory of art]] inspired both supporters who produced variations on the theory as well as detractors.

One of his more influential works is ''The Century of Taste'' (1996), an inquiry into several eighteenth-century philosophers' treatments of the subject.  The bulk of the work is devoted to championing [[David Hume]]'s treatment of the subject over that of [[Immanuel Kant]].  A review of the work can be found in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', 107:3 (July, 1998).

'''''George Lopez''''' &lt;!-- STOP...do NOT change to 'was' --&gt;is&lt;!-- NOTE-remains as "is" per Wikipedia convention; see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Lead paragraphs]]. --&gt; an American television [[sitcom]] created by comedian [[George Lopez]], [[Bruce Helford]] and [[Robert Borden (TV producer)|Robert Borden]], which originally aired for six seasons, 120 episodes, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from March 27, 2002, to May 8, 2007.  It is currently in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. ''George Lopez'' stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home. The series was produced by [[Sandra Bullock|Fortis Films]] and [[Mohawk Productions]] in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The executive producers consisted of Lopez himself, Bruce Helford, Deborah Oppenheimer and [[Sandra Bullock]].

== Premise ==
[[File:GeorgeLopezsitcomcast.jpg|thumb|left|The season 4 cast of ''George Lopez'' (from left to right): Valente Rodriguez as Ernie Cardenas, Constance Marie with Luis Armand Garcia as Angie and Max Lopez, Emiliano Díez as Vic Palmero, Belita Moreno as Benny Lopez, George Lopez as George Lopez, and Masiela Lusha as Carmen Lopez.]]

The comedy revolves around a fictionalized portrayal of Lopez, working at the Powers Brothers aviation factory and raising his family consisting of his wife Angie, his daughter Carmen, and his son, Max, after having endured a dysfunctional and miserable childhood at the hands of his [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], neglectful mother Benny, who is portrayed as selfish and cold-hearted. Other characters include Angie's indulgent father Vic Palmero, a [[wealth]]y [[physician|doctor]], and George's best childhood friend Ernie Cardenas, noted for his unsuccessful attempts at dating and his socially awkward behavior. After Carmen's departure from the series, the role fulfilled by her character was replaced with Angie's overindulged niece Veronica, with a large [[trust fund]] that has been entrusted under George's care.

Multiple storylines in the series are established through the unveiling of a secret guarded by Benny throughout George's whole childhood, most notably the discovery that his father Manny is still alive after George had been convinced by his mother that he died. Throughout a majority of the program, George tries to locate the whereabouts of his father, who was introduced at last in one episode and was revealed to be a nasty, yet successful [[Businessperson|businessman]], having remarried with his second lover Lydia and fathered a few more children. However, Manny's personality was commonly depicted as being [[Verbal abuse|abusive]] toward his son and former wife in the few appearances that he made, before his death in one episode of [[Chronic kidney disease|kidney disease]]. Nonetheless, he prohibits his son's family from attending his [[funeral]] in protection of his reputation, much to George's fury.

Though Bullock had connections through Hollywood, ''The George Lopez Show'' was not an easy sell.&lt;ref name=nytimes-sitcom&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/27/arts/life-so-sad-he-had-be-funny-george-lopez-mines-rich-vein-gloom-with-all-latino.html |title=A Life So Sad He Had to Be Funny; George Lopez Mines a Rich Vein of Gloom With an All-Latino Sitcom |last=Navarro |first=Mireya |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=November 27, 2002 |access-date=December 22, 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223054000/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/27/arts/life-so-sad-he-had-be-funny-george-lopez-mines-rich-vein-gloom-with-all-latino.html |archive-date=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock sought the help of Bruce Helford (who created ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' and had been a head writer for ''[[Roseanne]]''), and, due to his history with ABC on those shows, became a co-creator and executive producer of Lopez's show.&lt;ref name=nytimes-sitcom/&gt; Bullock, Helford, and two of the show's other executive producers met with ABC executives later that month, and the network tested the show with 4 episodes, before committing to 13 episodes the following fall and eventually adding an additional 9.&lt;ref name=wapo-lookback/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes-sitcom/&gt; Lopez was given full starring, creator, producer and writer credits for the show.&lt;ref name=wapo-lookback/&gt; ''The George Lopez Show'' was seen as an attempt from ABC to diversify their programming, while still appealing to the widest possible audience.&lt;ref name=wapo-lookback/&gt; ABC executives were hopeful that Lopez's humor and relatability would draw a large family audience, focusing on marketing the series as much as possible.&lt;ref name=wapo-lookback/&gt; The network bought promotional time for the show on Spanish-language networks, and took out full-page ads in some magazines.&lt;ref name=wapo-lookback/&gt;

Lopez drew much of the material for the show from his own life experiences, especially his upbringing in the [[San Fernando Valley]].&lt;ref name=wapo-lookback/&gt; Upon the series debut, Lopez became one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Freddie Prinze]], and [[John Leguizamo]].

=== Casting ===
For the first five seasons, the show had an all-Latino cast with the exception of [[Albanian American]] actress [[Masiela Lusha]], who played George's daughter Carmen.  During the show's fifth season, [[Aimee Garcia]] was cast as George's niece, Veronica.

=== Music ===
The show's theme song is "[[Low Rider]]", performed by [[War (band)|War]]. The theme plays in the opening credits and was present when the show aired on ABC as well as syndication, but was replaced in the DVD releases of all seasons except 1 episode due to licensing costs. At the [[9th ALMA Awards]] in 2007, George Lopez called the song the "[[Chicano]] National Anthem".

=== Cancellation ===
The series finale aired on May 8, 2007, after the show was canceled by ABC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/05/2007_cancelled_shows_abc_cuts_some_beloved_series.php | title = TV Series Finale - 2007 Canceled Shows: ABC Cuts Some Beloved Series | publisher = TV Series Finale | accessdate = 2007-05-15 | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070517044954/http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/05/2007_cancelled_shows_abc_cuts_some_beloved_series.php | archivedate = 2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lopez, ABC prime-time entertainment president Steve McPherson called him over the weekend and explained that the network would lose money if the show was picked up again, and that it wasn't doing well financially.&lt;ref name=lopez-lashes-out&gt;{{Citation | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/15/entertainment/et-lopez15 | title = George Lopez lashes out at ABC - Los Angeles Times | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = 2014-06-25 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014192002/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/15/entertainment/et-lopez15 | archivedate = 2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lopez stated that the explanation was "painful to hear," noting that the show had four different time slots in only five years and had to constantly compete against shows like ''[[American Idol]]'', yet the final season of the show was still able to outperform two comedy series that were renewed by ABC: ''[[Notes from the Underbelly]]'' and ''[[The Knights of Prosperity]]''. Lopez said that ABC "dealt with us from the bottom of the deck" and that it was "hard to take after what was a good run."&lt;ref name=lopez-lashes-out/&gt;

Lopez attributed the cancellation in part to the fact that the show was not produced directly by ABC Studios, but instead by Warner Bros. Television.&lt;ref name=lopez-lashes-out/&gt; Lopez also criticized ABC's decision to approve the show ''[[Cavemen (TV series)|Cavemen]]'', being perplexed at the circumstances: "So a Chicano can't be on TV, but a caveman can?" According to Lopez, 170 staff members who worked on the show lost their jobs. Lopez explained that he "took the five years of good, and I did a lot with the good. My popularity, I was involved in charities, I overcame my illness, all on TV. I shared all of that with America – every secret I had... Every emotion. Everything was open to the show. And what happens?"&lt;ref name=lopez-lashes-out/&gt; In spite of the cancellation, nightly episode re-runs continue to air on various networks both in the United States and abroad (see the "Syndication" section below).

On September 2, 2016, George Lopez announced through his Instagram that there are talks to bringing the show back on the air, but nothing has been announced.

== Distribution ==

=== Broadcast and syndication ===
The show entered syndication one month after the series finale on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and is distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]. The show aired in broadcast syndication on independent stations, and affiliates of Fox, The CW and MyNetworkTV as well as [[The CW Plus]] stations in the United States from 2007-2011 and on [[Telelatino]] in Canada. The show moved to [[ION Television]] on Thursday, Sept. 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pavan -- SitcomsOnline.com |url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/09/ion-television-fall-2011-schedule-now.html |title=ION Television Fall 2011 Schedule Now Has George Lopez; Centric Weekend Marathons - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog |publisher=Blog.sitcomsonline.com |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140301140949/http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/09/ion-television-fall-2011-schedule-now.html |archivedate=2014-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 2007, it was announced that ''George Lopez'' would join the [[Nick at Nite]] lineup. It first aired on Nick at Nite on September 10, 2007 – it was the most current non-original show to air on Nick at Nite&lt;ref name="Nick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickatnite.com/shows/georgelopez/index.jhtml|accessdate=2007-12-27|title=George Lopez at Nick At Nite|publisher=Nick At Nite|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227131222/http://www.nickatnite.com/shows/georgelopez/index.jhtml|archivedate=2007-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (until it was announced that ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'' would join the lineup, followed by ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'' and ''[[Mom (TV series)|Mom]]''). To this date, it continues to be their highest rated series and one of cable's best for an off-network sitcom.

Never a major hit in primetime, the show became an unexpected success in syndication. Many markets also moved the show from overnight timeslots to more desirable ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/lopez-sleeper-hit/32106 |title= 'Lopez' A Sleeper Hit {{!}} Broadcasting &amp; Cable |website= www.broadcastingcable.com |access-date= 2018-02-04 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180204183814/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/lopez-sleeper-hit/32106 |archivedate= 2018-02-04 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episodes from the first four seasons of ''George Lopez'' do not use those respective seasons' opening titles, the season five version is used instead (this is evident as Emiliano Diez is credited in the sequence, which is slightly longer than how they were originally broadcast on ABC, though there is also a short version also used in syndication that also differs from the original short opening credits that does not credit him for seasons 1-3, even though Diez did not make his first guest appearance until season two and did not become a cast regular until season four); the final two seasons use those seasons' appropriate versions of the opening credits.

On [[MTV Tr3s]], the show premiered on the  network's redebut July 12, 2010 and reruns are being shown there.

On [[ION Television]], the show premiered on the network's Sunday marathon starting on October 2, 2011 but then, was later pulled off their schedule.

In May 2016, the series was added to [[TV Land]]'s line-up.

[[Image:Amine Discovered with the Goule.jpg|thumb|"Amine Discovered with the Goule", from the story of Sidi Nouman, of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''|229x229px]]

A '''ghoul''' ({{lang-ar|الغول}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-ghuûl}}''), is a [[demon]] or [[monster]] originating in [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabian religion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghoul {{!}} Arabian mythology |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ghoul |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with graveyards and consuming human flesh. In modern fiction, the term has often been used for a certain kind of [[undead]] monster. 

By extension, the word ''ghoul'' is also used in a derogatory sense to refer to a person who delights in the [[macabre]], or whose profession is linked directly to death, such as a [[gravedigger]] or [[Grave robbery|graverobber]].

== Early etymology ==
Ghoul is from the [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|غُول}} ''ghūl'', from {{Lang|ar|غَالَ}} ''ghāla'', "to seize".&lt;ref name="Lebling2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lebling|title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKL3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96|date=30 July 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-063-3|pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arabic]], the term is also sometimes used to describe a greedy or gluttonous individual.

The term was first used in English literature in 1786, in [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] novel ''[[Vathek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O27-ghoul.html|title=Ghoul Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Ghoul|date=|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes the ''ghūl'' of Arabic folklore. This definition of the ghoul has persisted until modern times, with ghouls appearing in [[Ghouls in popular culture|popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Rawi|first1=Ahmed K.|date=11 November 2009|title=The Arabic Ghoul and its Western Transformation|journal=Folklore|volume=120|issue=3|pages=291–306|doi=10.1080/00155870903219730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==
[[File:Shah Namah, the Persian Epic of the Kings Wellcome L0035191.jpg|thumb|Ghouls gathering for combat in a Persian poem|274x274px]]

In the Arabic folklore, the ''ghūl'' is said to dwell in [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and other uninhabited places. A male ghoul is referred to as ''ghūl'' while the female is called ''ghulah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Werewolf Book: The Encyclopedia of Shape-Shifting Beings|last=Steiger|first=Brad|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2011|isbn=9781578593675|location=Canton, MI|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; A source identified the Arabic ghoul as a female creature who is sometimes called Mother Ghoul (''umm'' ''ghūla)'' or a relational term such as Aunt Ghoul.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture|last=Reynolds|first=Dwight|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780521898072|location=Cambridge|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is portrayed in many tales luring hapless characters, who are usually men, into her home where she can eat them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some state that a ghoul is a desert-dwelling, shapeshifting demon that can assume the guise of an animal, especially a [[striped hyena|hyena]]. It lures unwary people into the desert wastes or abandoned places to slay and devour them. The creature also preys on young children, drinks blood, steals coins, and eats the dead,&lt;ref name="merweb"&gt;{{cite web|title=ghoul|website=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|url=http://webster.com/dictionary/ghoul|accessdate=January 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; then taking the form of the person most recently eaten. One of the narratives identified a ghoul named Ghul-I-Beaban, a particularly monstrous character believed to be inhabiting the wilderness of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead|last=Melton|first=J Gordon|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2010|isbn=9781578592814|location=Canton, MI|pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until [[Antoine Galland]] translated ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' into [[French language|French]] that the western idea of ghoul was introduced into European society. Galland depicted the ghoul as a monstrous creature that dwelled in cemeteries, feasting upon corpses. 

Ghouls ({{lang-fa|غول}}) also exist in [[Iranian folklore]].

'''Gibraltar Photographic Society''' was established in January 1965 in Gibraltar. The object of the Society is to raise the standards of photography by organising meetings, lectures, excursions, competitions; encouraging beginners and advanced alike by&amp;nbsp;the exchange of ideas and to affiliate with foreign clubs and societies. All classes of&amp;nbsp;photography shall be included.

== Photography in Gibraltar before the formation of the GPS ==
In 1940 a camera club was formed by a group of Gibraltarians who held their meetings at the now defunct Calpe Institute. This club was never firmly established and more often than not it was closed due to lack of support from both local photographers and those from the Services. The problem was very likely due to the fact that no photographer in Gibraltar had the experience of organising and running successfully a club of this nature.

In 1960, after having run for some months with a very small membership, the club closed, never to re-open. Its assets, about £30, were placed in a suspended account and held by the Committee of the Calpe Institute. Any hopes of re-forming the club were dashed by the closing of the Calpe Institute itself.

During most of this time, the United Services Camera Club based at the Command Education Centre, ran successfully under various names, though with a small membership. The Club was not open to local civilians. This Club was closed in July 1964 by the Command Education Officer as a result of poor administration in the Club’s affairs, and re-opened in October 1964.

=== Formation of the Gibraltar Photographic Society ===
In October 1964, a Sergeant K Lloyd of the Middlesex Regiment and member of the United Services Camera Club, and local photographer Mr Albert Pizzarello put on an exhibition at the John Mackintosh Hall with a view of generating interest in the formation of a Service/civilian club. The venture proved successful and that same month a meeting was held at the John Mackintosh Hall with the aim of forming a camera club which would be open to everyone in Gibraltar, including servicemen and UK based civilians. The club was to be called The John Mackintosh Hall Camera Club, and would incorporate the United Services Camera Club. A caretaker Committee was formed and a provisional programme arranged.

In January 1965, the first Annual General Meeting took place and the following officers appointed :

Chairman :&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Wing Commander P A Rumbold Scott, RAF

Secretary &amp; A/Chairman&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A A Hammon, Esq

Treasurer &amp; A/Secretary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Staff Sergeant C P Berry, RAOC

Syllabus Secretary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A J Pizzarello, Esq

House Member&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A Perera, Esq

Committee Members &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - T Adamberry, Esq

- M M Bonilla, Esq

- Sgt K Lloyd was co-opted to the Committee.

The Chairman due to his appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer, RAF North Front, was frequently away from Gibraltar and so his duties were in the main carried out by Mr Hammon. As a result, S/Sgt Berry usually carried out the task of Secretary as well as that of Treasurer. Lectures, initial organisation and instruction were generally carried out by Messrs Berry and Pizzarello.

Later that year the Committee decided to change the name of the Club to that of The Gibraltar Photographic Society. An application for affiliation to The Photographic Alliance of Great Britain was accepted. The aims of the Society were as follows :

(a) To stimulate and promote amateur photographic activity within Gibraltar

(b) To provide a congenial club atmosphere where enthusiasts can meet others similarly inclined.

(c) To instruct, guide and assist novices in basic theoretical and practical&amp;nbsp;photographic work

(d) To cater for the intermediate and advanced amateur photographer by means of lectures, demonstrations,                               visual aids, instruction and discussion

(e) To work in close liaison with the Photographic Alliance of Great Britain, to &amp;nbsp; promote the advancement of, and                         maintain a high standard of amateur&amp;nbsp;photography in Gibraltar.

Subscriptions were set at 5 shillings (25p) a month for full members and 2 shillings and 6 pence (12½p) for those under the age of 18. Meetings were held on Wednesdays at fortnightly intervals, with a short recess during the Summer. Several local professional photographers were elected to Honorary Membership, and Lady Lathbury, the Governor’s wife, accepted to become patroness of the Society.

==== To the present ====
By February 1966, the membership of the Society stood at around 40, with the average attendance at meetings between 20 and 25. Initially, novices were placed into groups with an intermediate or advanced worker nominated as group leader whose duty was to instruct the novices. Printing was carried out in the group leader’s own darkroom or at the John Mackintosh Hall. This system worked but with great difficulty, and was eventually abandoned. Competitions for black and white prints were held about once a month, and based on set themes. Entries were limited to 4 prints per person, and the print size restricted to 9 x 7 inches. It was not till 1974 that the first slides competition was held. This was just a one-off event. It was not till 1977 that regular slides competitions were incorporated into the annual programme, whilst the first colour prints competitions were not introduced till 1979. Initially, beginners had to compete in the same group as everybody else, but in 1973 they were provided with their own set of competitions.

Since its founding, the Society has held an annual exhibition. At first this consisted of black and white prints, but in 1977 two other sections were added : a colour prints section and one for beginners. The addition of a slides section had to wait till 1986. The size and popularity of the exhibition grew to such an extent that since 1982 two exhibition rooms have been required for it. Problems with the judging of the annual exhibition resulted in the Society getting in touch with the Royal Photographic Society in 1982 with a view of their providing an adjudicator. This they did and have continued to do so up to the present, resulting in our forging very close links with this world-renowned organisation.

In 1968 the Society only had one challenge trophy in its possession : The Society Challenge Cup, which was presented to the winner of the competitions held during the year. By 1980 the total had increased to 11 as the number of competitions and the number of sections in the annual exhibition increased. In 1985, the late Alex Perera presented a trophy he had made himself for the award of the title of Photographer of the Year to the person obtaining the highest aggregate of points in competitions during the course of the year. Today the total number of challenge trophies is 20!

The logo of the Society was designed by Mr A Harper in 1977 and the proof drawing made by Mr A Ryman MBE. Also in that year the Society made its first application for funds from the Government Cultural Grants Committee and succeeded in obtaining the sum of £90. Thanks to subsequent grants from this Committee, the Society has been able to purchase much needed equipment, and more recently for the purchase of books to help establish a good reference library. Also in 1977 first contacts were made with the Malta Photographic Society. This was the first of many such contacts with other clubs and societies, especially from U.K., with the view of exchanging ideas and holding competitions. In 1986 the Society became members of the Southern Photographic Federation of Great Britain, and through them affiliated to the Photographic Alliance of&amp;nbsp; Great Britain. As members of the SPF the Society has competed every year in their league competitions. Contacts with Spanish clubs in La Linea and Algeciras were established in 1984, and a few competitions and exhibitions have been held with them since then.

In 1981 the Society held its first basic course on photography, aimed at members who were beginners, but also opened to the general public. These successful courses have been kept up to the present.

In 1976 a need was felt for updating and extending the statute of the Society. A new statute was voted in April of that year. Minor revisions were made in 1982 and in 1983&amp;nbsp; with respect to classes of membership, and again in 1984 with respect to the use of the darkroom and equipment. In 1990 further changes were made with respect to the use of the Society’s equipment and premises, and lastly in 1994 with respect of classes of membership once again.

The 150th anniversary of the invention of photography was marked in1989 by the Society holding a special exhibition. For this exhibition copy prints of early historical photographs were purchased from the RPS, and exhibited together with hundreds of old and personal photographs loaned by members of the public, depicting family photos and old views of Gibraltar. The exhibition was a great success.

First enquiries on the acquisition of premises were made in 1985, and at the end of that year, during the opening of a special exhibition marking the 20th anniversary of the Society, the then Minister for Education Mr G Mascarenhas announced that we were being offered premises at Wellington Front.&amp;nbsp; These premises were officially handed over in January 1986, and works on refurbishing them commenced in April. By March 1987 the bulk of the works were over in the main hall, and the first Annual General Meeting held there that month. Works still continued in refurbishing the rest of the premises, and in fitting out a darkroom. The darkroom at John Mackintosh Hall was demolished in December 1989, and it was not till August 1990 that the one at Wellington Front became operational. The official opening of the premises was held on 26 November 1990, and carried out by H.E. the Governor Sir Derek Reffell. This coincided with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Society. The acquisition of&amp;nbsp; the premises resulted in the Society being able to extend its activities without restrictions, and in the acquisition of the type of equipment which would have been impossible to obtain otherwise.

At present the Society is self-sufficient in terms of darkroom, audio-visual and studio facilities. The Society has also embraced the advent of digital imaging without any reservations; in all competitions digitally processed and manipulated images are accepted on a par with traditionally processed ones. With the help of awards from the Government Cultural Grants Committee, the Society has purchased three computers, two printers, two slides/negative scanner, a flat-bed scanner and a digital projector. In the programme of events for the year, a significant amount of time is dedicated to learning how to use imaging programmes, and the hardware.

=== Premises ===
The Society has premises which will shortly be refurbished in Summer 2015 at  Wellington Front, their mailing address  :

Wellington Front, PO Box 1422,  Gibraltar.

'''Harry Bolus''' (28 April 1834 – 25 May 1911)&lt;ref name="GunnCodd1981" /&gt; was a South African botanist, botanical artist, businessman and philanthropist. He advanced botany in South Africa by establishing bursaries, founding the [[Bolus Herbarium]] and bequeathing his library and a large part of his fortune to the South African College (now the [[University of Cape Town]]). Active in scientific circles, he was a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society]], member and president of the South African Philosophical Society (later the [[Royal Society of South Africa]]), the SA Medal and Grant by the [[S2A3|SA Association for the Advancement of Science]] and an honorary D.Sc. from the University of the Cape of Good Hope. Volume 121 of ''Curtis's Botanical Magazine''{{clarify|reason= need a more detailed reference|date=October 2017}} was dedicated to him. He is commemorated in five genera: ''Bolusia'' Benth., ''Bolusafra'' Kuntze, ''Neobolusia'' Schltr., ''Bolusanthus'' Harms and ''Bolusiella'' Schltr., as well as numerous specific names.

==Biography==
Bolus was born in [[Nottingham]], England. He was educated at Castle Gate School, Nottingham. The headmaster George Herbert regularly corresponded with and received plant specimens from William Kensit of [[Grahamstown]], South Africa. Kensit requested that the headmaster send him one of his pupils as an assistant; Harry Bolus duly landed at [[Port Elizabeth]] from the ship ''Jane'' in March 1850. He spent two years with Kensit and then moved to Port Elizabeth. Following a short visit to England, he settled in [[Graaff-Reinet]], where he would live for the next 19 years. In 1857 he married Sophia Kensit, the sister of William Kensit. Between 1858 and 1870 they had 3 sons and a daughter. In 1864 he lost his eldest son of six years, and [[Francis Guthrie]] who had become a close friend, suggested his taking up botany to ameliorate his loss. He started his botanical collection in 1865 and was soon corresponding with [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] at Kew, [[William Henry Harvey]] in Dublin and [[Peter MacOwan]] in Grahamstown. One of his most treasured gifts was a copy of [[A. P. de Candolle|De Candolle]]'s ''[[Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis|Prodromus]]'' received from Guthrie in 1869. In 1875, he joined his brother Walter in Cape Town, settling in the suburb of Kenilworth, where they founded a stockbroking firm called ''Bolus Bros''. The following year he and Guthrie made their first visit to Kew, taking with them a large number of plant specimens for naming. Bolus described the period as 'forty happy days'. Returning in the ''Windsor Castle'' in October 1876, the ship struck a reef off [[Dassen Island]] with the loss of his specimens and notes.&lt;ref name="band_Wind" /&gt;&lt;ref name="digi_Wrec" /&gt; Not daunted, he set about the collection of new specimens and organised expeditions to various corners of South Africa. He was an excellent field botanist and published numerous books on his observations. Although adventurous by nature, he was also quiet and unassuming.

His business flourished so he was able to acquire many fine botanical books. Complete sets of the ''Botanical Magazine'', ''Botanical Register'', ''Refugium Botanicum'', and the large folios of [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]], [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin]], [[Ferdinand Bauer]] and [[Francis Masson]] formed part of his collection. He founded the Harry Bolus Professorship at the Cape University and left a large trust for scholarships. He also donated his extensive herbarium and library to the South African College. He was one of the founding Members of the South African Philosophical Society.

Harry Bolus loved visiting England and made a total of 28 voyages (14 each way) to and from South Africa. He died of heart failure at [[Oxted]], Surrey, on 25 May 1911. His youngest son Frank married [[Harriet Margaret Louisa Kensit]], William Kensit's granddaughter, the following year. {{botanist|Bolus|Bolus, Harry|border=0}}

[[Image:Goodoldgaietyhis00holluoft 47.jpg|right|thumb|Byron in the 1870s]]
'''Henry James Byron''' (8 January 1835 – 11 April 1884) was a prolific English dramatist, as well as an editor, journalist, director, theatre manager, novelist and actor.

After an abortive start at a medical career, Byron struggled as a provincial actor and aspiring playwright in the 1850s.  Returning to London and beginning to study for the [[Bar examination|Bar]], he finally found playwriting success in [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and other punny plays.  In the 1860s, he became an editor of humorous magazines and a noted man-about-town, while continuing to build his playwriting reputation, notably as co-manager, with [[Marie Wilton]], of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  In 1869, he returned to the stage as an actor and, during the same period, wrote numerous successful plays, including the historic international success, ''[[Our Boys]]''.  In his last years, he grew frail from [[tuberculosis]] and died at the age of 49.

==Biography==
Byron was born in [[Manchester]], England, the son of Henry Byron (1804–1884, second cousin to the poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and descendant of many Lord Byrons), at one time British consul in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and Elizabeth Josephine ''née'' Bradley.  He was educated in [[Essex]] and then at St. Peter's Collegiate School in [[Eaton Square]], London.  Although his mother wanted him to pursue a career in the Navy, Byron did not do so.  Instead, he first became a physician's clerk in London for four years and then studied medicine with his grandfather, Dr. James Byron Bradley, in [[Buxton]].  Byron married Martha Foulkes (1831–1876) in London in 1856.  He entered the [[Middle Temple]] as a student briefly in 1858, but he had already begun writing for the stage and soon returned to that vocation.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Thomson, Peter. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4280 "Byron, Henry James (1835–1884)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 19 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Byron-jack-the-giant-killer.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for Byron's 1859–60 pantomime, ''Jack the Giant Killer'']]
Byron joined several provincial companies as an actor from 1853–57, sometimes in his own plays and sometimes in those of [[T. W. Robertson]] (with whom he acted and starved) or others, but had little success.  He described his early attempts at acting, and the hardships of the journeyman touring actor, in an 1873 essay for ''The Era Almanack and Annual'' called "Eighteen Parts a Week".  He began writing [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] of melodramas and [[extravaganza]]s in the mid-1850s.  In 1857, his burlesque of ''Richard of the Lion Heart'' premièred at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]].  His successful works in 1858 included ''The Lady of Lyons, or, Twopenny Pride and Pennytence'' and ''Fra Diavolo Travestie; or, The Prince, the Pirate and the Pearl'', also at the Strand, which later played in New York.  This was so well received that Byron abandoned the law to concentrate full-time on theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another successful Strand burlesque in 1858 was ''The Maid and the Magpie; or, The Fatal Spoon'' an early play to include a dance at the end of a song.  This starred [[Marie Wilton]] as Pippo and was also revived in New York.  In 1859, he wrote another successful burlesque, ''The Babes in the Wood and the Good Little Fairy Birds''.  He soon wrote other burlesques for the Strand, the [[Olympic Theatre]], and the [[Adelphi Theatre]], as well as a sequence of Christmas [[pantomime]]s for the [[Princess's Theatre]], beginning in 1859 with ''Jack the Giant Killer, or, Harlequin, King Arthur, and ye Knights of ye Round Table''&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Amy Wai Sum. [http://whaleyween.com/Holly/DLB344_19thC_BritishDramatists/Byron.pdf "Henry J. Byron"]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Hong Kong Baptist University&lt;/ref&gt; and followed the next year by ''Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday and the King of the Caribee Islands!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worc.ac.uk/victorian/victorianplays/Vol49viiRobinson.pdf Script for ''Robinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday'']{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1860)&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron also wrote for periodicals, and in 1861, he became the first editor of ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine, where he showcased the comic talents of the then-unknown [[W. S. Gilbert]].  He became editor of ''Comic News'' in 1863.  He also founded the short-lived ''Comic Trials'' and wrote a [[three-volume novel]], ''Paid in Full'', in 1865.  In 1867, he became the editor of ''Wag'', another humour magazine.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; He wrote numerous dramatic critiques and humorous essays for magazines, including the rival of ''Fun'', ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 14 April 1884, p. 7, col. C&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he was a well-known man-about-town, joining, and popular as a guest at, various London dining clubs and, in 1863, becoming a founding member of the Arundel Club.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; [[Henry Morley]] acknowledged with dismay Byron's position in the literary world as chief punster but found in him "a true power of fun that makes itself felt by high and low".&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of a London Playgoer'', 1866, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; He became a Member of the Dramatic Authors' Society by 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worc.ac.uk/victorian/victorianplays/Vol49viiRobinson.pdf Script of Byron's ''Robinson Crusoe; or, Harlequin Friday'' (1860)]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, he continued writing for the Strand, the Adelphi, the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and the Princess's, among other London theatres.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Among Byron's dozens of plays in the early 1860s, his early successes were mostly burlesques, such as ''Bluebeard from a New Point of Hue'' (1860); ''Cinderella'' (1860); ''Aladdin, or, The Wonderful Scamp'' (1861);&lt;ref&gt;Byron's 1861 ''Aladdin'' featured the début of the [[pantomime]] character, [[Widow Twankey]], first played by James Rogers.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Esmeralda, or, The Sensation Goat'' (1861), all in rhymed couplets.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, Jane. [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=23619681# ''W.S. Gilbert: A Classic Victorian and His Theatre''], Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Another success was ''George de Barnwell; or Harlequin Folly in the Realms of Fancy'' (1862).  Several of these early plays were revived in Britain and received New York productions.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

[[File:Dearer Than Life.jpg|thumb|left|350px|1868 production of ''Dearer Than Life'' showing seated l. to r. [[J.L. Toole|Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]] and [[Henry Irving|Irving]]]]
Between 1865 and 1867, he joined [[Marie Wilton]], whom he had met through his early work at the Strand, in the management of the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  She provided the capital, and he was to write the plays.  His first was a burlesque of ''[[La sonnambula]]''.  However, Wilton wanted to present more sophisticated pieces. She agreed to produce three more burlesques by Byron, but he agreed to write his first prose comedies, ''War to the Knife'' (a success in 1865) and ''A Hundred Thousand Pounds'' (1866).  They also staged one of T. W. Robertson's biggest successes, ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', in 1865.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Upon his severing the partnership and starting theatre management on his own account in the provinces, he lost money, ending up in bankruptcy court in 1868.  However, he produced many of his plays at these theatres while continuing to write for London theatres.  One successful provincial work was ''Dearer than Life'' (1867), which received many revivals, beginning with a London revival in 1868 starring [[J. L. Toole]] and the young [[Henry Irving]].  Another, the same year, was ''The Lancashire Lass; or, Tempted, Tried and True'' (1867), a melodrama, also revived in London in 1868.  He even collaborated with W. S. Gilbert on ''Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife'', which played in 1867 at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

===Return to acting and later years===
He returned to acting, making his London acting début, in 1869, achieving much greater success than in his early attempts, as Sir Simon Simple in his comedy ''Not Such a Fool as He Looks''.&lt;ref name=utility&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289–301, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with successful outings as Fitzaltamont in ''The Prompter's Box: A Story of the Footlights and the Fireside'' (1870), ''The Prompter's Box'' (1870, revived in 1875 and often thereafter, and later renamed ''The Crushed Tragedian''), Captain Craven in ''Daisy Farm'' (1871) and Lionel Leveret in ''Old Soldiers'' (1873).  Byron's acting was again admired in ''An American Lady'' in 1874, with which he began as the manager of the [[Criterion Theatre]], and then ''Married in Haste'' (1875) which was much revived.  In 1886, he played in his ''The Bull by the Horns'' and ''Old Chums''.  Other roles included Dick Simpson in ''Conscience Money'' (1878), Charles Chuckles in his ''An English Gentleman'' (1879) and John Blunt in his ''Michael Strogoff'' (1881).&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; In 1881, he played the role of Cheviot Hill in a revival of his friend Gilbert's eccentric comedy, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]''.&lt;ref name=utility/&gt; He continued acting until 1882, when ill health forced him to retire.  Not surprisingly, Byron achieved his greatest acting successes in timing of the delivery of his own witty lines.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  ''The Times'' explained that "in such parts as Gibson Greene in ''Married in Haste'', a self-possessed, observant, satirical, well-bred man of the world, [Byron] was beyond the reach of rivalry.  To ease and grace of manner he united a peculiar aptitude for the delivery of the good things he put into his own mouth."&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

[[File:Ourboys2a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Our Boys'', 1875]]
Byron continued to write prose comedies with the ambitious semi-autobiographical ''Cyril's Success'' (1868), ''The Upper Crust'' (starring Toole), ''Uncle Dick's Darling'' (1870, starring Henry Irving), ''An English Gentleman'' (1871, starring [[Edward Sothern]]),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1871, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''Weak Woman'' (1875, starring [[Marion Terry]]), and his greatest success, ''[[Our Boys]]'' (1875–79, [[Vaudeville Theatre]]).&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; With 1,362 performances in its original production, ''Our Boys'' set the record for the longest-running play in history and held it for almost two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. Review of plays by H. J. Byron including ''Our Boys'' in ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 82, No. 3, pp. 716-17, July 1987, Modern Humanities Research Association&lt;/ref&gt; It was also much revived, especially in America.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; From 1876 to 1879, he wrote several successful burlesques for the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], such as a burlesque of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''Don Caesar de Bazan'' called ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Information about ''Little Don Caesar de Bazan'' and the Gaiety Theatre] at VictorianWeb.org&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Gaiety Gulliver'' (1879).  Also during that period, he edited the humour magazine ''Mirth''.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; In 1878, he co-wrote a highly successful charity pantomime, ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'', together with [[Robert Reece]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[F. C. Burnand]]. In 1880, four volumes of his plays were published, with fourteen plays in each book.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Henry James. "Plays Volumes One to Four", Samuel French &amp; Thomas Lacy (1880)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1880, as his health greatly declined, so did Byron's playwriting output.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

Byron is described by Jim Davis in the introduction to his 1984 collection, ''Plays by H. J. Byron'', as the most prolific playwright of the mid-Victorian period, as he produced over 150 dramatic pieces.  ''The Times'' called Byron a master of "genial wit and humour".&lt;ref&gt;"Funeral of the Late Mr. H. J. Byron", ''The Times'', '18 April 1884, p. 10, col. C&lt;/ref&gt; It also commented that "The secret of his success... lay chiefly in his dialogue, which is seldom otherwise than neat, pointed and amusing.  He fires verbal shots in such rapid succession that one laugh has scarcely died away when another is raised.  In the delineation of character, too, he is often extremely happy".&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

By 1874, he was showing symptoms of [[tuberculosis]], which caused his retirement in 1882. His first wife died in 1876 at the age of 45, and the same year he remarried Eleanor Mary ''née'' Joy, the daughter of Edward Joy, a lawyer.  His son Henry and daughter Crede (a pun on ''Crede Byron'', the Byron family motto) also became actors, and he had another son.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

During the last few years of his life Byron was in frail health, and he died at his home in [[Clapham]], London, England, in 1884 at the age of 49. He is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

An '''intellectual property broker''' mediates between the buyer and seller of intellectual property (IP) and may manage the many steps in the process of creating a deal with regard to the purchase, sale, license, or marketing of intellectual property assets. This may include: patents, trademarks, or inventions (prototypes).

Inventors are faced with several alternatives to making their invention a commercial success.  They can build their own start up company from scratch using their own resources.  In the United States, they can seek government grants; SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) and (TTR) Technology Transfer Research to fund the early stage development of their technology.  They can contract with third parties such as: [[venture capital]] or [[angel investors]] to finance a startup or they can sell or license their products to an existing and established company.  Often inventors are interested in expanding their own intellectual property assets through licensing and acquisitions.

Because there is not a well defined market around the buying and selling of patents or other IP assets, if an inventor or patent owner wants to monetize their asset, an intellectual property broker can help by serving to connect the inventor or patent owner with one or more interested buyers.  The broker should have a network of connections in various market segments which can be used to help market the patent being sold.  Potential buyers may include industry peers, competitors, entrepreneurs looking to commercialize the technology, but also defensive patent aggregators, and patent licensing companies.

A competent broker should be able to explain to the inventor or patent owner the spectrum of values that may be assessed to a patent depending on the situation or motivation of the buyer in the market.  In addition, in bringing buyers and sellers together, an intellectual property broker may provide any or all of the following services:

* initial due diligence
* technology assessment
* market analysis
* value analysis
* competitive analysis

==Patent Brokers Market==
The estimated number of patent brokers varies greatly. For example, a 1999 World Intellectual Property Organization [[WIPO]] paper estimated 500 "patent brokers" in the United States in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/freepublications/en/intproperty/834/wipo_pub_834_ch9.pdf "Patent Brokers, Chapter 9"] by Hisamitsu Arai, [[WIPO]], December, 1999, in "Intellectual Property Policies for the Twenty-First Century: The Japanese Experience with Wealth Creation"&lt;/ref&gt; However, an October 2015 listing of patent brokerage companies includes only about 57 businesses worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardsonoliver.com/brokers/ "Patent Brokers/Patent Sellers"] website listing compiled by the ROL Group, October 15, 2015. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As none of these firms have a large number of employees, the 1999 estimates are either wrong as the number of businesses operating as patent brokers does not match the 1999 patent brokers estimates, or there has been a significant decline in the market for patent brokerage. Further research is required to estimate the number of patent brokers.

The estimated size of the brokered patent market was $165 million in 2016, down from $233 million in 2015. It was estimated that of all the brokered patent packages brought to market only 21% of them sell. Average asking price per patent asset was $197K in 2016. 137 people were estimated to be employed in the brokered patent market. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardsonoliver.com/news/2017/6/1/2016-secondary-market-report-available-for-download Richardson, Oliver, Costa, "Inside the 2016 brokered patent market", IAM Magazine, Issue #81, January/February 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Krakauer describes the events leading up to his eventual decision to participate in an Everest expedition in May 1996, despite having mostly given up mountain-climbing years before. The 1996 expedition season recorded 8 deaths, including that of Krakauer's guide Andy Harris. This was the third-highest recorded number of deaths on the mountain in a single day; the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]] caused the most at 21.

Krakauer, a journalist for the adventure magazine ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'', initially said his intentions to climb Everest were purely professional. The original magazine story was to have Krakauer climb only to [[Everest Base Camp|base camp]], and report on the commercialization of the mountain. However, the idea of Everest reawakened his childhood desire to climb the mountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off the story for a year so that he could train for a climb to the summit. From there, the book moves between events that take place on the mountain, and the unfolding tragedy, which takes place during the push to the summit. In the book, Krakauer alleges that essential safety methods adopted over the years by experienced guides on Everest are sometimes compromised by the competition between rival guiding agencies, in order to get their clients to the summit.

==Controversy==
Krakauer's recounting of certain aspects of the ill-fated climb has generated criticism, both from some of the climb's participants and from renowned mountaineers such as [[Galen Rowell]].  Much of the disputed material centers on Krakauer's accounting of the actions of Russian climber and guide [[Anatoli Boukreev]].  An experienced high-altitude climber and guide for Scott Fischer, Boukreev descended the summit prior to his clients, ostensibly out of concern for their safety and in preparation for potential rescue efforts. Boukreev later mounted repeated solo rescue efforts, saving several lives. In his book, Krakauer acknowledged Boukreev's heroism in saving two climbers' lives, but questions his judgment,  his decision to descend before clients, not using supplementary oxygen, his choices of gear on the mountain, and his interaction with clients. Boukreev provides a rebuttal to these allegations in his book, ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]''.

[[Galen Rowell]] criticized Krakauer's account, citing numerous inconsistencies in his narrative while observing that Krakauer was sleeping in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers.  Rowell argued that Boukreev's actions were nothing short of heroic, and his judgment prescient: "[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Climbing to Disaster|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB864852385619851000|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-09-06|issn = 0099-9660|first = Galen|last = Rowell|date = 29 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account has also been criticized for not informing the reader that the team members were receiving accurate daily weather forecasts and knew about the storm in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratcliffe MBE|first=Graham|title=A Day to Die For|year=2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=UK|isbn=9781845966386|url=http://adaytodiefor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Krakauer's 1999 paperback edition of ''Into Thin Air'', he addresses some of the criticism in a lengthy postscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krakauer|first=Jon|title=Into Thin Air|year=1999|publisher=Turtleback|location=USA|isbn=9780613663618|url=https://www.amazon.com/Turtleback-School-Library-Binding-Edition/dp/0613663616/ref=tmm_hrd_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373839576&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
[[Film rights]] for ''Into Thin Air'' were purchased by [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] almost immediately after the book's publication.&lt;ref name="EW1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGovern|first1=Joe|title=Into Thin Air author Jon Krakauer is not a fan of Everest|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/25/thin-air-author-jon-krakauer-not-fan-everest|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted into the TV movie ''[[Into Thin Air: Death on Everest]]'' ([[1997 in film|1997]]), starring [[Peter Horton]] as [[Scott Fischer]] and [[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]] as [[Jon Krakauer]]. The book and the film both contain the same strong editorial viewpoint regarding the fundamental causes of the tragedy, although the film differs sharply from the book in details regarding responsibility.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

: This book puts forward evidence that detailed weather forecasts were being received by several groups well in advance of their teams' summit attempts. These forecasts highlighted clearly the oncoming strong storm that struck the mountain on 10th/11th May causing the tragedy. While most of Ratcliffe's comments are directed towards the two expedition leaders for ignoring the forecasts and continuing on the summit attempts, thereby exposing clients to such high risk, he also makes clear that in his view, Krakauer and many others' description of the storm as "sudden and unexpected" is wholly inaccurate. Furthermore, Ratcliffe suggests that Krakauer, by not mentioning the forecasts, did not produce an accurate or adequately researched account.

'''''Jammers Minde''''' (literally A Memory of Lament), translated into English as '''''Memoirs of Leonora Christina''''', is an autobiography completed in 1674 by [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]], daughter of [[Christian IV of Denmark]] and [[Kirsten Munk]]. The work, first published in 1869, is included in the [[Danish Culture Canon]]. It is considered to be the finest piece of prose work written in 17th-century Denmark.&lt;ref name="Monod2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monod|first=Paul Kléber|authorlink=Paul Monod |title=The Power of Kings: Monarchy and Religion in Europe, 1589-1715|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNAmbT21ctUC&amp;pg=PA209|accessdate=18 January 2013|date=11 August 2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09066-6|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stecher-Hansen2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stecher-Hansen|first=Marianne|title=Danish writers from the Reformation to decadence, 1550-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NM0UAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 January 2013|date=6 August 2004|publisher=Gale|isbn=978-0-7876-6837-2|page=460}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relates a partly fictionalized account of Christina's time during captivity, with a detailed personal account of prison life, often drawing upon biblical references and black humour, and contrasting the comical with the macabre.  Radical for its period in its personal account, it is considered an existential religious writing.

==Background==
[[File:Leonora Christina French manuscript.jpg|thumb|160px|left|First page of Leonora's autobiography in French (1673)]]
Married to [[Corfitz Ulfeldt]], [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]] was imprisoned from 1663 to 1685 in the [[Blåtårn|Blue Tower]] of [[Christiansborg Palace|Copenhagen Castle]] for presumed knowledge of her husband's treachery. When [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] came to the throne in 1670, the conditions of her imprisonment were improved and she was given books and writing materials.&lt;ref name=dsd&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/Jammers_Minde "Jammers Minde"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 17 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After writing a short autobiography in French in 1673, she embarked on ''Jammers Minde'' which she completed after her release from prison in 1685. As the manuscript was secretly held abroad for many years, the work remained unknown until it was finally published in 1869, attracting considerable attention.&lt;ref name=dsd/&gt;

==The work==
Considered to be Denmark's most important 17th-century prose work, ''Jammers Minde'' is a defensive, intimate and dramatic account, which brings back to life the painful years of Leonora's imprisonment. It was written with a political and tactical purpose and is considered an existential religious writing, radical for its time in its reporting of personal confession and crisis.&lt;ref name="NWL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordicwomensliterature.net/article/fidelity-suffering-and-passion|title=Fidelity, suffering and passion|publisher=Nordicwomensliterature.net|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonora knew that the work would be more successful if it came across as an authentic account of her time within the prison walls so it displays many of her real experiences, but which are dramatized and fictionalized, and vividly and fully so.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt;

''Jammers Minde'' conveys the woman's conscious will to describe her experience without succumbing to her fate. It contains a host of vivid details: sights, smells and sounds, often conveyed with loathing — but also frequently juxtaposed with a grotesque twist of humour which only serves to make it all the more moving. Leonora's ability to describe the appearance and behaviour of those she was forced to come into contact with has left a picture of a series of insignificant figures, mainly women, who would otherwise have been forgotten. One of the reasons the work has become a literary masterpiece is that the author manages to couch her account in a fine, dignified style, giving elegance and shine to even the most lurid details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kum.dk/Documents/Temaer/Kulturkanon/KUM_kulturkanonen_OK2.pdf "Jammers minde"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211223858/http://kum.dk/Documents/Temaer/Kulturkanon/KUM_kulturkanonen_OK2.pdf |date=2012-12-11 }}, ''Kulturkanonen''. Danish Ministry of Culture. {{da icon}} Retrieved 17 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her account, her female attendants appeared to suffer more than she did, suffering from anxiety, fever and alcoholism, while she remained in good health during her time in captivity, although she once suffered from [[gallstone]]s.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt;

Leonora frequently draws upon biblical stories and characters and God in her depiction of prison life, recreating the prison in part as a scene in the Bible and her jailors and enemies into characters in her Christian Passion. Sophie Amalie for instance is portrayed as [[Salome]], stepdaughter of [[Herod Antipas]], who called for [[John the Baptist]] to be beheaded.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt; Languages also play an important and complex role in ''Jammers Minde''. It is mainly written in Danish, and Leonora translates much of the Low German, High German and French dialogue into Danish, but later on in the story adds more depth to her characters by writing in the original language, and demonstrates her superior knowledge of languages by often replying in a language they cannot understand.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt; Leonora's allies are usually French-speaking, sending her letters or conversing intimately with her.&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt; Anne-Marie Mai highlights the psychological meaning of the autobiography and how the  account can be viewed as a "monument for her spiritual and moral triumph over her adversaries, the evil agents of power, the flesh ungodly."&lt;ref name="NWL"/&gt;

[[File:The japan art academy01 1024.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Japan Art Academy]]

{{Nihongo|'''Japan Art Academy'''|日本芸術院|Nihon Geijutsu-in}} is the highest ranking artistic organization in Japan.{{cn|date=November 2014}} The Academy discusses art-related issues, advises the [[Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] on art-related issues, and promotes art (fine arts, music, literature, dance and drama though the annual Japan Art Academy Award ''(Nitten''), the premier art exhibition in Japan.  As a legal entity, its status is that of a special independent organization under the aegis of the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]. Its headquarters is in [[Ueno Park]], Tokyo.

The Japan Art Academy should not be confused with the [[Japan Art Institute]], which is a completely different organization.

==History==
The Japan Art Academy was founded in 1907 as the '''Fine Arts Reviewing Committee''' (''Bijutsu Shinsa Inkai'') of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]].{{cn|date=November 2014}} It was intended to provide quality standards and a venue for art exhibitions in [[Meiji period]] Japan. The first exhibition, or ''Bunten'', was held in 1907. It was renamed the '''Imperial Fine Arts Academy''' (''Teikoku Bijutsu-in'') in 1911 and headed by [[Mori Ōgai]]. The ''Bunten'' exhibition was correspondingly renamed the ''Teiten''.

After a period where it fell into inactivity, it was reorganized into the '''Imperial Art Academy''' (帝国芸術院, ''Teikoku Geijutsuin'') in 1937. In 1947, after [[World War II]], the Imperial Art Academy became the Japan Art Academy, and its annual exhibition was correspondingly renamed the {{nihongo|Japan Arts Exhibition|日本美術展覧会|nihon bijutsu tenrankai}}, which was abbreviated to ''Nitten'' (日展).

In 1958, there was further re-organization whereby the Japan Fine Arts Academy became a solely academic and consultative non-profit organization, and the organization of the Nitten annual exhibition was handled by a separate private company, the Nitten Corporation.

==Membership==
The Japan Art Academy is under the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]]. It consists of a maximum of 120 members, who are appointed for life.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

Membership is divided into the following categories

'''A. Fine Arts'''
# [[Nihonga]]
# Yōga
# Sculpture
# Crafts
# Calligraphy
# Architecture
'''B. Culture'''
# Novels, prose literature

==Nitten==
The {{nihongo|'''Japan Fine Arts Exhibition'''|日展|Nitten (Nihon bijutsu tenrankai)}} claims to be the largest combined art exhibition of its kind in the world, attracting a great number of fans and [[art critic]]s. The exhibition consists five art categories: ''Nihonga'' and Western Style Painting, Sculpture, Crafts and Calligraphy. During each exhibition, works of the great masters are shown alongside works of the new but talented artists.

The Japan Fine Arts Exhibition decided not to award any of the top prizes in any of the 5 sections for 2013, following the revelation of fraudulent judging in the calligraphy section of the fiscal 2009 show. It was the first time since 1958, when the organization became a nonprofit corporation, that none of the prizes were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000765469|title=Nitten cancels top prizes over fraudulent judging|publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is intended to promote local businesses and is inspired by comments made by Red Wassenich in 2000 while giving a pledge to an Austin radio station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/travel/destinations_us/118728504_Can_Austin_stay_weird_.html |title=Can Austin stay weird?

'''''Lady at the Tea Table''''' is a late 19th century painting by American artist [[Mary Cassatt]]. The work, done in oil on canvas, is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10391?searchField=All&amp;amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;amp;what=Paintings&amp;amp;high=on&amp;amp;ao=on&amp;amp;od=on&amp;amp;ft=*&amp;amp;offset=80&amp;amp;rpp=20&amp;amp;pos=86|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Description ==
=== History ===
The painting depicts Mary Dickinson Riddle, Cassatt’s mother’s first cousin, seated at a table set with a [[tea service]]. The tea set was a gift to Cassatt's family from Riddle's daughter. The tea service itself is gilded blue-and-white porcelain from [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (modern day Guangzhou) in [[Qing dynasty]] [[China]]; In the 19th century, Canton was renowned for its exports to the [[Western world]], as the port city was one of the centers of the [[Old China Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penobscotmarinemuseum.org/pbho-1/maine-and-orient/old-china-trade-1842|title=The Old China Trade: Before 1842  {{!}} Penobscot Bay History Online|website=penobscotmarinemuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crossman, Carl L. (1991). ''The decorative arts of the China trade''. Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK: Antique Collectors' Club. {{ISBN|1851490965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lady'' itself was painted by Cassatt as a gift for the Riddle family. However, Riddle's daughter disliked the painting, thinking it portrayed her mother's nose as being too big, and thus the painting was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Cassatt in 1923.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldsbestpaintings.net/artistsandpaintings/painting/198/|title=Great Works of Western Art - 
Lady at the Tea Table|website=www.worldsbestpaintings.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Painting ===
The painting exemplifies much of Cassatt's unique impressionist style; much emphasis is placed on the subject's stark outline, and Mrs. Riddle's jewelry pairs with the gold gilt on the tea service. Similarly, the faint blue hues used in the background draw the eye to the deeper blues of Riddle's eyes and the porcelain. The relative simplicity of the painting's design is also comparable to oriental art, which Cassat was influenced by.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Sarnath capital.jpg|thumb|The original Lion Capital. Minus the [[inverted bell]]-shaped [[Indian lotus|lotus]] flower, this has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]], seen from another angle, showing the horse on the left and the bull on the right of the [[Ashoka Chakra]] in the circular base on which the four [[Indian lion]]s are standing back to back. On the side shown here there are the bull and elephant; a lion occupies the other place. The wheel "Ashoka Chakra" from its base has been placed onto the centre of the [[National Flag of India]].]]

The '''Lion  Capital of Ashoka''' is a sculpture of four [[Asiatic lion]]s standing back to back, on an elaborate base that includes other animals. A graphic representation of it was adopted as the official [[Emblem of India]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 State Emblem], Know India india.gov.in&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally placed on the top of the [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka pillar]] at the important [[Buddhist]] site of [[Sarnath]] by the [[Emperor Ashoka]], in about 250 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarnathindia.com/lion-capital-of-ashoka.html|title=Sarnath site|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pillar, sometimes called the Aśoka Column, is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the [[Sarnath Museum]], in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. Standing 2.15 metres (7 feet) high including the base, it is more elaborate  than the other very similar surviving capitals of the pillars of [[Ashoka]] bearing the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] that were placed throughout India several of which feature single animals at the top; one  other damaged group of four lions survives, at [[Sanchi]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] is carved out of  a single block of polished [[sandstone]], and was always a separate piece from the column itself. It features four [[Asiatic lions|Asiatic Lions]] standing back to back. They are mounted on an [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] with a  [[frieze]] carrying sculptures in high [[relief]] of an [[elephant]], a galloping [[horse]], a [[bull]], and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels. The whole sits upon a bell-shaped [[Indian lotus|lotus]]. The capital was originally probably crowned by a 'Wheel of [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]' (''[[Dharmachakra]]'' popularly known in India as the "[[Ashoka Chakra]]"), with 24 spokes, of which a few fragments were found on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, caption at start of Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; A 13th-century replica of the Sarnath pillar and capital in [[Wat Umong]] near [[Chiang Mai]], [[Thailand]] built by King [[Mangrai]], preserves its crowning Ashoka Chakra or Dharmachakra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=286 |title=Wat Umong Chiang Mai |website=Thailand's World |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wheel on the capital, below the lions, is the model for the one in the [[flag of India]].

==Art history==
[[File:Sarnath Ashoka Capital Horse motif.jpg|thumb|The horse motif on the capital.]]
Currently seven animal sculptures from Ashoka pillars survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3s9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|title=The Return of the Buddha: Ancient Symbols for a New Nation|page=123|publisher=Routledge|author=Himanshu Prabha Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture|page=423-429|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|author=Rebecca M. Brown, Deborah S. Hutton}}&lt;/ref&gt; These form "the first important group of Indian stone sculpture", though it is thought they derive from an existing tradition of wooden columns topped by animal sculptures in [[copper]], none of which have survived. There has been much discussion of the extent of influence from [[Achaemenid Persia]], where the column capitals supporting the roofs at [[Persepolis]] have similarities, and the "rather cold, hieratic style" of the Sarnath sculptures especially shows "obvious Achaemenid and [[Sargon II|Sargonid]] influence".&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22, 24, quoted in turn; Companion, 429-430&lt;/ref&gt;

Very similar four-lion sculptures are on the capitals of the two columns supporting the south [[torana]] of the Ashokan or [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] enclosure wall round the Great [[Stupa]] at Sanchi.  Like other Ashoka pillars, the one at Sarnath was probably erected to commemorate a visit by the emperor.

==Rediscovery==
[[File:AshokaLions.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Lion Capital on the ground at Sarnath, probably 1904-05]]
There were no surviving traces above ground of the Sarnath pillar, mentioned in the accounts of medieval Chinese pilgrims, when the Indian Civil Service engineer [[F.O. Oertel]], with no real experience in archaeology, was allowed to excavate there in the winter of 1904-05.  He first uncovered the remains of a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] shrine west of the main [[stupa]], overlying an Ashokan structure.  To the west of that he found the lowest section of the pillar, upright but broken off near ground level. Most of the rest of the pillar was found in three sections nearby, and then, since the Sanchi capital had been excavated in 1851, the search for an equivalent was continued, and it was found close by.  It was both finer in execution and in much better condition than that at Sanchi.  The pillar appeared to have been deliberately destroyed at some point.  The finds were recognised as so important that the first onsite museum in India (and one of the few then in the world) was set up to house them.&lt;ref name="Allen, Chapter 15"&gt;Allen, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
[[File:India 1947 Ashoka Lions 1 and half annas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The second stamp of independent India and the first for domestic use.&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;''India Postage Stamps 1947-1988''.(1989) Philately branch, Department of Posts, India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;Souvenir sheet of the ''Independence'' series of stamps, Indian Posts, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;]]

What is being preached may be symbolised by the group of four lions of the capital. A group of four lions joined back to back symbolizes a group of four things of equal importance. The lion is frequently used as a symbol of the [[Buddha]], as at Sanchi, and the animals on the abacus below also have symbolic meaning in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Allen, Chapter 15"/&gt; The capital is clearly [[Buddhist]] and [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] in origin and thus probably symbolizes the spread of [[Dharma]], and perhaps the extent of the Maurya Empire in all directions, or four parts of the empire. Alternatively, the group of four lions and bell jointly symbolize preaching of 'the Four Noble Truths' of Buddhism to all; those that emphasize the Middle Path. The symbol U with a vertical line placed symmetrically inside it symbolizes 'The Middle Path'. The Middle Path is the fundamental philosophy of Buddhism, the Buddhist Dharma. 
[[Image:Emblem of India.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[National Emblem of India]]]]
A further clue could be the cylindrical portion of the Lion Capital. On the wall of the cylinder the bull, the horse, the Lion and the Elephant all in the moving position are being placed in between the Chakras. These could symbolize Bull, Lion, Horse and Elephant rolling the Chakras.

A study of the ancient coins and other archaeological finds of India and [[Sri Lanka]] reveals the fact that Buddha had been symbolized with a Horse, Lion, Bull, Elephant and a pair of feet. The Tamil epic [[Manimekalai]] mentions worship of a pair of feet. Pairs of feet made of stone had been discovered in [[Jaffna Peninsula]], [[Anuradhapura]] and in a number of places of [[Tamil Nadu]].In a number of Buddhist inscriptions of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, a pair of feet had been symbolized with a pair of fish or a pair of conch shells. In this way the symbols sculpted in the cylindrical portion of the Lion Capital represents Buddha rolling the Dhamma Chakra; that is, Preaching the Dhamma.

As [[Theravada]] Buddhism rejects symbolization of Buddha and Buddhism, the Lion Capital may be claimed as one of the finest sculptures of the main tradition that developed into [[Mahayana]] Buddhism several centuries later.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Government act==
Whenever the emblem is used by state governments or any other government body, the words [[Satyameva Jayate]] ("Truth alone triumphs") in [[Devanagari]] script (सत्यमेव जयते) has to be used right under the emblem as per the statute, State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/36040918.cms|title=Has Telangana government got the emblem wrong?|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities with the Sanchi capital==
[[File:Sanchi capital frontal view before-after reconstitution.jpg|thumb|The [[capital (architecture)|capital]] of the Sanchi pillar of [[Ashoka]], as discovered (left), and simulation of original appearance (right).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Sanchi pillar of Ashoka.jpg|Drawing reconstruction by F.C.

{{see also|Pillars of Ashoka}}

A pillar of finely polished sandstone, one of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], was also erected on the side of the main [[Torana]] gateway at [[Sanchi]]. The bell-shaped capital consists of four lions, which probably supported a [[Wheel of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture by Huu Phuoc Le [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA155 p.155]&lt;/ref&gt; The capital is located at the nearby [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]]. The capital is rather similar to the Sarnath capital, except that it is surmounted by an [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] and a crowning ornament of four lions, set back to back, the whole finely finished and polished to a remarkable luster from top to bottom. The abacus is adorned with four [[flame palmette]] designs separated one from the other by pairs of [[geese]], symbolical perhaps of the flock of the Buddha's disciples. The lions from the summit, though now quite disfigured, still testify to the skills of the sculptors.&lt;ref name="Marshall 90"&gt;Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.90ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Elizabeth Connell''' (26 March 1917, [[York]] - July 1997) was an English-born South African botanical illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;https://abcjournal.org/index.php/ABC/article/download/646/591&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at an early age Connell showed exceptional artistic talent and her first schooling was at the York College for Girls (closed down in 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Establishments/Establishment/Details/121723?searchQueryString=searchtype=ByLocalAuthority&amp;d=84&amp;startIndex=150&amp;Count=162|title=York College for Girls - GOV.UK|website=www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; She submitted her work to the [[Royal College of Art]] for their Masters examinations and was awarded honours in 1932 for Drawing from Nature Forms and 1933 for Pictorial Representation.

In 1933 her family moved to South Africa. She completed her schooling at [[Barnato Park High School]] in Berea, and enrolled at the Johannesburg School of Art. However, in 1936 a botanical artist post at the National Herbarium in Pretoria became available and her appointment was approved.

Her first project was to produce large plates illustrating poisonous and noxious plants for publication in the periodical 'Farming in South Africa', and later published as Henderson and Anderson's 'Common Weeds in South Africa' (Botanical Survey Memoir No. 37 of 1966). She was taken under the wing of [[Cythna Letty]], grand dame of South African botanical artists, and began to produce plates for the botanical journal '[[Flowering Plants of Africa]]'. In all, she created 121 plates for that work.

In addition she contributed artwork for White, Dyer &amp; Sloane’s 'The Succulent Euphorbieae' (1941), Meredith’s 'The Grasses and Pastures of South Africa' (1955) and 'Flora of Southern
Africa'. After producing and raising a family she returned to the National Herbarium between 1958 and 1960, and created 83 of the line drawings of weeds for 'Common Weeds in South Africa' (1966), a new version of [[Edwin Percy Phillips|Phillips’]] 'Weeds of South Africa' (1939), a publication to which she had also contributed.

'''Max Fenichel''' (2 July 1885 – 16 September 1942), also known as '''Maximilian Fenichel''' and '''Menasche (or Menasse) Fenichel''', was an Austrian photographer.

==Biography==
Menasche Fenichel, professionally known as Max Fenichel, worked as a photographer in Vienna, Austria, from 1915 to 1938. He shot photos for the daily newspaper ''Die Stunde'' (The Hour) and the magazine ''Die Bühne'' (The Stage). He also shot formal portraits in his studio, especially of professionals such as rabbis, writers, artists, and performers. Among those who sat for him were the writers [[Vicki Baum]] and [[Ernst Lissauer]], Rabbi Max Grunwald, and painter Ludwig Michalek.

Fenichel was Jewish, and after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria by the Nazis]] in 1938 he had to give up his photo studio. He and his wife were deported to the [[Łódź Ghetto|Lodz ghetto]] in October 1941, where both were murdered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22277">'''Modular art''' is art created by joining together standardized units ([[Modular design|module]]s) to form larger, more complex compositions. In some works the units can be subsequently moved, removed and added to – that is, ''modulated'' – to create a new work of art, different from the original or ensuing configurations.

== Origins ==
Historically, alterable objects of art have existed since the [[Renaissance]], for example, in the [[Triptych]] "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]" by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or in the so-called "alterable [[altarpiece]]s", such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]], or [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer's]] [[Paumgartner altarpiece]], where changing motifs could be revised in accord with the changing themes of the ecclesiastical calendar.

== 20th century ==
Beginning in the first half of the 20th century, a number of contemporary artists sought to incorporate [[kinetic art|kinetic techniques]] into their work in an attempt to overcome what they saw as the predominantly static nature of art. [[Alexander Calder|Alexander Calder's]] mobiles are among the most widely known demonstrations of physical dynamism in the visual arts, in which form has the potential to continually vary through perpetual motion, sometimes even without the agency of the human hand. [[Jean Tinguely|Jean Tinguely's]] efforts to create a self-destructive art machine constitute perhaps the ultimate expression of art's mutability, in this case by taking the form of its total eradication. [[Victor Vasarely]] postulated in his ''Manifest Jaune'' in 1955 in Paris that works of art should feature the properties of being multiplicable and repeatable in series. More recently, the notion that visual art need not be conceived solely in terms of perpetually fixed objects is embodied in performance and installation art by virtue of their unfolding and temporary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;See "Modularity in the arts" in [[Modularity]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industrial design and architecture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Image:Pfarrkirche Liesing - Erwin Hauer Design 3.JPG|thumb|alt=An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.|An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.]][[Modularity]] enters the modern artistic repertory largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] led a team of countrymen in creating one of the first modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer [[Gilbert Rohde]] crafted several lines of modular casework for the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller Corporation]] in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Charles Eames]] had jointly produced a suite of modular domestic furniture for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100526040623/http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Eames-Desk-and-Storage-Units EAS Storage Unit series] by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and wall unit system that remains in production today.

The module enjoys a long history in the realm of architecture. In antiquity architects utilized the module primarily as a unit of measurement guiding the proportions of plan and elevation. The Roman author and architect Vitruvius deployed the modular method in his descriptions of the classical orders and the composition of buildings in his treatise ''Ten Books on Architecture'', the only complete text on architecture to survive from antiquity. Architects of the Renaissance perpetuated the Vitruvian system in their resurrection of the classical orders, a tradition which continues to the present day. Among modern architects, the module is frequently employed as a design and planning tool.

=== Modular constructivism ===
{{main|Modular Constructivism}}
Architecture and modular sculpture intersected starting in the 1950s in the work of [[Norman Carlberg]], [[Erwin Hauer]] and Malcolm Leland. All three received commissions to design perforated architectural screens built out of repetitive modular motives cast in concrete. Non-structural, the screens were used on building exteriors to divide space, filter light and create visual interest. Their work has come to be described as [[Modular Constructivism]], reflecting both its compositional methodology and its architectural context. Each created stand-alone modular-themed sculptures into the 1960s and after as well.

=== Modularity in the fine arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ondahalfoster/2546134482/ "White Painting"] of 1951; consisting of just four equal white squares, with its geometry of interlocking forms, is among the earliest statements of modularity as an autonomous subject of art. Rauschenberg explored this theme that same year in a three- and seven-panel format; the linear array of rectangular panels in these versions suggests their potentially infinite replication.  The cool abstraction of these canvases presages the emergence of modularity as a full-fledged topic of [[Minimalist art]] in the 1960s. [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]] are among this school's most prolific exponents during the period. In particular, the work of Smith is key to understanding the transformation of modularity from a compositional and production tool into a broadly investigated artistic theme in its own right.

[[Image:Minneapolis14.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, MN.]]Smith began his career as an architectural designer. To further his education he apprenticed himself on some projects by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for a couple of years starting in 1938. From Wright he learned to utilize modular systems in generating architectural designs in two-dimensional plans as well as in three-dimensional applications, such as the development of building sections and interior built-ins. As an architect, Wright himself was part of a centuries-old continuum stretching back through [[Vitruvius]] to Greco-Roman antiquity in which the module was utilized to proportion built and sculpted form. In the case of Wright, the interest in modular design also may have derived from his familiarity with [[tatami|modular practice in traditional Japanese architecture]].

Wright's Hanna House of 1937 is a clear example of the master's facility with modern modular design in multiple dimensions. Its striking angled forms are built up from the individual hexagonal modules that define the floor plan and various vertical elements. Wright's use of the hexagon here is by no means an arbitrary aesthetic choice, but an example of how he rooted his architecture in nature by drawing from its forms and principles – the interlocking hexagonal cells of the bee's honeycomb being nature's most perfect representation of modular design. Not surprisingly, this project is sometimes  referred to as the "Honeycomb House".

Smith would employ the hexagon and other elemental geometries in his own architectural practice and again in the sculpture he began to fabricate in the early 1960s. Freed from the programmatic and extensive structural requirements of his architectural work, Smith's sculptures are three-dimensional extrusions of modular form with no ostensible pragmatic purpose beyond aesthetic contemplation.

Significantly, Smith himself did not manually fabricate the final version of his sculptures. Instead, he outsourced their production to skilled ironworkers in foundries and industrial facilities, who worked off his drawings and models to manufacture the designs. In part this reflects Smith's training as an architect, who customarily designs and documents but does not construct his art. It further reinforces the idea of modular art as a [[generative art|generative system]] in which the arrangement of pre-determined formal units – rather than wholesale imaginative invention – defines the creative act. Finally, it is consistent with the notion implicit in modularity that the supply of modules in a modular system must be infinite, that is, that they be industrially rather than artisanally produced, for the system to be realized. (Bees in a honeycomb are essentially operating as an industrial enterprise insofar as the production of cells is without end.)

The work of Smith and the minimalist school constitute the most far-ranging exploration of modularity in art before the millennium. However, neither it nor the explorations of movable and alterable art in the preceding centuries synthesized the two central features of modular art. Mobiles and other kinetic pieces were not modular, and the modular work of the mid-century Minimalist artists was, with a few exceptions, not changeable.

== Theory in the 21st century ==
[[Image:The Couple 1.JPG|thumb|alt=The Impossibility to Make it|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple.]][[Image:The Couple 2.JPG|thumb|alt=The Possibility to Make it|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 1.]][[Image:The Couple 3.JPG|thumb|alt=A Never-ending Story|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 2.]][[Image:The Couple 4.JPG|thumb|alt=Inside-out and Upside-down|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 3.]][[Image:The Couple 5.JPG|thumb|alt=No Way to Return|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 4.]]

=== Co-creativity ===
A school of thought coming out of the United States emphasizes modular art's alignment with the [[post-industrial]] character of 21st century culture and its contrast with traditional notions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core characteristics of post-industrialism, as largely defined by the theorist [[Daniel Bell]] in his 1973 book ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', include the emergence of a service economy in place of a manufacturing one; the social and economic pre-eminence of the creative, professional and technical classes; the central place of theoretical knowledge as a font of innovation; the strong influence of technology on daily life; and high levels of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular art appears to synchronize perfectly with several of these criteria. For example, its manual changeability opens up the possibility of co-creative art, in which the collector or user collaborates with the originating modular artist to jointly determine the appearance of the work of art. This presupposes the existence of creative people capable of and interested in serving such a role – a demographic evolution that was already underway in Bell's time and that has since been studied in works like Richard Florida's ''Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard. ''The Rise of the Creative Class and How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life''. Basic Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Co-creation]] is closely associated with [[mass customization]], a production model that combines the opportunity for individual personalization with mass production. Modular art and mass customization share a commonality in their synthesis of two opposing qualities. On the one hand, as previously stated the very concept of modularity implies a limitless supply of identical modules such as only industrial production can provide; on the other hand, the ability of the individual to re-arrange these modules in the work of art based on aesthetic criteria re-injects a subjective and purely human dimension into the creative act.

Mass customization is itself only made possible with the advent of computers and a type of software known as a [[configurator]]. A configurator is a software tool used by the buyer to configure a product from the options made available by the vendor. Applied to the purpose of composing a work of modular art onscreen, it can greatly facilitate the design of a modular assembly by allowing the user to study multiple design options more quickly and in far greater depth than by using analog methods. Once the design is established a computer file is then sent over the air to a manufacturing facility where robotically controlled equipment produces the object according to its specifications. Not only does this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) allow for the customization of mass-produced objects, it also enables a much higher level of precision and fit – qualities critical for modules to be physically joined together. Bell's identification of technology as a central axis of post-industrial life is underscored in the intertwining of the digital with the physical realization of modular art.

=== The de- and re-constructive approach in Europe ===
In Europe, where the 1960s Minimalist school of modular art was often seen as a principally American phenomenon, the discussion of modularity often focuses on its changeability. For example, the mutability of art is a core principle of [[Arte Povera]], a contemporaneous movement that emerged in Italy which holds that works of art "should not be seen as fixed entities", but as objects of change and movement to "include time and space in a new manner. At stake is the issue of transferring the phenomenology of human experience" into the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monopol-magazin.com/magazine/2009/09/interview-carolyn-christov-bakargiev Interview with Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev.] See also: Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. ''Arte Povera (Themes &amp; Movements)''. New York: Phaidon Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]] has produced modular paintings, composed of movable painted panels set in steel frames. Luss Luyken has dubbed her work "ModulArt".&lt;ref&gt;The term "ModulArt" was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts" in: Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, changing the configuration of a modular painting constitutes a form of motion, offering the spectator alternative views and alternative interpretations, and thus aligning the work more closely than a static object to the dynamism of physical human experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ModulArt&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and theorist [[Denys Zacharopoulos]] called this "a new way of motion in painting".&lt;ref&gt;von Kap-herr, Georg (Ed.). ''ModulArt''. Bobingen (Germany), 2008, pp. 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of modular art allows the user to de-compose and to re-compose a work of art that is already completed by re-arranging its parts, thus providing numerous possibilities for ever newer pictures not yet imagined. The original painting can be re-contextualized ad libitum and ad infinitum.

== Modular artists and their work ==

===Visual artists===
Working in the 1950-60s in Manchester (UK), American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale. She referred to them as ''modular sculptures''. The University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) acquired some of these works, although there are no references to them in published accounts of her work.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 19 December 08 by Prof. E.G. Wedell, Manchester (UK), friend and landlord of Mitzi Cunliffe in Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptor and ceramicist Malcolm Leland designed in 1954 a similar [http://www.mocad.org/store/Vessel_LS_Fountain.html modular sculpture system] based on a single 23-inch tall module that could be stacked vertically by means of a centering pin; the module has a generally biomorphic, curvilinear outline that yields an undulating silhouette when multiple modules are placed on top of each other. The technique of stacking repetitive elements in the round recalls [[Endless Column|Brancusi's "Endless Column"]] of 1938.

Starting in the 1970s, Leland's contemporary Norman Carlberg produced groups of [http://www.francisfrost.com/carlbergprint.html square framed prints] which he placed together on a wall in a tight grid, each print conceived as an independent module. The viewer is then invited to rotate or reposition them to generate new composite images. The abstract quality of the prints enhanced the creative possibilities of their re-orientation insofar as they are non-directional and geometrically inter-related.

Greek-born [[conceptual artist]] [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[modularity]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.

In the U.S. Moshé Elimelech creates what he has called [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107101439/http://www.mosheart.com/cubes/index.html "Cubic Constructions"]. These are multiple groupings of approximately three-inch cubes set inside pockets in a framed shadow box. On each cube he applies paint in fields of bright color and abstract pattern with precise, controlled brush strokes. Like Carlsberg, Elimelech then invites the viewer to reposition any or all of the cubes to display one of their six sides, each of which is painted in a different pattern. Exhibiting since the 1980s, Elimelech shows primarily in California galleries, and has work represented in several museum design stores as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807164738/http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |archive-date=2003-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of [http://www.s4aa.com Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture], a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner. Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books. To bring his work and those of other "modulartists" to the marketplace, Rattner founded [http://www.art-rethought.com A.R.T. (art-rethought)], an art storefront focused on co-creative and modular work. In his writings Rattner has emphasized the post-industrial aspect of the most recent trends in modular art, coining the term "New Industrialism" to denote mass customization, production on demand, open innovation, co-creative design, tele-fabrication, robotics and other computer-driven technologies that are re-defining how things are made in the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/the_studio_portfolio/docs/studio_portfolio_-_art?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true. Pp. A-3f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
Modularity in music can be seen as bringing two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting:{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Painting? What has this to do with music?--&gt; [[Variation (music)|variation]] of a theme and [[Moving image|movement]] of and within a picture. For this very reason the contemporary composer Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ROAI III for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Italian composer and arts theoretician [[Stefano Vagnini]] has developed a theory of [[Open source|open-source composition]] based on modular aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Vagnini, Stafano, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, 161 pp, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a musical work of art being something closed, limited and immobile disappears in favor of a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]] and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA. Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini's compositions  as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”. &lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano:'' SalmodieSubliminali'', Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mural''' is any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other permanent surface. A distinguishing characteristic of mural painting is that the architectural elements of the given space are harmoniously incorporated into the picture.

Some wall paintings are painted on large canvases, which are then attached to the wall (e.g., with [[marouflage]]). Whether these works can be accurately called "murals" is a subject of some controversy in the art world,{{Who|date=August 2014}} but the technique has been in common use since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Willsdon2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare A.

==History==
[[File:Meister des Mahâjanaka Jâtaka 001.jpg|thumb|[[Jataka]] tales from the [[Ajanta caves]], 7th century]]
Murals of sorts date to [[Upper Paleolithic]] times such as the paintings in the [[Chauvet Cave]] in [[Ardèche]] department of southern [[France]] (around 30,000 BC). Many ancient murals have been found within [[ancient Egypt]]ian tombs (around 3150&amp;nbsp;BC),&lt;ref&gt;Only after 664 BC are dates secure. See [[Egyptian chronology]] for details.{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/index.html|title=Chronology|accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan palaces]] (Middle period III of the Neopalatial period, 1700–1600 BC) and in [[Pompeii]] (around 100 BC – AD 79).

During the Middle Ages murals were usually executed on dry [[Plasterwork|plaster]] (secco). The huge collection of [[Kerala mural painting]] dating from the 14th century are examples of [[fresco secco]].&lt;ref&gt;Menachery, George (ed.): ''The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India'', Vol. II, 1973; Menachery, George (ed.): ''Indian Church History Classics, Vol. I, The Nazranies'', Saras, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Pallikalile Chitrabhasangal'|url=http://www.nazraney.com/Pazhama--MAY--13_file.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620235620/http://www.nazraney.com/Pazhama--MAY--13_file.pdf|archivedate=2015-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, circa 1300, the technique of painting of frescos on wet plaster was reintroduced and led to a significant increase in the quality of mural painting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8526688/Mural_Painting_as_a_Medium_Technique_Representation_and_Liturgy Péter Bokody, ''Mural Painting as a Medium: Technique, Representation and Liturgy'', in ''Image and Christianity: Visual Media in the Middle Ages'', Pannonhalma Abbey, 2014, 136-151]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the term became more well-known with the [[Mexican muralism]] art movement ([[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|David Siqueiros]] and [[José Clemente Orozco|José Orozco]]). There are many different [[Painting style|styles]] and techniques. The best-known is probably ''[[fresco]]'', which uses water-soluble paints with a damp [[Whitewash|lime wash]], a rapid use of the resulting mixture over a large surface, and often in parts (but with a sense of the whole). The colors lighten as they dry.  The ''[[marouflage]]'' method has also been used for millennia.

Murals today are painted in a variety of ways, using oil or water-based media. The styles can vary from abstract to ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' (a French term for "fool" or "trick the eye"). Initiated by the works of mural artists like [[Graham Rust]] or [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] in the 1980s, [[trompe-l'oeil]] painting has experienced a renaissance in private and public buildings in Europe.
Today, the beauty of a wall mural has become much more widely available with a technique whereby a painting or photographic image is transferred to poster paper or [[canvas]] which is then pasted to a wall surface ''(see [[wallpaper]], [[Frescography]])'' to give the effect of either a hand-painted mural or realistic scene.

==Technique==

[[File:Mari fresco Investiture Zimri Lim 0210.jpg|thumb|right|The 18th-century BC fresco of the ''[[Investiture of Zimrilim]]'' discovered at the [[Royal Palace of Mari|Royal Palace]] of ancient [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in [[Syria]] ]]

In the history of mural several methods have been used:

''[[Fresco|A fresco]]'' painting, from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''affresco'' which derives from the adjective ''fresco'' ("fresh"), describes a method in which the paint is applied on [[plaster]] on walls or ceilings. The ''[[buon fresco]]'' technique consists of painting in [[pigment]] mixed with [[water]] on a thin layer of wet, fresh, [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]]. The pigment is then absorbed by the wet plaster; after a number of hours, the plaster dries and reacts with the air: it is this chemical reaction which fixes the pigment particles in the plaster. After this the painting stays for a long time up to centuries in fresh and brilliant colors.

''[[Fresco-secco]]'' painting is done on dry plaster (''secco'' is "dry" in Italian).  The pigments thus require a binding medium, such as [[egg (food)|egg]] ([[tempera]]), glue or [[oil painting|oil]] to attach the pigment to the wall.

''Mezzo-fresco'' is painted on nearly-dry plaster, and was defined by the sixteenth-century author Ignazio Pozzo as "firm enough not to take a thumb-print" so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster. By the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced the ''buon fresco'' method, and was used by painters such as [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]] or [[Michelangelo]].  This technique had, in reduced form, the advantages of ''a secco'' work.

In [[Greco-Roman]] times, mostly [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] colors applied in a cold state were used.&lt;ref&gt;Selim Augusti. La tecnica dell'antica pittura parietale pompeiana.

[[Tempera]] painting is one of the oldest known methods in mural painting. In tempera, the pigments are bound in an albuminous medium such as [[egg yolk]] or [[egg white]] diluted in water.

In 16th-century Europe, [[oil painting]] on canvas arose as an easier method for mural painting. The advantage was that the artwork could be completed in the artist's studio and later transported to its destination and there attached to the wall or ceiling. Oil paint may be a less satisfactory medium for murals because of its lack of brilliance in colour. Also the pigments are yellowed by the binder or are more easily affected by atmospheric conditions. The canvas itself is more subject to rapid deterioration than a plaster ground.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
Different muralists tend to become experts in their preferred medium and application, whether that be oil paints, emulsion or acrylic paints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As used by Eric Cumini Murals|url=http://www.cuminitrompeloeil.com|publisher=Eric Cumini|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied by brush, roller or airbrush/aerosols. Clients will often ask for a particular style and the artist may adjust to the appropriate technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto Mural Painting|url=http://torontomuralists.ca/toronto-mural-painting|work=Technical aspects of mural painting|publisher=Toronto Muralists|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consultation usually leads to a detailed design and layout of the proposed mural with a price quote that the client approves before the muralist starts on the work. The area to be painted can be gridded to match the design allowing the image to be scaled accurately step by step. In some cases the design is projected straight onto the wall and traced with pencil before painting begins. Some muralists will paint directly without any prior sketching, preferring the spontaneous technique.

Once completed the mural can be given coats of varnish or protective acrylic glaze to protect the work from UV rays and surface damage.

In modern, quick form of muralling, young enthusiasts also use POP clay mixed with glue or bond to give desired models on a canvas board. The canvas is later set aside to let the clay dry. Once dried, the canvas and the shape can be painted with your choice of colors and later coated with varnish.

[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|[[Computer aided mural|CAM]] designed [[Frescography]] by Rainer Maria Latzke, digitally printed on canvas]]

As an alternative to a hand-painted or airbrushed mural, digitally printed murals can also be applied to surfaces.  Already existing murals can be photographed and then be reproduced in near-to-original quality.

The disadvantages of pre-fabricated murals and decals are that they are often mass-produced and lack the allure and exclusivity of an original artwork. They are often not fitted to the individual wall sizes of the client and their personal ideas or wishes can not be added to the mural as it progresses. The [[Frescography]] technique, a digital manufacturing method ([[Computer aided mural|CAM]]) invented by [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] addresses some of the personalisation and size restrictions.

Digital techniques are commonly used in advertisements. A "wallscape" is a large advertisement on or attached to the outside wall of a building.  Wallscapes can be painted directly on the wall as a mural, or printed on vinyl and securely attached to the wall in the manner of a [[billboard]]. Although not strictly classed as murals, large scale printed media are often referred to as such. Advertising murals were traditionally painted onto buildings and shops by sign-writers, later as large scale poster [[billboards]].

[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|left|The [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] mural]]
Murals are important in that they bring art into the public sphere. Due to the size, cost, and work involved in creating a mural, muralists must often be commissioned by a sponsor. Often it is the local government or a business, but many murals have been paid for with grants of [[patronage]]. For artists, their work gets a wide audience who otherwise might not set foot in an art gallery.  A city benefits by the beauty of a work of art.

Murals can be a relatively effective tool of social emancipation or achieving a political goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/politically-relevant-street-art-has-long-tradition-latin-america |title= Seizing public space |author= Sebastián Vargas |publisher= D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate= 21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals have sometimes been created against the law, or have been commissioned by local bars and coffeeshops. Often, the visual effects are an enticement to attract public attention to social issues.
State-sponsored public art expressions, particularly murals, are often used by [[totalitarian]] regimes as a tool of propaganda. However, despite the propagandist character of that works, some of them still have an artistic value.

Murals can have a dramatic impact whether consciously or subconsciously on the attitudes of passers by, when they are added to areas where people live and work. It can also be argued that the presence of large, public murals can add aesthetic improvement to the daily lives of residents or that of employees at a corporate venue.

Other world-famous murals can be found in [[Mexico]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Belfast]], [[Derry]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Cuba]] and in [[India]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100314123543/http://rpmurals.home.att.net/]  They have functioned as an important means of communication for members of socially, ethnically and racially divided communities in times of conflict. They also proved to be an effective tool in establishing a dialogue and hence solving the cleavage in the long run.
The [[India]]n state [[Kerala]] has exclusive [[murals]]. These [[Kerala mural painting]] are on walls of [[Hindu]] [[temples]]. They can be dated from 9th century AD.

The [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] murals of the [[Maya civilization]] in [[Guatemala]], are the oldest example of this art in [[Mesoamerica]] and are dated at 300 BC.

Many rural towns have begun using murals to create tourist attractions in order to boost economic income. [[Colquitt, Georgia]], is one such town. Colquitt was chosen to host the 2010 Global Mural Conference. The town has more than twelve murals completed, and will host the Conference along with [[Dothan, Alabama]], and [[Blakely, Georgia]]. In the summer of 2010, Colquitt will begin work on their Icon Mural.

The [[Mexican Muralism|Mexican mural]] movement in the 1930s brought a new prominence to murals as a social and political tool. [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Orozco]] and [[David Siqueiros]] were the most famous artists of the movement. Between 1932 and 1940, Rivera also painted murals in  [[San Francisco]], [[Detroit]], and [[New York City]]. In 1933, he completed a famous series of twenty-seven fresco panels entitled ''[[Detroit Industry]]'' on the walls of an inner court at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diego Rivera|url=http://www.abcgallery.com/R/rivera/rivera.html|publisher=Olga's Gallery|accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[McCarthyism]] of the 1950s, a [[:file:Diego Rivera Mural Sign.jpg|large sign]] was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as "detestable."

In 1948, the Colombian government hosted the IX Pan-American Conference to establish the [[Marshall plan]] for the Americas. The director of the OEA and the Colombian government commissioned master [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], to paint a mural in the Colombian congress building to commemorate the event. Martinez decided to make it about the [[Congress of Cúcuta|Cúcuta Congress]], and painted [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] in front of [[Francisco de Paula Santander|Santander]], making liberals upset; so, due to the murder of Jorge Elieser Gaitan the mobs of el [[bogotazo]] tried to burn the capitol, but the Colombian Army stopped them. Years later, in the 1980s, with liberals in charge of the Congress, they passed a resolution to turn the whole chamber in the Elliptic Room 90 degrees to put the main mural on the side and commissioned [[Alejandro Obregon]] to paint a non-partisan mural in the [[surrealist]] style.

[[Northern Ireland]] contains some of the most famous political murals in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Rapp and Markus Rhomberg: Seeking a Neutral Identity in Northern Ireland´s Political Wall Paintings.

In: Machin, D. (Ed.) Visual Communication Reader. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, many murals are non-sectarian, concerning political and social issues such as racism and environmentalism, and many are completely apolitical, depicting children at play and scenes from everyday life. (See [[Northern Irish murals]].)

A not political, but social related mural covers a wall in an old building, once a prison, at the top of a cliff in Bardiyah, in Libya.  It was painted and signed by the artist in April 1942, weeks before his death on the first day of the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].  Known as the [[Bardia Mural]], it was created by English artist, private [[John Frederick Brill]].&lt;ref name=" Commonwealth War Graves Commission"&gt;

In 1961 [[East Germany]] began to erect a wall between East and [[West Berlin]], which became famous as the [[Berlin Wall]]. While on the East Berlin side painting was not allowed, artists painted on the Western side of the Wall from the 80s until the fall of the Wall in 1989.

Many unknown and known artists such as [[Thierry Noir]] and [[Keith Haring]] painted on the Wall, the "World's longest [[canvas]]". The sometimes detailed artwork were often painted over within hours or days. On the Western side the Wall was not protected, so everybody could paint on the Wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Eastern side of the Wall became also a popular "canvas" for many mural and [[graffiti]] artists.
[[Orgosolo]], in [[Sardinia]], is a most important center of [[murals]] [[politics]].

It is also common for mural graffiti be used as a memoir. In the book "Somebody Told Me," [[Rick Bragg]] writes about a series of communities, mainly located in New York, that have walls dedicated to the people who died.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, Rick. ''Somebody Told Me: The Newspaper Stories of Rick Bragg''. New York: Vintage Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; These memorials, both written word and mural style, provide the deceased to be present in the communities in which they lived. Bragg states that the "murals have woven themselves in the fabric of the neighborhoods, and the city." These memorials remind people of the deaths caused by inner city violence.

==Contemporary interior design==

===Traditional===
[[File:Forestmural.jpg|thumb|left|Forest mural by ''One Red Shoe'' in private home, England 2007]]
Many people like to express their individuality by commissioning an artist to paint a mural in their home. This is not an activity exclusively for owners of large houses. A mural artist is only limited by the fee and therefore the time spent on the painting; dictating the level of detail; a simple mural can be added to the smallest of walls.

Private commissions can be for dining rooms, bathrooms, living rooms or, as is often the case- children's bedrooms. A child's room can be transformed into the 'fantasy world' of a [[forest]] or [[racing track]], encouraging imaginative play and an awareness of art.

The current trend for feature walls has increased commissions for muralists in the UK. A large hand-painted mural can be designed on a specific theme, incorporate personal images and elements and may be altered during the course of painting it. The personal interaction between client and muralist is often a unique experience for an individual not usually involved in the arts.

In the 1980s, illusionary wall painting experienced a renaissance in private homes. The reason for this revival in interior design could, in some cases be attributed to the reduction in living space for the individual. Faux architectural features as well as natural scenery and views can have the effect of 'opening out' the walls. Densely built up areas of housing may also contribute to people's feelings of being cut off from nature in its free form. A mural commission of this sort may be an attempt by some people to re-establish a balance with nature.

Commissions of murals in schools, hospitals and retirement homes can achieve a pleasing and welcoming atmosphere in these caring institutions. Murals in other public buildings, such as [[public houses]] are also common.

===Graffiti-style===
[[File:Acehotel-002023.jpg|thumb|right|Mint&amp;Serf at [[Ace Hotel]], New York City]][[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating personal expression]]
Recently, [[graffiti]] and street art have played a key role in contemporary wall painting. Such graffiti/street artists as [[Keith Haring]], [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Above (artist)|Above]], [[1134nyc|Mint&amp;Serf]], [[Futura 2000]], [[Os Gemeos]], and [[Faile (artist collective)|Faile]] among others have successfully transcended their street art aesthetic beyond the walls of urban landscape and onto walls of private and corporate clients. As graffiti/street art became more mainstream in the late 1990s, youth oriented brands such as Nike and Red Bull, with Wieden Kennedy, have turned to graffiti/street artists to decorate walls of their respective offices. This trend continued through 2000's with graffiti/street art gaining more recognition from art institutions worldwide.

===Ethnic===
[[File:Wall_murals_Rajasthani_motif.jpg |thumb|left|200px|Rajasthani motif mural by Kakshyaachitra, Mumbai 2014]]
Many home owners choose to display the traditional art and culture of their society or events from their history in their homes. Ethnic murals have become an important form of interior decoration. [[Warli painting]] murals are becoming a preferred mode of wall decor in India. Warli painting is an ancient Indian art form in which the tribal people used to depict different phases of their life on the walls of their mud houses.

==Tile==
[[File:Azulejos Parque Eduardo VII-2.jpg|thumb|Panel of glazed tiles by Jorge Colaço (1922) depicting an episode from the battle of [[Aljubarrota]] (1385) between the Portuguese and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] armies.  A piece of public art in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].]]
Tile murals are murals made out of stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass and or metal tiles that are installed within, or added onto the surface of an existing wall. They are also inlaid into floors. Mural tiles are painted, glazed, sublimation printed (as described below) or more traditionally cut or broken into pieces. Unlike the traditional painted murals described above, tile murals are always made with the use of tiles.

Mosaic murals are made by combining small 1/4" to 2" size pieces of colorful stone, ceramic, or glass tiles which are then laid out to create a picture. Modern day technology has allowed commercial mosaic mural makers to use computer programs to separate photographs into colors that are automatically cut and glued onto sheets of mesh creating precise murals fast and in large quantities.

The azulejo ({{IPA-pt|ɐzuˈleʒu}}, {{IPA-es|aθuˈlexo}}) refers to a typical form of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] or [[Spain|Spanish]] painted, [[tin-glazing|tin-glazed]], [[ceramic]] [[tile]]work. They have become a typical aspect of [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]], manifesting without interruption during five centuries, the consecutive trends in art.

Azulejos can be found inside and outside [[church (building)|church]]es, [[palace]]s, ordinary houses and even [[railway station]]s or [[subway station]]s.

They were not only used as an [[ornament (architecture)|ornamental art]] form, but also had a specific functional capacity like [[temperature control]] in homes. Many azulejos chronicle major historical and cultural aspects of [[Portuguese history]].

Custom-printed tile murals can be produced using digital images for kitchen splashbacks, wall displays, and flooring. Digital photos and artwork can be resized and printed to accommodate the desired size for the area to be decorated. Custom tile printing uses a variety of techniques including dye sublimation and ceramic-type laser toners. The latter technique can yield fade-resistant custom tiles which are suitable for long term exterior exposure.

[[File:Orchestra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A symphony orchestra]]

''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'' defines '''music criticism''' as 'the intellectual activity of formulating judgements on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres'.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is a branch of [[musical aesthetics]]. With the concurrent expansion of interest in music and information media over the past century, the term has come to acquire the conventional meaning of journalistic reporting on musical performances.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of music criticism==

The musicologist [[Winton Dean]] has suggested that "music is probably the most difficult of the arts to criticize."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 44&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[plastic arts|plastic]] or literary arts, the 'language' of music does not specifically relate to human sensory experience - Dean's words, "the word 'love' is common coin in life and literature: the note C has nothing to do with breakfast or railway journeys or marital harmony."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Like dramatic art, music is recreated at every performance, and criticism may therefore be directed both at the text (musical score) and the performance. More specifically, as music has a temporal dimension that requires repetition or development of its material "problems of balance, contrast, expectation and fulfilment ... are more central to music than to other arts, supported as these are by verbal or representational content."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of a clearly evolved or consensual musical aesthetics has also tended to make music criticism a highly subjective issue. "There is no counter-check outside the critic's own personality."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===To end of 18th century===
Critical references to music (often deprecating performers or styles) can be found in early literature, including, for example, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' and in the writings of medieval music theorists.

According to [[Richard Taruskin]], the active concert life of late 18th-century London meant that "the role and the function of arts criticism as we know it today were the creations of the English public."&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010) 571.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first magazines specifically devoted to music criticism seem to have developed in Germany, for example [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]'s ''Der getreue Music-Meister'' (1728), which included publications of new compositions, and ''Der critische Musikus'' which appeared in [[Hamburg]] between 1737 and 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In France in the 1750s, the [[Querelle des Bouffons]] (the dispute between supporters of French and Italian opera styles as represented by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] respectively) generated essays from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and others, including [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010), 441-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The English composer [[Charles Avison]] (1709–1770) published the first work on musical criticism in the English language - an ''Essay on Musical Expression'' published in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Avison claims that since the time of [[Palestrina]] and [[Raphael]], music had improved in status whilst pictorial art had declined.&lt;ref&gt;Avison (1752), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he believes that [[George Frideric Handel]] is too much concerned with naturalistic imitation than with expression,&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 37&lt;/ref&gt; and criticises the habit, in [[Italian opera]]s, of &lt;blockquote&gt;'that egregious absurdity of repeating, and finishing many songs with the first part; when it often happens, after the passions of anger and revenge have been sufficiently expressed, that reconcilement and love are the subjects of the second, and, therefore, should conclude the performance.'&lt;ref&gt;Avison (1752), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Typically until the late eighteenth century music criticism centred on vocal rather than instrumental music - "vocal music ... was the apex of [the] aesthetic hierarchy. One knew what music was expressing."&lt;ref&gt;Charlton (2003) 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Romanticism===
The last years of the eighteenth century reflected both a change of patronage of music from the aristocracy to the rising middle-classes&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012), 11-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of [[Romanticism]] in the arts. Both of these had consequences for the practice of music criticism; "the tone of the critic was lowered as his audience expanded: he began to approach the reader as a colleague rather than a pedagogue,"&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and a new generation of critics began to widen their consideration to other aspects of music than its pure representative aspects, becoming increasingly interested in instrumental music. Prominent amongst these was [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], who wrote in 1809&lt;blockquote&gt;That instrumental music has now risen to a level of which one probably had no inkling not long ago, and that the [[symphony]], especially following...Haydn and Mozart, has become the ultimate form of instrumental music - the ''opera'' of instruments, as it were - all this is well-known to every music-lover.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann (2003) 222-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further impetus to the direction of music criticism was given by the changing nature of concert programming with the establishment of the European classical music canon; indeed it is at this period that the word 'classical' is first applied to a received musical tradition. At the same time, the proportion of new music to 'canonic' music in concert programming began to decline, meaning that living composers were increasingly in competition with their dead predecessors. This was particularly the case in respect of the rise of [[Beethoven]]'s reputation in his last year and posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 50-1; Weber (2001); Weber (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise both to writings on the value of the 'canon' and also to writings by composers and their supporters defending newer music.

In 1798 the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'', edited by [[Friedrich Rochlitz]] (1769-1842), began publication in [[Leipzig]], and this is often regarded as the precursor of a new genre of criticism aimed at a wider readership than qualified connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010) 673.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years a number of regular journals dedicated to music criticism and reviews began to appear in major European centres, including ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' (London 1823-33), ''[[The Musical Times]]'' (London, 1844-date), the ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' (Paris 1827-1880, founded by [[François-Joseph Fétis]]), the ''Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' founded in 1825 by [[Adolf Martin Schlesinger|A.M. Schlesinger]] and edited by [[Adolf Bernhard Marx|A. B. Marx]], and the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' founded in 1834 in Leipzig by [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Friedrich Wieck]], and later edited by [[Franz Brendel]]. Other journals at this period also began to carry extensive writings on music: [[Hector Berlioz]] wrote for the Parisian ''[[Journal des débats]]'', [[Heinrich Heine]] reported on music and literature in Paris for the Stuttgart ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', the young [[Richard Wagner]] wrote articles for [[Heinrich Laube]]'s magazine ''Zeitung für die elegante Welt'' and during his 1839-42 stay in Paris for Schlesinger's publishing house and for German newspapers. In 1835 [[James William Davison]] (1813–85) began his lifelong career as a music critic, writing 40 years for ''[[The Times]].''&lt;ref&gt;Davison (1912) v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensions: overall (when open), 25 3/8 × 46 3/8 in.; central panel, 25 1/4 × 24 7/8 in,; each wing, 25 3/8 × 10 3/4 in]]
[[File:Robert Campin 006.jpg|thumb|260px|''The Annunciation''. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], Brussels, version of the central panel, at one time attributed to [[Jacques Daret]], a pupil of Campin's. This panel was painted earlier than the New York version, and may be the original.&lt;ref name="r50"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 50&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Mérode Altarpiece'''{{efn-ua|The triptych is named after a previous owner, comtesse Marie-Nicolette de Merode (1849–1905)}} (or '''''Annunciation Triptych''''') is an [[Oil painting|oil]] on oak panel [[triptych]], now in [[The Cloisters]], in New York City. It is unsigned and undated, but attributed to [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Robert Campin]] and an assistant.{{efn-ua|The painting is attributed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to "Robert Campin and assistant". The "assistant" is attributed with the figure of the female donor, rather than the main subjects}} The three panels represent, from left to right, the [[votive portrait|donors]] kneeling in prayer in a garden, the moment of the [[Annunciation]] to Mary, which is set in a contemporary, domestic setting, and [[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter with the tools of his trade. The many elements of religious symbolism include the lily and fountain (symbolising the purity of Mary), and the [[Holy Spirit]] represented by the rays of light coming falling from the left hand window.

The central panel was completed after 1422, likely between 1425 and 1428, by a member of Campin's workshop.{{efn-ua|Dates as early as 1420 have been suggested, based on Campin presumed birth date and that [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Ghent altarpiece]] "Annunciation" was influenced by Campin's treatment of the same subject. See Rousseau (1957), 128}}  The outer panels are later additions by a workshop member, probably on request by the donor who sought to elevate the central panel to a triptych and place himself in the pictorial space. The wings contain views of the city of [[Liège]], in today's Belgium. A version of the center panel in Brussels is earlier, and maybe Campin's original panel.

The triptych is a founding and important work in the then emerging late Gothic, [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] style, and has been described as a "milestone between two periods; it at once summarizes the medieval tradition and lays the foundation for the development of modern painting".&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and attribution==
The New York triptych has been at times attributed to the young [[Rogier van der Weyden]]&lt;ref name="r117" /&gt; It is today accepted as belonging to a group of paintings associated with the Master of Flémalle, assumed to be Robert Campin,{{efn-ua|Until the connection had been made, Campin was associated with a separate grouping of works. See Campbell (1998), 72}} a mentor of [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref name="dg130" /&gt; There is another version of the Annunciation panel in [[Brussels]], slightly earlier but damaged,&lt;ref name="c643"&gt;Campbell (1974), 643&lt;/ref&gt; which may represent the original version by Campin.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

Technical examination of the wood panels suggest that the New York triptych was completed by a number of hands. The wood of the central panel is different and earlier to that of the wings, while the hinging further suggest that the central panel was not intended as part of a triptych. The central panel is likely a copy of an earlier composition by Campin, while the wings were probably a later commissioned by the donor, who presumably wished that they were attached to the main panel to form a devotional altarpiece, probably (given its size) for private devotion.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; Areas of the panels have been reworked; both the female doner and bearded man on the left wing were painted over landscape, while the window behind the Virgin was originally painted in gold.&lt;ref name="s140"&gt;Suhr, 140-44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Campbell]] has dismissed the triptych's association with the Flemalle group, and thus Robert Campin. He describes the Mérode as "incoherent in design", in that it lacks spatial continuity between the panels, a trait most noticeable in the ''[[Seilern Triptych]]''.&lt;ref name="c643" /&gt; In addition the open sky seen through the windows in the central is incongruous in point of view with the street scene in the donor panel. He further notes the poor command of perspective in the donor panel, and notes that it is "unfortunate that a line of one of the mortar courses in the garden wall disappear into the donor's mouth".&lt;ref name="c644" /&gt; Campbell disregards the wing panels as pedestrian and by lesser hands, thrown together at the will of the donor. He gives prominence to the Brussels panel, which he cautiously attributes to the Master of Flémalle.&lt;ref name="c643" /&gt;

==Description==
The triptych was commissioned for private and domestic use; the central panel is a relatively small 64 × 63&amp;nbsp;cm and each wing measures 65 × 27&amp;nbsp;cm. Each panel has a steep perspective, in that the viewer seems to be looking down on the figures from an elevated point of view. In other respects the perspective is underdeveloped; neither the Virgin nor Gabriel seem to rest on solid ground, while the female donor seems to hover, and  barely able to fit into the space she is positioned in.&lt;ref name="r124"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels are well preserved, with little over-paint, glossing, dirt layers or paint losses.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/470304 Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece)]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 17 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; They are almost entirely in oil; and establish many of the inventions that were to make the technique so successful and adaptable over the following centuries.&lt;ref name="r121"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 121&lt;/ref&gt; The serenity of the works is achieved, in part, through the dominance of pale, opaque white, red and blue hues. The panels are relatively small; the at times minute attention to detail calls to mind the focus of contemporary miniatures, of the kind seem in the two [[illuminated manuscripts]] in the central panel.&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt;

===Annunciation===
[[File:Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece) MET DT7255.jpg|thumb|260px|Detail, center panel, with table, book of hours, fading candle and vase]]
The panel is one of the earliest representations of the [[Annunciation to Mary]] in a contemporary middle-class Northern European interior,&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt; perhaps a dining room. This is Campin's main innovation; showing a reading Madonna, with unbound hair in a then familiar setting; an image that lead to many adoptions, most famously [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[The Magdalen Reading|Reading Magdalen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 65&lt;/ref&gt; The colours of the central panel are dominated by the cool grays of the plaster and the brown of the timber wall.&lt;ref name="g76"&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 76&lt;/ref&gt; The lower half is characterised by warmer and deeper brownish greens and reds.&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian suggest that the success of the panel is due to the contrast between the warm reds of the Virgin's robe and the pale blue hues of the archangel [[Gabriel]]'s vestment.&lt;ref name="r118"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mérode Altarpiece (Mary).jpg|left|thumb|240px|Detail with the Virgin reading a book of hours]]
The perspective is very steep and unevenly distributed. The angle of the table in particular is illogical. Art historian [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] describes these distortions as "disturbing".&lt;ref name="c644"&gt;Campbell (1974), 644&lt;/ref&gt; The panel shows the moment before the traditional scene, as Mary, absorbed in her book, is still unaware of the presence of Gabriel.&lt;ref name="r118" /&gt; Mary is in a red gown rather than the more usual blue. She is in a relaxed pose, reading from a [[book of hours]], her hair unbound. Unusually for a medieval depiction of the Annunciation, the dove of the Holy Spirit is not included. Instead he is represented by the extinguished light of the candle, and the beam of light falling from the window to the left, which carries the Christ Child holding a cross.&lt;ref name="r479"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Christ Child flies down towards Mary from the left oculus, signifying her impregnation by [[God the Father]]. He gazes directly at her and holds a cross. The folding-table contains a recently extinguished candle,&lt;ref name="r46" /&gt; and shows coiling smoke and a still glowing [[Candle wick|wick]]. This maybe a reference to the Holy Spirit, who, according to some late medieval writers, descended to the apostles "like a puff of wind".&lt;ref name="r47"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The white [[Lilium|lily]] in a Tuscan earthenware jug&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt; on the table represents Mary's virginity and purity, as does the white, [[ocher]] towel. The jug contains a series of enigmatic letters in Latin and Hebraic, deciphered by some art historians as ''De Campyn'', that is the artist's signature.&lt;ref name="r47" /&gt; An opened manuscript is positioned on a green velvet book pouch. Unusually the book is positioned next to the Virgin rather than the shelf. The pages seem worn and handled, indicating that it has been well read.&lt;ref name="r47" /&gt; It has been suggested that the book reflects the [[Carthusian]] [[Ludolf of Saxony]]'s idea of the  secluded life of the Virgin - that she earlier lived with "the Holy Scriptures as her sole companion".&lt;ref&gt;Châtelet, quoted in Reuterswärd (1998), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The right hand half of the back wall holds three windows, one of which contains a [[Latticework|lattice]] screen.&lt;ref name="r117" /&gt; The beams of the ceiling are supported by a series of [[corbel]]s.&lt;ref name="r120"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 120&lt;/ref&gt; The sky visible through the windows is a later addition, which was painted over an earlier gold ground. The armorial shields are also later additions.&lt;ref name="r121" /&gt;

===Donors===
[[File:Merode Altarpiece left Panel Detail a.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Left panel, with street scene and attendant]]
The [[donor portrait|donor]] and his wife are shown kneeling in prayer are in the left panel, looking through a half-open door into the Virgin's [[Hortus conclusus]].&lt;ref name="r117"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 117&lt;/ref&gt; The door presents a continuity oddity; although it can be seen opening into the Virgins room from the left panel, no such door entrance is visible in the center panel. Addressing this, the art historians Rose-Marie and Rainer Hagen suppose that the donor is "imagining that she has entered into his house. From without, he has opened the door; with his own eyes he beholds the Mother of God and petitions her for a family".&lt;ref name="h33"&gt;Hagen; Hagen (2003), 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant or attendant dressed in a festive outfit&lt;ref name="r122"&gt;Rousseau (1957), 122&lt;/ref&gt; appears to be an later addition by a different artist, perhaps after the donor's marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, (2005), 51–65&lt;/ref&gt; The space contains an unlocked entrance which leads to a minutely detailed street scene.&lt;ref name="r46"&gt;Reuterswärd (1998), 46&lt;/ref&gt; The panel is the more striking as the door leading into the Virgin's chamber is wide open, hugely presumptuous for even a mid-fifteenth century commission, and suggesting access to the gates of heaven.&lt;ref name="g78"&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The donors are identifiable as bourgeoisie from nearby [[Mechelen]], and are documented in Tournai in 1427, identifiable from the [[coat of arms]] in the [[stained glass]] window of the central panel.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

It is assumed that this panel was a later commission to Campin's workshop, not part of the original single panel design. There has been speculation that it was completed by the young [[Rogier van der Weyden]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2002), 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The altarpiece was commissioned either by the businessman Jan Engelbrecht, or the [[Cologne]]-born merchant Peter Engelbrecht and his wife Margarete Scrynmaker.&lt;ref name="k441"&gt;Kleiner (2013), 441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkArts"&gt;"[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/merode-altarpiece.htm Merode Altarpiece (1435)]". visual-arts-cork.com. Retrieved 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbrecht translates from German as "angel brings", while Scrynmaker means "cabinet maker", the latter perhaps influencing the choice of Joseph in the right hand panel.&lt;ref name="k441" /&gt;

===Joseph===
[[File:Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece) MET DT7259.jpg|thumb|200px|Right panel, detail with street scene and view of [[Liège]]]]
[[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter by trade, occupies the right-hand panel. He is shown at work, boring spike holes into one of the instruments of the Passion. An unusual feature is that, although Mary and Joseph did not marry until after the Annunciation, they are apparently living together and sharing the same space. Joseph is shown with the tools of his craft, including an ax, saw and rod, laid out across a table, and a small footstool, sitting before a fire of burning logs. Joseph's presence is probably intended to invoke  10 :15 from the [[Book of Isaiah]]: "Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth there-
with? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if
the staff should lift up itself as if was it were no wood."&lt;ref name="m267"&gt;Minott (1969), 267&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah's words were intended as incentatory and revolutionary, were followed by a treatise for the salvation of [[Israel]], and protested against an [[Assyria]]n king he considered considered boorish and vainglorious.&lt;ref name="m267" /&gt; Given this, Joseph is seen by art historians as a reassuring presence, warding the devil from the center panel.&lt;ref name="s185"&gt;Schapiro (1945), 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph is shown as an old man&lt;ref name="s185" /&gt; wearing an [[eggplant]] coloured coat and blue turban, in a panel characterised by dark and warm colours, and framed by the shadows from the window shutters.&lt;ref name="r117"/&gt; He works on a mouse trap, probably intended as a symbol of the cross at the [[Crucifixion]],&lt;ref name="dg129"&gt;Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 129&lt;/ref&gt; in that it represents an imagined but literal capture of the Devil, said to have held a man in ransom because of the [[original sin|sin of Adam]].&lt;ref name="m268"&gt;Minott (1969), 268&lt;/ref&gt; In some scripts, Christ's naked flesh was served as bait for the devil; "He rejoiced in Christ's death, like a bailiff of death. What he rejoiced in was then his own undoing. The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death."&lt;ref&gt;Sermo ccLcxii, "De ascensione Domini" . Migne, Pat. Lat., xxxvII, col. 1210. See Schapiro (1945), 182-87&lt;/ref&gt;

The background contains a cityscape, probably fictitious, showing the spires of two churches, one of which is now lost, the churches of St. Pierre (left) and Sainte Croix (right) in Liege.{{efn-ua|The church is however identifiable from surviving documents and contemporary descriptions. See Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 129}}&lt;ref name="dg130"&gt;Duchesne-Guillemin (1976), 130-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Merode Altarpiece Center Panel Detail d.jpg|left|thumb|340px|Detail of the center panel]]
The [[Iconography]] contains complex religious symbolism, although their extent and exact nature is debated – [[Meyer Schapiro]] pioneered the study of the symbolism of the mousetrap,&lt;ref name="ms182"&gt;Schapiro (1945), 82&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erwin Panofsky]] later extended, or perhaps over-extended, the analysis of symbols to cover many more details of the furniture and fittings. Similar debates exist for many Early Netherlandish paintings, and a number of the details seen for the first time here reappear in later Annunciations by other artists. 

The symbolic elements in the central panel mostly relate to the Annunciation, the Mass and the [[sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1984), 42–47&lt;/ref&gt; Mary sits on the floor to show her humility. The [[scroll]] and book in front of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] symbolize the Old and the [[New Testament]]s, and the roles Mary and the [[Christ]] child played in the fulfillment of prophecy.  The lilies in the earthenware vase on the table represent Mary's virginity. Other symbols of her purity include the enclosed garden (''[[Hortus conclusus]]''),&lt;ref name="k441" /&gt; and the white towel, while the small windows to the right, and  the half-closed windows at the rear, serve to emphasise the quiet, virginal life she has lived.&lt;ref name="h33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkArts" /&gt;

[[File:Merode Altarpiece Center Panel Detail c.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail with [[coat of arms]] in window, center panel]]
The lion finials on the bench may have a symbolic role (referring to the [[Seat of Wisdom]], or throne of [[Solomon]]) – this feature is often seen in other paintings, religious or secular (like [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'').  The arrangements for washing at the back of the room, which are considered unusual for a domestic interior, may relate to the similar arrangements of a [[piscina]] for the officiating priest to wash his hands during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].  The sixteen sides of the table may allude to the sixteen main Hebrew prophets; the table is usually seen as an altar, and the [[archangel]] [[Gabriel]] wears the [[vestment]]s of a [[deacon]].&lt;ref&gt;McNamee (1998), 151&lt;/ref&gt; The basin may represent both the purity of Virgin, and the cleansing of the Christian act of [[baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (1970), 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the right-hand panel, [[Saint Joseph]], a carpenter, has constructed a mouse trap symbolizing Christ's trapping and defeat of the devil, a metaphor used three times by [[Saint Augustine]]: "The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death."&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro (1945), 1&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of the right-hand panel has been studied in detail by Russell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=Malcolm|date=2017|title=The woodworker and the Redemption: the right shutter of the Merode triptych|url=|journal=Simiolus|volume=39|pages=335-350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that the object that Joseph is working on is a scandalum or stumbling block, a spiked block that gashes the legs of a punishment victim who walks with it hanging from a cord around his waist. Joseph's joinery instruments are displayed in a consistently unnatural manner, suggesting that they have been planned to fit a specific agenda; for example the joinery instruments on the table are so placed as to represent the three crosses of Christ and the two thieves.

==Provenance==
Its early history is obscure. The triptych was owned by the aristocratic [[Belgium|Belgian]]  [[Arenberg]] and [[House of Merode|Mérode]] families from 1820 to 1849 before reaching the art market, and has been in the collection of [[the Cloisters]], New York since 1956. Until its acquisition it had been in private collection for many years and thus inaccessible to both scholars and the public. Its purchase was funded by [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] and was described at the time as a "major event for the history of collecting in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll12/id/871 The Merode Altarpiece, a great and famous landmark in the history of western painting, by the Master of Flémalle, has been acquired for the Cloisters]".

The '''New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal''' is an award presented annually by the [[New Zealand Institute of Architects|NZIA]] to a New Zealand architect.
[[File:Auckland War Memorial Museum, 2016-01-21.jpg|thumb|Grierson, Aimer &amp; Draffin's design for the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]] won the Gold Medal in 1929.]]

== History ==
From 1927 until 1977 a gold, silver or bronze prize was awarded each for the design of a public building and was judged by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|Royal institute of British Architects]]. In 1978 a "National Award" replaced the Gold Medal. The Gold Medal was reintroduced in 2001 and is awarded to an architect who, over a period of time, has made an outstanding contribution to the practice of architecture, rather than for a specific building. This contribution is demonstrated through the production of a consistently high-quality body of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzia.co.nz/news--media/aon-new-zealand-named-as-principal-sponsor-of-2016-gold-medal-tour.aspx|title=New Zealand Institute of Architects – Aon New Zealand named as Principal Sponsor of 2016 Gold Medal Tour|last=(www.bka.co.nz)|first=Site designed and developed by bka interactive ltd, Auckland, New Zealand|website=www.nzia.co.nz|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Prize for Performing and Audiovisual Arts''' ({{lang-es|'''Premio Nacional de Artes de la Representación y Audiovisuales'''}}) was created in [[Chile]] in 1992 under Law 19169 as one of the replacements of the [[National Prize of Art of Chile|National Prize of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30536&amp;idVersion=1992-09-26 |title=Ley 19169: Establece normas sobre otorgamiento de Premios Nacionales |trans-title=Law 19169: Establishes Rules on Granting National Prizes |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Chile)|Ministry of Education]] |language=Spanish |date=26 September 1992 |access-date=8 December 2017 |via=Library of the National Congress of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is granted "to the person who has distinguished himself by his achievements in the respective area of the arts" (Article 8 of the aforementioned law). It is part of the [[National Prize of Chile]].

The prize, which is awarded every two years, consists of a diploma, the sum of 6,576,457 [[Chilean peso|pesos]] ({{US$|{{To USD|6576457|CHL|round=yes}}}}) which is adjusted every year, according to the previous year's [[consumer price index]], and a pension of 20 {{ill|Monthly tax unit|es|Unidad tributaria mensual|lt=monthly tax units}} (approximately US$1,600).

The '''Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti''', "New Academy of Fine Arts", also known as '''NABA''', is a privately run university in [[Milan]], [[Lombardy]], Italy. It has approximately 3000 students,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naba.it/why-choose-naba/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom are from abroad; it participates in the [[Erasmus Programme]].

==History==

NABA was founded in Milan in 1980.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1994 the Nuova Accademia received one of the forty "Ambrogino" certificates of civic merit awarded each year by the [[Comune]] of Milan.&lt;ref name=ambrogio&gt;[http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/ambrogini/attach/elenco%20CIVICHE%20BENEMERENZE_storiche.pdf Benemerenze Civiche (elenco aggiornato all'anno 2011)] (in Italian). Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 NABA also began hosting a “node”, or center linked to the [[University of Plymouth]]’s Planetary-Collegium research platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/273 Planetary-Collegium]&lt;/ref&gt; offering various PhD programs in the arts and technology.

NABA was bought by Bastogi Spa of Milan in 2002. In December 2009 Bastogi sold it to [[Laureate Education]] of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, for €22 million.&lt;ref name=bastogi&gt;[http://www.bastogi.com/it/storia/ Storia]. Bastogi Spa. (in Italian) "History". Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rep&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/01/13/le-scuole-gioiello-del-design-vendute-un.html Le scuole gioiello del design vendute a un colosso americano] ''La Repubblica'', 13 January 2010. (in Italian) "Precious schools of design sold to an American colossus". Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation and International Programs==

NABA is listed by the [[Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca]], the Italian ministry of education, as a "legally recognized academy" in the AFAM classification of schools of music, art and dance that are considered equivalent to a traditional university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afam.miur.it/argomenti/istituzioni/accademie-di-belle-arti-legalmente-riconosciute.aspx/ AFAM, Alta Formazione Artistica, Musicale e Coreutica: Accademie di belle arti legalmente riconosciute].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2989">The '''Oslo Conservatory of Music''' ({{lang-no|Musikkonservatoriet i Oslo}}) was a music school in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

The school was established by [[Ludvig Mathias Lindeman]] and his son [[Peter Brynie Lindeman]] in 1883 in Christiania (as Oslo was then called) and was named the Organist School ({{lang-no|Organistskolen}}).&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. 1961. ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', vol. 9. Kassel: Bärenreiter, p. 1583.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 it had 174 students and was renamed the Music and Organist School. Peter Brynie Lindeman took over leadership of the school after his father's death in 1887. The school was renamed again in 1892 to the Christiania Music Conservatory, and it was the only institution of its kind in Norway until 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nmh.no/om_musikkhogskolen/musikkhogskolens_historie Norges musikkhøgskole: Musikkhøgskolens historie.]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter's son [[Trygve Lindeman]] (1896–1979), who studied music in Stockholm, became a teacher at the school in 1921 and became its head in 1930. Trygve Lindeman retired in the 1960s and management was transferred to the Lindeman Foundation ({{lang-no|Lindemans Legat}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://nbl.snl.no/Trygve_Lindeman ''Norsk biografisk leksikon'': Trygve Lindeman.]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1969 to 1973, the conservatory was operated in a partnership between the foundation and the government. The school offered a mix of professional training of musicians, and amateur education for children and adults. The conservatory closed in 1973, when the [[Norwegian Academy of Music]] was established.

The Conservatory of Music Archives were administered by the Lindeman Foundation until 2013, when they were transferred to the [[National Archives of Norway]]. The archives consist of teaching records with student and teacher schedules, evening performances by students, the music conservatory society, and a series of leaving assessments of students. It also contains some accounting records, including student payments and salary records. The materials cover the period from the school's establishment in 1883 until it started being shut down in 1969/70.

==Notable alumni==
Notable people that attended the Oslo Conservatory of Music include:
*[[Geir Henning Braaten]] (born 1944), pianist
*[[Trond Kverno]] (born 1945), composer

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3967">[[File:Defendant and Counsel by WF Yeames.jpg|thumb|250px|right| ''Defendant and Counsel'' (1895), by Yeames, an example of the problem picture, which invites the viewer to speculate on the woman's alleged crime and on whether or not she may be guilty.]]A '''problem picture''' is a [[genre]] of art popular in late [[Victorian painting]], characterised by the deliberately ambiguous depiction of a key moment in a narrative that can be interpreted in several different ways, or which portrays an unresolved dilemma. It has some relation to the [[problem play]]. The viewer of the picture is invited to speculate about several different possible explanations of the scene.  The genre has much in common with that of [[book illustration]], then at its most popular, but with the text belonging to the illustration omitted.&lt;ref&gt;See David Skilton,“The Centrality of Literary Illustration in Victorian Visual Culture: the example of Millais and Trollope from 1860 to 1864.” Journal of Illustration Studies (December 2007). 14 May 2014. &lt;http://jois.uia.no/articles.php?article=30&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The genre began to emerge in the second half of the nineteenth century, along with the development of book illustrations that depicted "pregnant" moments in a narrative. One of the earliest problem pictures is [[John Everett Millais]]' ''Trust Me'', which depicts an older man demanding that a young woman hand him a letter she has received. Either character might be uttering the words. The significance and content of the letter is left to the imagination.  Their relationship is also unclear; in view of their ages, they might be a married couple, or a father and daughter. 

Other artists who worked in the genre included [[William Frederick Yeames]], whose ''"[[And When Did You Last See Your Father? (picture)|And when did you last see your father?]]"'' became the most famous example of the genre. It depicts a young boy of the [[English civil war]] period being gently interrogated by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] troops who are looking for his Royalist father. It is implied that they are asking a trick question designed to discover his location. The painting is poised at the moment the child is about to answer. Yeames painted many other works of this type, including ''Amy Robsart'' and ''Defendant and Counsel''. When the latter was exhibited a newspaper ran a competition for readers to guess what crime the woman was accused of.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/biog/yeames.htm Obituary of Yeames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822202258/http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/biog/yeames.htm |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sickert.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Walter Sickert, ''The Camden Town Murder'', originally titled, ''What Shall We Do for the Rent?'' or ''What Shall We Do to Pay the Rent'' 1908]]
Some [[avant garde]] artists also experimented with the genre, notably [[Edgar Degas]] and his follower [[Walter Sickert]]. Degas's [[Interior (Degas)|''Interior'']] (1869) depicts an ambiguous scene suggestive of sexual transgression and violence (hence the alternative title of "the Rape"). Similar ambiguity is found in Sickert's ''[[The Camden Town Murder]]'' (1908), in which the two figures can be interpreted as a couple, or a killer and his victim.

The genre continued to be popular into the early twentieth century, but was by this time increasingly seen as old fashioned and as over-literary, against the emphasis on pictorial style and form characteristic of [[impressionism]] and [[post-impressionism]].

'''Punchinello Players''', founded in 1914, was a [[theatre]] organization of the [[University of Minnesota]]. When it closed it was the second oldest student-run [[community theater]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name=UNS&gt;{{cite web|title=UNM News Service 4.19.82|publisher=University of Minnesota News Service|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello - located on the [[University of Minnesota#St. Paul campus|St. Paul campus]] - originated for the purpose of improving the lives of the greater community, and as a University-associated theater it continued that purpose throughout its existence via production of chosen works.&lt;ref name=Manhood&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Country Plays with Country Players|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiREAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA417&amp;dq=back+to+the+farm+minnesota+rural+manhood&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4ZSg0MPYAhWK5oMKHTmqDaoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=back%20to%20the%20farm%20minnesota%20rural%20manhood&amp;f=false|journal=’Rural Manhood: Devoted to the County (Rural) work of the Young Men’s Christian Associations in Village, Town and Open Country |publisher=The International Committee of Young Men’s Christian Associations, New York |date=January 1918 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |pages=417–418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello Players closed in 1994 due primarily to its home, North Hall (formerly a student dormitory), being slated for demolition.

==Debut==
'''Back to the Farm'''

''Back to the Farm'' was a two-year production (1913–1915) written by School of Agriculture student Merline H. Shumway and directed by Estelle Cook &lt;ref name=Manhood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bookdepository.com/Back-Farm-Merline-H-Merline-Henderson-Shumway/9781360495736 Back to the Farm : A Play in Three Acts]&lt;/ref&gt; to create awareness of the University's new Agricultural Extension Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= |first1= |authorlink= | title=Exension History|url=https://www.extension.umn.edu/about/history/|work=[[University of Minnesota]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the rural communities of [[Minnesota]]. 
''Back to the Farm'' was created to demonstrate the value of scientifically trained farmers. It centers around a farm family in which the father is an old-school farmer, who isn't open to his sons' new ideas about how to do things. The son leaves the farm and enrolls at a nearby agricultural college for their 4-year program. They mend their relationship and he returns to the farm, implementing what he's learned - with the result that the farm becomes the most productive in the state.&lt;ref name="Card"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Gopher: Annual Publication of the Student Body of the University of Minnesota|volume=39|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|work= University of Minnesota|date=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|426}} 
Initially presented at County Fairs around the state, its popularity exceeded expectations and the play continued to tour at farmers' institutes and other educational sessions, eventually being performed fifty times in the first year and many more times for years afterwards.{{refn|group=note| From notes of a freshman: October 11.

The Agricultural Extension Program (along with General Extension, founded 4 years later in 1913) was instituted to increase the university's outreach. [[George Edgar Vincent]] - University President from 1911-1917 - put in place innovative programming including 'University Weeks' with plays, lectures, concerts and debates similar to the [[Chautauqua Institute]] he had previously led, in the spirit of increasing educational and cultural opportunities for the general public.&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential History|url=https://president.umn.edu/about/presidential-history/george-edgar-vincent|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chautauqua&gt;{{cite book| last1= |first1=|authorlink= | title=’ ‘The Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties: From Self-Improvement to Adult Education in America, 1750-1990.”|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BjGrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=minnesota+The+pursuit+of+knowledge+under+difficulties+:+from+self-improvement+to+adult+education+in+America,+1750-1990.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8-IGg-MTYAhVD9IMKHeFaCKwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=minnesota&amp;f=false|work=[[Stanford University Press]] |date=1994|page=291 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=150years&gt;{{cite book| last1=Lehmberg |first1=Stanford |authorlink=Stanford Lehmberg| last2=Pflaum|first2=Ann M. |authorlink2=Ann M.

Those initial rural productions of ''Back to the Farm'' launched the existence of Punchinello Players in 1914, originally under the name the Minnesota Agriculture Dramatic Club. The organization changed its name to Punchinello Players in 1923.&lt;ref name=snac&gt;{{cite web|title=Punchinello Players|url=http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6bd25ct|publisher=Snac Cooperative|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty Advisors==

The first committed, long-term faculty advisor of Punchinello was William J. Routledge, who steered the organization from its beginnings through till the 1940-1941 school year.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gopher: Annual Publication of the Student Body of the University of Minnesota",Volume 45, Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota, 1922, Page 484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Minnesota Alumni Weekly",Volume 23, Number 9, Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota, 11/22/23 Page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the 1941-1942 school year, Francis E. Drake was Faculty Advisor, but Punchinello - like many University organizations - was largely dormant during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;"The University of Minnesota Directory of Student Organizations", Minneapolis, Minnesota.

University of Minnesota Student Body, Vol 55. 1942. P. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Punchinello's faculty advisor and frequent production director for over three decades was William M. Marchand, Humanities Professor of the Rhetoric Department, [[CFANS]].&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite web|title=William Marchand Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/twincities/obituary.aspx?pid=181696415|publisher=Pioneer Press|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParkBugle&gt;{{cite web|title=William Marchand Obit|url=http://www.parkbugle.org/william-marchand/|publisher=Park Bugle|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Marchand had a PhD in theatre, and prior to coming to the University in 1960 he had co-founded the Paul Bunyan Theatre, a summer theatre in [[Bemidji]].&lt;ref name=MNDaily_Baumann&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Baumann |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Baumann|title='Born in 1914, Punchinello Players is still young at heart'|work=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=October 13, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North Hall==

Punchinello took over the former cafeteria area of North Hall (formerly a dormitory) in the 1960s, while [[O. Meredith Wilson]] was president.

Punchinello had operated out of various spaces prior to that point, including the Ag Auditorium during the 1940s and one of the World War II -era temporary buildings on the St. Paul Campus through the 1960s.&lt;ref name='42 Gopher'/&gt;

When Wilson became aware of that, he felt that something better could be arranged. Soon, Punchinello had a new home.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite web|title=O. Meredith Wilson, 1960-1967|url=https://president.umn.edu/about/presidential-history/o-meredith-wilson | publisher=Office of the President|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MNDaily_Roberts&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Roberts |first=Raequel |authorlink=Raequel Roberts|title='Punchinello Players elebrate 65th years|work=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=November 12, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theater proper (in the former cafeteria) sat 119, and there were various other spaces in the building that Punchinello used for props, costumes, sets, the green room and dressing rooms.&lt;ref name="MNDaily_Roberts"/&gt;

==Theater Genre==

Punchinello mainly performed traditional classics as well as some musicals, and the occasional newer work. Among the rare melodrama/related productions were ''[[Kind Lady (play)|Kind Lady]]'' by [[Edward Chodorov]], in 1942.&lt;ref name='42 Gopher'/&gt; and ''[[Dracula]]'' (from the novel by [[Bram Stoker]]) in 1969.&lt;ref name=1969UMN&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1969 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/51858| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedies have included ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1973 and ''[[Hay Fever]]'' by [[Noel Coward]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=73-74&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1973 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/51875| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=78-79&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1978 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/51894/1978October-DecemberPressReleases.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello produced the [[Metatheatre|metatheatrical]] play [[Our Town]] by [[Thornton Wilder]] in 1969.

Punchinello often explored social issues, with sell-out productions such as ''[[The Crucible]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]] and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' by [[Samuel Beckett]] in 1983,&lt;ref name=Wtr83&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1983 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/51968/1983January-MarchPressReleases.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lesser known works including ''Play with a Tiger'' by [[Doris Lessing]] in 1979 and ''[[The Shadow Box|Shadow Box]]'' by [[Michael Cristofer]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=78-79 /&gt;

The students who were involved often were sometimes but not always theater majors, representing the range of disciplines within the University.&lt;ref name="MNDaily_Roberts"/&gt;

==Finale==
Its final two productions continued that tradition: [[William Saroyan]]'s ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'' was the second-to-last production. The final production, directed by William Marchand, was [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[Our Town]]''.&lt;ref name=Curtains&gt;{{cite web|title=It's curtains for Punchinello Players|url=http://parkbugle.org.s3.amazonaws.com/backissues/1994/02.pdf|publisher=ParkBugle|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Schwechater''''' {{IPA-de|ˈʃvɛçaːtɐ|}} is a 1958 [[experimental film|experimental]] short film by Austrian filmmaker [[Peter Kubelka]]. It is the second entry in his trilogy of metrical films, between ''Adebar'' and ''[[Arnulf Rainer (film)|Arnulf Rainer]]''.

Originally commissioned to make an advertisement for {{ill|Schwechater Bier|de}}, Kubelka edited footage from the shoot based on a complex set of rules, producing a rapid procession of images. Although the company was displeased with the commercial, ''Schwechater'' found favour as a work of avant-garde cinema.

==Description==
''Schwechater'' contains 1,440 [[film frame|frame]]s, making it exactly one minute long when projected at the standard rate of 24 [[frames per second]]. The film has no narrative, and it cuts between images quickly enough that they form flickering patterns.&lt;ref name="sitney-visionary-film"&gt;Sitney 1974, pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four different moving images appear throughout the film. One shows a woman sitting at a table as beer is poured into her glass, and another shows her drinking the beer. There is also footage of a [[champagne glass]] filled with beer as well as a group of people in a restaurant.&lt;ref name="sitney-visionary-film"/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Peter Kubelka und Gerhard Rühm, 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Director [[Peter Kubelka]] in 2014]]
===Photography===
The Schwechater Bier brewery commissioned Kubelka to make an advertisement for its beer.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 2008, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Kubelka shot using an old, hand-operated [[35 mm]] scientific camera. The camera had no viewfinder, and Kubelka largely ignored the [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the images. Once the film stock was used up, Kubelka humored the [[art director]] for Schwechater Bier and cranked the empty camera, pretending to continue filming.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bodien |first=Earl |year= 1966 |title=The Films of Peter Kubelka |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |page=55 |doi=10.2307/1210702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=Scott |year=2004 |title=His African Journey: An Interview with Peter Kubelka |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=5–7 |doi=10.1525/fq.2004.57.3.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editing===
[[File:Schwechater film.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|A sequence of red frames from the film]]
Kubelka used four shots spanning 16, 30, 90, and 1,440 frames as the material for ''Schwechater''. He produced high-contrast positive and [[negative (photography)|negative]] prints, copied so that each shot looped for exactly 1,440 frames.&lt;ref name=p6869&gt;Tscherkassky 2012, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; After getting the developed film from the laboratory, Kubelka let it sit for six weeks until executives from Schwechater Bier began asking about the commercial.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt;

The editing process for ''Schwechater'' lasted six months.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt; Kubelka produced a score for the film with a complex system of overlapping structures to determine how to combine the eight film strips. One such structure specifies outlines the gradual permeation of the colour red in ''Schwechater''. The film starts alternates between black-and-white sequences and red sequences; the black and white sequences decrease in duration from 110 frames down to 10 frames as the red sequences remain are all roughly 30 frames. As such, the film becomes increasingly red over the course of its runtime.&lt;ref&gt;Tscherkassky 2012, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another structure specifies which frames do and do not contain images. Each sequence of frames with images is immediately followed by a sequence of the same length containing frames showing a solid color—either black or red. The frame count of these sequences traverses the [[powers of two]], from 1 up to 32 and back down.&lt;ref name=p6869/&gt;

===Soundtrack===
For the film's soundtrack, Kubelka created a score of rasping sounds and beeps. The intermittent periods of sound happen parallel to the red-tinted sequences, with a low hum and one to three [[sine tone]]s. When the Schwechater logo appears at the end of the film, Kubelka used a sustained, high-pitched sine tone.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tscherkassky 2012, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
After Kubelka delivered the finished version to Schwechater, they stopped payment to him, ended their relation with him, and destroyed the company's print of the film.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt; Initial reaction to ''Schwechater'' was very negative. The company sued Kubelka, and the film lab, which had Schwechater as a client, stopped making prints for him. His decision to leave Austria was in part because of the response to ''Schwechater''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Grissemann |first=Stefan |date=September 2012 |title=Frame by Frame |url=https://www.filmcomment.com/article/peter-kubelka-frame-by-frame-antiphon-adebar-arnulf-rainer/ |magazine=[[Film Comment]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |page=74 |access-date=8 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2013/04/04/monument-film-interview-with-peter-kubelka/ |title=Monument Film: Interview with Peter Kubelka |last= Jahn |first=Pamela |date=4 April 2013 |website=Electric Sheep Magazine |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film found success on the European film festival circuit. After several years, Schwechater Bier requested another print of it.&lt;ref name="bodien-film-quarterly"/&gt; ''Schwechater'' is now part of [[Anthology Film Archives]]' Essential Cinema Repertory collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/about/essential-cinema |title=Essential Cinema |publisher=[[Anthology Film Archives]] |access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5768">[[File:Abraham Teniers - Kaartspelende apen.jpg|thumb|270px|''Card playing monkeys'', [[Abraham Teniers]], mid-17th century]]
'''''Singerie''''' is the name given to a visual arts [[genre]] depicting [[monkeys]] imitating human behavior, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild [[satire]].  The term is derived from the [[French language|French]] word for "Monkey Trick".

==History==
The practise can be traced as far back as Ancient Egypt; [[Cyril Aldred]] detected a love of ''singerie'' that he found characteristic of the late [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]];&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Alfred, 1955. ''New Kingdom Art in Ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the medieval period in Europe, monkeys were seen "as a symbol of downgraded humanity",&lt;ref name="Duffy2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean H. Duffy|title=Signs and Designs: Art and Architecture in the Work of Michel Butor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1CgfS5boKoC&amp;pg=PA267|year=2003|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-788-4|pages=267–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were used to mimic man and his foibles, often appearing in the margins of illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Garnier-PelleForray-Carlier2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicole Garnier-Pelle|author2=Anne Forray-Carlier|author3=Marie-Christine Anselm|title=The Monkeys of Christophe Huet: Singeries in French Decorative Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxxvkgAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=978-1-60606-065-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1807"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Taylor|title=The Literary Panorama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A94RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT427|year=1807|pages=427|quote=The prayer book written for Charles V. of Austria by his mistress, had, on every page, monkeys mimicking religious ceremonies, in the most incongruous manner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment originated as a pictorial genre in [[Flemish painting]] in the 16th century and were further developed in the 17th century. The Flemish engraver [[Pieter van der Borcht the Elder|Pieter van der Borcht]] introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]].  These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists, in particular by those in Antwerp such as [[Frans Francken the Younger]], [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Younger|the Younger]], [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]] and [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]]. [[David Teniers the Younger]] became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother [[Abraham Teniers]].  The two brothers were able to cater to the prevailing taste in the art market and were thus instrumental in spreading the genre outside Flanders.  Later in the 17th century artists like [[Nicolaes van Verendael]], principally known as a painter of flower [[still life]]s started to paint ‘monkey scenes’ as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bert Schepers, ''Monkey Madness in Seventeenth-Century Antwerp'', in: The Rubenianum Quarterly, 2012 2, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antoine Watteau 032.jpg|thumb|left|A copy of ''The Monkey Sculptor'', originally painted c. 1710 by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau]]]] 
''Singeries'' became popular among French artists in the early 18th century. French decorator and designer [[Jean Berain the Elder]] included dressed figures of monkeys in many wall decorations, the great royal ''[[ébéniste]]'' [[André Charles Boulle]] used them in his work&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Randall Jr, "Templates for Boulle Singerie" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''111''' No. 798 (September 1969), pp. 549-553.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] painted ''The Monkey Sculptor'', a critique of art and artists' habit of "aping" nature.&lt;ref name="Impelluso2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucia Impelluso|title=Nature and Its Symbols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LtPeLH3iHYC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2004|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-772-6|pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete monkey orchestra was produced in [[Meissen porcelain]]. In France the most famous such rococo decor are [[Christophe Huet]]'s ''Grande Singerie'' and ''Petite Singerie'' decors at the [[Château de Chantilly]]; in England the French painter [[Andieu de Clermont]] is also known for his ''singeries'': the most famous decorates the ceiling of the Monkey Room at Monkey Island Hotel, located on [[Monkey Island, Bray|Monkey Island]] in [[Bray-on-Thames]], [[England]]. The Grade I listed buildings, which have housed guests since 1840 were built in the 1740s by [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough]].

Singeries regained popularity in the 19th century and artists then successful in this genre included [[Zacharie Noterman]], [[Emmanuel Noterman]], Sir Edwin [[Henry Landseer]], [[Edmund Bristow]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], Charles Monginot and [[Paul Friedrich Meyerheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/noterman_zacharias_the_litigants.htm Zacharias Noterman, ''Les Plaideurs ('The Litigants')] at Art of the Print&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''talent manager''' (also known as an '''artist manager''', '''band manager''' or '''music manager''') is an individual or company who guides the professional career of [[entertainer|artists]] in the [[entertainment industry]]. The responsibility of the talent manager is to oversee the day-to-day [[business]] affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career.&lt;ref name="casestudy"&gt;[http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm MusicBizAdvice Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115173626/http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm |date=2009-01-15 }} January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   

The roles and responsibilities of a talent manager vary slightly from industry to industry, as do the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to which the manager is entitled. For example, a music manager's duties differ from those managers who advise [[actor]]s, [[writer]]s, or [[film director|director]]s. A manager can also help artists find an agent, or help them decide when to leave their current agent and identify who to select as a new agent.&lt;ref name="breakingintrodummies"&gt;Garrison, Larry. ''Breaking Into Acting for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing Inc., 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talent agent]]s have the authority to make deals for their clients while managers usually can only informally establish connections with producers and studios but do not have the ability to negotiate contracts.

==History==
{{See also|Category:Talent agents}}
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
Modern talents managers are associated with all artistic fields, sports, as well as various fields in business.{{cn|date=February 2015}} Talent agents have at times been covered in the music or art press almost as intently as artists themselves, for example the various talent agents who spearheaded the British Invasion of [[The Beatles]] and [[Herman's Hermits]] in the 1960s such as [[Brian Epstein]], [[Allan Williams]], [[Harvey Lisberg]]. Infamous examples in the music press include [[Allen Klein]], manager of both The Beatles and [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/allen-klein-notorious-business-manager-for-the-beatles-and-the-rolling-stones-1732780.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=July 6, 2009 | title=Allen Klein: Notorious business manager for the Beatles and the Rolling Stones}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of talent agents deemed notable by [[wp:GNG|Wikipedia's general notability guidelines]], see [[:Category:Talent agents]]. For notable agencies and businesses, see [[:Category:Talent agencies]].

The industry of talent management has been unionized or organized in several forms throughout history. In the United States, a notable early example was the [[Association of Talent Agents]], which was formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1937. The ATA comes out of the [[Wagner Act]] upheld by the Supreme Court which established many of the unions and guilds that regulate people who work in the entertainment industry such as the [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Directors Guild of America]], and [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentassociation.com/ Association of Talent Agents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music managers==&lt;!--Linked to from "Music management"--&gt;
A music manager (or band manager) may handle career areas for [[Musical ensemble|bands]], [[singers]], and [[DJ]]s. A music manager may be hired by a musician or band, or the manager  may discover the band, and the relationship is usually contractually bound with mutual assurances, warranties, performances guarantees, and so forth.  The manager's main job is to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotion, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers can be extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, [[business manager]] (who are usually [[certified public accountants]]), [[Tour promoter|tour managers]], and sometimes even a [[personal assistant]].  

Manager's contracts, however, cannot license those responsibilities unto the manager in the same way a state license would empower the agent to do so.  Therefore, conflicting areas of interest may arise unless those are clarified in the contract.  That said, a manager should be able to read and understand and explain a [[contract]] and study up on the long-term implications of contractual agreements that they, the bands, and the people they do business with, enter into. Before the manager enters into an agreement with the band, their relationship may be regarded as competing for interest; after a good contract is signed, their interests, obligations and incentives are aligned, and the interest in success is shared.  

Responsibilities of a music manager are often divided among many who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers may assume multiple roles: graphic designer, [[publicist]], promoter, and handling money and finances. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities may grow, and because of their percentage agreement with the band, the manager's income may grow as well. 

A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, [[songwriter]]s, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding [[Record producer|music producers]], and developing relationships with [[Record company|record companies]], publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. They should carefully consider when certain contributions have been made which would also entitle them to cowriting credits, Executive Producer credit, or Producer credit should they become involved in songwriting, financing works, or actually producing demos and recordings, and should carefully know these jobs and these fees should be considered either as separate from the contract, in addition to the contract, or as free to the musician as clarified in emails and the contract.  

The duties of an active music manager may include supporting the band's development of a reputation for the musician(s) and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, creating social network identities for bands, and booking shows. A music manager may be present during recording sessions and should support the artist during the creative process while not interfering between the artist and the producer, but musicians may also find valuable feedback in the extra pair of ears and this should be carefully considered as well. The manager may gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.

Among all the business and professional responsibilities that music managers assume; they also become a pseudo parent for the group and help with personal matters usually. This is both for the psyche of the group and to ensure that things are running smoothly.  

Early on in an artist's career, the different facets of management and [[marketing]] fall upon either the band itself or, if they have one, their manager. Because the band or artist is relatively unknown initially, promotion, booking, and touring are minimal. A new music manager begins by establishing a clear understanding of what the artist(s) want. This can be accomplished through either a written or verbal [[contract]]. A music manager's first task is to solidify all artist development aspects and then concentrate on product development.

==Management strategies==
Despite the dominant presence of digital media in the music industry, there are many typical strategies that even the most modernized managers must adhere to in order to reach the managerial goals effectively. Most of these trick-of-the-trade strategies are employed to establish and maintain connections with booking agents, promote the activities of the artist, and manage finances in order to optimize the artist's ability to book gigs, establish a fan base, and ultimately bring in revenue from their work, respectively.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Booking gigs===
Among the more traditional responsibilities of music managers are booking and promoting gigs for their artist(s). Managers often become known for establishing ongoing relationships with specific venues, booking one artist at the venue regularly, or several artists on their roster.&lt;ref&gt;Farrish, Bryan. Gig Booking 101 – Venue Relationships. Bryan Farrish Radio Promotion: Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of 'how-to' books have been published on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, June 11, 2010, A Booking Strategy that Works! The DIY Musician (2010): Accessed March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet strategies===
As technology has advanced, the music industry has consequently undergone a drastic change in the way it operates. The internet has made it both easier and harder to attract the attention of fans and the press, as both outreach increase but industry saturation increases.{{cn|date=February 2015}} “The sale of pre-recorded music has diminished, but there’s so much more that’s going on. You can’t focus on what’s not working when there are so many other opportunities.”.&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, Don and Dan Kimpel. “Chapter 6: The Manager.” In It All Begins With The Music. Boston: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media is a common form of online networking for managers, and platforms such as [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], [[Beatport]], [[Bandcamp]], [[SoundCloud]], and [[YouTube]] have been noted in the press for their use in networking in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Bryan. Music Marketing with Social Media in Only 30 Minutes a Day. The DIY Musician (2012): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fields such as business may use more common websites such as [[LinkedIn]] or [[Google+]], while networking on behalf of a client.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Not everyone is so optimistic about the role of social media in the music industry. In his article, “Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media”, Wes Davenport suggests that the role of social media in the industry “has been grossly inflated”. In the article, Davenport quotes Jon Ostrow saying, “Social media is a conversation tool – that’s it”, acknowledging that there is potential for sparking conversation and building a fan base, but suggesting that social media does not necessarily live up to the potential for success that people in our modern culture seem to give credit.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Wes. Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media. Hypebot.com (2013): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital case Study: Lady Gaga===
In an article titled, “Case study: Making money from music” by Martin Kupp, [[Jamie Anderson (scientist)|Jamie Anderson]] and Joerg Reckhenrich, the effects of technological advances on the music industry are recognized, analyzed, and utilized through an online marketing strategy that led to the incredible success of [[Lady Gaga]]. [[Troy Carter (music industry)|Troy Carter]] of Coalition Media signed Gaga with the intention of making her into a star with the help of some clever marketing. Recognizing that digitalization was the cause of the almost 33% decrease in the music industry’s total revenue between the years 2000 and 2007, Carter decided to find a way to use digitalization to his advantage with his newly signed artist. Coalition Media, with the help of marketing company ThinkTank Digital, invested large amounts of time and money into developing Lady Gaga’s global presence through social media. 

They set up many interviews with [[Bloggers|online bloggers]], established a large following on Myspace through “constant news updates, as well as [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusives]], [[interviews]] and special features” and Gaga personally handled her Twitter account, building a very personal connection with many of her fans. This strategy demonstrates the massive success that skillful online marketing can produce. The article focuses on Coalition Media and [[Lady Gaga]]’s utilization of the “Four E’s”: [[Emotions]], [[Experiences]], [[:wikt:engage|Engaging]], and [[:wikt:exclusive|Exclusive]]. By personalizing her online activity, creating an experience, engaging, and providing exclusivity to her fans through social media marketing, [[Lady Gaga]] was able to achieve incredible levels of success with her music career.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kupp, Jamie Anderson and Joerg Reckhenrich. Case Study: Making Money From Music. The Financial Times LTD (2011): Accessed March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
Striking a tentative compensation agreement that can be renegotiated after three or four months is recommended, and the rate of pay is generally based on [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s of 20-80 percent, or more, of performance and commercial incomes.{{cn|date=February 2015}}  This amount depends on the level of development the band or artist is at and the experience, networks and resources of the manager. (The less developed the artist and more experienced the manager, the higher the commission.) The artist or band should never agree to circumstances that cannot be terminated or negotiated within a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapositiveradio.com/general/dir/band_manager Band Manager Info at Media Positive Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Managers usually secure the services of a professional [[photographer]] while the artist is recording. Different 8x10 pictures of the artist can be used for websites, [[compact disc|CD]] labels/jackets, posters, and the [[press kit]]. Cost for high quality shoots vary from $500 for a basic shoot to thousands for several looks. Photographers are not expected to cover material cost. It is important that the manager obtains an agreement upfront confirming license to use the images which will cover the uses necessary, in addition to high resolution digital images on CD.  Managers are also advised to have photographs taken before CD designs or artwork goes into production.  Managers are also responsible for hiring additional staff when necessary.

'''''The Census at Bethlehem''''' (also known as '''''The Numbering at Bethlehem''''') is an oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Flemish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in 1566.  It is signed and measures about 115,5 cm × 164,5 cm.  It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]], which acquired it in 1902.  It is one of the first paintings in western art to feature a significant snow landscape and was painted in the aftermath of the winter of 1565, which was one of the harshest winters on record.

==Description==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Census at Bethlehem (detail) - WGA03381.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of Mary and Joseph]]
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Census at Bethlehem (detail) - WGA03385.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of ruined castle]]

The painting shows a Flemish village in winter at sundown.  A group of people is gathered at a building on the left. A sign bearing the Habsburg double-headed eagle is visible on the building.  Other people are making their way to the same building, including the figures of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and the pregnant [[Virgin Mary]] on a donkey. A pig is being slaughtered. People are going about their daily business in the cold, children are shown playing with toys on the ice and having snowball fights.  At the very centre of the painting is a spoked wheel, sometimes interpreted as being a reference to the [[Rota Fortunae|wheel of fortune]].  To the right, a man in a small hut is shown holding a [[Clapper (musical instrument)|clapper]], a warning to keep away from leprosy. Leprosy was endemic in that part of Europe when the painting was created. There is a begging bowl in front of the hut.   As he often did, Bruegel treats a biblical story as a contemporary event. And once again, reference to particular political events has been adduced - in this case, the severity of the [[Netherlands#Habsburg Netherlands 1519.E2.80.931581|Spanish administration]] in the southern [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the Netherlands region was part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and some land in [[France]] and [[Germany]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bruegel may well be making a more general criticism of bureaucratic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti. ''Brueghel''. Milan:Skira, 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events depicted are described in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2, 1-5: {{quotation|And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered... So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.|Luke 2:1-5, [[NKJV]]&lt;ref&gt;From online [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202&amp;version=NKJV ''Luke'' 2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This is a rare subject in previous [[Netherlandish art]]. The ruined castle in the background&lt;sup&gt;see 2nd detail&lt;/sup&gt; is based on the towers and gates of [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Max Seidel, Roger H. Marijnissen. ''Bruegel''. Pt.2, Random House, 1985. {{ISBN|0-517-44772-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies==
[[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] and his studio made dozens of copies of the painting after his father's death, one of which was sold at auction for $10 million in 2013. Another copy, dated from 1610, is also at  Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels.

[[File:The Last Harvest - Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore.jpg|thumb|''The Last Harvest - Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore'']]
'''''The Last Harvest''''' was an exhibition of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s paintings to mark the 150th anniversary of Tagore's birth. It was commissioned by the [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]], [[India]] and organised with the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] (NGMA). It consisted of 208 paintings drawn from the collections of [[Visva Bharati]] and the NGMA. The exhibition was curated by art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]. [[Asia Art Archive]] later classified the exhibition as a "world event".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/WorldEvents/Details/20913|title=The Last Harvest  - Asia Art Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within the 150th birth anniversary year it was conceived as three separate but similar exhibitions, and travelled simultaneously in three circuits. The first selection was shown at [[Museum of Asian Art]], Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smb.museum/smb/kalender/details.php?objID=31839&amp;n=0&amp;datum=02.09.2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216001957/http://www.smb.museum/smb/kalender/details.php?objID=31839&amp;n=0&amp;datum=02.09.2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-16 |title=Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Kalender |publisher=Smb.museum |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asia Society]], New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Current Exhibitions Upcoming Exhibitions Past Exhibitions |url=http://asiasociety.org/new-york/exhibitions/rabindranath-tagore-last-harvest |title=Rabindranath Tagore: The Last Harvest &amp;#124; New York |publisher=Asia Society |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Museum of Korea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.go.kr/program/show/showDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002002002&amp;searchSelect=A.SHOWKOR&amp;showCategory1Con=SC1&amp;showCategory2Con=SC1_1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;langCodeCon=LC2&amp;showID=5371 |title=Exhibitions &amp;#124; Special Exhibitions |publisher=Museum.go.kr |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seoul, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/rabindranath-tagore-poet-and-painter/ |title=Rabindranath Tagore: Poet and Painter - Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; London, [[The Art Institute of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/press_pdf/Tagore.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, [[Petit Palais]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petitpalais.paris.fr/en/expositions/rabindranath-tagore-1861-1941 |title=Le Petit Palais - Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) - Paris.fr |publisher=Petitpalais.paris.fr |date=2012-03-11 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paris, [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]], Rome, [[National Visual Arts Gallery (Malaysia)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianhighcommission.com.my/tagore.php |title=Welcome to High Commission of India, Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) |publisher=Indianhighcommission.com.my |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuala Lumpur, [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcmichael.com/exhibitions/tagore/info.cfm |title=McMichael Canadian Art Collection - The Last Harvest: Paintings by Rabindranath Tagore |publisher=Mcmichael.com |date=2012-07-15 |accessdate=2012-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213163139/http://mcmichael.com/exhibitions/tagore/info.cfm |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario, [[National Gallery of Modern Art]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngmaindia.gov.in/pdf/The-Last-Harvest-e-INVITE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New Delhi, [[National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-18/people/38646057_1_rabindranath-tagore-paintings-exhibition&lt;/ref&gt;

An illustrated catalogue, titled ''[[The Last Harvest: Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore (book)|The Last Harvest: Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore]]'', with essays by international Tagore experts was published to accompany the exhibition. The book covered Tagore's art and other aspects of his work and life.

{{Quote box|quote=The inclination to know and understand other cultures was innate to his personality, and contributed to his emergence as an artist. A world traveler and a creative artist with interest in cross-cultural contacts, he looked at the art of the countries he travelled to. Sometimes he did this with greater purposefulness and self-awareness, as he did during his 1916 visit to Japan. But often he merely absorbed them, and without discussion or record allowed them to sink to the bottom of his awareness, from where they subliminally guided his thoughts and rose to the surface when required. Primitive and modern art that he saw during his many travels abroad played such a role in his emergence as an artist.|source= —[[R.

==''The Last Harvest''==

[[File:Art historian R. Siva Kumar accompanies the Culture Minister of India.jpg|thumb|Art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]] accompanies the Culture Minister of India]]
Surrounded by several painters Rabindranath had always wanted to paint. Writing and music, playwriting and acting came to him naturally and almost without training, as it did to several others in his family, and in even greater measure. But painting eluded him. Yet he tried repeatedly to master the art and there are several references to this in his early letters and reminiscence. In 1900 for instance, when he was nearing forty and already a celebrated writer, he wrote to Jagadishchandra Bose, "You will be surprised to hear that I am sitting with a sketchbook drawing. Needless to say, the pictures are not intended for any salon in Paris, they cause me not the least suspicion that the national gallery of any country will suddenly decide to raise taxes to acquire them. But, just as a mother lavishes most affection on her ugliest son, so I feel secretly drawn to the very skill that comes to me least easily." He also realized that he was using the eraser more than the pencil, and dissatisfied with the results he finally withdrew, deciding it was not for him to become a painter.

Although he gave up the hope of becoming an artist around 1900, Rabindranath continued to doodle in his manuscripts. He turned struck-out words into ornamental motifs and sometimes linked the scratched out words on the pages of his manuscripts into an art-nouveau-like arabesque. This continued without much change until the end of 1923. Then almost all of a sudden on the pages of the notebook he used during his tour of 1924 his doodles proliferated and assumed more representational and expressive intent. Victoria Ocampo who spotted these during his stay in Argentina as her guest was impressed and found artistic merit in them. "He played with erasures," she wrote, "following them from verse to verse with his pen, making lines that suddenly jumped into life out of this play: prehistoric monsters, birds, faces appeared."

[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar Explains Tagore's Painting.jpg|thumb|Art Historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], the curator of the show explains [[Tagore]]'s Painting]]
These doodles in the Purabi manuscript that excited Ocampo in 1924 mark the beginnings of Rabindranath"s artistic career. Rabindrnath himself recognised such doodles as the beginnings of his art and wrote: "The only training I had from my young days was the training in rhythm in thought, the rhythm in sound. I had come to know that rhythm gives reality to that which is desultory, which is insignificant in itself. And therefore, when the scratches in my manuscript cried, like sinners, for salvation, and assailed my eyes with the ugliness of their irrelevance, I often took more time in rescuing them into a merciful finality of rhythm than in carrying on what was my obvious task." He also called this his "unconscious training in drawing." And described the imagery that emerged as follows: "... when the vagaries of the ostracized mistakes had their conversion into rhythmic inter-relationship, giving birth to unique forms and characters. Some assumed the temperate exaggeration of a probable animal that had unaccountably missed its chance of existence… Some lines showed anger, some placid benevolence, through some lines ran an essential laughter. ... These lines often expressed passions that were abstract, evolved characters that hung upon subtle suggestions."

After four years of involved doodling, Rabindranath began to do independent paintings in 1928. And six years after she first noticed the expressive strength of his doodles in 1930 Ocampo helped him organize the first exhibition of his paintings in Paris. This was followed by a string of exhibitions across Europe, in Russia, England and America. He was the first Indian artist to be exhibited widely in the West. He felt that different as his works were from the art of his Indian contemporaries they stood a better chance to be appreciated in the West. And many of his first viewers in the West, and these included seasoned artists and connoisseurs, were appreciative. However, they were fleeting encounters and they saw his work as an extension of Western art and not in relation to the totality of his oeuvre or in relation to India. His familiarity with the "primitive" and modern traditions of art played a role in his emergence as a painter. But it is only in the context of post-forties Indian art that Rabindranath's paintings find their true place in the history of modernism and it is in this context they need to be looked at.

Though Rabindranath began to paint only in 1928 when he was sixty-seven he painted well over two thousand paintings. It was as Abanindranath Tagore said a "volcanic eruption" that continued unabated for the last thirteen years of his life. Coming at the end of a hugely creative life spreading across six decades and involving work in several mediums and genres the question of how his paintings relate to the rest of his oeuvre rises. Is there a unifying theme or universal "truth" running through all his creations? It would be difficult to give a categorical and simple answer but the following words of Rabindranath from My Pictures, a statement he made in 1930 in connection with his paintings might contain a lead.

"But one thing which is common to all arts is the principle of rhythm which transforms inert materials into living creations. My instinct for it and my training in its use led me to know that lines and colours in art are no carriers of information; they seek their rhythmic incarnation in pictures. Their ultimate purpose is not to illustrate or to copy some outer fact or inner vision, but to evolve a harmonious wholeness which finds its passage through our eyesight into imagination. It neither questions our mind for meaning nor burdens it with unmeaningness, for it is, above all, meaning."

==Organizational theme of the exhibition==

[[File:Installation team at V&amp;A.JPG|thumb|Installation team at V&amp;A]]
''The Last Harvest'' is an international exhibition commissioned and fully supported by the Government of India as part of Rabindranath's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It brings together a representative selection of his works culled from the collections of Rabindra Bhavana and [[Kala Bhavana]] at Santiniketan, and the National Gallery of Modern Art.

Rabindranath's life, his works and the history of his institutions mark a progress from nationalism to universal humanism. His paintings belong to the period of universal humanism and linked as they may be to personal experiences they have a universal appeal. In consonance with it Rabindranath did not title his drawings and paintings. He also did not date most of them. Thus they come to us as an open-ended oeuvre, encouraging us to respond to them with our sensibilities and find linkages between them. In other words, he encourages the viewers to embark on a curatorial process. This exhibition is one such effort.

In this exhibition the works are grouped into what may be considered four important facets of his oeuvre. His earliest paintings grew out of the doodles he did in his manuscripts while attempting to turn crossed out words and discarded lines into visually exciting motifs. These have an element of playful inventiveness and involve morphological cross-projections that defy perceptual experience. If the subliminal played an important part in his first paintings, painting itself led him to pay attention to the pageant of forms in nature. The landscapes included in these selections are a token of this shift. As he progressed he also began to see the human body not merely as form but as gestures carrying within them the seeds of visual narration and theatre – ambivalent as they may remain without the benefit of names. A third group of paintings bring this into focus. And finally there are his representations of the human face; hovering between hieratic masks and individualised portraits, they turn countenance into characters.

The four groups may be highlighted thus:

Group 1 This group contains some of his earliest paintings, they are either geometrical or arabesque and have an element of playful inventiveness involving morphological cross-projections that defy reality.

Group 2 Nature was an enduring theme in Rabindranath's writings and songs, he felt a deep companionship with nature since his childhood. A more meditative and observant come through in his landscapes and flower pieces.

Group 3 As a playwright and actor Rabindranath was sensitive to gesture and its dramatic and narrative potential; the paintings in this group bring this into focus.

Group 4 This group consists of his representations of the human face into which he reads traces of social and personal life. They are products of observation and psychological probing.

Finally a word about the title. For Rabindranath who welcomed contact with other cultures to foster creativity, and for whom the touchstone of authenticity was not the lineage of one"s language but one"s ability to make it one"s own, the value of art lay not in its source or style but in being an imperative of life.

And painting was the last enchantment of his life, his last personal imperative. "I am hopelessly entangled in the spell that the lines have cast all around me…. If I were a free agent ... unburdened by any care," he wrote to close friend in 1928 just when he was embarking on his career as a painter, "I would live by the Padma and gather a harvest of pictures and nothing but pictures to load the Golden Boat of Time with." He was burdened with too many commitments to allow himself that privilege but the harvest has been good (well over two thousand paintings in thirteen years) and this exhibition carries a small part of it eighty years after he himself had ferried it across the world for the first time.

==Reception==
''The Last Harvest'' received highly appreciable reviews across the globe. The British newspaper ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported,"Tagore is such a fascinating figure that for the fans of his work the art will illuminate his poems and fictions; and for those coming cold, this (''The Last Harvest'') serves as a delightful introduction." ''[[The Independent]]'' rated the exhibition as one of the five best shows 
to have opened in London in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngmaindia.gov.in/pdf/NGMA-E-newsletter-option17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Mumbai Boss declared it the best museum exhibition saying, "At this gathering of about 100 works, one of the largest since his death, fluidly curated by historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], the viewer was given a peek into a less assured Tagore, as a 60-something artist, who used his innate sense of linguistic artistry to permeate his at-times fantastical works. There were animals invented, idyllic landscapes, portraits and drawings that showed him to have an astonishing grasp of what it meant to endow a visual expression with the same raw beauty as its written equivalent."&lt;ref&gt;http://mumbaiboss.com/2013/12/23/best-of-mumbai-2013-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daily News and Analysis]] reported, "Tagore's imagination created paintings that underline his sheer genius. Yet, they were untitled, left to viewers to interpret." According to ''[[The Times of India]]'',  ''The Last Harvest'' was "A rare display of artworks by Tagore". "Like a skipping stone, Tagore’s style glanced off a variety of inspirations – wood-cuts, surrealist imagery, North American folk art – and yet was sharply distinctive. ''The Last Harvest'', curated by Professor [[Raman Siva Kumar]] of Visva-Bharati University, presents one of the most elaborate exhibitions of Tagore’s paintings that we’ve seen." reported [[Firstpost]].

'''''Women Speak''''' is a 1988 Chinese article written by [[Beijing]]-based Xiang Ya (向娅) about [[sexual revolution]] in the country as it "[[Chinese economic reform|opened up]]". The piece includes supposedly "tape-recorded" interviews of 10 anonymous urban women in their 30s and 40s, who discussed their highly private love/sex lives and thoughts. It was translated to English by Diana B. Kingsbury in her 1994 translated anthology ''I Wish I Were a Wolf''.

''Women Speak'' was adapted into a 1989 film ''[[Golden Fingernails]]'' directed by Bao Zhifang.

==Author==
Zhao Shaoling (赵绍玲), who used the [[pen name]] Xiang Ya, was born in 1951 in [[Lingshou County]], [[Hebei]]. In 1969, as part of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]] she was "[[sent-down youth|sent-down]]" to [[Inner Mongolia]] where she worked for 3 years in a rural army unit. In 1974, she was transferred to an electrical equipment plant in [[Beijing]], after which she found employment with the [[National Library of China]]. She attended night school and graduated with a degree in Chinese literature in 1985. She published her first article in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Wish I Were a Wolf: The New Voice in Chinese Women's Literature|last=Kingsbury|first=Diana B.|publisher=[[New World Press]]|year=1994|isbn=7-80005-124-2|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The interviews==
Each interview reads like a long monologue, with the interviewer barely present. No names are mentioned. Like the author, all interviewees in the 30s were "sent-down" to work in the countryside during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

*Woman '''A''' ("'''Her husband had a lover, but it worked out in the end'''"), a 36-year-old physician who graduated from medical school in 1983 along with her husband, with whom she has a loving relationship and great sex life. When she discovered her husband's affair 8 years into the marriage, she was not hurt, instead she felt calm and confident. She gently talked to him, said she understood and asked for only honesty. Her magnanimity greatly relieved him, who gratefully returned her trust. She also talked to and comforted his lover. Three years later the younger woman married well, and she is very happy for both marriages.
*Woman '''B''' ("'''Her husband's rising fame fed her fear'''"), a 35-year-old factory worker from a peasant background. Before their marriage, she persistently and unabashedly courted his love. The years right after the wedding were blissful, but recently she has become paranoid about his possible infidelity. Afraid of the attention he gets, she doesn't want him to write or dress up. She stalks him, opens his mail, confronts women around him, and visits his boss, but still feels anxious. He no longer makes love to her, but she'd rather have that than discover his affair. She has access to poison and is ready to kill him if he cheats. 
*Woman '''C''' ("'''She said, 'We are two independent planets, both free to come and go''''"), a 39-year-old company assistant manager. Her first marriage fell apart quickly. Her husband cheated on her, so she did the same to him. Two years later she fell in love with someone and filed for divorce. Her husband refused. Crying and begging, he even surprised her and her lover at night, but she protected her lover from his beating. On the wedding of her second marriage, she pronounced that if one "wants a divorce, the other must not refuse". She believes this made her new hubby value their relationship. They are very happy.
*Woman '''D''' ("'''Conventional love for her is not enough'''"), a 46-year-old department vice-director in a publishing house. She has no problems with her husband—except for sex. As he isn't able to satisfy her, she starts a clandestine affair with a married man who is good in bed. She also has no desire to divorce her husband, a point she made very clear to her lover. Actually, she believes the affair helps her marriage, as she can now vent her sexual frustration periodically without getting angry at her husband. She also believes adulterous lovemaking more exciting and satisfying, another reason she's maintaining the status quo.
*Woman '''E''' ("'''She fell in love with a married man'''"), a 38-year-old middle-school teacher. Her sex life during marriage was terrible, but she took a long time to leave him. After the divorce, she fell in love with a man already separated from his wife for 3 years. Still, she was called a homewrecker and received a disciplinary warning from her job. Without a marriage license, they are also turned away by most hotels. But she believes she did nothing wrong and continues to love him. When he was falsely diagnosed with cancer, she stayed in the hospital with him for 21 days. Eventually people around her became more understanding.
*Woman '''F''' ("'''A woman set on conquering men'''"), a 34-year-old charity organizer. Extremely ugly, she was abused by her parents and brother growing up. She craves for love, but no man paid her attention. Finally she swore vengeance. In 1981, she began the first non-governmental charity organization, and quickly achieved fame and success. During a TV interview, she was overcome with emotions and fainted. She began to have handsome suitors, but her "desire for revenge subsumed any sexual feeling". She repeated rejected two charming men. Now she has a stable plain-looking male partner, but doesn't want to marry.
*Woman '''G''' ("'''Love and sex are two different things'''"), a 38-year-old actress-turned-film director. Because she lost her virginity before marriage, her ex-husband treated her poorly, often beating her up during sex. Initially submissive, she became more confident and developed feminist ideas after working as an actress. After the divorce her career took off, and she started dating again with the intention of remarrying, but only met frivolous men. Disgusted, she has decided that she will never remarry, but she will not give up sex. She despises men, but still leads an active sex life without any commitment.
*Woman '''H''' ("'''Without love, she had to turn him down'''"), a 43-year-old teacher who lost her husband in a terrible accident 5 years ago. Though she has missed him, she is ready to remarry. Two years ago, a good male friend made advances towards her in his apartment, but she rejected him. Although he was still married, he had been separated for years from his wife who had gone abroad. So they were both independent, sexually experienced and very lonely, but it still didn't "feel right", as if something was missing. She has come to realize how important love is to her, and she "can't have sex without love".
*Woman '''I''' ("'''She wants a child but doesn't want to get married'''"), a 34-year-old lower-level cadre in an office. She is not interested in men and has no desire to marry, but wants to have a child. The family planning official finds her unbelievable, but she cites the marriage law as granting equal civil rights for children out of wedlock. She is also frustrated that the government has not allocated a large apartment for her only because she is single. "Why not judge us based on what we've done for society rather than on our marital status?... Why can't I be accorded my proper rights?" She asks angrily.
*Woman '''J''' ("'''A woman preoccupied with proving her virginity'''"), a 37-year-old company section chief. During middle school she accidentally broke her hymen riding a bike. At age 17, she was "sent-down" to rural [[Shaanxi]], where she witnessed the tradition of new brides holding high blood-stained cloth the morning after their weddings to prove that they had been virgins. Since then, she has been terrified she won't bleed if she has sex, and this anxiety effectively keeps her a virgin. Gradually all men lose interest in her, and she has stubbornly vowed to remain a virgin for the rest of her life, having learned to masturbate.

==Reception==
Li Xiaojiang wrote that ''Women Speak'' "did not incite a whirlwind when it appeared in 1988 because, for most intellectual and career women, a base of social equality and group consciousness had already been laid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li Xiaojiang|chapter=Resisting While Holding the Tradition—Claims for Right Raised in Literature by Chinese Women Writers in the New Period|pages=109–16|editor-last=Chen|editor-first=Peng-hsiang|editor2-last=Crothers Dilley|editor2-first=Whitney|title=Feminism/Femininity in Chinese Literature|publisher=[[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]]|isbn=90-420-0727-3|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
